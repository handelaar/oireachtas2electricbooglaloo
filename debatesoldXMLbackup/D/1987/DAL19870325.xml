    <Title>Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill, 1986: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role and functions of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta (ACOT) are set out in the provisions of existing legislation. Under section 15 of the National Agricultural, Advisory, Education and <Col N="357" /> Research Authority Act, 1977, the authority may.</P>
    <P>(a)  provide advisory services designed to assist farm families and others engaged in agriculture to make the best use of their resources and to encourage, through better practices and management, increased output and income and higher standards of living generally;</P>
    <P>(b)  take steps to encourage, through co-operative effort, improvement in the economic and social conditions of those engaged in agriculture;</P>
    <P>(c)  take steps to ensure that the results of agricultural research are made known as speedily and widely as possible;</P>
    <P>(d)  adopt measures to ensure that those engaged in agriculture are informed of schemes and facilities for the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In addition ACOT provide for the agricultural education and training programmes for new entrants to agriculture as well as the adult population already engaged in farming.  The Certificate of Farming is the most important course in the educational programme but it is supplemented by other appropriate courses.  Also in those farms where socioeconomic factors like age or family circumstances are major obstacles to development ACOT now provide a socio-economic advisory service.</P>
    <P>The role of ACOT is to provide programmes aimed at helping the farming community to utilise all their resources as efficiently as possible.  The whole question of resource development &mdash; human and physical &mdash; is of course central to the Government's broad policy and strategy for national economic recovery.  ACOT are seen, therefore, as an important agency in developing and utilising our agricultural resources.  Despite current budgetary difficulties and EC surpluses in some of our main commodities, there is considerable scope for greater efficiency in the production of existing output and for the encouragement of <Col N="358" /> alternative farm enterprises in areas where further expansion is not possible.</P>
    <P>It is against this background and in the context of the need to develop and utilise our existing resources and strength to the maximum that the proposal for the introduction of some charges for advisory services must be viewed.  The broad aim of the Government is to ensure that as far as possible cost-effective advisory and educational resources will be maintained.</P>
    <P>In turning now to the Bill before the House, may I preface my remarks by reminding Deputies that the measure is precisely the same as that introduced by the previous Government and has been at Second Stage at the dissolution of the Dáil.  I would like to acknowledge the role played particularly by the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, who is at present in the House, who had brought the Bill through the Dáil on Second Stage before the Dáil terminated.  What I am doing now is effectively reintroducing the same legislation in a way in line with what Deputy Quinn suggested just now.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable ACOT to charge for agricultural advisory services provided by them subject to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture. I do not think there is any necessity for me, in the present circumstances of extreme pressure on Exchequer resources, to go into a lengthy justification for allowing ACOT to make such charges.  The provision and maintenance of a nationwide on-farm service, staffed by highly trained professionals, are necessarily expensive.  This year ACOT will require public funding amounting to almost £23 million from Exchequer and local authority contributions. This represents almost 80 per cent of their budget.  While ACOT have in recent years pruned a number of their services of lower priority and have decreased staff numbers correspondingly, the fact remains that the operating costs of their farm advisory services are substantial and likely to remain so.  The Government regard it as imperative, in present circumstances of the public finances, that ACOT should <Col N="359" /> be enabled to secure a reasonable contribution towards their costs from those who benefit directly from their advisory services.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation does not empower ACOT to charge fees for advisory services and, consequently, I am introducing the present Bill to make appropriate amendments in the relevant Acts.  The intention in the Bill is to enable ACOT to require suitable and reasonable contributions for these services.</P>
    <P>While this legislation may enable ACOT to charge for advisory services, it also provides that any such charges and the criteria on which they are based will be subject to prior approval of the Minister for Agriculture.  Furthermore, should the Minister consider, in the light of changing circumstances, that any fees or charges should be varied, or indeed terminated, the legislation will enable him to direct ACOT to vary or terminate them.</P>
    <P>Some may think that the introduction of charges will be a disincentive to some farmers to seek advice from ACOT.  I believe there is now a much greater awareness in the farming community of the need and value of appropriate technical and management advice.  In the planning and development of well-run and efficient farms the right professional advice can be invaluable in securing the desired results.  Accordingly, advice should be viewed as an important farm input.  All inputs should, of course, be cost-effective and I am confident that technical and management advice will continue to be cost-effective to the user.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the charges made for ACOT services will be reasonable and applied in an effective and constructive manner.  There will be full consultation between my Department and ACOT prior to the introduction of any charges in relation to their level and the criteria used in their formulation.  As my approval is ultimately necessary for the making of charges, the Bill provides adequate safeguards that the overall interests of the agricultural sector will be <Col N="360" /> fully taken into account in the determination of the fees which ACOT may charge.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill provide adequate safeguards to achieve the objectives of the Government for the promotion of the efficiency of Irish farming and assisting it to develop to its full potential.  To the extent that increased income is generated under this measure to augment the considerable funding already provided from public finances, ACOT's ability to service the need of the less developed farmers with potential for expansion will be enhanced. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish the new Minister and his Ministers of State well in their difficult role in looking after the interests of Irish farmers.  It is only fair to say at this stage that two of the Ministers of State with whom we worked for the past four years were at all times quite constructive, maybe a bit cynical at times but that is part of the role of the Opposition. We certainly did some very constructive work and had quite a few achievements, some of which can be forgotten very quickly.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is our legislation. There are a few aspects of it on which I would like to comment.  We should look very briefly at the whole ACOT-AFT scene in so far as value for money is concerned.  Agriculture is changing rapidly. Hitherto we could look very placidly at operations such as dairying, beef production and so on and say: &ldquo;We will go more and more into dairying, make more money and we do not have to worry very much about anything else.&rdquo;  Had we taken some advice earlier on probably we would be much bigger in dairying than we are at present.  We now have a totally new ball game in so far as we have peaked in dairying.  There are limits to what we can do in beef and, in fact, there are limitations right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the dilemma of young farmers at the moment in not being able to get sugar beet contracts we realise the real limitations of Irish agriculture and the role ACOT have to play in this new <Col N="361" /> changing scene.  With the reorganisation of ACOT much has happened.  It took a long time and possibly the right thing was not done.  I said and I repeat in this House that Mark Clinton's original idea whereby the two organisations would have been blended into one was probably the best option of all.  There would not be the sort of duplication that exists with regard to research and putting research theories into practice.  We must live now with ACOT and AFT working closely together and endeavouring to improve the lot of farmers.</P>
    <P>The idea of a general practitioner type of ACOT adviser we had in the past is no longer acceptable.  ACOT have recognised this and have now come up with some of the answers.  They now have specialists in beef production, dairying and tillage.  Slowly but surely these specialists are being accepted by farmers. The green CERT course is very popular. It is nice to think that these courses are now linked with some of our EC benefits. Farm accession is linked to the green CERT course and any tax concessions that are available from the Government are also linked to competence in farming. That is only as it should be.  People should not get these benefits too lightly.</P>
    <P>With the tough competition we have not merely among ourselves but also from overseas, we need to be tops at our job. There is no point in saying the job is easy or that we have a better climate than anybody else.  It galls me at times when I read that it is so easy for us to produce all sorts of things that we are not producing especially with regard to horticulture.  We have a fairly unfavourable climate for a wide range of horticultural crops.  We have a fairly inclement climate.  No one knows better than those of us who have grown these crops unsuccessfully during the years that we do not have that much on our side.  With an enlarged Community, with Spain now in the Community and with the Mediterranean climate which they have, we now have more and more competition to contend with.</P>
    <P>ACOT would need to be much more aggressive in the marketing scene.  It is <Col N="362" /> not good enough any more to tell farmers we will help them to produce X, Y and Z ACOT will have to get involved in the marketplace.  There is very little point in producing frozen peas, French beans or any other crop if there is no market for them.  That is the big difficulty we are experiencing all the time.  It certainly has been a problem for me and for my predecessors and that problem still exists. Whether we like it or not the Irish housewife is not over-concerned about where the frozen foods or the vegetables come from; she is concerned about quality and about price.  In many areas we have upped our quality over the past number of years.  The quality of our vegetables has improved considerably.  Everybody, especially people in this House, can take a bow on that.  In 1982 when I became Minister of State there was almost a civil war when Irish farmers dumped Dutch potatoes into the sea.  At least now we have ordered marketing and we have the national potato co-operative, admittedly a struggling co-operative.  We have for the first time, with the co-operation of ACOT, a register of potato growers and we can keep tabs on these people.  We can compliment ACOT on having helped with this registration.</P>
    <P>Incidentially, we cannot boast too much, because many people have not registered.  If farmers are to be charged for services they will be looking for and be entitled to a better service.  They will be more critical and the service will need to be much improved.  Some experienced farmers will be in need of expert advice and will be expecting to get a much better service.  I can see a great involvement for ACOT right through to the market place.</P>
    <P>I should like to see ACOT becoming involved in producer goods.  In the last couple of years we have succeeded in getting producer groups going in horticulture and potatoes, not before time. These groups are still small and centred in Dublin, Meath and Louth, but they are moving down to the south east and Cork.  However, they are not getting the support they deserve.  ACOT must rally around these producer groups, to help <Col N="363" /> them get their products into the shops and supermarkets.  Regretfully, quite a number of our trading people are not one bit concerned about where the food comes from.  The tendency is to have a telex machine and perhaps a small office staff with the aim of getting the container load or whatever from the cheapest place possible.  I keep saying that it is not the Dutch who are responsible; it is Irish people who are bringing the goods over. Irish traders, some of them prominent, have not the commitment.  Some have the audacity to bring in vegetables in bulk and put them in their own bags, giving the impression that these are Irish potatoes and other Irish vegetables.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned an Bord Glas.  When this board unfolds, I shall be very constructive in my approach to it.  The weak link is getting the produce into the shops and the stores.  That market is being controlled by people who to a large extent do not mind very much where the food comes from.  After much difficulty and a great deal of help from the ACOT advisers, we succeeded in reformulating both Midleton and Mallow Foods.  We got a processing operation, admittedly a very lean operation going.  It was very tightly funded.  We got 2,000 acres of crops growing and created a little employment, but unfortunately at this moment almost the entire produce of last year's crop is sitting in a cold store, costing about £1 per pallet per day.  At the same time, Irish merchants are flooding our shops with foreign produce. There is no point in blaming the Dutch, the Danes or anybody else.  The blame lies with Irish merchants who have no interest in promoting Irish goods.  Very few shops are supplying Midleton packaged foods.  That is the real role of ACOT with the farming organisations, with those who have already set up these horticultural co-operatives, to make no apologies for bringing Irish foodstuffs into our shops and supermarkets.  We can offer first class goods at the right price. If we are to charge farmers for services, that is the sort of service they will be looking for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> I am sure many Members on both sides of the House have had the same experience as I have, that farmers are no longer prepared to take the same sort of risk with new crops that they might have taken ten years ago.  The reason is that they have to budget much more carefully than in the past because they are living in a tough scenario.  Their input costs are still relatively high and they must be sure, first that they will be paid and, secondly, that they will get an adequate return for what they produce.  Whether it be parsely, frozen peas, cauliflower or one of the more labour intensive crops, the growers must know what their profit margins will be like.  The role of ACOT and AFT is vital, because these people must cost out for the farmers the entire programme, the cost of the crop, the likely yields, the varieties of seed that they should be growing.  They must be able to point out that through the IFA controlled produce groups the farmers will be able to sell their crops.  One of our toughest difficulties is trying to dispose of what we produce.</P>
    <P>The dairy people with quotas are happy enough and those in efficient beef production are reasonably satisfied, but for the younger farmers and those not fortunate enough to have these very substantial quotas and contracts it will be a very tough scene, although not an impossible one.  In the past we succeeded well in exporting much produce to the United Kingdom.  The beginning has been made in some areas, for example with mushrooms which were highly successful. There is great scope in that market for quite a range of products. We have already attempted with some success to bring some produce into the ethnic Irish populations in Manchester, Birmingham and Coventry.  Success will come about only if we have a first class advisory service.  Farmers will respond reasonably favourably to a change.  Quite a number are now paying quite substantial sums to private advisory companies which have been set up around the country.  They are getting the necessary specialised advice.  The challenge is there <Col N="365" /> for ACOT.  They have been highly successful in my own area and that success is growing in the Dublin area on the horticultural side.  Their improved services are very much in demand.</P>
    <P>Originally on Second Stage we talked about farmers who could afford to pay.  I hope it would be the Minister's intention that advice would still be available to farmers who could not pay for it.  I should like that clause to be put back.  I was adamant at the time that that clause should be included in the relevant legislation. I had a reason for so ensuring.  I do not think any farmer should be regarded as a lesser citizen if for one reason or another he is unable to afford to pay for such a service.  Indeed, a formula was worked out at the time as to how such a scheme could be devised.</P>
    <P>ACOT have served the Irish farming community well over the years.  In my area there was only one adviser covering the whole of east Cork.  He got to know all the local farmers and generated much enthusiasm.  I had hoped that the revitalised ACOT would regenerate that enthusiasm but that does not seem to have been happening.  I should like to see advisers going out among farmers somewhat more, getting to know them better.  Those advisers now have substantial office accommodation and are inclined perhaps to remain there hoping that farmers will come to them.  I should prefer to see them putting on their wellingtons again, getting out to farms, having discussions with farmers, seeing for themselves at first hand what is taking place.  From the point of view of weather, we have experienced two of the worst years in living memory.  The chances of our experiencing another bad year are about a million to one so, hopefully, we can look forward to better weather this year.</P>
    <P>Some of our markets have stabilised but there are many challenges ahead. There is an element of the unknown about such challenges.  For example, there is now the question of rabbit production, something at which people might have smirked a couple of years ago <Col N="366" /> had one mentioned the subject.  It is now big business in the United Kingdom and in France.  A few people here have moved into that production.  Many more would do so if there were sufficient advice available about that whole production scene. It is an area of production in which ACOT and others would need to update their thinking.</P>
    <P>With regard to new projects, there appears to be a vacuum between production and marketing.  In the future we need to get farmers, their advisers people like the IDA and CTT together so as to ensure that from the farmer/ACOT point of view and from the point of view of AFT we can produce competitively.  Then the IDA and CTT would be able to say: we believe you can sell your product, these are the types of customers that exist, these are the prices they can afford to pay.  At present that type of liaison appears to be missing in any new proposal. Such proposals come forward so quickly now we must be prepared for them.  For instance, one area in which we are experiencing difficulty in getting moving is that of soft cheeses.  For a number of years now AFT and ACOT have been conducting a number of projects on farmhouse cheeses which has led to the production of very good Camembert, Brie and that type of cheese around the country.  The snag is that marketing costs are astronomical.  It should be remembered that we still import approximately £12 million worth of these cheeses.  These could be produced here but there is a need to involve the larger co-operatives who would handle their marketing.  ACOT, with the help of the co-operatives, would need to work out a formula to ensure a satisfactory marketing policy.</P>
    <P>We introduced this Bill.  We envisage an ever-increasing, sophisticated farming scene, with that type of expertise and advice I have mentioned being readily available.  It is not longer a case of an ACOT adviser advising farmers on the amounts of fertilisers they should use on their farms.  All of that is old hat; farmers know exactly how much to use and when to use such fertilisers.  The advice now <Col N="367" /> needed is: how will a farmer work out financially at the end of the day if he goes down that road.  That is much more difficult advice to give.  It is very easy to say to a farmer: if you do X, Y and Z you will get three tonnes but there is no point in getting three tonnes if he loses at the end of the day.  The type of advice now needed is much more sophisticated.  It must be better researched and this will need increasing numbers of specialists on the part of ACOT.  Indeed, people are to be commended on endeavouring to devise ways and means of putting that advice into practice.</P>
    <P>In fairness it should be said that the county committees of agriculture have been constructive in their suggestions. The Department worked closely with them over the past four years.  They had mixed views about charging.  There is the fear that if a charge is introduced people will not avail of the service.  Experience has proved the contrary.  For example, all farmers in Normandy are charged for services, a flat rate of approximately £90 to £100 to join the club, be they big or small.  One is not charged according to one's valuation or acreage.  One is charged approximately £90 to £100 and for that one receives good advice. Indeed, one is entitled to seek a particular adviser or type of advice.  There is no hassle about it.  Where such charge has been levied it has been shown to work. At the end of the day the farmer will feel that he has the right to criticise an adviser if the advice does not prove to be correct. I would hope that ACOT would strengthen their activities in the future.  It is my wish that, with the aid of this House, we would help them to look after the interest of our farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to say about this Bill is that I am sure everybody subscribes to the success of ACOT and of agriculture.  But I must confess to having been very alarmed as I heard the arguments unfold this morning because they are unfolding in what I can only describe as a relatively aspirational way.  People are wishing farmers well, <Col N="368" /> wishing ACOT well, wishing agricultural advisers well; we all do.  The fact of the matter is that we have clear evidence from several other countries in Europe as to what has happened when charges for agricultural advisory services have been introduced.  There is indeed a body of research put together in Holland as to what happens when advisory services are restructured in a fee-paying way.  I might quote one example, the one most appropriate. In Finland &mdash; a country often quoted in this and the other House &mdash; when charges were introduced the total number of people availing of agricultural advisory services dropped to 22 per cent of those before their introduction.  That is simply a fact.</P>
      <P>Following on from the point made previously, that one hopes the advisers will get out to the farmers and spend less time in their offices, unless they have the gift of St. Martin de Porres &mdash; being in two places at the one time &mdash; how are they to get to the farms since travelling allowances have been cut back?  I find myself unable to make these connections.  If we want to get farm advisers out to the farms we should be facilitating rather than obstructing them by eliminating their travelling allowances.  This debate about giving ACOT the ability to levy charges raises a number of fundamental issues. For a start, the debate is taking place in an atmosphere in which there has been an organised narrow-minded, backward-looking opposition to farm tax.  Anybody who cares about the development of agriculture as a resource and who is concerned about adequate rural income can accept that there are farmers who are able to pay tax and that there are thousands of farmers who are living in poverty and who are below the tax threshold, however reasonably it might be structured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 75 per cent of all farms in the constituency I represent are under 30 acres and perhaps 35 to 40 per cent are under 15 acres.  My constituency has serious disadvantages in terms of soil, access to markets, drainage and in terms of social characteristics such as access to and participation in education and so on. <Col N="369" /> As a subsection of those there are tiny smallholders in the Galway Gaeltacht for whom it has not been possible to provide veterinary services.  There have been repeated applications to the Department of Agriculture, to the advisory services, to educational services and professional bodies to assist in this regard.  People are locked away in small holdings and are unable to benefit from any of the farseeing policies for the improvement in animal husbandry, in disease eradication and so on.</P>
    <P>Effectively, because we have decided not to have a tax on an equitable basis, we have to introduce a whole series of regressive piecemeal badly thought-out charges which will affect the productive capacity of agriculture.  If one were to say that the needy could be catered for but that people with over a certain valuation should pay charges, I would agree but before agreeing I would ask &ldquo;why did you not charge tax and why do you not separate out the issue of tax from the issue of the use of agriculture as a productive asset?&rdquo;  By introducing charges we will reduce by perhaps one-fifth the most vulnerable category who are consuming agricultural advisory services at present, but something else will happen. If we introduce charges and some people pay and others do not, the pressure will be put on the agricultural adviser and anybody else applying services that the person who pays will be entitled to see the adviser most often because he is paying for it.  Of course that will not be true because the adviser's education training and so on has been provided already from general taxation and the charges will be an additional increment. By paying that additional increment one would be able to put additional pressure on the adviser.  How can anyone but conclude that the introduction of the charges will both shrink and distort the quality and volume of advisory services available in agriculture, with inevitable results for the productive capacity of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Over the last several years Deputies in this House have spoken about commercial farmers, development farmers and about people below development <Col N="370" /> capacity.  Obviously the people who will not now see an adviser, and who do not see an adviser often enough will be the people below development capacity. Within the development capacity category, perhaps one third of those have been persuaded to take up advisory services. These people were reluctant to take advice but they were wooed to the notion that they could farm more efficiently and that they would have more flexibility and adaptability.  How can the imposition of charges do anything but reverse what has been the previous policy of agriculture spokespersons in this House up to now.  It is not logical.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall cut in ACOT funding in 1987, if we are talking about people making adequate rural livelihoods, we have to move away from strict economic criteria based entirely on income.  The notion of a socio economic adviser was a very good one because it enabled people to link agricultural advice with other realities in farming, particularly on small farms.  This would also take account of health and ageing characteristics and the need for land mobility and so on.  All of that will be reversed or will be made far more difficult. If we continue the present tendency of cuts in ACOT funding, who will now be able to train for a career or a livelihood in agriculture?  The figures coming out in response to the proposed cuts in ACOT spending are suggesting that one of the things that are going are the scholarships for agricultural colleges. In 1985 in County Galway, 53 young people were able to attend agricultural college under scholarships.  One of the responses to the 62 per cent to 65 per cent cut proposed in the ACOT budget, as it will affect County Galway, is that these scholarships will be wiped out.  The more public educational programmes in agricultural, demonstrations, exhibitions, assistance given to agricultural shows and so on will be cut.  Overall in the country we are taking out of the advisory services available the education side of agriculture which might have been a powerful input to making agriculture more productive.  In 1987 it is proposed <Col N="371" /> to take something between £2 million and £5 million from agriculture.  I deliberately say between £2 million and £5 million because there is a heavy uncertainty as to the amount of money available from the European Social Fund into agricultural training education and development. Because of this uncertainty the cuts proposed may be at a higher level than those we have read about so far.</P>
    <P>In relation to the aspiration that the advisers get around to the farms, unless the price of petrol is going to fall dramatically, it will be difficult to see the advisers getting to more farms, when their travel grants are cut by 25 per cent. There are a few other small points that might as well be made.  There is in the Minister's speech the well meaning aspiration that one hopes that all farmers will continue to be advised even though they will be paying for it whether or not they can afford to and that all farmers will receive advice whether or not the agricultural adviser is able to put petrol into his car to get to them and that all farmers whether or not they are paying will not put pressure on the agricultural adviser arriving on the farm and that the person who cannot pay will be in exactly the same position as the person who can. This optimism is encouraging but it hardly substitutes for proper planning in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the aim in this legislation was as drafted by his predecessors in office, and let us leave out that partisan view.  He want on to say:</P>
    <P>The broad aim of the Government is to ensure that as far as possible cost-effective advisory and educational resources will be maintained.</P>
    <P>How can advisory and educational resources be cost-effective unless they are measured against some target?  What is the target?  Will they have failed if fewer people are availing of the advisory services, or will they have succeeded if some of those who are still using the advisory services continue to do so?  What is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;cost-effective advisory and educational resources <Col N="372" /> will be maintained&rdquo;?  If you say honestly, as did Paddy Hogan, one of the greatest Minister for Agriculture this State has known, that you help the strong man and the devil take the weakest, that is one aim and the cost-effective advisory and educational resources can be maintained to achieve that aim.  But is it the aim to secure as many rural livelihoods as we can, particularly for people with less than 50 acres?  My view is very simple.  The small farmers have become an army propping up a number of people at the front who are able to avoid paying farm tax and avoid responsibility in the larger society.  Now they are seeing the personnel of the State helping the very people they pushed out in front, the strong commercial farmers, while they suffer.  Their children will suffer because their chances of making a livelihood in agriculture and outside the commercial sector will be severely damaged.</P>
    <P>Is it not agreed that there is hope for greater mobility from traditional farm practices?  In fairness the Minister accepted this in his speech.  If that is the case and choices have to be made both within and from agriculture into different patterns of activity, surely there is a need for more advice and more services being available.  What this is saying is that agriculture is to be exempted from any scheme of progressive taxation, but it will be included in a system of regressive taxation in which increasingly the small farmers and the people depending on them will be allowed to slip into rural poverty.  All over rural Ireland there are people with commercial prospects who are just about able to manage, or are slightly better off at the moment, and who will be able to afford to pay for the advisory services which will be available to them.  There is nothing Irish about this. It happened in Finland and it has been studied and recorded at the University of Wargeningen in Holland.  It has happened in every European country but the one dramatic example I quoted was Finland where participation in advisory services was at 22 per cent before the introduction of charges.  All these figures can be checked and tested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> It might be said that nobody is so irresponsible as to do what I am suggesting to Irish agriculture and Irish rural life but the truth is that if there is to be discrimination in favour of the poor people, why is it not included in the Minister's speech?  For example, in relation to some of the environmental grants the poor law valuation criterion is still used.  Why not say that for farms below £60 PLV, there will be no charge and that the advisory and educational services, will not be distorted so as to exclude all the people with valuations below that figure?  That is not in the Minister's speech and it is a very serious erosion of parliamentary responsibility in relation to agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The argument is that ACOT can come up with proposals but they cannot implement them.  They send those proposals to the Minister for approval and he may, at his discretion, decide which proposals he will accept.  I should like to know what social philosophy is behind those proposals.  If there is to be an exemption, I should like to know now what the cut-off point will be and which farmers will be exempted so that they can continue to participate in advisory and educational services.  It is highly appropriate that we get this information here. Not only is ACOT vulnerable in relation to what is now being proposed as regards charges, but in a knock-on way local authority contributions will be imperilled by what will be proposed in relation to local authority funding.  However, that is for another day.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with this measure as it affects the people in my constituency. Everybody agrees that land as a resource should be used to the best advantage, that as many people as possible should be moved into the category of potential development farmers and that commercial farmers should be allowed to expand, but everybody knows unless he lives on Mars, that there is a land use pattern.  In parts of the country there are larger farms with better soil, better orientation towards marketing and better drainage.  I am speaking of farms made <Col N="374" /> up of one holding.  They are completely different to the farms in the 12 western counties.  The figure for fragmented holdings in the 12 western counties is around 40 per cent.  This means that just over half the people in farming hold their land in one parcel.  It is the people with fragmented holdings who are being told they have seen the last of the advisers.  We must insert a specific policy exemption for them.  I want to record in their own language gur tharla sin cheana san Ghaeltacht. Is fíor-fhada ó chonaic muintir na Gaeltachta atá ag plé le cúrsaí talmhaíochta aon chomhairleoir beag no mór. Ní fhaca siad duine leis na blianta.</P>
    <P>I visit Carna, Lettermore or Lettermullen and may speak to a woman whose family have emigrated.  She may have one person at home, or nobody at home, but she has a couple of fields and a few acres.  What is she supposed to do for advisory services?  What happened for years was that a dedicated vet, until he went broke, delivered his services free or for the £1 or £2 people like her could pay.  The people in the Department of Agriculture allowed a situation to emerge where practically no veterinary services were available in the Gaeltacht, despite all the lip-service which has been paid to our culture and our national future.  The people who live in those areas were abandoned. What will happen now is that that model will be extended into the other impoverished rural areas.  I want to repeat that I am not saying no one should ever pay for anything in Ireland.  I emphasise there should be adequate farm tax of a progressive kind for those who are able to pay.  If that existed, we would not be having these highly regressive, unproductive, backward, discriminating measures in agriculture.</P>

      <P>This is my first occasion to address the House and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as Ceann Comhairle. I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and his Ministers of State on their appointment.  I assure them of my support and the support of my party, the <Col N="375" /> Progressive Democrats, in advancing the cause of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I regard us as members of the board of Irish agriculture incorporated.  We are here to provide a framework and a climate to produce wealth for agriculture, not verbiage.  Because of the present position and the difficulties farmers and themselves in, and taking into account the major contribution agriculture makes to farmers' income, employment, and foreign earnings, this is not an area in which to play party politics.  Nevertheless, when the Bill before the House today was introduced formally last April it was opposed vehemently by the then Opposition spokesman on agriculture. He said:</P>
      <P>I am appalled that the Minister for Agriculture is not here to present this Bill which will affect the vital interests of agriculture over the next number of years.  The advisory services are paramount in relation to future agricultural development.</P>
      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>This Bill will push back the cause of agriculture for many years.  It proposes an unusual and sinister taxation on farmers and it proposes to negate the powers of the board of ACOT irrespective of what the Minister of State said in his brief speech this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning to the Bill itself. <Col N="376" /> we would like to know if there is a scale of fees in operation or have they been proposed?  Will travelling time be an important factor in the charging of accounts to farmers with distance being a priority?  Will farmers have to suffer because of the distance between their farms and the homes of the ACOT advisers or from their places of operation? How are the proposed charges to be collected?  Will there be a yearly charge or will they be on the basis of so much per visit?  Will there be different fees for individual farmers?  How will they be assessed?  Will there be an agricultural card like the medical card with each farmer assessed and entitled to so many services depending upon his circumstances? I suggest there will be difficulties in the implementation of these fees which will have to be arbitrary.</P>
      <P>What about the disadvantaged areas? Will collection fees be introduced into the disadvantaged areas which require a lot of help.  I have to agree with the previous speaker who asked whether we are going to help these people to stay on the land or drive them from it and have to pay them social welfare benefit and find houses for them in the towns.  I suggest that we must have another look at these fees especially for people in the disadvantaged areas to allow them to stay on the land and maintain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed to see that there will be no further inclusions in the disadvantaged areas this year.  I believe that the disadvantaged areas hold the key to keeping people in the poorer parts of the country.  Not alone do they relate to the grants which are available, such as headage grants etc., but they also relate to the kind of alternative industries which are being proposed today and which are being proposed by ACOT and the Department of Agriculture generally. They need as their base some kind of packaging or processing plant close to the area of production.  The fact that these areas are classified as disadvantaged entitles them to major grants for plant and equipment and for the training of personnel.  It is very important to realise that many of these alternative industries <Col N="377" /> and ones other than traditional will depend to a large extent on the marketplace, as other speakers have pointed out, and on production and packaging in local co-operatives within those areas. The benefits will be twofold.  Not alone will they accrue to the farmer directly but they will also accrue to the co-operative. If a farmer becomes a member of a co-operative it will give him independence in the packaging and processing of the produce from his own land.</P>
    <P>Speaking about ACOT and their small budget, what would happen if we were to charge people participating in AnCO courses?  It is a matter of education. Advice is education.  It is a direction of your business.  AnCO are directing people into careers.  We are doing the same thing in agriculture.  We are trying to maintain people on the land by giving them advice.  There is a strong case to be made for charging people on commercial farms for professional advice in terms of buildings and layout, crop rotations, etc., but when we talk about certain parts of the country which are disadvantaged in terms of climate, soil types, infrastructure and know-how we are talking about something entirely different.  The reality is that if we withdraw help from these people we will have to find it for them in terms of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by previous speakers with regard to ACOT and the marketplace I must point out that we should first take the fresh market.  We are part of the European Economic Community and we are in free competition with other member states.  The first thing we must do is to ensure that no fresh produce whatsoever is imported into this country. We should put all our strength and know-how into being in the fresh market, be it in the greengrocers or in the supermarket. It is my information that there has been a big swing to fresh produce in supermarkets.  We were not getting our fair share but much of that difficulty was of our own making.  There is no point in making the case that shopkeepers and supermarkets are not stocking Irish produce and saying that RTE are accepting <Col N="378" /> advertisements for foreign products. The sale is being made in people's homes. The shops have got to stock the products for which there is a demand.  We have a tremendous advantage in being what is termed in Europe as a &ldquo;green country&rdquo;. We are relatively unpolluted and we have the opportunity to grow the fresh produce which has a higher added value content and which has a higher sales premium in the marketplace.  The difficulty has been that we have not been producing what the customer wants.</P>
    <P>In that regard the smaller farms and poorer areas can exploit their potential because growing fresh produce is more labour entensive and needs more man management than, say, the large ranch type farms which have large herds of cattle in milk production.  The Minister said that, despite current budgetary difficulties and EC surpluses in some of our main commodities, there is considerable scope for greater efficiency in the production of existing output and for the encouragement of alternative farm enterprises in areas where further expansion is not possible.  I would say to the credit of the farmers that the difficulties we find ourselves in today are not of their making.  They were encouraged in the seventies to borrow money to expand and told that there would be a big market and a bottomless purse in the EC.  As a result farmers invested millions of pounds and agricultural production increased a couple of hundredfold but now they are in a difficulty.  They are trapped by the money they borrowed and by the assets they have which in many cases are virtually non-productive.  Those who advised them, who produced the policies or gave them the money continue to hold their jobs and are relatively unscathed. We have a duty to support those farmers in their time of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Withdrawing ACOT services across the board will not help farmers in their difficulties.  We must remember that there is a social aspect to the call by ACOT advisers.  They give farmers a certain amount of confidence in what they are doing and encourage them to make changes.  The PDs support charging fees <Col N="379" /> in principle for State services to those who can afford to pay for them because of the dire state of public finances.  At the end of the day there is no such a thing as a free service because they have to be paid for by somebody, in this case by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Charging fees will have a good effect commercially because those who can pay will avail of the advisory service to a greater extent.  It will also have the effect of putting the advisers on their toes.  I have no doubt that ACOT who are the specialists are in a position, in consultation with farming organisations, to devise a fair scheme.  I accept that smallholders should be exempted from these charges.  Those people are not in a position to pay fees but they are entitled to an advisory service.  The fees should be varied from year to year to take into account the increase in the cost of providing the ACOT service.  The PDs maintain that there are no free meals in this society, somebody has to pay and it is only right that in hard times those who can afford to pay must be asked to do so on a fair and equitable basis.  We support the Bill but we will be anxious to scrutinise certain fees when they are introduced by ACOT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this legislation.  It is important that Members when discussing any matter of interest to the agricultural community should acknowledge the contribution made by the advisory service to the development of that industry over the years.  That contribution has been immense in terms of the amount of progress that has been made in the area of research.  In that regard it is worth noting the advancements made in the dairy sector.  When I was involved in Macra na Feirme the old style agricultural advisory service proved of great benefit to rarmers.  The results of research carried out by specialists like Dr. O'Grady in Moorepark was conveyed to farmers by the advisory service and led to a great improvement in the dairy sector.  I do not think anybody will <Col N="380" /> dispute the fact that we have some of the most efficient dairy farmers in Europe and that that significant development is as a result of the dedication of those involved in research and the advisory service.</P>
      <P>It is important that the House recognises that any money voted by the House for education or research in the agricultural sphere is more than repaid in terms of returns to the nation.  We are all aware of the increase in the volume of agricultural exports and the benefit that accrues from them to our economy.  We should recognise that farmers were very eager and willing recipients of the advice given to them.  They have always displayed a tremendous commitment to the industry for their own benefit and the benefit of the nation.  The advisers who worked in close co-operation with the farmers were, in effect, development officers because of their involvement in local communities.  The investment in agricultural education was more than repaid through agricultural exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural community were always anxious to learn, improve their living standards and the overall efficiency of the industry.  We must recognise that our entry to the EC provided us with a base on which to build the agricultural industry.  There was a lot of controversy at the time of our application to join the EC but there can be no doubt that the agricultural industry and our economy benefited significantly from our membership and is continuing to do so although on a somewhat reduced scale. It is ironic that the response of Irish farmers to call for increased production by good farming techniques has resulted in the introduction of a quota system for most of our agricultural products.  I must express strong criticism of the treatment of our marketing position within the EC. The real problem facing agriculture is that the opportunity for expansion no longer exists.  A quota applies to most of our agricultural products and that automatically restricts potential for development in that industry.  It is because we depend on agriculture that we should endeavour to renegotiate our <Col N="381" /> position in the community in regard to that sector.  Unless we can come to some satisfactory arrangement within the European Community to give us an increased share of the European market, then there will not be any real scope for improving our agricultural industry or saving many farmers who are in extreme financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is worth putting on the record the findings of a well researched document circulated in March by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  A survey on the level of poverty and hardship all over the country showed that households headed by a farmer comprised some 29.9 per cent of the total number of all poor people.  That is a sad reflection on the level to which the agricultural industry has declined in recent years.  Surely it must strike a warning note for those of us in this House who have a say in the formulation of agricultural policy for the future.  We must take note of the fact that farming income has been declining at a frightening rate.  We must look to our European partners to provide us as a matter of urgency with the opportunity further to, develop our agriculture and help to raise the living standards of the people who are so far below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems is the lack of alternative enterprises.  An agricultural adviser may be asked what area of agricultural production can be developed which will give an economic return, but the sad reality is that there are few, if any, areas in which agriculture can develop successfully.  Milk and sugar are subject to quotas and the profit margins in relation to beef are so slight that a person who has borrowed to undertake this enterprise will not be able to make a profit.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which we are discussing this Bill.  We must consider where agriculture is heading.  I welcome the new Minister for Agriculture and the Ministers for State.  They are all dedicated and committed public representatives. The Minister for Agriculture will benefit from his vast European experience and what I have <Col N="382" /> been saying today is very relevant to him. I urge him and the new Government to commence negotiations immediately with our European partners to get some kind of special concession for Irish agriculture. I have no doubt that the Government will take seriously the problems affecting the industry.  Even though we are improving efficiency and output, we are not significant contributors to the overall European surplus &mdash; in fact, we are minimal contributors to it.  Because of the dependence of our economy on agriculture it should be possible to renegotiate our entry in terms of the development of the industry for the future.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by previous speakers to the level of imports.  I am pleased the Taoiseach decided to give a special recognition to the very serious problem of large scale food imports.  We must immediately tackle this matter, not only by reducing the level of imports but by substituting with home production in order to generate employment.  At the end of the day it is a matter of whether we can be successful in providing employment for the maximum number of people in their own country.</P>
    <P>Horticulture and forestry are two areas which have potential for job creation and for reducing the level of imports.  I welcome the appointment of Deputy Seamus Kirk as Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture.  As our spokesman in Opposition he displayed a great willingness to familiarise himself with every aspect of the horticulture industry and I have no doubt that this sector of our economy is in safe hands.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the development of agriculture in the European Community is the milk cessation scheme.  The number of farmers who opted for this scheme under regulations introduced by Brussels is frightening because it reflects the soft option which that scheme made available to farmers who found themselves in serious financial difficulties.  It is sad that the farmers who opted for this scheme are in this position and are mainly smaller producers.  The bureaucrats here <Col N="383" /> or in Brussels have now decided that those who have applied and been accepted must stay within the scheme; they will not be allowed to opt out.  I have come across cases of farmers in recent weeks who had applied for inclusion in the milk cessation scheme but have now decided, because of the reorganisation of their farms, that they would like to opt out.  By doing so they would be making more flexi-milk available for farmers who did not succeed in their original applications for inclusion in the scheme. Bureaucracy has reached such a level in Europe and at home that the people who want to opt out will not be allowed to do so, even though other farmers are anxious to be included.  I make a special plea for some kind of sanity to prevail in relation to this matter.  I know of one farmer who has a milk quota in the region of 100,000 gallons and who applied for inclusion in the scheme because of family circumstances.  He now wishes to remain in the scheme and there are many other farmers who will not be allowed to participate because the milk is no longer available to them.  Surely it is within the scope of officials in the Department of Agriculture and in Europe to devise a readjustment of this scheme to allow those who wish to leave it to do so and to allow others to participate?</P>
    <P>The farmers who are in serious financial difficulties today are those who responded to the call to improve their efficiency to increase production.  It is not their fault that the markets have gone wrong and that they are restricted by quotas.  Some kind of assistance must be provided to help to alleviate the short term problems which some of our most progressive farmers face at present.  They responded to the call to increase production, the nation benefited as a result but they are now left carrying the can.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of speaking briefly on the Bill and I am confident that the Minister for Agriculture will face up to the crisis existing in the agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory service clearly has a crucial role to play in improving the efficiency of farmers and it is not unreasonable for ACOT to charge for these services where necessary. People are charged for all sorts of services, students are charged examination fees, there are fees for planning applications and people are charged for water and refuse services.  Indeed, in some areas, people are charged for borrowing books from libraries and all the charges to which I referred are paid mainly by people who already carry a heavy PAYE tax burden.  On the other hand the failure of successive Governments to ensure that farmers paid a fair share of taxation has been well established. In 1985 the average PAYE worker paid £2,490 per year compared to an average of just £672 per year by farmers, an average of £47.9 per week from the PAYE worker and an average of just £13 per week from the farmer.  As we know, the vast majority of farmers do not pay any tax.  Many farmers have said quite openly that they pay in the region of £500 to the local accountant but they do not pay anything to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When farmers pay so little tax it is reasonable for ACOT to charge for an advisory service which can contribute to increased profits and wealth.  It is also worth nothing that not one penny has been paid on land since 1982.  We hope, <Col N="385" /> however, that ACOT will offer a sufficiently flexible system of charges to ensure that small farmers who are genuinely in need and who would have difficulty in meeting charges will not be prevented from getting the necessary advice to help them to improve their efficiency and earning power.  There is a need to examine the way in which grants and other financial assistance are paid to industry and farmers.  At a time of economic crisis, when spending cuts are being increased across the board, there is need to look at the generous tax concessions and grants available for industry and agriculture, particularly where they do not lead to the creation of additional jobs.  Grants to industry and agriculture should be linked to productivity and if they do not result in increased productivity, the grants should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for a total review of our agricultural policy and the various agencies which exist to meet the needs of farmers.  There has not been a replacement for the Land Commission.  Many farmers are working uneconomic holdings and require land in order to be viable in the immediate years ahead.  However, there is no help for them in this regard but when land is offered for sale the people who were crying wolf yesterday are able to buy it.  There is an urgent need for the implementation of a policy which will enable people who do not have viable holdings to be able to acquire land at a reasonable price.  Land is being bought up by those who already have very big farms and who are obviously very wealthy.</P>
    <P>Macra na Feirme are taking a new initiative in regard to agriculture which is very welcome.  I refer particularly to the demand for an increase in beet acreage. It has been stated publicly that the A quota for sugar was not filled in eight of the last 14 years.  There must be diversification, if people want to take up tillage farming or grow beet there should be a radical approach to the question.  Many land owners who now opt for beet growing would be very glad to increase their <Col N="386" /> quotas if they were given the necessary contracts.  Land is our greatest national resource and should be a rich source of new jobs.  However, our land is under-used and its potential for job creation from food processing and industrial crops has been developed to only a marginal degree.  The present system of financial aid to farmers, combined with the existing structure of the Common Agricultural Policy, will not bring about a sustained increase in marketable output or ensure the most productive use of our land resources.  They have also failed miserably to develop a comprehensive system of industrial and marketing linkage between the producer on the land and the consumer of food, timber or horticultural products.</P>
    <P>We believe that the creation of a single Government agency is vital for the development of the agricultural sector and that it would have enormous job creation potential.  That agency, an agricultural development authority, would have the responsibility for stimulating investment, farm modernisation, diversification of production, the development of food processing, production and marketing. They would also take over the State's role in respect of land use policy, research and development and training. In addition the disease eradication scheme and the various grants for infrastructural development on the land would be administered in accordance with the priorities of the Authority.  In future all State aids for agriculture should be related to farm plans, national production priorities, value-added production and employment potential.  The new Authority would be the executive authority of the State in this sector and would have on their board representatives of farmers' organisations, trade unions, various development agencies and the State itself.  They would be similar in structure to the IDA but would have a specific development role in relation to agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of these things that we will work out in time between the Whips.  Let me congratulate the Minister and the Ministers of State who have been appointed and wish them well in their portfolios in the coming months and years.  I intend to be brief because a number of my colleagues wish to speak on this Bill and time is against us.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that here we are talking about a Bill which was first introduced into the House on 10 April 1986 and we have heard already here quotations of the then agricultural spokesmen from the main Opposition party at the time who are now in Government. I quote from one of the present Ministers of State who said as recorded in column 504, volume 365 of the Official Report of Thursday, 10 April 1986:</P>
      <P>I oppose this Bill.  I call on the Minister to withdraw it and abandon the campaign for financial withdrawal from the agricultural industry.  I believe this Bill will spell the death knell for ACOT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> Even though 11 months have elapsed it is interesting to see that the commitment was made then and that if there was a change of Government this legislation would not see the light of day.  Now it is back on the floor of the House.  I accept that the cost of services across the board in agriculture right down along the line has always been a problem.  We all accept that there were never and will never be free lunches.  Of course it was different, going back a few years, when the farming community were paying rates and certainly they were paying for these services with the type of cost incurred then on the basis of the rate bills they had.  Now that that has changed it is no surprise to me that this proposal here has not been reversed by the new Government because in other areas where there are charges similar circumstances have prevailed. In opposition all these charges would be abolished, but when that party arrived in Government none of these charges was ever abolished.</P>
    <P>I have two things to say in relation to the charge.  I do not mind the charge being implemented provided the farmers have the service.  We have a serious problem in my constituency because of the Government embargo from 1981 that we have today, in that two members of ACOT staff have retired &mdash; that is a substantial number in any one constituency &mdash; and there is no replacement. In an area where agriculture is so improtant and where ACOT officials have so much to contribute to the future of agriculture the embargo in this area should be lifted.  I ask the Minister of State to take note &mdash; because I am sure his constituency has similar problems which extend right across the country &mdash; and to lift the embargo where it is involved in the educational sphere.  The educational sphere that has developed in agriculture over the past few years is as important as the RTCs and so on.</P>
    <P>In so far as this charge is concerned the Minister at the time emphasised that the formula was to be worked out in regard to the payment of this charge concerning farmers who could afford to pay it and other farmers who could not afford to <Col N="389" /> pay it.  We know that thousands and thousands of farmers over a period of years &mdash; not just two years &mdash; have had incomes far lower than £4,000 a year and when this charge is introduced and becomes law they will have to do without the service of ACOT in any shape or form.  This must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point.  I have been chairman of the ACOT committee in Meath for three-and-a-half or four years.  The taxpayers in Meath provided substantial buildings.  Three different premises were provided at a substantial cost to the ratepayers of the county.  At the takeover the committees of agriculture gave these buildings free, gratis and for nothing to ACOT.  From that time &mdash; I will take 1986 in particular &mdash; we in our county, out of the ACOT allocation to the county committee of agriculture, were asked to pay for the rent of the accommodation that we gave free, gratis and for nothing to ACOT and which was paid for by the taxpayers and ratepayers of County Meath, and we had to pay for the staff who attended at our meetings at a cost of in the region of £4,500 or £5,000 out of our contribution.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the overall cash proposal abolished and the amount of money given to the other end of the scale to services and the grants that we provided for shows and promotions in other areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, will know exactly what I am talking about and his Department must address themselves to it immediately because on the allocations we have received if there are not changes in the next week we will find that by the middle of this year the ACOT committees will have to be abandoned. I would not like that to happen.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise enough that farmers must have a service and instructors available to help them.  I do not think we can stand by this charge if there are areas where ACOT staff have not been replaced due to retirement.  I appeal to the Minister, following the introduction of this proposal, to look at that area immediately so that ACOT staff will be replaced the same as teachers and so on are replaced.  The embargo should be <Col N="390" /> lifted for those staff.  There are not many of those vacancies but where there are there is a big problem and farmers cannot avail of the services we are asking them to pay for.  We must be realistic and very fair to everybody.  I would appreciate if the Minister would take that on board in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate not alone yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment but also the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Kirk with whom I have worked over the last number of years preparing agricultural policy documents. If he applies, as I am sure he will, the same effort to this post I have no doubt he will make an outstanding success of it.  I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity in a Bill such as this to have a look at ACOT and the agricultural services generally.  It gives an opportunity especially to somebody from the smaller farming areas to look back at the massive changes that have taken place in agricultural development in the past number of years.  It has not been nearly as pronounced in the better farming lands of Munster and Leinster because they were traditionally grain, pulp and milk producers.  In the other 12 western countries there have been changes in the small farming enterprises that existed in the war years to milk and beef production.  They now have to re-examine their development and in order to survive have to move to other areas of production.  There never was a greater need for advice and instruction than is the case now.  It is important that that advice be made available.  There have been changes in the agricultural structure, in marketing and in production.  The family farm which is so much part of the structure of this island is in a serious position.  In the past number of years it has not been helped by the withdrawal on a continuous basis of development aid to the small or medium sized farmer.  The emphasis was placed almost completely on the big farmer.  With the introduction of the super-levy there has been a restriction <Col N="391" /> on milk and beef production and it looks as if that will continue.</P>
    <P>Other areas should also be examined. The party which I represent have examined a number of those areas.  There has been great development of afforestation. Substantial grant aids were given in this area &mdash; the highest in the EC in respect of any area &mdash; but many of those grants were not taken up for a number of reasons.  The people were not traditionally timber producers even though research indicated a high rate of growth and that it would be an area with great potential for development.  As I mentioned earlier, we have fruit and vegetable production and we have schemes for agri-tourism.  That is one area which could very well be used to good advantage in the 12 western counties.  We could develop further our production of milk, meat and poultry products.  There has been a development which is very pronounced in my own constituency, that is mushroom production, an are which has provided thousands of jobs in the growing, processing and compost manufacturing areas and which was mainly home produced raw materials.</P>
    <P>Since the early fifties I have had close association with the advisory service in my own county.  We have to pay tribute to them for the contribution they made to the changing face of agriculture.  Many of the instructors and advisers went far beyond the call of duty to visit halls, meeting places and community centres during winter months.  They were prepared to give of their time in that way without pay.  Their contribution was substantial. The amount of advice and instruction was never greater.  In the earlier years we had the family type farm which produces flax, potatoes, eggs, poultry and pigs.  Within a small number of years these farms moved into the hands of the larger intensive producers.  If that had not happened we would not be in a position to compete with our competitors in the EC where there is freedom of movement of produce.  There was movement to milk and meat production areas in which there is now serious curtailment. <Col N="392" /> Consequently, people will have to look to other areas of production.</P>
    <P>When the cessation scheme and the super-levy were introduced the farmers in the 12 western countries who were only developing at that time and moving into milk production did not get the recognition they deserved in the allocation of quotas.  I stated in this House very clearly my objections that they were not getting proper recognition and I have been justified in that criticism.  There has been a large number of applications for the milk cessation scheme.  There was only a 2 per cent take-up in some cases but in others the figure was 8 or 9 per cent.  That is regrettable because many of our co-ops were built to cater for substantially increased amounts of milk.  In any manufacturing industry it is the additional throughput that reduces the unit cost.  A drop in the overall amount of milk would have serious effects in terms of the additional costs involved.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kehoe from the Oak Park Research Centre of AFT wrote an article recently on seed potato production.  In Counties Donegal, Mayo and Monaghan there was much growing of seed potatoes for export and in the midlands the emphasis was on early production.  In Mayo and Monaghan it was a major source of income and in County Donegal it was the greatest source of income.  Under the heading &ldquo;Comment&rdquo;.  Mr. Kehoe writes as follows:</P>
    <P>Seed potatoes for export are one of the few agricultural commodities that can be expanded, provided we have a steady flow of new Irish-bred varieties. However, the area under seed potato production has declined from 6,500 hectares in 1964 to 3,300 hectares in 1983, while exports of seed potatoes have declined from 42,702 tonnes to 10,837 tonnes in the same period. Exports from Northern Ireland have consistently been much higher, and while they too have declined, they are still five times as great as from the Republic.</P>
    <P>That is very hard to understand.  A considerable amount of money has been <Col N="393" /> spent here on research into potatoes.  Several new varieties of seed potatoes such as Cara, Avondale and Red Cara are available at Oak Park.  Before this the varieties were Edwards and Banners, but the market was not for these.  The claim is that the potential is there and that this decline should be arrested.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kehoe goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Having arrested the decline in seed exports there is now considerable potential for expansion using the new Irish-bred varieties.  It should be possible to reach the 1963 export figure of 53,000 tonnes within 5-6 years.  This would demand a greater commitment from all the agencies involved.  ACOT, Irish Potato Marketing, Department of Agriculture, AFT and particularly, the growers.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Irish Potato Marketing Board is in place.  ACOT and the Department of Agriculture should make a serious effort.  It is an area in which there could be substantial increases in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a delegation which travelled out to Ethiopia last year from the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  The IFA and the Department of Agriculture had sent out 500,000 tonnes of Cara variety potatoes and we could see the lovely crops being grown in small corners, hand cultivated with a small spade or trowel and producing vigorous healthy crops of potatoes with great returns.  If the natives received one cwt. of potatoes from the supplying agency the commitment was to return that one cwt. and the rest would be theirs.  We found on our return that in the restaurant in this House the potatoes being served had not been grown here. That shows the scope for development.</P>
    <P>The main trust of this Bill is concerned with charges.  Nobody likes to pay charges, but we must realise the constraints upon the Government.  I ask the Minister to recognise the areas in real need of development as regards afforestation and <Col N="394" /> agri-tourism and on the fruit and vegetable side.  There is a chance there for massive development.</P>
    <P>There is also the proposal to provide natural gas to the Border regions and through my own constituency to Sligo. This would lead to a chance for development in the fruit and vegetable growing areas.  I hope farmers moving into these areas will not be curtailed because of charges.  This charging will have to be on a selective basis, with the emphasis on opportunities for development beneficial to all, to ensure the continuance of the family farm in those areas which have been in the past and still are having it very hard because the acreages are so small and the holdings are fragmented.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the Land Commission have been virtually abolished.  The Department of Agriculture must look closely at the aspect of land structure and land use.  Some authority or body will have to be set up to examine and monitor the transfer of holdings of land, to prevent them from getting into the wrong hands.  The Land Commission may have been a little slow, but they did much good work and did away with much of this fragmentation.  It is a pity their efforts have been thwarted.  I hope the Minister will understand the problems these people have, especially those with the initiative for development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  I have always treated agriculture as the high-tech industry of this country.  However, it was never put on the pedestal where it should have been put, by comparison with other industries. This had a very serious effect on the output of our farmers in the past decade. They were not geared to meet their counterparts in Europe.  We were lackadaisical in supporting the farmers in their demands for their rightful share of the national cake to enable them to take their place in meeting the challenge in Europe. We entered Europe with an agricultural community completely unprepared for the challenge they faced.</P>
      <P>The Irish farmer is as good a worker, if not better, as his European counterpart. He did not receive the financial assistance to which he was entitled over the past two decades.  However, in latter years we appear to have seen the light as far as aiding agriculture is concerned. Even though substantial strides have been made in that regard I remain unconvinced that our farmers receive the aid to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spend over 25 per cent of our income on food whereas our European counterparts spend approximately 20 per cent.  There being now over 3,000 items on the average supermarket shelf, with more disposable income, customers devote increasing attention to all commodities by way of quality, presentation, taste and health aspects.  With over 163,000 people engaged on farm production and 47,000 in the food processing industry it should be remembered that they are dependent on our ability to compete in our own and European markets. That applies not merely to our beef and lamb exports to France and Germany.  It is applicable also to our bacon and potato <Col N="396" /> production at home.  It should be remembered also that the consumer lobby in relation to food and health will strengthen as time progresses both here and in Europe, exerting greater pressure on the food industry and on our farmers to produce the right type of product for our own and continental housewives.</P>
    <P>I note that ACOT will receive £23 million from the Exchequer and local contributions which I am told represents over 80 per cent of their budget.  I regard that as peanuts only to a major industry which can be so viable and of such importance to our economy.  We are blessed with a climate for agricultural production second to none.  We have farmers with the acumen and interest to promote their industry to the best of their ability.  We have also agricultural manufacturers to ensure that their products are marketed and put on supermarket shelves.</P>
    <P>If we are to be realistic in our approach to our greatest industry, agriculture, we must afford it priority so far as finance is concerned.  The ACOT committees throughout the country are almost bankrupt, muzzled by lack of finance.  They have not sufficient funds at present to meet the travelling and subsistence allowances of their members.  I appeal to the new Minister for Agriculture and his Department to ensure that funds are not restricted for the education of our young farmers and making advice available to the farming community in general.  If we want our farmers to compete with their European counterparts we must ensure that there will be no cutbacks in agriculture. The time is ripe for this Government to ensure that agriculture is placed on a proper footing.  I realise there may be financial constraints generally.  No matter how many hundreds of thousands of people are unemployed the Department of Social Welfare have never failed yet to meet unemployment benefits.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better if the countless millions of pounds earmarked by the Department of Social Welfare for unemployment benefit and assistance were devoted to improving our one and only thriving industry?  Would it not be better to see another 100,000 people taken off <Col N="397" /> the dole queues and employed in the processing of our products?  Would it not be much better if we ensured that this industry was placed on a sound footing rather than having it beg for crumbs at the Government table in order to remain in existence?  I cannot see any sense in a policy of restraint on financial contributions to agriculture.  I maintain that, through proper planning, we can ensure that our farmers can compete effectively with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>The farm installation grants for young farmers were a wonderful innovation. However, I question how many of those grants have been paid; as far as I know, very few.  This means that such farmers' activities are curbed through lack of finance. Take the example of the poultry industry which has been completely neglected.  Over 6,000 people are engaged in that industry here, constituting a considerable impact on endemic employment, particularly in the feed sector in which the poultry industry utilises 14 per cent of the provender milling output.  Our poultry industry is involved mainly in the production of chickens, with poultry accounting for 25 per cent of our total meat production.  We have almost 200 breeding and hatching facilities, including supply farms, the existing 19 processing plants having adequate capacity to handle the current throughput.  The output of broiler chickens amounts to approximately 24 million.</P>
    <P>There is the spectacle within the ACOT authority in Cork of countless numbers of supply farms stretching from Cork city to Mizen Head, to Dursey Head &mdash; the three large peninsulas &mdash; dominating much of the poultry industry. Now we are being told by ACOT and the Department that there will not be a poultry instructress nearer than Cork city to serve those supply farms.  There is no sense in having one poultry instructress to serve that huge territory.  It would be enough for the instructress to drive 80 or 100 miles in the morning and to drive back at night without giving instruction or advice to the supply farms.  These things must be addressed if the industry is to survive.  Our egg production has declined <Col N="398" /> by 50 per cent in the past ten years even though we were told that instruction was being given to poultry producers to expand their production.  Almost 35 per cent of our present egg consumption and 25 per cent of our poultry requirements are imported from Northern Ireland. Surely this is something that can be corrected.</P>
    <P>In relation to bacon products we are only skimming the surface of the markets available to us.  Anybody who takes a trip to the US knows there is a huge demand for Irish bacon products there.  Irish Americans return to the US bringing 10 to 12 lbs of smoked Irish rashers because they cannot get anything like that quality at home, yet we have failed to avail of that market in the US.  In Japan there is a huge opening for Irish bacon.  We are very slow to cash in on these valuable outlets.  There is unlimited demand for a special type of Irish ham in Italy.  We are closing our ears to the demands.  Are we really making an attempt to get agriculture back on its feet or are we impeding progress through lack of funds? We are importing almost 50,000 tonnes of frozen chips per year.  This is a commodity that could be processed here.  We are also importing over 50,000 tonnes of other processed vegetables.  It is amazing that vegetable processing factories here have been closed down.  A chip factory in Donegal was opened in 1981 and closed down a few years afterwards.  It has reopened now under new management but how long it will last is anybody's guess.  Surely a business tycoon with foresight, with the right backing from the Department could run a successful food processing business.</P>
    <P>In Skibbereen a vegetable factory catered for the needs of the area but it was closed down over ten years ago just because the company were too slow to diversify from dehydrated products to deep frozen products.  It is one of the finest processing factories in Europe and with a little bit of modernisation it could be put back into production.  I hope our new Minister for Food who is a constituency colleague of mine will play his part in insisting that that factory be <Col N="399" /> reopened and that we stop the unlimited importation of frozen foods.</P>
    <P>We saw yesterday where a colorado beetle was found in a consignment of imported celery.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan, I would venture to suggest that you are widening the scope of the debate beyond that which is provided for in the proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am only outlining the serious consequences which we could face through importing vegetables. No matter how they are monitored at the port of entry insects such as the colorado beetle can make their way in with serious consequences for our farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, it was in a parsley consignment and everybody knows that parsley can be grown here under glass.  I do not know why the Irish product is not bought but our Minister would want to investigate that and come up with an answer.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude I will compare the incomes of Irish farmers and their European counterparts.  Dutch farmers enjoy incomes at the rate of 250 per cent of the Community average, Belgian farmers 200 per cent of the Community average, Danish farmers almost 225 per cent of the European average, British farmers almost 200 per cent of the Community average, while the income of the Irish farmer is 10 per cent under the average of his European counterpart.  Surely the time is right to give an income lift to Irish farmers.  The agriculture industry will continue both here and in Britain when the last litre of oil is extracted from the Celtic Sea and from the North Sea.  It is most important that we give credence to an industry which should have been given more credence before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the imposition of the charges now envisaged in this Bill will improve the services.  The disadvantaged areas <Col N="400" /> should be exempt from those charges.  It is hard enough for the farmers in the peninsular areas which I represent and in other disadvantaged areas to eke out a living for their wives and families in their small mountain holdings, so a special allowance should be made for these farmers. I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to exempt small farmers from the charges envisaged.</P>
    <P>A lot can be said in favour of the whole system of county committees of agriculture. I became a member of a county committee of agriculture about 25 years ago and saw how such committees worked.  They worked very well in the interests of the farmers, in particular the small farmers.  It is more than ten years since we changed the county committees of agriculture to the ACOT system.  I have yet to be convinced that agriculture has progressed to any great extent since the changeover.</P>
    <P>Instead of taking the agricultural instructor away from the agricultural community and putting him behind a glass panel in an office, I hope any future Minister for Agriculture will ensure that these instructors are out in the field advising farmers on the right type of grass to plant or animals to breed and giving them the advice they so badly need.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister in his wisdom will reintroduce the lime subsidy scheme for small farmers along the western seaboard. There are farmers in my parish who are over 100 miles from the nearest lime kiln.  They are denied the right to add sea sand to their soil because we are told it might interfere with the environmental protection of the area.  In view of the colossal charges being levied on those farmers to apply lime to their land, again I appeal to the Minister to reintroduce the lime subsidy for the farmers in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Ministers of State and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on their appointments. I agree with what Deputy Sheehan said about exemptions from charges for small farmers.  No one likes to talk <Col N="401" /> about imposing charges on farmers or on anybody, but I hope the Minister will see his way to direct ACOT to be selective in the types of charges they impose.  The Minister must approve these charges but he can vary or terminate them in any way and can direct ACOT to do so.  That is very important.  At present farmers have to pay veterinary charges and will have deductions in their grants for farm visits, but this Bill will impose certain charges on them.</P>
      <P>I am not just talking about the £1 million which will be charged for services. There are £1 million in savings and £3 million hopefully to come from the European Social Fund.  I understand the saving will be made by the elimination of scholarships to agricultural colleges.  This is very worrying because those £600 scholarships are availed of by farmers' sons who are coming back to work on the land. Since advisers' travelling will be cut by 25 per cent, this means they must spend more time in their offices.  We want them to be out on the farm helping and advising farmers.  I understand from the ACOT committee in Galway that there is no guarantee that this £3 million will be continued. I hope the Minister in his reply will give some information about the money from the European Social Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned selectivity.  One of the areas to which we are all looking forward with great excitement is the establishment of Bord Glas.  We hope that board will be instrumental in replacing half our horticultural imports.  The board should be helped by bodies like An Foras Talúntais and ACOT.  I would not like to see any producer group being charged fees for that type of advice.  This is an area where we want to see progress. In the past few days we have heard a lot about the importation of parsley and the £87 million worth of horticultural produce which we imported last year. These matters are of concern to this House.  Fianna Fáil are setting up this board to tackle this problem and to try to replace half of these imports by home produced products within five years.  This is a realistic target and this is an area to <Col N="402" /> which we will be devoting a great deal of our time.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the socioeconomic programme for ACOT and we would like to see more people involved in this area.  In Galway we have three advisers, one involved in poultry.  When we are talking about advising farmers, whether it be on horticultural problems, the normal advice they give, or the new socio-economic role, it is important that we have the necessary manpower. Galway is a very large county and the relationship between the adviser and the farmer is very important.  We would not like to see any charges being introduced which would affect that relationship.</P>
    <P>When negotiating price fixing in the EC, I hope the Minister will be able to get money for cattle headage payments. It is very unfair that only parts of County Galway are considered as severely disadvantaged areas.  A road often divides two farms, one farmer getting the headage payments for all his cattle while the other does not qualify.  It is very important that the Minister gets these benefits for all the farmers in my county.</P>
    <P>We have seen from the Estimates prepared by the previous Government that there has been a £5 million cut in the provision for ACOT, that there was no provision for cattle headage payments in the severely handicapped areas, and that there would be a reclassification of existing areas.  I hope the Minister will announce the Government's decision on these matters as soon as possible because these headage payments are not made until the end of the year or even early the following year.  There are farmers in County Galway who have not yet been paid their 1986 grants.  The Minister has a very important job to do when negotiating price fixing at EC level and he should try to get all of County Galway included in the severely handicapped areas scheme to ensure that the cattle headage payments will be paid to all farmers in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the final decision on the levying of these charges during his discussions with ACOT, but he should examine which areas can be exempt and <Col N="403" /> see where he can be selective so that farmers will be helped by the practical and realistic policies the Minister will introduce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Let me first extend my good wishes to you on your election and assure you of my full co-operation.</P>
      <P>I have listened to this discussion this morning with great interest.  I have a particular interest as I am a practising farmer.  I want to say that I am both disappointed and concerned at the introduction of this Bill.  I am disappointed because of the fact that it is a continuation of the stop-go policies which has been the hallmark of agricultural policies since the foundation of the State.  It has been the case that policies of a vote-catching nature that had no long-term future have never been beneficial to the agricultural industry.  Listening to the words of the incoming Taoiseach I had hoped coming into this House this morning that we were going to see a new administration who were going to move so fast that the rest of us would not be able to keep up.  I had hoped the Taoiseach was talking of a forward gear or an overdrive and not of a reverse gear.  It is a reverse decision to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the effect it will have on farmers.  The Bill has been introduced by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, and I wish him well, but we cannot forget that less than six months ago his party were totally opposed to this Bill and rejected it out of hand.  They have now made a U-turn.  The one thing the Minister needs on taking up office at this time is the confidence of the farmers. How can he receive that confidence if he outlines policies which are not going to last longer than six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need in 1987 is a policy which will take us through the next decade. <Col N="404" /> There is a golden opportunity for our farmers in that there is a vast market out there.  People have never been more health conscious and aware of the food they eat.  We have the name and the climate for producing top-quality food. This morning while travelling up from Cavan I heard a news report on research into the Chernobyl disaster which indicated that we were very little affected by the fall-out from that disaster which spread right across Europe.  The results of that research will bear on the minds of people on the Continent and Irish produce will be seen to be clean and healthy.  However, we are not making the most of that fact.</P>
    <P>Very constructive and worthwhile speeches were made here this morning when all aspects of what is involved were discussed but we are not getting down to doing anything about it.  We have been talking about it for the past 25 years. There are many problems and I am aware of them.  The Minister indicated &mdash; I hope he is wrong and not serious &mdash; that the funds to pay for the headage payments in the newly disadvantaged areas may not be forthcoming.  That has caused great concern in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. At very short notice, more than 600 farmers packed a hall in Cootehill on Monday night last.  They did so because they were concerned about their future.  The outgoing Government and the outgoing Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, gave a commitment that those payments were going to be made this year and they were looking forward to them.  At that meeting one could not fail to be affected by the pleas from the heart of small family farmers in desperation.</P>
    <P>People talk about taxing farmers and about farmers reneging on their tax commitments. No farmer wants to renege.  It has never been his policy to renege on his commitments.  He cannot afford to meet his commitments.  On the issue of farmer taxation, as a practising farmer I believe that every farmer should make a return.  There should be simplified farm accounts which would show clearly that the income that many people through <Col N="405" /> ignorance, believe, is out there is not there.  Many farmers live far below the breadline.</P>
    <P>When a farmer of 35 to 40 acres who has a family, who has pride and decency, stands up in public and states that he cannot afford to put bread on the table things are at a low ebb.  When a farmer stands up in a group of his neighbours and states that he had to go to the manager of his local co-op to ask for money to carry him over the spring months, things are at a low ebb.  That is the reality.  That is only one side of the small family farm.  I accept that there are many big farmers and commercial farmers who are doing exceptionally well.  They got off the mark in time and were able to receive the full benefit of our entry into the EC.  They were able to develop when times were good but there are many farmers who were not in that position.  There is a category of farmer in between who borrowed extensively and who is now left sitting with those borrowings and who cannot meet the repayments.  These people are being hounded by the lending institutions. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>I recall that back in the mid-fifties &mdash; it is important to refer to this &mdash; a land reclamation scheme was introduced by the late James Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, as a result of the Marshall Aid moneys.  That was an outstanding scheme and was years ahead of its time.  Unfortunately, because of political considerations and stop-go policies that scheme was scrapped.  Had it been allowed to continue we would have been well prepared for the advent of the EC.  Unfortunately, we were not.  We have ground to make up and we can still do it.  What we need is advice but that advice will not be available to the farmers I am talking about unless it is freely available. There is no point in talking about charges because they will not be able to pay them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill does not state clearly who will and will not have to pay.  It may very well be that the categories of farmers I am talking about will not be expected to pay but that is not <Col N="406" /> spelled out.  Farmers have enough charges to pay.  There are enough levies imposed on them.  Any further charges will turn them off completely.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to ACOT and the role of the agricultural instructors.  They have carried out outstanding work despite the restrictions placed on them and despite the shortages of staff.  This has resulted in their spending most of their day in their offices doing paperwork when they should be out on the fields. That is not what they are qualified for. They should be out meeting the farmers and these visits should be ongoing when a relationship will be built up.  An occasional visit is not sufficient.  Because of the desperate position they are in, farmers need these regular visits from the instructors to advise and show them the other areas they can turn to, such as horticulture, rabbit and mushroom production, all of which have been referred to in this debate.  There is plenty of scope but farmers need advice and confidence. They are sadly lacking in confidence at present.</P>
    <P>They are the main points of the case I would like to make.  I would like to refer to the problem of milk production and the milk cessation scheme.  On the one hand, farmers have applied for the scheme but did not qualify while, on the other hand young farmers who are anxious to increase their milk production cannot get hold of this unwanted quota which is lying unused.  I had hoped that today we would have got a restructuring programme off the ground which would enable those farmers to buy or lease that quota.  That quota cannot be allowed to lie idle.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his party were strongly opposed to this Bill and campaigned in the general election on the basis that those charges would not be introduced.  The effect of his U-turn on the farmers, who are looking to him to lead them will result in a loss of confidence. For that reason, I am strongly opposed to this proposal.  I look forward to more constructive proposals and discussion on the real problems that are facing our farmers at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Tunney on his election as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I know, from previous experience, that he will give fair play and justice to all Members. I should like to thank Deputies who in contributing to the debate extended good wishes to me in my new office.  I expect that support and encouragement will be forthcoming from many areas.  The Bill before us gives the House an opportunity to consider in depth the role of ACOT and the importance of that body as an advisory council looking after the affairs of agriculture.  As one who has been closely identified with agriculture for many years I fully appreciate the importance and commitment of those who have been involved in advisory work with ACOT for a number of years.  They have been a vital cog in the development of our agricultural industry.  They were to the fore when opportunities were presented to us by our entry to the EC. They helped our farmers and provided much needed advice.  Today's debate has served to emphasise the importance of advice, research and education in the agricultural aector.  It is vital that priority is given to those areas.  There is a need at all times to encourage better management practices and techniques.  We are living in an ever-changing world when the demands and requirements of the market place ordain that the primary producers in agriculture should be fully conversant with the needs of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole emphasis in the years prior to and shortly after we joined the EC was on increased production but, unfortunately, the introduction of the quota system in the dairy sector, and other inhibitions on production, have posed a threat to farmers.  Many farm enterprises are at saturation point.  Many of those involved in dairying who made a considerable investment down the years now find that their capacity to produce more is restricted.  The importance of ACOT personnel giving the correct advice on the direction farmers should go in those circumstances cannot be over-emphasised. Management decisions taken by <Col N="408" /> farmers now will decide their position in years to come.  There must be a continuing search for alternative farm enterprises. Some Deputies in referring to the potential for alternative enterprises for those involved in agriculture stressed that the help of ACOT instructors will be vital in that regard.</P>
    <P>The day of making a quick decision to move into an alternative enterprise and regarding it as a solution to the economic problems of farmers has gone.  We need forward planning and good management. Wise decisions will have to be taken to ensure that farmers know where they are going.  They must be satisfied that there is a market for their produce.  I have said many times from the far side of the House that the farm structure we have has in many ways inhibited the development of our agricultural industry.  The average farm size has meant that the family farm is not able to give a sufficient return to support the family farm unit.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that there has been a considerable movement towards part-time farming.  That trend prevails throughout the Community and it appears that it will continue in the future. That change raises the question of the type of part-time employment that will be available for part-time farmers.  Such employment should dovetail with the type of part-time farming practised here but it is not easy to come by.</P>
    <P>I hope that ACOT personnel, AFT and other organisations concerned with agricultural development, apply themselves diligently to identifying prospects in this area.  The importance of ACOT disseminating information on the progress of various R and D programmes carried out by AFT has been stressed by many Members.  We have reached the stage where the approach in regard to agricultural commodities will have to change quickly.  We must identify new products to be marketed here, in Europe and further afield.  It is important that ACOT advisers help farmers in the marketing of such produce.</P>
    <P>Marketing and organisation have been the Achilles heel of the agricultural industry for many years.  The whole thrust and <Col N="409" /> emphasis has been on production.  The emphasis today should be on marketing and organisation.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the dilemma faced by the horticultural industry. Commentators have been focusing, rightly, on the volume of imports in that area.  Earlier this week we heard of the colorado beetle finding its way to this country in a consignment of imported parsley.  That insect could pose a serious threat to agriculture, particularly to our potato crop and plant health.  I should like to deal with the restriction on farm enterprises and the implications that poses for downstream employment potential.  Our dairy plants and creameries, because of the reduced output of milk and cattle numbers, will find themselves under-utilised, posing serious problems for those who invested heavily when times were better.  The reduction in the number of dairy cows will, in turn, lead to a decrease in the number of calves born.  That will have an impact on the number of cattle going through the system which will mean that our meat plants will not get an adequate supply.  I have no doubt that employment in that sector will be reduced.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to <Col N="411" /> know if the Minister considers it desirable that Irish Life should be privatised.

I can say that exploratory discussions about its future have taken place with the company at official level in recent months.  No conclusions have been reached and no commitments have been entered into.  Given the suggested benefits from a sale of State shares, it is important that the matter be fully explored.  The Deputy refers to a statement by the managing director.  A number of statements were made and it will be seen that there was no immediate hurry in regard to these questions.

The decentralisation programme initiated by Fianna Fáil in October 1980 was cancelled by the previous administration in the context of the 1983 Estimates debate. This Government continue to believe in the efficacy of decentralisation in the promotion of the above objectives. However, in view of the time that has elapsed since our original initiative, I have asked that a thorough examination of all the factors relating to this issue be carried out.

      <P>Speaking personally, I have to say to the Deputy that I would <Col N="425" /> look at it in the opposite way.  The numbers would have to be reduced.  I am going to take the opportunity at this stage arising from these two questions to say that we have had embargoes and replacements of one in three, and the difference between 1981 and 1987 is we have still the same numbers in the public service, 187,000 costing £2,840 million.</P>

Will he confirm that these indicate that while there may not have been a reduction in the public service there was a reduction in the Civil Service? Further will he confirm that it was only to the Civil Service that the embargo applied in its full form?  In that context would he confirm that it was effective and that, furthermore, the reduction in numbers in the Irish Civil Service over the period was considerably greater than the number reduced in the Civil Service in the UK by proportion?  Furthermore, will the review he is undertaking with regard to Civil Service numbers be such <Col N="426" /> as to ensure that there will be no need to make any increase in the Estimates provision for pay during 1987 as provided for in the Estimates already published?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to promote legislation to modify the pension terms of ministerial office-holders.  The arrangement under which members of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament who cease to be ministerial office-holders but draw their ministerial pensions in addition to their parliamentary allowances was made by legislation, that is, in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Office Act, 1938, following acceptance of the relevant recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into ministerial and other salaries, etc. Serving office-holders do not receive pensions in respect of offices which they previously held.  The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the public sector, which is an independent body has, in its reports of 1972 and 1979, taken the level of all benefits available, including superannuation, and the conditions under which they are paid into account in making recommendations on the remuneration of office-holders.  I have no doubt that they will again have regard to <Col N="430" /> the superannuation provisions of office-holders in the course of their present review.</P>

      <P>I should like the opportunity of replying to a couple of the points made last.  There are two things which need to be said here.  First, the review body has two members of the Labour Court on it.  Secondly, it is well known by quite a number of the membership of this House that everybody who is honoured to perform in a ministerial capacity must sever any links he or she has in any other capacity.  That may last for a short term or a long term; nobody ever knows.  That factor is not taken into account.  It is disappointing, as Deputy Mitchell has said, to find Deputies and a former Minister putting forward such <Col N="434" /> ideas.  These matters were dealt with by independent review bodies before I was born, more recently in 1972 and 1979 and at the present time.  That should be taken into account by the Deputies in this House and then, by their statements, the public at large would really know what the true position is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>During yesterday's contribution I outlined the seriousness of the problem of air pollution throughout the country and more particularly in our capital city and the devastation that is occurring in many different aspects.  I will now present to the Minister a programme of various steps he could take immediately which would alleviate the problem to a very great extent and which could be enforced through this legislation.  I expressed my reservations about the fact that it was merely enabling legislation. The Minister through this legislation can perhaps indicate that it is his intention, unless immediate action is taken by local authorities, to take alternative steps to make sure the quality of our air improves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first step I propose is that there should be a declaration of intent that the capital city be declared a smokeless zone. This can be done within a fixed period.  I <Col N="455" /> suggest one year from now, which will enable preparations to be made and old ways to change.  A year is a long time.  I would like to see a smokeless zone declared now but we have to envisage some period to adapt to the new system. Having made that declaration that Dublin will be a complete smokeless zone, this system should be allowed to operate for two to three years to assess how the improvement in the environment took place.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a system of smog warnings, or a smog alert system, should be coupled with the weather forecast programmes in much the same way as other warnings are given in relation to the pollen count for allergies and so on in the daily papers. There is no reason why a smog alert system could not be instigated straightaway. It has been reported that it is not possible to do this because the equipment is not readily available and that we have to wait for two or three months before the environmental health section of Dublin Corporation can produce the figures. This is not correct.  The equipment is available.  A continuous smoke particle monitoring system which is in use in Germany, Belgium and in Holland is available. The cost of this smog warning device in 1985 terms is of the order of between £15,000 and £20,000 per unit to give a continuous read-out of the smog situation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a piece of German equipment which I should like to read into the record &mdash;a switchable measuring range for continuous smog warning, the Beta-Staubmeter F703 Verewa.  That equipment could be used and would be welcomed by people who are very sensitive to smog.  It would be an advantage if, in times of temperature inversion when this is a very acute problem, people could switch to an alternative system, such as bottled gas heating or electric fires.  I know they are slightly more costly but during those particular times this switch over could be made.</P>
    <P>Another area in which I would like to see the Minister engaged over the next 12 months or so is in an in depth programme <Col N="456" /> of education, primarily through the schools.  I do not mean that older generations are lost generations, but it is very important to at least instil ideas in young minds that in future the environment will be theirs, as well as ours, and that systems can be used to protect the quality of air.  This can be done through the local authorities or the Department of Education.  There are many systems which can be used, such as smokeless fuels, the sulphur recovery grate system and so on.</P>
    <P>The fourth area is the investigation of the development of the anthracite mines in Tipperary.  Ironically last year these mines ran into difficulty and were closed down, perhaps due to overseas rather than national interests.  Let us face facts. We are parochial in our approach to this problem and if the anthracite is present as an indigenous fuel, it should be used and the Department should address themselves to developing those mines and ensuring a ready availability of anthracite.  I would even go so far as to say that an investigation could be carried out into providing an incentive scheme to encourage people to burn anthracite and smokeless fuels.</P>
    <P>The fifth point I wish to mention deals with the development of clean air in the Moneypoint installation.  As I said yesterday, sulphur recovery equipment should be installed at that plant without delay.  Any policy, particularly on the environment, must seek a balance between the encouragement of economic growth or progress and the preservation and the delicacy of our natural environment. Modern growth entails new products and a greater volume of waste matter, be it air or any kind of waste matter in the wake of progress in industrialisation, but at the same time there is a growing demand for good living conditions and a good quality environment.</P>
    <P>The aim of any legislation must be to ensure that the established agencies of the State are utilised to their maximum ensuring that, within the ability of society to pay, the environment is protected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and look forward <Col N="457" /> to its speedy implementation in the most efficient manner.  I hope this practical legislation will force Irish society into making the necessary changes as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this is European Environment Year, it is appropriate that the Dáil should be debating a Bill to introduce measures aimed at tackling the hazards of air pollution.  The heart of this problem so far as Ireland is concerned is the smoke and smog pollution in the Dublin area especially.  In yesterday's newspaper the alarming extent of this problem was highlighted.  According to the environmental health officers of Dublin Corporation there were record concentrations of smoke and smog in the capital on 31 January last which were five times higher than the EC accepted levels. In Ballyfermot alone smog levels exceeded the EC standards on no fewer than 30 days in the four months November to February, and between 12 and 18 February this year smog concentrations were above the EC limits.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the EC standards are endorsed by the World Health Organisation as the level beyond which human health is damaged.  If such smog levels persist for a number of days they can result in serious respiratory problems, and sometimes death.  These tragic consequences were already borne out in the case of Dublin according to the research by Doctor Geoffrey Dean in 1981.  Mortality among Dubliners from air pollution related diseases was then running at up to three times the national average and it is clear from the Dublin Corporation data that the situation has worsened considerably since then.  That will give the House some idea of the seriousness of the smog problem in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which must be borne in mind is that Dublin Corporation's monitoring of the position is seriously deficient and, therefore, is likely to greatly understate the true extent of the problem. There are 11 monitoring stations in the capital, but most are situated on the south side and are not concentrated in the <Col N="458" /> highly populated suburbs of Coolock and Artane.  Given that over 80 per cent of the smoke emissions in Dublin come from households burning solid fuels, it is obvious that the real test of the Air Pollution Bill now before the House is how it proposes to deal with this specific issue and, if we do not confront this issue, we are simply waffling and ignoring the central problem.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, Part IV of this Bill addresses this issue.  It provides for the making of special control areas by local authorities where regulations can be applied, determining what kind of fuels can or cannot be used by householders, and what kind of fireplaces they must use. In theory that is fine.  All we have to do is to adopt special control areas in the affected parts of Dublin, ban various forms of coal and fireplaces and legally require householders to transfer to smokeless fuels.  At a stroke the problem can be solved in theory, but what is the reality?  The reality is that in some of the worst affected areas householders cannot afford to convert fireplaces and switch to smokeless fuels.  That brings us to the nub of this debate and whether this Bill will remain a dead letter with pious aspirations or whether it represents a serious intent by this Government to tackle the deadly smog problem in Dublin.  What I want to know, what the Progressive Democrats want to know and what the householders of Dublin want to know is what measures the Government will take to ensure that if the special control areas are adopted, they can be made to work in areas where householders themselves cannot afford to fund such measures.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister in his speech yesterday very carefully omitted to indicate the Government's intention in this regard but there is a section in the Bill, section 45, which enables the Minister for the Environment to grant financial assistance &ldquo;in relation to the whole or any part of the cost incurred by the owner or occupier of a premises situated within a special control area&rdquo;.  I am asking the Minister to indicate the Government's intentions on this key issue <Col N="459" /> in his reply to this debate.  Have his Department done any cost benefit analysis of the value of a grant scheme to enable smokeless zones to be established and the parallel savings in health costs that could result?</P>
    <P>That is why I queried the possibility earlier of this Bill being nothing more than a pious aspiration.  It is impossible for any Deputy or for the general public to assess the true merit of this Bill without a clear indication of how the Government propose to respond to the central issue. Will finance be provided to enable householders who cannot afford to do so to comply with the conditions necessary for smokeless zones?  If such a scheme is envisaged the Minister must spell it out to the House.  If none is planned I challenge the Minister to show how this Bill amounts to anything other than a pious platitude.  This House deserves to know what are the full intentions of the Government in this matter.  There has been already too much unplanned public expenditure and there are too many laudable Acts that remain dead letters.</P>
    <P>Neither must we muddle into increased public spending without making full account to the taxpayers of this country. The Progressive Democrats are determined to scrutinise every item of public spending coming before this House. That, too, is why I raise this very real issue of the possible cost arising from this Bill and of how the Government intend to face up to its implications.  This is an issue as important as the question of tackling air pollution.  Section 45 of the Bill raises the possibility of a new Government expenditure programme being created. The House must be fully aware of the implications of this.  We must not simply stumble into increased public spending.  That was the politics of the past and the Progressive Democrats are determined to tackle it.  There is a clear obligation on the Government and on the Minister to spell out in cost terms and in benefit terms where this Bill may be leading us.</P>

      <P>Deputy <Col N="460" /> Gibbons, congratulations on your maiden speech.  In welcoming Deputy Kitt I offer him my congratulations also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leatsa, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, agus freisin don Áire Stáit nua, Gearóid Ó Conghaile.  It gives me great satisfaction to speak, in this my maiden speech, on the Air Pollution Bill as this is a matter of particular concern to me.</P>
      <P>Pollution has no frontiers.  The whole issue of acid rain and the disaster of Chernobyl gives an immediacy and particular relevance to this Bill.  Fianna Fáil's track record on this issue is very positive.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, at the 1986 Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis said that we must avoid &ldquo;detrimental planning decisions, harmful development and ensure the preservation of our unique environmental heritage&rdquo;.  This Bill must be part of an integrated attack on pollution which must embrace air, sea, river and sound pollution set in the context of a creative and forward looking policy on conservation as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the key role of environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Earthwatch, An Taisce and the Irish Clean Air Group.  These groups, among others, are no longer operating on the periphery but are in the mainstream of public concern with the whole question of the environment.  Before commenting on the details of the Bill I would like to focus on the cost of pollution, in particular the health cost.  A very detailed paper by Dr. Dale Tussing in a recent analysis of Irish medical care resources points out that, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Car and bus emission, the burning of rubbish and the use of soft fuels have made Dublin as polluted as most of the highly industrialised cities in Britain and Europe despite the fact that we are not an industrial country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These environmental conditions have been linked directly to the high incidences of cancer and heart disease which are two of the principal causes of mortality in Ireland.  Even more striking are the <Col N="461" /> high instances of death in Ireland from respiratory diseases, mainly pneumonia and bronchitis which are well above European average levels.  This reflects not only the effects of pollution but also, among other things, the prevailing climatic conditions which is all the more reason for us to face up squarely to this major threat to human life.</P>
    <P>A striking feature of morbidity statistics is that a large number of respiratory conditions have a much higher prevelance in Dublin as compared with rural areas.  In effect, Dublin is being discriminated against through our failure to control pollution.  Our historic buildings are being destroyed.  Pollution is killing not just our heritage but our people.  The previous speaker referred to the figures released on Monday by Dublin Corporation concerning the city's smog problem this winter and which support this viewpoint, with the highest concentration of smoke ever recorded in Dublin occurring in Ballyfermot on 31 January when it reached a figure of over 1,400 micrograms per cubic metre, more than five times the EC daily limit of 250 micrograms.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to the dangers of vehicle pollution, in particular leaded petrol.  Lead has been added to petrol since the twenties as a means of boosting octane.  Because lead is corrosive and abrasive, however, other components are added at the same time to scavenge it from the engine so that it comes out along with exhaust gasses.  As a result of this, roughly 75 per cent of lead in petrol is subsequently spewed into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>There health environmental hazards are associated with lead.  First, when inhaled or ingested by people it can accummulate to levels high enough to cause toxic effects including neurological disorders such as brain damage.  At lower levels of concentration it can still produce hyperactivity in children &mdash; this was confirmed to me by many of my teaching colleagues &mdash; and high blood pressure in adult males.  Secondly, the scavenger compounds which I referred to are extremely toxic and thus represent a risk <Col N="462" /> during their distribution and handling even before being mixed with petrol and combusted.  Thirdly, if leaded instead of unleaded fuel is used in a car which is fitted with a convertor designed to reduce emissions of other pollutants the lead additives react with the catalyst system.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years these dangers have caused most industrial countries to lower the limits of the amounts of lead that can be added to petrol.  The availability of alternative ways to boost octane and the growing body of knowledge of the dangers of lead have kept Governments under pressure, and rightly so, to reduce permitted concentrations of lead in petrol and to require the introduction of unleaded petrol.  The EC, for example, decided in March 1984 to require all member states to make lead free petrol widely available by the beginning of 1989. Yet, other countries have gone further and we must have regard to these.</P>
    <P>In Japan, for example, very few people still use leaded petrol, while in the United States the permitted concentration of leaded petrol has been reduced to 0.026 grams per litre.  This compares with a range of 0.15 to 0.4 grams per litre in the EC.  In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency are now considering a complete ban on leaded petrol by next year.  We have to emphasise again the dangers that arise to a healthy environment through the use of leaded petrol and to ask ourselves seriously whether we have gone far enough in meeting these concerns.</P>
    <P>What we have talked about are the costs in terms of health.  We have to be concerned about the very high expenditures on health that arise through our failure to control air pollution.  Those expenditures in terms of hospital care, disability benefits and associated costs run into millions of pounds each year, another strong argument for action.  A third cost of pollution which we have to consider very seriously is the damage to our natural resources and to tourism.  In a recent lecture a leading German industrialist pointed out that forests in County Wicklow were showing pronounced signs of sick forest syndrome; in other words, <Col N="463" /> he was stating that acid rain was devastating one of our chief natural resources.  We have to examine very seriously the effects of air pollution on our tourism industry.  Ireland has an image of an environmentally pure country and that helps attract thousands of tourists here annually.  We should market that image but our failure to control pollution means that we are directly undermining that major resource.</P>
    <P>The next area I should like to look at is the experience of other countries in controlling pollution and to see if there are any lessons we can learn from them. My research suggests that the Scandinavian countries have learned important lessons which we should look at seriously.  For example, in Finland sulphur emissions are required to be cut by 50 per cent by 1993 and the Finnish Government are ensuring that lead-free petrol will be cheaper than leaded petrol. I commend that suggestion to the Minister for Finance.  The Norwegian Minister responsible for the environment at a recent conference, argued strongly that cutting down dramatically on exhaust emissions was essential for health and environmental reasons.  He said that his Government were taking strong action in that area.  The Italian experience is interesting.  The pollution policy in that country is built around a desire to control traffic.  Traffic needs planning, like any other aspect of our environment, if we are serious about controlling air pollution. A walk through Dublin on any day of the week will indicate the serious effects of the uncontrolled growth of traffic.  Our policy should address the consequences of the growth of traffic.</P>
    <P>The Ministers responsible for the environment in industrial countries issued a declaration one year ago in which they recognised that &ldquo;the responsibilities and need for action concerning environmental protection do not end at national frontiers&rdquo;.  Those Ministers confirmed the need to increase international co-operation in addressing environmental problems of a global or regional character, <Col N="464" /> especially those which impact on neighbouring countries.  Our small country is particularly vulnerable to the effects of pollution from neighbouring countries. In this regard I should like to draw attention to nuclear plants in Britain.  The environmental Ministers in their declaration pledged all industrial countries, including Ireland, to achieve &ldquo;through vigorous national policies and international co-operation early effective reductions of emissions of major air pollutants from stationary and mobile sources in order to achieve environmentally acceptable air quality and acid deposition levels and to prevent and combat damage to health and the environment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to look in more detail at the recommendations of those Ministers in regard to the control of air pollution from fossil fuel combustion.  It is important that we understand those recommendations as a back-drop to the legislation before us.  The OECD Council recommended that member countries should pursue policies to control more effectively air pollution resulting from the emission of oxides and nitrogen, hydro-carbons and particle matter.  That organisation suggested that member countries should achieve that objective by an appropriate combination of some or all of the following means: more efficient use of energy; the use of less polluting fossil fuels; stricter control on air pollution emissions and the development of consistent emission control strategies on a regional or national basis. Member countries were asked to actively encourage internationally co-ordinated research and development aimed at a better understanding of atmospheric processes and the effect of air pollution on man and the environment.</P>
    <P>Developments within the EC are of more direct consequence to Ireland since we are constrained by EC directives on pollution and related matters.  The EC Commission recently issued guidelines which recommended that nitrogen oxide be reduced by 30 per cent over the next couple of years.  I recognise that Ireland is one of the low pollutant countries in Europe but it is disturbing that we have <Col N="465" /> found it necessary to seek a derogation from the draft EC Directive on Air Pollution. We are a small country on the receiving end of pollution from other countries and, therefore, we are in a position to play a very constructive role in the formulation of international policies aimed at curbing pollution.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing &mdash; I make this point with some reluctance &mdash; that the ESB have found it necessary to apply for this derogation, although I appreciate the cost constraints which have led them to adopt this position.  The ESB have pointed out that it will cost £70 million to bring the Moneypoint station to EC standards of safe control of air pollution by the installation of desulphurisation equipment.  I understand that involves trickling lime and water down the chimneys of the power stations.  We must ask ourselves if our credibility will not suffer, even allowing for the fact that we are one of the low polluting countries in the EC, if we do not tackle the problem of pollution. We must ask ourselves at what cost in terms of damage to the health of the population and the environment we are prepared to secure cheaper electricity. I leave it to Members to form their own conclusions on this.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on some of the more important provisions of the Bill.  When considering its provisions we must bear in mind that pollution is an international problem.  We must take into consideration efforts made by other countries to tackle pollution.  I recognise the constructive suggestions of An Taisce in their submission on the Bill. They argued that instead of insisting on each local authority having their own scientific staff to monitor air pollution it would be more cost effective to have this work carried out on a regional basis making use of the expertise available in An Foras Forbartha, the IIRS and NBST. I have some sympathy with their concern that the designation of special control areas should be discretionary rather than mandatory.</P>
    <P>We must now show good faith and trust in our local authorities and encourage and assist them in their efforts to tackle <Col N="466" /> this problem, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  I detect from my discussions a widespread awareness of the seriousness of this problem and I have no doubt that local authorities will apply themselves to implementing not only the letter but the spirit of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend good wishes to the Ceann Comhairle on his election to that office.  I know he will carry out his duties with impartiality and justice.  I should like to extend good wishes to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  As a rural Deputy I am sure he is concerned about the environment.  I should like to congratulate the two new Deputies who made their maiden speeches today.  I can recall how nervous I was when making my maiden speech to an almost empty Chamber.  I wish the two Deputies a long and successful career.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, spoke of the urgency and importance of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We all share a sense of disappointment that once again in respect of EC directives Ireland would seem to be lagging behind in some respects.  It is a pity we have not been to the forefront in implementing legislation in accordance with the directives and that once again we have had to be taken to the European Court.</P>
      <P>We have an enormous task keeping our environment healthy and clean for the future.  Sometimes we consider it a disadvantage to be apart from the mainland of Europe, but one of the great advantages we have is the wonderful, wild Atlantic Ocean with nothing to pollute it for 3,000 miles, provided we ensure there is no dumping.  I welcome Deputy Síle de Valera who, I am sure, will be doing her utmost to preserve the west coast.  We have an inbuilt environmental and geographical advantage and I do not think we, as a generation, could live with ourselves if we did not take every precaution to protect our environmental heritage by continuing surveillance and strengthening our legislation, when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who would have believed in the fifties <Col N="467" /> that we could reach a stage where we would be threatened by the same type of health hazards which were experienced in London and other industrial cities in Britain as a result of smog?  I remember being an immigrant in Britain in the fifties and encountering the frightening consequences of smog.  I have a very fresh memory of coming out of the underground into a wall of black where one could not identify the road from the footpath. On feeling a lamp standard I looked up and could not see the light on the top.  It was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.  I know how the pollution from industry, if unchecked, can affect the lives of people.  Citizens in Britain who were suffering from lung problems literally had to wear masks in order to go out into what is commonly known as the &ldquo;fresh air&rdquo;.  The positive side is that the British, when they reached that crisis, introduced the Clean Air Act in 1956.  The results were incredibly positive, to the extent that smog is now spoken about by elderly people like me to a younger generation who have never experienced it.  Happily, in Ireland we have not reached that stage.  The United States has had a Clean Air Act since 1970, to which several amendments were made in 1977.  They have managed to a great extent to stop the pollution of a very beautiful environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, undertook to consider all amendments with a more open mind than usual on Committee Stage.  I will not take up the time of the House on Second Stage and I very much welcome the Minister's promise regarding Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about smog levels in Dublin and other urban areas of Cork, Limerick and elsewhere.  We must never believe that Dublin is Ireland, but what happens in Dublin this year could happen in the rest of the country in the years ahead.  While the problem may seem to be concentrated in Dublin it is a warning of how quickly such problems can build up unless we take precautions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that smoke from domestic sources contributed <Col N="468" /> 79 per cent of the 117,000 tonnes emitted in the State as a whole in 1985. Although the figures for 1987 are not yet available, the Minister and other scientific people who have been evaluating the situation tell us that the figures will be worse.  An incredibly high level of pollution is coming from domestic sources and the combination of smoke and damp must affect our citizens very much.  A great amount of the heavy cloud of smoke that lies over Dublin arises from some of the most densely populated areas where it might not be economically easy to change to more expensive fuels.  If costs are involved, particularly in low income areas, funding must be made available to people.  We will take into consideration as well the situation of elderly people who may get their fuel in small amounts. I was going to say less expensive amounts but in many cases it is more expensive to buy in small quantities.</P>
    <P>We are not unique in having these pollution problems.  When the clean air legislation was introduced in places like London, Birmingham and Manchester they also had high density areas with low income groups and they managed to overcome all these problems.  We have no less capacity for innovation and compassion. Examples from other countries will enable us to deal with the problems arising in the interim period.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to discuss the full effects of the directives from the EC.  He mentioned reducing lead emissions from motor vehicles.  Deputy Kitt referred to the health hazards of such emissions to children, particularly those in the city who play near busy roads.  Their height makes them susceptible to emissions from car and bus exhausts and children of this age should not be exposed to such a hazard.  It has been medically proved that the brains of young children can be affected by these emissions.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that Ireland, with other countries, will be part of the Protocol which will ensure that we will not be invaded by transboundary pollution borne on the wind from other countries.  In Helsinki in 1981, 21 countries <Col N="469" /> undertook to reduce their sulphur emissions by 30 per cent as soon as possible. They are working to ensure that there will be further reductions in that level and hope that more countries will join the Protocol.  I will be referring to this later on and the need for everyone to see this not just in a national or country sense.  Chernobyl has proved that the world is literally a village that can be invaded and even countries that take stringent precautions to keep their environment clean can also be invaded.  This applies to Scandinavia who are still paying a very high price in human, animal and plant terms as a result of polluted air from the nuclear explosion at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill does not deal with radioactive emissions or those connected with the incineration of waste at sea because other legislation, namely the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, and the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, already cover these matters.  In any event the Minister believes that these matters would not be within the field of competence of local authorities.  We are all aware of uninvited pollution, not only from nuclear waste but also from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which is leaking oil off the coast of one of the most beautiful parts of our country, south west Cork.  This was arrogantly dumped there and nobody wants to take responsibility for it.  There is a threat to beaches from which people have physically shovelled tar and saved birds from certain death.  However, that obscene vision is still in front of them and thousands of tonnes of oil are still there.  We must ensure that people who do not take full responsibility for such actions will be penalised in the fullest possible sense and that compensation will be paid.  We are all appalled that such an incident could take place and that no one seems to want to take responsibility for it.  I know that the Taoiseach has already visited the area and I welcome the Government's strong attempts to bring those concerned to justice. I hope that this legislation will prevent such occurrences in future and that it will prevent us from becoming a dumping ground for nuclear waste or oil.  Our independence and neutrality apply to our <Col N="470" /> clear, pure water and we must not allow other countries to pollute it.  We must do this for future generations so that our country will be unpolluted.</P>
    <P>I also share the concern which many people have expressed in relation to the plant at Moneypoint.  It has been alleged by the ESB that it would be too costly for them to put in the essential scrubbers and non-pollutant equipment needed.  I do not accept that.  If such equipment had been basic to the building of Moneypoint in the first place, would it have been as costly as they say?  I am not an expert but I doubt it, as it is always much more expensive to try to improve something when the job is finished.  Other countries in Europe have discovered, to their great distress, that their equipment of 50 or 100 years ago is now irreversible.  We must not allow that to happen here; other countries did it through ignorance but we would be doing it in full awareness of the position which would make it all the more criminal.</P>
    <P>When we talk about cost considerations, what do we mean?  We have a commitment not alone to keep this country as fresh, healthy and clean as possible but to agriculture and tourism which are our two greatest resources. How cost effective is it for the ESB to argue that it is not financially feasible for them to improve Moneypoint when they could be not just polluting a country themselves but setting up a very dangerous precedent by asking for special consideration regardless of this directive?  If the wind was blowing in the wrong direction the whole area of the Burren would be under threat.  This is not just an Irish heritage, it is recognised world wide as being unique.  We would never be forgiven if we allowed the ESB or anybody else to destroy what was laid down thousands of years ago.  We must ensure that this does not happen.  We must give people a sense of the awareness of the shocking &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; behaviour of people who attempt to do that.  I am sure we will come to that again.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the legislation will apply immediately to new industrial plant and licensing, but he says, <Col N="471" /> too &ldquo;Licensing under Part III will also apply to alterations of industrial plant which may materially increase or change emissions and it may be gradually extended to cover existing plant by ministerial regulation&rdquo;.  I have made a passionate plea on Moneypoint but it is there now.  This is an extremely important part of the Minister's powers.  Because of the strict planning regulations that will emerge as a result of the legislation here much of what we might have to examine and ensure is changed could be plant which is in existence already.  That is one of the most important parts of the legislation and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that the need for national standards and guidelines and for central policy direction and co-ordination in air pollution matters has not, however, been overlooked and that the Bill provides the Minister for the Environment with powers to ensure adequate action by any reluctant local authority.  Without indicting any local authority, I think this is a power that the Minister must not alone take on, but must implement if necessary.  We can put the argument that pollution crosses all boundaries with regard to countries; even more does it cross all boundaries with regard to local authority areas.  Where a local authority adhere totally to their planning and to legislation to ensure that their area is living up completely to the environmental laws it is totally unfair that another local authority who might not be so conscientious be allowed to exist beside that area.  Apart from the area itself there are huge implications for people who are conscientiously trying to do the right thing.  The Minister needs those powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill has a flexibility and that amendments may be made to it.  Very often pollution occurs as a result of the speed of scientific development and it is wise of the Minister to include that power.  I would like us to concentrate in the Bill, maybe on Committee Stage, on trying to ensure that we have the legislation and more emphatically the education and awareness within <Col N="472" /> the proper authorities responsible so that if an accident or an incident occurs the responsible bodies are totally trained and prepared for it.  I remember hearing of a rather frightening incident, not of air pollution, where a truck with chemicals in it collided on the Naas carriageway. The chemicals spewed all over the road and there was a delay of about an hour while all kinds of institutions had to be contacted in an effort to find out how such chemicals should be treated.  The people who had to take the time to find that out were very concerned about the fact that a far worse, more tragic accident could have occurred (a) if people had been involved (b) if the wrong treatment had been applied.  A chemical explosion could have occurred.  Therefore, part and parcel of what we are attempting in this area is not just making sure that the legislation will be evaluated and balanced but that it will be controlled to the extent that where an accident or incident occurs anybody who is responsible and in whose jurisdiction it lies will not alone be totally educated to cope with it but will have the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>On the matter of expertise and education, I note that the Minister has referred to the fact that An Bord Pleanála will be the overall board responsible, the body to whom appeals could be made and who could give final decisions.  I applaud the fact that an independent body would do this and that in the complicated, scientific, fast changing technological age we are living in An Bord Pleanála would have within their membership and staff the expertise to enable them to make the right decisions regarding such appeals.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the Geneva Convention and said that EC member states are all party to the Convention and that being part of this Convention gives us access to expertise and learning that we as a small country could not possibly have the resources to attain on our own. For instance, the Norwegian Institute of Air Research is responsible for technical co-ordination and there are two meteorological synthesising centres, again in Scandinavia.  I am glad to note something <Col N="473" /> that I did not know until the Minister said it in his speech, that we because of our geographical position will aid and contribute to the shared information under this Convention.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the Meteorological Service here who with a small staff but a high level of expertise have been contributing to the programme over the years.  I include also in that tribute such institutions as An Foras Forbartha.  I note that further links will probably be set up with them.  We live in a very finely balanced and dangerous world and we in Ireland even on the fringe of the Atlantic are part of it.  We have learned that the only way we will not only survive but, we hope, enjoy the quality of life and environment that we want is to observe our responsibility to preserve it: that must come from shared expertise and shared resources.  Our being part of the larger European and world groups allows us to take advantage of not alone the shared learning, but the shared responsibility, too.</P>
    <P>Let me mention two areas which I am sure we will all be attending to and which will not come within the Bill.  One area some Deputies have mentioned is noise control.  Noise can make life almost unlivable and can lead at times to deafness. Another area which is a pollution of a kind is smells.  We have all been appalled at times at trucks or lorries loaded with offal passing us and they not even covered.  Those of us who come from a rural background and know the importance of agriculture do not object to the transport of such materials but they need a covering and a protection so that people are not paralysed by the stench for about 15 or 30 minutes before and after such transport passes.  That again is a consideration, a sensitivity, a hygiene. Above all it is a control of our environment which we should examine but we are very lax in that respect.</P>
    <P>Let me finish on a positive note.  Many people still regard this country very highly because of the quality of life it offers.  This is something we will try to maintain through this Bill and other measures.  A recent survey was carried <Col N="474" /> out with regard to the relative enjoyment and quality of life in certain countries.  It is good to know that despite our problems and some of the bad image we get abroad Ireland came eighth in choice.  From an affluent point of view, the countries that were ahead of us were the United States and the United Kingdom.  The countries that were ahead of us with regard to enjoyment of life and concern for the environment were the Scandinavian countries.  They achieved that by good planning and at a cost that did not seriously injure them industrially or financially.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House are endeavouring to ensure that what has been achieved in other countries can be achieved here, particularly in a country as beautiful as ours.  It is something that all of us can agree to and work towards on Committee Stage of this Bill and also in other Bills that will come before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I join with my fellow Deputies in congratulating you and wishing you every success.  I also would like to take this opportunity of wishing the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, well in his work.  I would also like to thank Deputy Barnes for her kind remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are discussing such a Bill as this shows that the matters of pollution and conservation are no longer the preserve of a few.  Instead, we have become more mature and responsible in our attitude towards conservation and the hazardous effects of pollution.  We are no longer looking at the short-term effects of that, wanting to put off the evil day of doing something about conservation and the problem of pollution. Instead, we are looking at the major effects, particularly on industry.  I will name an industry directly affected by pollution, that is tourism.  That is something not many people immediately advert to <Col N="475" /> but in a constituency such as County Clare, to which Deputy Barnes already referred, that can boast of unique environmental assets such as the Burren, tourism is of extreme importance.  We must ensure that pollution, from wherever it comes, will not cause problems for that industry in Clare or indeed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There has, of course, been much criticism of the Moneypoint plant and I want to refer to that because it is in my constituency. It causes much concern in the County of Clare and outside it.  There has been much criticism of Moneypoint simply because there are 90,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide emitting from that plant per annum.  To comply with the EC directive, we would need to reduce the sulphur dioxide by 60 per cent, the dust emissions by 40 per cent and oxide of nitrogen by 40 per cent.  In order to install the scrubbers &mdash; I am told the scrubbers that will be needed are the Wellman Lord flu gas desulphurisation equipment &mdash; the ESB estimated that the cost would be about £400 million in 1984 figures.  This would not only cover the imported emission control equipment but would also take into account the associated efficiency losses and operational costs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes rightly said that the matter of pollution should not be put down to terms of cost but, unfortunately, we must be realistic and see the effects of such costs on the day to day running of the country.  The ESB said that if they were to install these scrubbers it could well mean a 20 per cent to 25 per cent increase in electricity costs for the consumer by 1995.  Obviously that is not the solution.  I would hope to see the Minister pushing very strongly for European capital grant aid in this area.  As Deputy Barnes said, the Burren and many other areas of the country that are noted for their unique environment are not just of national interest but are also of European and worldwide interest.  I hope that in the year Europe has designated as the Year of the Environment they will take some action in this regard and will be prepared <Col N="476" /> to give us some capital grant funding with regard to this matter.  That would alleviate much of the cost that may be involved.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the clean technology demonstration programmes.  These programmes are run by the EC on a four yearly basis.  One of them has just been completed.  No less than four Irish programmes were accepted for the last phase of those technology demonstration programmes. I will name them &mdash; if the Minister is interested I hope he will follow this up &mdash; UCD under the direction of Mr. Brendan Keegan, the project leader, were granted aid to look into a system for monitoring the seabed for pollution using computers; Professor Richard from Trinity got funding to look into the uses of leaf yeast for testing air quality; Mr. Hegarty, the project leader of Dublin Corporation, also got funding for air pollution; the Agricultural Institute were also in receipt of funding in Moore Park in Cork.</P>
    <P>The basic philosophy of this demonstration programme is, of course, to cut down on pollution.  I have been told that new regulations are being proposed at the moment in the hope that further phases of these programmes may be brought in.  If so, I suggest that the Department of the Environment nominate somebody from the National Board of Science and Technology to sit on the advisory board.  In the hope that the second phase of these demonstration programmes goes ahead by the EC, I hope that the ESB research institutions, colleges and the Department of the Environment will get together to formulate proposals.  They could be considered for submission for these demonstration programmes so that we could find some solution in terms of research.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be glad to hear that the European institutions under this programme will fund the programmes by 30 per cent.  We hope that if the submissions that are sent in are accepted, at least we will have some direction or policy on this matter.  When I talk about <Col N="477" /> policy I am talking about a policy from the ESB and research institutions so that the unique qualities of the Burren in County Clare in particular can be preserved.</P>
    <P>Once these submissions are accepted and there is agreement among the authorities on their approach, I would hope that the Minister would look further for capital grant aid towards the installation of scrubbers and towards making the many other changes that are needed in our generating plants to ensure a discontinuance of the great hazard of pollution. I stress that it is too easy to criticise a plant such as Moneypoint which has been a tremendous asset to the constituency of Clare.  I hope the European Community would have a very strong part to play in granting aid direct to Moneypoint in order to solve the many problems that could arise.</P>

      <P>As every speaker has already said, this Bill is very welcome. There is inclined to be some repetition in the debate because there is a certain amount one cay say on the subject and that is it.  It is heartening that so many Deputies are standing up to say their piece, even if it is repetitive, because this is such an important issue and such an important Bill.  I make no apologies for repeating much of what has been said previously and I doubt if anybody else would.</P>
      <P>We have more information about the Dublin conditions.  I do not have the required information about Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway or rural areas. I do not have the information about the particular industries in rural areas which may be causing local problems.  Statistics should be available for every town in the country.  There should be monitoring stations everywhere.  There should be far more stations in Dublin.  When I raised this question at a meeting in Dublin on Monday, the systems manager asked did I want them to have stations in every parish in Dublin.  Of course, that is the answer.  Why not have a monitoring station in every parish?</P>

      <P>One never knows. There may be pollution in local towns in Mayo that are not being monitored.  In particular kinds of weather the smoke will lie exactly where it rises.  In even a small town one can have a concentration of pollutants which are not being monitored.</P>
      <P>In Dublin all one need do is look at the older buildings, those of which we are most proud, to see the manner in which they are decaying before our eyes.  It is bad enough to see limestone and Portland stone being damaged, but granite which we thought was perennial and would last for thousands of years is disappearing before our eyes also.  The Bank of Ireland could afford to do a very expensive and long job which was very welcome but there are not many other organisations which could afford to do so.  I understand that the authorities of Trinity College are very worried about their buildings which are well over 200 years old &mdash; the manner in which they are deteriorating and the huge cost of endeavouring to restore them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One need only go as far as Stepaside or the Pine Forest and look down on the city.  At times of calm, cold weather one will see the enormous pall of yellowish brown smoke right across the city of Dublin.  It used to be known as smog. Deputy Barnes referred to the problem of smog in London but it was experienced in Dublin also.  In the forties I remember three continuous days when you could hardly walk through Dublin without putting your hands in front of you.  We are back to a crisis situation again.  There was a slight fall in the figures from 1979 but certainly it has been rising since the mid seventies.  The figures released through a Dublin Corporation report show that the level of air pollution increased by 50 per cent in one year alone, from the winter of 1982-83 to that of 1983-84.  The annual smoke emissions per square kilometre in <Col N="479" /> Dublin are six times the level of those in London.  We all remember how bad the problem was in London, but there a clean air Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>The figures for Dublin released this week show that an already bad picture has got steadily worse.  It is no exaggeration to say that we are now at crisis point.  Several city monitoring stations have recorded smoke levels far in excess of the EC limit of 250 micrograms per cubic metre, a figure which is also accepted by the World Health Organisation. It is the level at which health can be damaged, particularly if it must be endured for a period of time.  It is generally accepted that exposure to over that level of 250 micrograms per cubic metre can lead to respiratory problems and even death.  In the light of this, the figures produced by Dublin Corporation are quite frightening.  One of the highest levels of smoke ever recorded in the city was registered in Ballyfermot, my constituency, at 1,429 micrograms per cubic metre.  That is more than five times the level beyond which the EC recommend that one should not go.  On the same day in Crumlin, the level was almost as bad at 1,242 micrograms per cubic metre.</P>
    <P>In Ballyfermot the smog levels were exceeded on no less than 30 days in four months.  The EC say that its limit of 250 micrograms per cubic metre should not be exceeded on more than seven days in a whole year.  In Ballyfermot these levels were exceeded on three days in November 1986, six days in December 1986, nine days in January 1987 and 12 days in February, making a total of 30 days in a four month period.</P>
    <P>The next highest level to Ballyfermot was registered in Cabra where the level was exceeded on 15 days in the four month period.  The EC also says that the value of 250 micrograms per cubic metre should not be exceeded on more than any three consecutive days at a station.  After that, it is even more serious for health. That occurred in Dublin at four different stations.  In Mountjoy Square it was exceeded on four consecutive days in February, from 12 to 15 February.  That <Col N="480" /> is the north inner city area.  In the south inner city area.  Herbert Street, it was exceeded on four consecutive days and in Crumlin also on four consecutive days. As far as Ballyfermot was concerned, it was exceeded on seven consecutive days in February, 12 to 18 February, inclusive.</P>
    <P>These reports come to us monthly.  I have asked Dublin Corporation constantly &mdash; the figures are very bad all over the city &mdash; why are they consistently much worse in Ballyfermot than in any other monitoring station in Dublin?  Of 11 monitoring stations Ballyfermot has been consistently way above the others in Dublin.  For instance, in February the median in Ballyfermot was 252 microgrammes per cubic metre as against 116 in February 1986, more than doubled in the year.  The next highest &mdash; which of course is excessively high &mdash; was Cabra where the median was 165 microgrammes per cubic metre for the month of February 1987 as against February 1986. Therefore it will be seen that consistently Ballyfermot has been 60 per cent or 40 per cent higher than the next highest level.  The last time I posed that question to Dublin Corporation &mdash; I think in January last &mdash; I was told it was an atmospheric problem, that the wind levels were not as high in Ballyfermot as on the north side.  That was a unique meteorological position.  It would lead one to believe that people from all over the world would be coming to see Ballyfermot, that unique meteorological phenomenon where wind levels in one area of Dublin ceased.  While all around they were gushing all over the place, clearing away the smoke, for some reason they were quite static in Ballyfermot. That is the type of answer one receives when one poses such questions.  There must be a specific answer that no scientist or anybody else has yet produced for this extraordinary phenomenon in Ballyfermot as compared with other areas.</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out there is no monitoring station in Finglas, the other side of the river from Ballyfermot, with the same concentration of houses and so on.  The levels must be as high there.  Neither is there any monitoring <Col N="481" /> station in Kilbarrack, Coolock or in many other areas on the north side.  Presumably the same position obtains in many other areas, which is absolutely appalling.  We do not know how many people die as a result of these levels.  Apropos the figures for February of this year two good friends of mine have been in hospital for the past two weeks with respiratory problems. How many people have died as a result we do not know.</P>
    <P>There was an article in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in October 1984 which produced chilling evidence of the link between air pollution and deaths from respiratory problems.  The article was written by Doctors Ian Kelly and Luke Clancy of the Trinity College Medical School showing that excessive air pollution and sub-zero temperatures were responsible for doubling the number of deaths in St. James's Hospital in Dublin in January 1982.  According to a study carried out there were 120 deaths at the hospital in January 1982 compared with a monthly average of 54 and a January mean of 64.  Between January 14 and January 20 of that year there were 39 deaths.  During that week exceptionally higher levels of air pollution were recorded in Dublin.  There were high and static concentrations of pollutants in the area around St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Of the 120 deaths in January 55 per cent were as a result of respiratory problems. The average age of those who died was 77.  In that month no bacteriological or viral epidemic occurred.  The high levels of pollution during that week in January 1982 were caused by fog being trapped under a blanket of cold air as a result of calm, cold weather.  That is when smoke levels are concentrated downwards in one area.  It occurred in January and February of this year and again in early March.  It can happen in any town in Ireland, in certain atmospheric conditions when smoke is trapped under a blanket of cold air.</P>
    <P>The authors of that article say that the effects of a rise in air pollution have been well established, that these have been demonstrated by an increase in the <Col N="482" /> number of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, increases in sickness absence benefit, increases in hospital bed demand and, most important, by increases in mortality among patients already suffering from chronic respiratory disease.  They say that the young and elderly are among those most vulnerable to those adverse effects.  While it is not fully understood how air pollution causes death in those with severe respiratory disease, the authors say that reports suggest that harmful effects are associated with particles in the air and, to a lesser extent, sodium dioxide.</P>
    <P>People, quite rightly, have been very concerned about the number of recent casualties arising from gas explosions. But a greater number die every single winter as a result of the appalling levels of air pollution in this city without there being any fuss, any attention being paid to them by anybody other than their immediate families and friends.</P>
    <P>There was a time when environmental issues were regarded largely as the interest of the middle class or well-off only.  Over the years there has been a growing awareness that the protection and preservation of a healthy, clean environment are matters of concern to all.  It is significant that the areas in which the highest levels of air pollution have been consistently recorded in Dublin have been working class areas like Ballyfermot, Crumlin and Cabra.  It will be seen that the working class has more to gain than anyone else from a clean and healthy environment.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill and hope its provisions will have the desired results.  Of course, the three main elements contributing to pollution in the air are domestic fires, pollution from industrial concerns and from motor vehicles.  Quite rightly domestic coal fires have been identified as the key element of the problem. Smoke from the chimneys of dwellinghouses and flats is responsible for 81 per cent of the total smoke load &mdash; approximately 16,000 tonnes per annum &mdash; emitted in the Dublin area.  Three quarters of domestic smoke emissions derive from the burning of household <Col N="483" /> coal which generally are discharged through relatively low chimneys.  It is no coincidence that the air pollution in Dublin increased as the volume of coal sales shot up.  Coal sales went down during the early seventies to a minimum equivalent to 430,000 tonnes of oil equivalent. By 1978 it had risen to 551,000 tonnes of oil equivalent and, by 1982, it had shot up as far as 869,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to encourage householders to transfer from coal to smokeless fuels through the creation of special control areas, an aim much to be welcomed.  The first thing that must be done is to increase the number of monitoring stations in order to identify areas which should be categorised as special control areas.  The Bill provides for a scheme of grants to cover the whole or part of the cost of any adaptations to fireplaces which might be necessary to comply with the limitation of emissions. The cost of conversion would comprise part of the problem only.</P>
    <P>A restriction requiring householders to burn smokeless fuel would constitute a heavy imposition on lower income families. Since such fuel costs approximately 50 per cent more, weight for weight, than bituminous coal, it must be understood that if sales of smokeless fuels increased enormously their price would drop.  At the moment they cost about 50 per cent more but that would be a reducing amount.  There is no point in giving people money to adapt fireplaces for smokeless fuel if they cannot afford to buy it.  There is no point in saving the old from death through air pollution if they are going to die from the cold instead. If the scheme is to be a success, smokeless fuels must be available at a cost people can afford.</P>
    <P>Alternatively there is now an opportunity for the State run gas company to contribute to the smokeless zones in Dublin by making gas available at a cheap rate in order to eliminate the burning of coal.  That should be discussed at Government level with the Minister for Finance and with An Bord Gáis to ensure that it is possible to do so under the terms of <Col N="484" /> this Bill and as part of the process of ensuring that the Bill will be effective.  If we want a genuinely clean and healthy environment, it will cost money.  Many people fear that the Bill will be passed and that it will be quietly forgotten, or that it will become a victim of the financial stringency to which Fianna Fáil have become converts judging from the replies of the Minister for Finance to questions today.</P>
    <P>The licensing system for industrial emissions is very welcome.  While industry certainly contributed to pollution problems in Britain and other European countries in the first half of this century, most modern industries, especially high technology industries, are almost pollution free but there are still traditional heavy industries and chemical industries in which precautions must be taken to limit or eliminate pollution.  This will cost money.  The Government and the IDA must evaluate the jobs to be gained by admitting dirty industries here which would not be taken into other countries as against the jobs that could be lost in tourism and the food industry as a result of such industries coming here.  These decisions must now be made.  We have a reputation as a country with clean air and water and therefore clean food.  That reputation could be damaged and jobs lost.  These evaluations must be made.</P>
    <P>One of the most frightening aspects of industrial pollution is the phenomenon known as acid rain.  So far, Ireland has managed to escape the worst effects of acid rain but evidence of the environmental disaster it can create can be seen in the withering forests and dead and empty lakes of Germany, Sweden and some other countries.  We have a right to be protected from the effects of acid rain created by other countries and we have a duty to see that we do not contribute to this problem.  Legitimate concern has been expressed about the possible contribution of the new Moneypoint power station to the problem.  I understand that filtering devices could have been installed at the design stage to eliminate or greatly reduce the problem.</P>
    <P>When sulphur dioxide combines with <Col N="485" /> water in rainfall it forms sulphuric acid, creating the lethal cocktail known as acid rain.  Moneypoint at peak production will produce 70,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide. Deputy de Valera today gave a figure of 90,000 tonnes, but even taking the lower figure of 70,000 tonnes as against the domestic production in Dublin of 16,000 tonnes which is causing a grave problem there one can readily see the effect Moneypoint will have in regard to acid rain.  What goes up must come down and the cost of the damage done could be far in excess of the cost of remedying the problem now.  The Minister should ask the Minister for Finance to reduce his £20 million levy on the ESB and allow them to apply some of that annually to installing scrubbers in Moneypoint and at least reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide.  The Bill is very welcome and we look forward to its implementation to save lives and our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence is overwhelming that a problem exists in our major cities, not only in Dublin.  There have been comments today that only Dublin has a problem and that the rural areas do not have a problem.  There are other cities besides Dublin.  Cork has a problem in certain areas.  The evidence has been documented clearly by the local authority.  Any money being made available to implement the clean air policy must go not only to Dublin but to other local authorities that have documented evidence of an air pollution problem.</P>
      <P>We have a reputation as being a clean country environmentally and we are one of the few European countries that can boast about being nuclear free.  Our reputation helps to sell our agricultural produce abroad and it is in our interests to ensure that our reputation is maintained. The evidence as we walk around our cities however, shows that we are careless and slipshod in ways about our environment. Instead of having our litter wardens involved in a punitive role they would be better employed going around our schools training our young people to care for our environment in a positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to be unable to tackle our <Col N="486" /> environmental problems effectively.  We do not have an overall national environment protection policy and we do not have any strategy to deal with the problems caused by industrial development. At present we just react to crises without having any clear objective.  Many major problems have arisen because of departmentalised thinking.  One has only to consider the role of State bodies to see that our attempts to maintain a clean environment are being hampered by the sectioning off of the environment protection policy.  We have problems of waste disposal, both domestic and industrial. We have problems in relation to sea pollution and river pollution.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is polluted with nuclear waste and the Atlantic is polluted by the dumping of nuclear waste off our western coast.  There are major question marks about the quality of the technology being used to dispose of toxic and nuclear waste.  We also have a problem which we have not addressed in relation to the disposal of toxic and chemical waste. Technology is advancing so quickly that we are not in a position to predict the environmental consequences.  This is very worrying.  We seem to be embracing technology for purely economical advantages while not being able to predict the environmental consequences.  Major changes are taking place in this country and we do not yet know what the effects will be.</P>
    <P>I referred recently to the departmentalisation of the environmental problem which is affecting our attitudes and the attitudes of the State in a most serious way.  We have about ten State and semi-State agencies involved in environmental management.  On top of that we have each local authority attempting to do their own thing without having the financial resources to treat the environmental problem seriously.  I pose the question: could we not, even at this stage, harness all the departmentalised efforts together and bring them under one agency?  At the moment we have each local authority and each Government Department appointing their own specialists to interpret the rules and regulations coming <Col N="487" /> within the sphere of their own interest without getting involved in the overall situation, and with very little liaison.</P>
    <P>We need an agency comparable to the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States who do an excellent job providing specialist advice and taking corrective action.  They also involve themselves in long term planning.  I am saying that we need a central agency, and this is a proposal I put to this House on a number of occasions but without much success to date, unfortunately.  The evidence is there and will show that dividing our efforts has caused problems for this country.  We only have to look at the oil spillage off the south coast recently.  I believe the indecision arose because nobody could decide which Department were responsible.  In such a crisis, and in a crisis like the Chernobyl disaster which happened thousands of miles away, we were badly equipped to deal with the problem as it affected this country.  The Nuclear Energy Board did their best within their limited resources but they were not responsible for the health of the population.  The health boards were undecided whether they should monitor the radioactive levels in milk.  They did not know if it was their responsibility or the responsibility of some other agency. Such indecision has arisen from the fuzzy thinking in relation to environmental protection. The only answer is to have a central agency with adequate resources to meet the problems in an effective way as they arise.</P>
    <P>We should be planning and thinking of the environment and the management of it for the future.  We are reaching a situation whereby economic and social policy cannot be taken in isolation any longer without embracing the question of the environment and the implications for it.  Thankfully under the Water Pollution Act &mdash; which is related because air pollution causes water pollution &mdash; no company can set up in business without going through a very select and difficult screening system with people such as the IDA, <Col N="488" /> An Foras Forbartha, the IIRS and the local authority, all judging the implications which the setting up of the company would have for the environment.  I am not satisfied that local authorities, who are badly short of finance, are laying all the emphasis they should on environmental protection.  I know they act at times only when pushed by public opinion.  That is human nature.</P>
    <P>Atmospheric pollution has been a source of concern to environmentalists and legislators for quite some time because of the possible damage to health and the environment.  As we all know, two of the more significant atmospheric pollutants are smoke and sulphur dioxide and these have been the subject of an EC directive adopted in 1980.  As previous speakers have said, levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide have reached worrying proportions in recent times.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, certain areas of Dublin have reached danger point because of meteorological factors in recent months. The same can be said of other cities.</P>
    <P>Acid rain is a major problem throughout Europe.  Acid rain levels are increasing in Ireland too, and we must address ourselves to this problem immediately. Strict compliance to EC pollution level directives would have serious economic consequences for Ireland.  We must decide if we can afford a comprehensive clean air policy which would demand the use of expensive smokeless fuels, compulsory smoke free zones and so on.  I believe there is only one way we can go; we must tackle this problem seriously before it reaches dangerous proportions.</P>
    <P>Our clean air policy must be linked with our energy policy.  We must utilise our natural gas because this is a clean fuel which is relatively cheap, but we must use it as quickly and as efficiently as possible. We do not have a very big reservoir of natural gas.  Therefore, the Department of Energy must look seriously at the proposal to tap into the European grid where there is a limitless gas reservoir. This gas can be piped from as far away as Siberia if we decide to tap into the British gas grid.  This is something we must consider.  The link between our <Col N="489" /> environmental policy and our energy policy is something this Government must address.  It would be appropriate in the Dublin and Cork areas where natural gas is available to encourage people to use natural gas.  The Cork Gas Company and the local authorities should get together and devise a policy to introduce gas in areas of high levels of pollution. The same should apply in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The guiding principles in an environmental policy should be first, that a clean healthy environment is the basis of a flourishing community; second, that industrial development and environmental protection are complementary; third, we must educate our young population and our industrialists about the problems that can arise from litter, silage, slurry run-off and so on, and there must be an education programme for farmers; and fourth, we must insist on the elimination of the irresponsible disposal of chemicals around the country.  Up to now the environment has tended to be approached on a fire brigade or crisis management basis.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being introduced today against a background of ambivalence concerning our attitude to pollution. We criticise the British Government, and rightly so, in relation to Sellafield and its operations but, at the same time, we continue to export our industrial and toxic waste because we cannot get our own act together.  We must not be ambivalent about this matter.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly, we have grave anxiety about nuclear installations in Britain but, at the same time, we fail to deal with plants such as Moneypoint which are and will cause severe environmental damage not only to this country but, through transboundary pollution, will cause damage to the European mainland. Therefore, while we criticise Britain on the one hand we fail to deal with our own environmental problems at home. Sooner rather than later it will catch up with us; our colleagues in Europe will not allow us to get away with it.  Our attitude to Britain and Sellafield is compromised seriously by our failure to dispose of our own toxic and chemical waste.  We will <Col N="490" /> have to face up to this problem sooner rather than later.  We have to be consistent and introduce a comprehensive environmental protection policy.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the Bill.  The Air Pollution Bill, 1986, has as its core the provision of a comprehensive modern framework for the control of air pollution in order to meet national requirements and to enable full effect to be given to relevant EC directives.  In conferring on local authorities the necessary powers to ensure the protection of air quality in their areas, it is to be hoped it will be implemented with far greater effect than some of the previous legislation.  The Bill is a comprehensive one.  In examining its detailed provisions I found them to be defective in not having mandatory time limits inserted to force local authorities to act and carry out their duties under the legislation.  I view this as a serious omission in view of the local authorities' track records in this field to date, which I have referred to earlier.  Consequently, I believe the Bill is defective without these mandatory provisions.</P>
    <P>The deterioration in air pollution levels has been scientifically documented and newspaper reports of recent days have confirmed that fact.  It suffices to say that air pollution has now reached a serious and worrying level.  The Bill cannot be implemented in any way without the allocation of substantial funding from the Exchequer.  It will be interesting to see in the months ahead what funding the local authorities will receive to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe the introduction of mandatory time limits for local authorities to carry out their duties under the Bill is essential. There should be a mandatory stipulation on local authorities to act on air pollution when the situation warrants it.  Research and monitoring must be stepped up. There must be an increased emphasis on medical research to quantify the damage which is being done to the nation's health because of the present levels of air pollution. As I have said, special grants must be made available to the local authorities to follow up and carry out the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> On a parochial level and as a Deputy representing Cork.  I read with interest that Dublin Corporation had made submissions to the Department of the Environment requesting finance for pilot schemes in the Dublin area.  I hope that any moneys which are made available will be made available to a number of cities in the State and are not totally spent in Dublin.  The local authority in Cork have a large number of monitoring stations throughout the region and they have documented their arguments and their facts in a responsible and scientific way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Government to ensure that the report which was undertaken by the Nuclear Energy Board in relation to the Chernobyl disaster be published sooner rather than later.  I hope the Government will publish the report within the next few days if possible.  A number of questions which were raised at the time still remain unanswered.  I ask that the report which was undertaken by the Nuclear Energy Board be published.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into detail on the question of lead pollution and burnt hydrocarbon pollution in our cities as they were dealt with earlier but I would hope that the provisions of the Bill would ensure that action is taken on those matters also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your election to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I would also like to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, on his appointment to what is obviously going to be a very demanding and interesting post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot but be very pleased that this Bill is before the House today. Having had a very comprehensive airing in the Seanad, it is most desirable that we proceed with all haste to give it legal effect.  When one studies the short title and the various headings, one quickly identifies the vital and crucial importance of this Bill.  Having listened to some of the previous speakers, it is becoming very obvious that matters such as air pollution, <Col N="492" /> the protection of air and cleanliness of air are matters impinging on energy policy. Because of the financial constraints at present, the implementation of Government policy which is going to cost will be difficult in the coming years.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that one should take an overall and cohesive view of energy policy when talking about air pollution.  Deputies representing Dublin constituencies have expressed concern about the level of air pollution in their constituencies which has been brought about because of a shift in energy policy and the use of various fuels.  The various fuels which are used are controlled by different Government Departments and I would ask the Minister to endeavour to undertake with the Minister for Energy cost-benefit analysis of the usage of gas, oil, power through the ESB, solid fuel from Bord na Móna and imported coal.</P>
    <P>I and you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, can recall that in the vast housing areas we represent such as Ballyfermot and Finglas this was not a particular problem some years ago but because of various economic changes and a shortage of oil there was a return to solid fuel heating in homes.  That has been the biggest single contributor to air pollution in the capital city.  As the State controls the price of gas and as Dublin Gas are now about to come into State ownership we should look at the cost levels and the profitability of the gas company as against the national concern about air pollution.  The price levels which the ESB are charging and which Bord Gáis will be charging Dublin Gas have got to be related to some of the very valid points made earlier by Deputy Mac Giolla regarding the health cost of the continued air pollution about which we are all concerned.</P>
    <P>We must consider the knock-on expense that arises from pollution, particularly in the Dublin area.  The Minister should carry out a cost-benefit analysis to ascertain the best type of heating at the most economical rate.  Imported coal appears to be the biggest source of air pollution.  I understand that coal ships which were anchored off Dublin during a recent dispute at Dublin docks could <Col N="493" /> not be diverted to other European countries because of the quality of the coal on board.</P>
    <P>An article in the January issue of the <i>OECD Observer,</i> under the heading, &ldquo;Making the Cities more Liveable&rdquo;, dealt with upgrading the urban environment and pointed out that Scandinavian countries are concerned to reduce air, water and noise pollution. It stated that sulphur emissions in those countries are to be cut by 50 per cent from 1980 levels by 1993 and that lead-free fuel will be the cheapest form of fuel to buy in Scandinavian countries.  If we allow the pollution to continue in our cities we will find it difficult to get people to reside in houses provided by local authorities and private developers at economic prices.  Unless we make it clear that from now on our environment must be clean and healthy, we will be failing in our task.</P>
    <P>According to the article in the OECD publication the Italians, the Spanish and other member countries, have adopted policies to reduce air pollution such as traffic control, environmental upgrading, concentrating on the renovation of old buildings and so on.  It is important that people recognise the need to have a clean and healthy environment.  In the early seventies, in compliance with the County Dublin Development Plan, we created three satellite towns around Dublin and housed 100,000 people in Tallaght, Clondalkin-Lucan and Blanchardstown.  The first inhabitants of those satellite towns were fortunate in that the air was clear when they moved there.  However, following the huge increase in the price of oil in the early seventies many of those people had to change to using solid fuel to heat their homes.  Many of the local authority houses had warm air heating systems installed but because of the high cost of electricity they had to switch to solid fuel.  People could no longer afford a pollution free system.  In fact, grants were given to people to enable them to change to solid fuel systems.  In carrying out any cost-benefit analysis we must bear in mind that a pollution free environment <Col N="494" /> will lead to huge savings in other areas.</P>
    <P>We have not concluded our development in west Dublin and it is proposed to build many more houses in the satellite towns in that area.  We must try to get our plans right from now on.  We must use our by-laws and planning regulations to ensure that we do not add to the problem. The Minister, who also has responsibility for planning, must ensure that all regulations are complied with.  He must ensure that the natural gas grid is extended to new housing estates and that pollution free systems are made available to new tenants.  Dublin County Council should insist on developers extending the gas grid to new housing estates so that we do not have to dig up roads and footpaths later on to instal such a facility.  I understand that matter is not covered in the existing by-laws and that the local authority cannot insist on that work being carried out by developers.</P>
    <P>Ballyfermot, which is in my constituency, is an area that is causing great concern to local representatives because of the extent of the air pollution there. There is no doubt that because of the extent of the pollution in that area the Department of Health have to spend a lot of money on health care.  People are very concerned about the damage to the health of pensioners who are adversely affected by air pollution there.  In any area where there has been a shift to solid fuel there will be a problem of air pollution. Ballyfermot has 6,000 local authority houses and the Department and the corporation will have to make an effort to eliminate the pollution there.  I accept that the Bill represents a step in the right direction but I urge the Minister to embark on pilot schemes in Ballyfermot and Finglas as the first phase in a determined effort to eliminate air pollution.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have broken the back of their housing programme with the result that staff in the housing section are available for other work.  I suggest that they be made responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  We would hope that a blueprint <Col N="495" /> to deal with the worst affected areas of Dublin would be devised and that decisive action would be taken as soon as the President signs the Bill.  That would be an indication that the Department of the Environment are serious about taking real action.</P>
    <P>Appropriate action must also be taken in the housing construction sector.  This very day Department-funded local authority housing schemes are under way and the open fireplace is being built into those houses.  This is understandable because of the economics of that type of heating but pollution will certainly follow from the use of solid fuels.  The Department will have to address this issue and take action.</P>
    <P>Several sections of the Bill deal with research into air pollution.  I urge the Minister to ask city and county managers to identify staff from their local authorities to undertake that research.  This would not involve an extra financial burden on the local authorities.  Staff resources could be made available with a little more flexibility, less attention to demarcation and better utilisation of personnel. It should be possible for local authorities to make an indepth analysis of air pollution within their jurisdictions. It would appear that in next week's budget various Government Departments and local authorities will not get the financial resources they would wish to have.  If spending is to be curtailed in various areas, local authority staff must be briefed and educated to embark on research into air pollution in their areas.</P>
    <P>The licensing of industrial plants is another very important matter.  Local authority staff can carry out research into existing plants within their areas and engage in various tests.  We were discussing this morning charges being levied on agriculture for advisory services. Surely the local authorities should be able to recover some funds where they are endeavouring to ensure that manufacturing industries are complying with the regulations in regard to air pollution. Section 19 appears to allow for some <Col N="496" /> mechanism by which funds could be recovered. A very big money earner for local authorities is the collection of funds for the disposal of industrial waste.  In Dublin county we had to pay a very high price for a tip but within three years the manager told us that he had recovered the cost of the investment.  There is some elbow room in the area of dealing with industrial plants and it may be possible to have an annual recovery of costs incurred by the local authority in monitoring air pollution.  There are knock-on effects of air pollution such as the costs to hospitals of dealing with people whose health is affected by it.</P>
    <P>I now refer to special control areas in Dublin city and county.  Rapid residential growth in the western part of Dublin and the build up of various satellite towns where the houses are heated by solid fuel means that there is often a pall of pollution hanging over Dublin in certain climatic conditions.  This is very obvious when one comes from the higher areas in the south of the county down towards the city.  Areas which are badly affected will have to be designated special control areas.  Something will have to be done to identify some pilot areas as quickly as possible.  Section 39 (2) states:</P>
    <P>In deciding whether it is necessary or expedient to make a special control area order in relation to any area, the local authority shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any air quality management plan in force in relation to the area, and</P>
    <P>(b)  any relevant air quality standard, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the availability of the means necessary for compliance with the order, and</P>
    <P>(d)  the expense which would be incurred in complying with the order.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>A special control area order shall specify&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the area to which it relates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> (b)  the pollutant with which it is concerned, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the measures to be taken and the requirements which shall have effect in the area to which the order relates.</P>
    <P>Ballyfermot might be identified as one special control area.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that a pilot project of this type is undertaken.  Statistics of pollution levels justify a decision to make it a special control area.  The bulk of pollution is from residential areas and it is not a simple problem of blaming one or two industries.  On the contrary, since the car assembly industry and other industries closed in that part of Dublin, there is very little air pollution from industry. The Minister must show the way by identifying Ballyfermot as a special control area due to the very severe air pollution problems which have been identified there.</P>
    <P>Regarding air quality management plans and standards, section 46 (1) states:</P>
    <P>A local authority may, and shall if the Minister so directs, make, in relation to all or any part of their functional area, a plan (in this Act referred to as an &ldquo;air quality management plan&rdquo;) for the preservation or the improvement of the air quality in the area to which such plan relates.</P>
    <P>There is a slight overlap with the special control areas but the Bill identifies that there are black spots about which something needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the 1963 Planning Act is implemented in such a way that by-law approvals will be given only when considerations of air quality have been taken into consideration. We must not continue to compound the problem, as has been happening every day of the week. Decisions are being made to allow further residential growth which, in itself, is desirable, but we are adding to the air pollution problems.  Action must be taken by the drawing up of positive guidelines. I would ask the Minister to identify in his reply to this debate the resources <Col N="498" /> which will be made available in this financial year.  I get the impression that with the overall financial constraints it may not be intended to provide funds for these purposes this year.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position and to have a special pilot project for Ballyfermot which has such a major problem at present.  I welcome the Bill which will have a very important effect on the whole country.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is another major plank of our party's policy in Government. Pollution will be the most prominent issue in the years ahead in relation to air, water etc.  The various sections of the Bill should be vigorously pursued as the Department of the Environment, the outgoing Government, Seanad, where the Bill was introduced, and the incoming Government are all committed to this issue.  I compliment the Minister and his Department for moving so quickly in bringing the Bill before the House and in making progress in the work done by the Seanad by getting it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.  The Minister made it clear that he is amenable to amendments on Committee Stage and he also stated that he will study in detail many of the excellent submissions he received. There are probably many areas which could be strengthened.  I wish again to appeal to the Minister to designate a pilot area to ensure that everybody realises we mean business with the introduction of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Go raibh míle maith agat as ucht na bhfocal úd.  I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister and his staff who have drawn it up.  If fully implemented, it will lead to a significant improvement not alone in the quality of the air in Dublin and other cities but also in the general health of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who canvassed in the city in the general election during the months of <Col N="499" /> January and February will realise that in those months the air becomes extremely polluted.  The main cause of such pollution is domestic fires.  However, there is a problem in controlling domestic smoke emission in that the main source of heat for the population of the city is coal fires because coal is the cheapest and most controllable source of heat.  If we control smoke emission, we will have to replace carboniferous fuels, mainly soft coal, with some other fuel.  Trying to replace coal with something else will increase the cost to domestic households which will not be accepted by the public.  While the Bill is very welcome with its long list of repeals, regulations, offences, penalties and prosecution of offenders, thought will have to be given to what will replace smoke producing fuels.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the effects of the smoke from these fuels on the population at risk, those who suffer from lung problems and asthma, mainly the elderly.  As a practitioner it is my experience that the number of admissions to cardiac and respiratory units in hospitals rises dramatically in the winter months.  This adds extra costs to our medical services which has not been quantified.  It would be interesting to see how much money the State spends on the treatment of respiratory diseases and if it has increased over the past few years.  If an inquiry into the cost of this aspect of medicine was instituted, we would find it has risen over the past few years.  It would pay us to introduce fairly rigorous methods of controlling air pollution, especially as it affects the grater urban areas.</P>
    <P>Once again I congratulate the Minister and his civil servants on bringing forward this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is my <Col N="500" /> pleasant duty to congratulate you on your appointment as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I wish you well in that office.  I have no doubt that the experience you will bring to the post means that we can look forward to your wise counsel and judgment at all times.  I have known you over the years to be impartial, fair and honest.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank all the Members of the House across the political divide for their good wishes to me on my reappointment to the Department of the Environment. This is my third time in the Department with the same portfolio.  I assure all Members of the House that in all matters relating to my Department I will be fair, honest and as helpful as I possibly can. That will be my policy, as it was in the past.</P>
      <P>I also wish to congratulate the new Members elected to the Dáil on their excellent contributions which dealt with a wide range of matters affecting many areas.  They were most informative and very well put.  The standard of the debate has been excellent and I thank them for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many interesting points were made by Deputies.  Deputy Doyle, who guided the Bill through the Seanad, spoke knowledgeably about many aspects of it.  She suggested that we should consider bringing nuclear safety within the ambit of the Air Pollution Bill now that the new structure for radiological protection is being planned by the Government.  The suggestion is interesting in a way.  The incident which brought home the reality of transboundary air pollution most dramatically to the people of Europe was the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.  Nuclear emissions of this kind are clearly a form of air pollution.  However, I doubt whether that very wide question of radiological protection could be adequately accommodated within the long title of the Air Pollution Bill.  At the moment the Nuclear Energy Board have to deal with such diverse matters as licensing of equipment for use, safety of operators, monitoring of food and nuclear contamination of the sea and other waters.  Nuclear safety is a very specialised area and it is <Col N="501" /> not possible to reduce it to the air pollution aspects alone.  Having said that, I am aware of the developing interest of the EC Council of Environment Ministers in nuclear safety and I intend to support and to participate actively in this development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle and Deputy Quinn spoke about EC environment policy generally and about the principles on which it should be based.  There is an explicit acknowledgement in the Single European Act that Community environment policy in future must have regard to the economic circumstances in member states, to different environmental conditions in these states and to the balanced development of the regions.  We will insist that these principles are taken fully into account in developing important directives on air pollution and other matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn argued that in so far as the Community wishes to impose costly standards of pollution control it should be prepared to provide financial assistance to countries for which this might represent an unfair burden.  There is already some acceptance of these principles. The European Investment Bank already finances major pollution control projects and under the draft Fourth Environmental Action Programme to be adopted this year the Regional Fund is also to be made available for this kind of undertaking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady referred to the EC environment policy.  He made the point, with which I agree, that we should not be complacent about the concept of accepted levels of pollution and that we should strive where possible to achieve even higher standards, but there is a helpful and a positive side also to the EC environmental standards.  In the air pollution area, for instance, they establish a common regime which industrialists must comply with across all 12 member states. There will be no question then of dirty industries trying to play off different countries in order to obtain lax treatment. In broad terms a common environmental standard will be upheld throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to <Col N="502" /> possible air pollution problems from the Moneypoint power plant.  The statutory environmental requirements at present applying to Moneypoint, including emissions and limits on smoke and sulphur dioxide, are set out in the planning permission granted by Clare County Council in 1979 to take account of the impact study carried out by An Foras Forbartha and a study of the consequences for agriculture by An Foras Talúntais.  It is interesting to recall that no appeal to An Foras Forbartha was taken against the Moneypoint planning permission in 1979.  The environmental criticisms which we now hear of Moneypoint have, therefore, an element of hindsight about them in that serious international concern about acidification seems to have asserted itself only after 1979.</P>
    <P>The Moneypoint power plant has a total capacity of some 900 MW and would be capable of emitting a maximum of 70,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide per year.  In addition to emissions monitoring at the plant itself, 11 stations in Clare and several in the neighbouring counties monitor the air pollution requirements of the planning permission.  A number of these stations are run by Clare County Council but most are operated by the ESB themselves.  An Foras Forbartha have been engaged to provide a check on validation results of the ESB network of monitors by independently monitoring them themselves.  Results so far have shown a negligible impact of emissions on the environment of Moneypoint including the Burren.  As regards possible longer range effects from Moneypoint, the ESB have established a monitoring station on the Slieve Bloom mountains and An Foras Forbartha are arranging to set up further stations at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow, and near Kilkenny.  It will take somewhat longer to assess this longer range data.  I have dealt with these arrangements in some detail to demonstrate that a strict monitoring regime is being maintained at Moneypoint.  As a plant which is now operational and which was authorised in 1979, Moneypoint will not immediately at least come under the new licensing system contained in Part <Col N="503" /> III of the Bill.  However, it will be subject to the general requirement of section 24, to use the best practical means to limit emissions from it.  If it should ever transpire that this obligation is not being met in relation to Moneypoint, Part II of the Bill contains full powers to take remedial action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady expressed the view that the Bill contains too many discretionary provisions and is not sufficiently directive. This criticism was made also by some speakers in the Seanad as well as by certain outside commentators.  There is no denying that in many respects this is a framework Bill.  In other words we are setting up a new system of environmental control to deal with all future eventualities as best as we can foresee them at this point.  Knowledge of air pollutants and their effects is constantly developing and this is as true for the EC and international environmental bodies as it is for ourselves.  It follows that not all provisions of the Bill may be suitable for immediate application.  Moreover, some of them may never be needed in certain parts of the country.  In these circumstances it would simply not make sense to require that the Minister make full use of all his functions in every case.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are not discretionary.  These are included in the general obligations under section 24.  All non-domestic premises should use the best practical means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions.  In the licensing system established under Part III for industrial plant these provisions are mandatory and the Minister has no discretion on whether to put them into effect.  Many of the items raised by Members in the Dáil yesterday evening and today will be dealt with in great detail on Committee Stage.  I want to give an assurance to the House that all amendments will be looked at carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be looking at all amendments.  Every amendment put down by a Member will be examined very carefully.  Deputy Quinn who has very good experience of Government operations can be assured that we will try to be as helpful as we possibly can.  We must take the financial position into consideration also.  In doing that we must protect the national interest, too.  I think everybody in the House agrees with me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a growing understanding in recent decades of the causes and effects of air pollution.  The main causes lie in the very ordinary activities by which we produce goods, rely on transport for commerce and leisure, provide ourselves with heating, lighting and cooking and generally use the energy needed to maintain our 20th century standards. Deputy Barnes dealt with trucks which carry products which in her opinion need to be better protected in transportation. I agree completely with that.  Vehicles carrying material such as contaminated material or waste should be covered in and managed properly.  I regret to say that on some occasions that has not been the case.  I am glad that very little of such material is transported in uncovered vehicles, but I should like the House and the press to take note that I wish all vehicles to be carefully loaded and given the necessary protection of covers.  That is essential.  In other countries if this is not the case one is breaking the law and heavy fines are involved.  I should like the public to be aware of these measures. The cost involved will not be very high and the country will benefit.  This will keep our environmental standards high. Visitors to the country will be watching <Col N="505" /> to see how we manage our affairs in this respect.  I am making a special appeal here that commonsense will prevail.</P>
    <P>There is now better documentation of the effects of air pollution.  Localised effects include damage to health, to buildings and to vegetation.  There are longer range effects in terms of acidification which can damage lakes, forests and also soil.  Air quality is becoming an issue of international, national and local importance.  Ireland's most fundamental obligation in the international sphere is as a party to the Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. Under this convention we have accepted the duty to limit and if possible to reduce air pollution.  The reduction of air pollution is also a prime concern of EC environmental policy.  Some eight directives dealing directly or indirectly with air quality are already in force and several more are being processed.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on air pollution in the international forum reflects a number of concerns.  In the first place we are anxious to support the general aspiration towards better air quality in the industrialised world.  At the same time &mdash; and I say this without apology &mdash; we must have regard to certain characteristics in the Irish situation.  We are neither significant emitters nor receivers of transboundary air pollution.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a greater awareness in our housing estates where many have been depending on local authorities to clean up their estates and where the residents could do a little in co-operation with those local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this in connection with air pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks relate to pollution in general.  This is an opportunity to mention these matters.  In many of our estates a little more could be done. I shall say no more on that topic.  This Bill deals with many aspects of future policy.  Many Members ask about the financial undertakings that would be given in regard to its implementation and want to know what finance will be available. <Col N="506" /> They must appreciate that we have just taken over the office of Government and we must take into account the overall situation with regard to budgetary policy and financial constraints.  That is something which we will take into consideration when the time comes.  The Deputies can rest assured that, finances permitting, we will implement the Bill.</P>
      <P>Publicly and politically, air pollution has also assumed a much higher standing in Ireland in recent times.  A number of environmental groups have been active in this area and two reports have been published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  The major response to this has been the Air Pollution Bill.  Without a proper and specific legislative framework, air quality controls could at best be implemented in an <i>ad hoc</i> way in Ireland and the system of administration would remain impoverished in every sense.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide a comprehensive framework for the control of air pollution to enable our national requirements to be met and to give full effect to the relevant EC directives.  Its provisions will afford local authorities the necessary powers to ensure the continuance of good air quality in their areas and will allow the Minister for the Environment to exercise effective supervision of this work.  Furthermore, the provisions of the Bill constitute the statutory framework within which many of our pollution problems can be tackled.  Before final solutions are decided, the position obtaining in each area will have to be assessed objectively with appropriate remedial measures devised on a rational, cost-effective basis. A number of options come to mind such as encouraging the use of natural gas and other smokeless fuels, prohibiting the use of certain fuels or requiring the use of appliances which burn smokeless solid fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our objective is clear and is required by way of an EC directive, which is to have the necessary legislative measures passed and operational by 1993.  This will ensure the smoke emissions in Dublin city conform to the requirements of the <Col N="507" /> relevant EC directive.  However, much work remains to be done.  First, we shall have to convince the public, particularly those in the most severely affected areas, of the importance of the necessary smoke abatement measures and then have such measures implemented.  The task will not be easy.  We shall have to tackle it as quickly and as thoroughly as resources allow.  I look forward to receiving full co-operation from all concerned in this task whether they be Government Departments, local authorities, fuel suppliers, residents' associations, environmental groups or whoever &mdash; in short, the public at large.</P>
    <P>I should not like to give the impression that action with regard to the control of air pollution is something for the future only or that no worth-while advances have been achieved by way of measures already adopted.  For instance, regulations made in 1985 provided for a 60 per cent reduction in the lead content of petrol with effect from 1 April 1986.  That constituted a significant step in the direction of ultimately eliminating lead from petrol in line with the requirements of the relevant EC directive.  A further set of regulations was made in 1985 to limit the sulphur content of gas oils used in domestic oil-fired central heating and diesel-engined vehicles to 0.3 per cent of weight from 1 October 1985, again in compliance with the EC directive.  This last requirement helps to ensure that we continue to observe the EC emission standards, a point to which I adverted briefly earlier and it is worth emphasising.</P>
    <P>While there are problems obtaining in relation to smoke emissions in Dublin, the requirements of the directive for sulphur dioxide, which constitutes such a problem on mainland Europe, have been met so far.  The Government will be working to ensure that the smoke porblem can be tackled and curtailed in the immediate future.  It is my belief that the overall drive against air pollution at home and abroad &mdash; I have dealt very briefly with some aspects of it here today &mdash; is beginning to show results and that we can all look forward to there being a <Col N="508" /> significant improvement in air quality in the years ahead.  This is a challenging time for all concerned about air pollution. We face the task of adopting policies and strategies which must serve us for some time to come.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of matters raised.  I want to reassure the House that the Minister will be dealing with these also and will be making a comprehensive statement to the House when concluding, dealing with many more matters raised by Members.  The debate has been of a very high standard, with matters relating to air pollution being dealt with in great detail.  We can tease out the various sections of the Bill on Committee Stage which I am sure will be most enlightening. Seldom in my experience in this House has any Bill gone through without some amendments being made to it.  Some very good amendments have been made on Committee Stages of Bills.  For the information of the new Members of the House, Committee Stages can be very interesting and enlightening.</P>

      <P>The problem with the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act is capable of being remedied. The Act is deficient in two simple ways. It is limited in its effectiveness to a three year period and it involves a complex consultative process which by its nature would take up a considerable portion of those three years.  Secondly, the commission as envisaged by the Act, and as established, have been given inadequate powers to really bring about the requisite degree of radical change in the manner in which Dublin city is planned and rebuilt, an urgent task which we must face over the next number of years.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended, is not by its nature sufficient to conserve and plan the rebuilding of an urban area. There are deficiencies in our planning system which is a fundamentally negative and permissive one and which is not apposite to urban conservation.  Accordingly, no matter how the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act is implemented and no matter how it is financed and prosecuted by those who are a party to the Act in terms of their membership of the commission or in terms of their capacity to fund the commission's activities, the reality remains that the powers given to the commission were inadequate for the task set for the commission.  The political tension which accompanied the birth of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, which was a tension between Dublin Corporation on the one hand and the Government of the day on the other as to the separation of powers between the commissioners and the corporation and as to the length and duration of the commissioners' powers, should not be allowed in the lifetime of the commission to take away from the capacity of the commission to do their work properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are fundamentally a superficial body in terms of the powers now given to them because they deal with the outward appearance of a city, rather than the nuts and bolts of urban renewal and development. Many changes of a fundamental <Col N="510" /> kind are required through our planning law.  I fully support the resolution as proposed by Deputy O'Brien that the commission as a new and active agent for urban renewal should be supported but I do so subject to two caveats, that their powers be amended and their role extended and that this be done in a manner which gives the people of Ireland generally and the people of Dublin good value for money.</P>

      <P>What is at issue here is not the re-opening of the debate on the merits or otherwise of the metropolitan streets commission.  While some Members currently in the House were not here when that debate was going through, this House, in the sense of continuity, has the opportunity in this Dáil to look at what was decided and debated in the last Dáil. The reason the Labour Party will be supporting the Fine Gael resolution and opposing the amendment put down by the Government is because having done the work in the last Dáil we want to see it implemented without further delay. The movers of this motion were right to put it down in Private Members' time because it has flushed out the reservation which is clearly implicit in Government policy.  I know that the Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal wishes to contribute to the debate so I will not anticipate what he will say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the amendment bears more of the hallmark of the Department of Finance than of the Custom House and the caveat &ldquo;subject to available resources&rdquo; is in total contrast to that overall assurance given by the Taoiseach in the House yesterday when he said that the abridged version of Estimates with respect to the forthcoming budget next week, will be the same as that prepared by the previous administration.  The previous administration made provision for a sum of approximately £3.4 million to be made available for the implementation of the work of the commission in the first of their three years.  While many in the House will have views as to what the commission should do and about the effectiveness of the legislation and so on. <Col N="511" /> the point at issue this evening and the point of the vote this evening is confined specifically to the question of implementing without delay legislation which of its nature has a limited duration of only three years.  The movers of the motion have done a service in that they have clearly signalled that this Government have reservations, if we are to interpret the wording of the amendment in a literal sense.</P>
    <P>I will now put arguments to the Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal which he might usefully use in trying to convince people in the Department of Finance to ensure that this money is released in the current year.  I do not wish to go over the ground of this Bill or the merits of having the commission. The reality is that it has been established.  The commission's establishment was delayed by the political poverty and miserly attitude of the Opposition of the day in June 1986, when they refused to take it, and the work of the commission was delayed over the summer, although not entirely because a consultant architect was provisionally hired, and he has prepared a very comprehensive proposal study for the area designated in the Schedules to the Act.</P>
    <P>The architect in question is a man called Paddy Shaffrey who is perhaps one of the seminal influences in Irish urban design and thinking and who has written the definitive book entitled <i>The Irish Town,</i> published by the O'Brien Press about ten years ago, and who is recognised within the profession as being among the foremost authorities on the problems that confront urban Ireland today, problems which are not specific to Dublin but which can be found in every town.  The commission were wise in getting his services.  I know that this man has refined and developed his thinking over the period of the publication of that book, and with his wife he has participated in publishing some other work as well.  I put it to the Minister of State that on a professional basis the commission have got a person whose professional competence is recognised by everybody who <Col N="512" /> has a knowledge of the field, that work has been done to date and that that work should not be left lying in a filing cabinet for want of money.</P>
    <P>The consultant in question and the commission have identified some of the problems in the areas covered by the remit of the Metropolitan Streets Commission. There are gaps in the implementation of the planning Acts which have allowed the erection of unsightly structures and signs.  Their replacement with an improved standard cannot simply be implemented or brought about by the local authority using the existing 1963 planning legislation.</P>
    <P>The role of the commission is not to replace Dublin Corporation.  The argument articulated at great length in this House as regards this legislation was false.  This commission are not in competition with the local authority.  They are not trying to replace the authority in a moral or political sense.  They are simply trying to augment the authority and to do what they cannot do.  I believe the Government were right to bring in legislation which produced this specific instrument, because to amend the legislation for local authorities generally would be to extend the powers of the local authorities in respect of every square millimetre of urban Ireland when the problem is confined to designated areas which are calling out for action.  While £10 million spent over three years in the thoroughfares covered by the designated areas of the legislation will have a very obvious impact, £10 million spent by all local authorities with responsibility for urban affairs would not be seen.</P>
    <P>This was part of an overall Government strategy.  For the first time the outgoing administration introduced urban policy measures, some of which required legislative effect that targeted both provisions and resources into urban areas in a manner which was specific and discriminatory and clearly said that problems in certain areas would benefit rather than the previous practice where every local authority was treated equally.  Previously the manager of Leitrim County Council virtually had the same status in <Col N="513" /> the Custom House as the manager for Dublin city and county, which was patent nonsense because one-third of the population live in Dublin city and county while there is a population of just under 27,000 in the entire county of Leitrim. Because both were statutory local authorities for the purposes of legislation and the related instruments governing their activities with the Custom House there was equality of treatment, although obviously the Custom House and the Department of the Environment were able to make a much more subtle distinction.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a need to get on with the job.  The worry the Labour Party have is that a reticence is being expressed in the Government's amendment to the effect that while they will not do anything to the commission, they will simply starve them of funds and effectively let the commission wither away because the legislation provides that the commission must be wound up within three years.  I believe that the self-determination provision is a good one because it sends a signal of urgency to the commission members, it sends a signal of finality to the Department of Finance that there is an end in sight to the work that has to be done by that body, and it sends a signal to the members of the local authority who feel their pride, authority or moral position as guardians of the city has somehow been usurped.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to another point I want to make by way of argument to persuade the Minister of State not to press his amendment or, alternatively, to argue with his colleagues in the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State is a very senior parliamentarian.  The new Government pledged throughout their campaign and for two years previously that tourism was one of the major areas in which real, economically based jobs could be found if we were to turn round the armies of the unemployed.  Tourism was frequently identified by the Fianna Fáil Party when in Opposition as an area which could create many new jobs.  There is nothing more directly related to permanent improvement of the tourism facilities of Dublin city than the work <Col N="514" /> programme of the Metropolitan Streets Commission.  The money to be spent will be extremely cost effective in terms of the impact it will make not only on the citizens of Dublin but on tourists.  There is a need to generate what is known in the tourist trade as culture tourism, attracting people to urban areas like Dublin because of the cultural activities provided and the institutions available.</P>
    <P>Tourism cannot be exclusively confined to the green pastures of rural Ireland because the entry points for air travellers are Shannon, Knock or Dublin. One of the problems Dublin has encountered in the past is that it has not been promoted as a tourist venue as vigorously as some European capitals.  These cities are very conscious of the enormous market which exists for tourists &mdash; museums, theatres, concerts, or simply walking around the city.  Many politicians who have the opportunity to visit other capitals enjoy such activities and talk about them on their return.  We do not provide the same kind of facilities and in the past we have not attempted to make the same degree of investment in urban Dublin, in marked contrast to London, Amsterdam or Paris.</P>
    <P>This commission are concerned about this as well.  This must find an echo in the hearts and minds of Fianna Fáil now they are in office.  I do not doubt the sincerity of their repeated assertions of their commitment to tourism, but with their specific responsibility for urban renewal they will recognise that they have a unique opportunity to put into effect that commitment to tourism by ensuring that this money is made available to the commission as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that there are budgetary constraints.  I do not want to misinterpret what the Taoiseach said in reply to questions from my colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, but might I respectfully suggest that if the farmers of Laois-Offaly were to pay their outstanding rates and if the farmers throughout the country paid the rates they owed, that additional revenue would enable the Department to comfortably fund the entire £10 million due to the commission in 1987 alone.  It <Col N="515" /> is not a question of cash but ultimately of political priorities as to how we obtain that cash.  As the response to the lottery demonstrated yesterday, and the exodus to Cheltenham demonstrated last week, there does not seem to be a problem of cash in this country.  There merely seems to be a problem as to how one gets one's hands on it, particularly if one is in Government.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that overall budgetary constraints must prevent the Department working within the framework of the abridged Estimates to provide the necessary money.  The Department of the Environment have a budgetary Estimate of approximately £900 million, and I cannot believe a sum of £3.4 million would cause a serious monetary problem in 1987.  No doubt with his experience in this House the Minister will have the wisdom not to suggest that, even if people have suggested on behalf of the officials of the Department of Finance that he must enforce this amendment by pushing it through the House in a division.</P>
    <P>Many of us are now familiar with the problems of Dublin city and, indeed, there are people in this House who are currently members of Dublin City Council. In 1975 my own professional institute, the Institute of Architects of Ireland, produced a major study entitled &ldquo;Dublin: A City in Crisis&rdquo;.  Extensive reference was made to that publication by Senator Alexis Fitzgerald during the debate in the other House on this legislation last year. We have all been aware of the problems of Dublin city for some time.  What has inhibited an effective response by way of providing a solution has been the legislative pattern of the past of having broad universally based legislation which was equally applicable in every part of urban Ireland.  What is needed and what was clearly identified as being needed is targeted specific legislation.  This commission was one part of that approach.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that currently <i>in situ</i> are two other pieces of legislation, one fiscal and the other based on the urban renewal of the Custom House Docks site.  This House in its wisdom <Col N="516" /> decided to discriminate in favour of the redevelopment of the city centre by means of making special tax reliefs and discounts available.  Their utilisation has been successfully adopted in other countries which have urban economies similar to our own.  Those will not be successfully taken up, I put it to the House and specifically to the Minister with responsibility for urban renewal, if the general appearance of the downtown area, to use an American phrase, is not dramatically improved.  Marketing is as much about packaging as it is about anything else and the marketing of an inner city urban redevelopment scheme which needs to attract finance and purchasers will depend very much on the physical appearance of the area into which a prospective purchaser is being asked to invest.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission with their small provision of £3.4 million in 1987, the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site and the special tax provisions for the quays and for an area which is pretty well coterminous with large sections of the area covered by the commission are integral parts of the overall urban renewal strategy which was part of the previous Government's urban policy in general terms.  Therefore, this legislation should not be seen in isolation. It should be seen as an integral part of a balanced approach, albeit a modest one but modest because of the constraints of the market on the one hand and capital resources on the other.</P>
    <P>Failure to implement the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act without delay and to give them funding will undermine seriously the effectiveness of the Custom House Docks site redevelopment board because any prospective foreign investor coming to this city to look at that site will have to come down O'Connell Street.  The Minister can determine the impression that prospective investor will get if this commission either receive or do not receive money.  Similarly, the pension funds people who are likely to underwrite redevelopment projects in the inner city areas with the very positive co-operation <Col N="517" /> of Dublin Corporation will look at them with a jaundiced eye.  They have a responsibility to secure the pension rights of their depositors and will be influenced as much as anything else by the physical appearance of what they see.  This is a fact of urban economics which is clearly recognised.  It is for that reason, among others, that the previous Minister for the Environment established this particular commission.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on the merits of the legislation, the area it covers or some of the proposals which have emanated recently because I do not believe that is our task.  We set up a task force comprised of experts to do the job.  We should not starve them of the funds now that they have got to the edge of the runway. The Minister has a unique opportunity and his entire credibility as Minister with responsibility for urban renewal now depends on whether he can deliver to this commission the very small sum of £3.4 million.  Otherwise, with all due respect, the Fianna Fáil administration will have to do what they have done on issues such as women's rights and abolish the title of Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal.  Quite frankly, this will be the acid test.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, this is my first opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment.  You bring great parliamentary experience to this post and I wish you well in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first, it seems a bit puzzling that this motion should come up for debate so soon after the election of the new Dáil. The Opposition spokesmen were obviously not in any way ill-informed about the current position in relation to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission or about the operation of the Act <Col N="518" /> generally.  Neither was the purpose of the exercise to put forward any new or worthwhile suggestions for consideration. In the words of Deputy Boland, the motion was tabled as a test for the Government.  The truth, of course, is that the motion is no more than a crude attempt to introduce red herrings and divert attention from the more immediate and critical issues which face the country.</P>
    <P>As far as this Government are concerned, there is only one test and that is the economy.  This is the test on which the previous Government failed so badly and so consistently.  As we all know, especially the former incumbents of the offices of Minister and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are fully operational.  During the past 48 hours or so the commission have received considerable media attention with the news bulletins and the newspapers full of their suggestion that a replica of Nelson's Pillar should be erected. I will refrain from making any judgment on that idea at this stage since it is likely to form part of any improvement scheme submitted by the commission to the Minister for the Environment for approval.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already outlined in some detail the very wide and important range of functions which are, or will be, available to the commission.  Central to all of these is the preparation of improvement schemes for the metropolitan central area.  It is through the improvement schemes that the commission will have to show how it intends, as the Act says, to secure by every practicable means, an improvement in the level of civic amenity and in the standards of civic design.  In setting about their task of preparing improvement schemes, the commission are obliged to consult with Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Transport Authority and to make arrangements for the submission of ideas, and so on, from interested persons.  The commission are also obliged to have regard to the development plan prepared by Dublin Corporation.  This whole process of consideration and consultation is vitally <Col N="519" /> important to the commission's chances of success.  Improvement schemes will detail the type of measures regarding buildings, advertisements, roads, paths, street furniture, trees and flora, and so on, which the commission consider will have to be undertaken.  Since the commission have been appointed for at most a period of three years, and since most, if not all, of the members of the commission have no experience in the political arena, it will be vitally important for proper channels to be established to enable the ordinary citizens of Dublin to voice their opinion. I know that this is something of which the members of the commission are very conscious.</P>
    <P>Before going on to comment further on aspects of the commission and the Act, as well as dealing with some of the points raised in the debate last night, I must emphasise once again the overriding importance of the state of the public finances and the constraints imposed by the budget.  One thing which the Government are not short of at the present time is a list of projects and ideas on which additional expenditure could be incurred.  For many of these, unfortunately, it is not a question of whether the particular project or idea is good or bad in itself, but rather whether the country can afford the necessary finance at this critical time.  We all have to remember, and it cannot be emphasised enough, that in any area where more money is required, it can only be obtained in one of two ways, either by reducing expenditure in other areas or by further borrowing. If there is one thing on which there is now almost unanimous agreement it is that we have reached the limit of borrowing.  No matter how compelling a project may seem the harsh reality is that an increased level of borrowing cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>The last Government included a provision of £3.4 million direct from Exchequer funds to finance the streets commission this year.  Over the three years of its operation, the Act envisages that the commission will receive up to £10 million in Exchequer funds.  The question <Col N="520" /> which the Government now have the unenviable task of answering is whether this kind of expenditure can be afforded and, if so, what other areas must suffer.</P>

      <P>The major priority facing this Government is to restore balance to the public finances and to set about the task of generating confidence and renewed growth in the economy.  All available resources must be directed towards the achievement of these objectives. No area of public expenditure can escape critical and detailed examination. It is for these reasons that the Minister has tabled the amendment to the motion before the House and I too would urge the House to accept the motion as so amended.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the powers, duties and functions which the commission already have, the Act provides for the transfer from Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Transport Authority of the following: the full range of powers of Dublin Corporation in relation to the construction, maintenance and improvement of public roads; the various traffic management functions of the Dublin Transport Authority in relation to taxis, bus-stops, control of pedestrians, traffic and parking, traffic signs and co-ordination of road openings; and the powers of Dublin Corporation in relation to the prevention and control of litter and the removal of house and trade refuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These additional powers are extensive and a vital issue now in relation to the operation of the Act is how these functions will be performed and discharged from 1 June next.  Speaking as one who has 20 years experience in local government as an elected representative, I understand just what these functions entail.  They are not simple and straightforward and I wonder whether the commission fully understand what is involved.  I do not understand why the <Col N="521" /> former Minister took the rash step of making an order bringing the sections of the Act into operation in advance of improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>Like so many of my party colleagues, I am forced to the conclusion that this was Deputy Boland's final insult to the members and officials of Dublin Corporation. The sad fact of the matter is that the commission will require the active commitment and co-operation of Dublin Corporation if these functions are to be discharged satisfactorily from 1 June.  Deputy Boland's action was hardly the way to go about securing that co-operation.</P>
    <P>Did the previous Minister fully consider the implications of this decision to give the roads, traffic, litter and refuse collection functions to the commission on 1 June?  What will happen if the corporation decide not to co-operate with the commission on 1 June 1987?  And if they do co-operate and the work is carried out on an agency basis, then the question must be asked why was this transfer order made in the first place and, indeed, without even a draft plan prepared by the commission?  This is an issue which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>In proposing this motion Deputy Boland professed himself to be at a loss in trying to understand why my party and Dublin Corporation opposed the measure in the first place.  Well, if there remains any lingering doubt, let me say now that our disagreement was not about the problems which Dublin is suffering &mdash; the traffic problems, the state of the roads and footpaths, the litter and dirt, the architectural vandalism, to use the Deputy's own words, the plastic signs and so on.  We can all agree also that improvement and renewal are desirable and overdue.  Where we disagreed was on the wisdom of establishing a body such as the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission to attempt to resolve the problems.  We did not accept the rationale of separating this small area from the rest of the city to deal with it in isolation. We took the view that an integrated approach was necessary.  We also had doubts about the need for some of the <Col N="522" /> functions to be given to the commission. However, what we felt most strongly about was the manner in which the former Minister treated Dublin Corporation both as regards their role under the Act, which is very limited, and the way in which the measure was seen as a vote of no-confidence in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted in the Act is to isolate the metropolitan central area from the rest of Dublin city.  It must be remembered that a city is a living thing; all the problems which have been identified and which were cited as the justification for bringing forward this measure cannot be dealt with in isolation from the remainder of the city.  Neither can a lasting solution be achieved by the mere cosmetic injection of amenity improvements.  The fact of the matter is that a city will only live and thrive if the necessary ingredients are present.  One of the most important of these is that the business climate must be right.  All the fancy presentation in the world will simply not work if business people do not believe that adequate returns can be achieved on their investment.  And without a thriving business community, an area such as Dublin city centre cannot survive and prosper.  My colleagues on Dublin Corporation can vouch for the fact that in the current economic climate businessmen are not prepared to invest money in their property.  As a result many properties have been deteriorating.</P>
    <P>It would not require a degree in planning to realise that this approach of isolating the metropolitan central area from the rest of the city will cause difficulty. The only way of mitigating this difficulty would be to ensure maximum co-operation with statutory bodies and, in particular, the members and officials of Dublin Corporation.  For a body such as the commission to stand any chance of achieving its objectives, within the limited life allotted to it, close co-operation with other bodies and, in particular, the corporation would be essential.  This is true even now while the commission's main task is to prepare improvement schemes for the area, but when the full <Col N="523" /> range of traffic, roads, litter and refuse functions become the responsibility of the commission with effect from 1 June next, it will simply not be possible for the legislation to operate without the co-operation of Dublin Corporation.  With the best will in the world, it seems to me that a body of seven individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the city manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;many of whom are inexperienced in the practical administration of important and extensive public functions of this kind, could not be expected to perform the necessary duties adequately from 1 June without elaborate back-up and assistance from Dublin Corporation.  The only ways in which the commission could discharge these functions from 1 June would be either a transfer of all necessary staff, premises, machinery, and so on, from Dublin Corporation, or alternatively, to convince Dublin Corporation to continue to carry out the functions, but on an agency basis.  Realistically, I have to say that I am apprehensive about the continued smooth operation and discharge of these essential functions.  In this connection I understand that the members of Dublin Corporation have shown some reluctance to nominate two of their number to be members of an advisory committee with a total of 20 members whose role will be to advise the commission generally in the performance of its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDowell made an interesting and worthwhile contribution to the debate here last night.  At this point I would like to extend my congratulations to the Deputy on his maiden speech in the House.  The points he made were rather different to those of Deputy Boland in that he is opposed to the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act because the powers given to the commission are in his view inadequate in extent and duration.  I have to say here that I detect an even more antidemocratic bias than I would have <Col N="524" /> expected.  The Deputy spoke at length about what he termed positive planning, the problem of dereliction and the powers, especially compulsory purchase powers, which he feels a body such as the commission should have for a very lengthy period, if not forever.  In a nutshell, he seems to favour the abolition of Dublin Corporation at least in so far as the metropolitan central area is concerned and to put in place instead what would amount to a development corporation appointed solely by the Minister. Since he also suggested that something could be done to reduce the level of compensation payable under the planning Acts I am not at all sure that his proposals would receive an enthusiastic response from the business community. In any event I feel that many of the points raised by the Deputy are broader in scope than the terms of the motion before us.</P>
    <P>Many other important points were made last year during the debate on the Bill which I could delve into again here tonight.  However, for the purposes of the motion before the House the facts speak for themselves.  The Act has been brought into operation.  The commission are up and running and we must reject any suggestions that the Act requires further implementation.  However, we cannot divorce ourselves from reality. We all accept that improvements are needed in the appearance of the city but in the current very difficult economic circumstances and at a time when everybody accepts the need for stringency, it is absolutely essential that all programmes be looked at carefully.  There are many pressing and deserving cases, but the Government are faced with an extremely difficult budgetary situation and need to examine all claims very critically so that the tough decisions which are needed can be taken in a calm atmosphere and in a way which will ensure that all activities of Government and all expenditures are directed towards the major priorities of restoring balance to the public finances and generating confidence and growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I urge the <Col N="525" /> House to acknowledge the critical budgetary constraints facing the Government and to accept the motion as amended.  I wish to point out that every penny the Government have to spend on the Department of the Environment will be examined very carefully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We would love to have the resources to fund all projects submitted to the Department but there are only two ways in which that could be done, by cutting expenditure in another area and by taxation.  The people rejected those options and we respect their wishes.</P>

    <P>The Minister for the Environment who introduced this Bill was a former chairman of the Dublin County Council, a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and chairman of Dublin City Council who had very good experience of the pressures and <Col N="526" /> needs of the capital.  The Metropolitan Streets Commission is not unique.</P>
    <P>There was a Wide Streets Commission in the 18th and 19th centuries who were responsible for the design and layout of O'Connell Street which at one time was in the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> described as one of the widest streets in the world and the widest in Europe at the time.</P>
    <P>The work of the commission should be proceeded with because Dublin is a beautiful, well appointed city near the mountains and sea.  However, the city centre has become a honky-tonk and it is a severe criticism against An Bord Pleanála that they have allowed it to be overrun by plastic fronted burger joints. Permission for these places was turned down by the city manager on the advice of Dublin City Council but that decision was overturned on appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála should certainly be independent but we should not create organs of the State which are not accountable for their decisions; the board should be asked to account for the number of burger joints and other undesirable establishments they have permitted in Dublin city.  Where two-thirds of the members of the city council or local authority wish to overrule An Bord Pleanála, consideration should be given to allowing local authorities to have that power.  If two-thirds of a local authority require An Bord Pleanála to explain their decision, that should be the case.  Everybody seems to feel that the only people who can be got at are politicians, especially Ministers.  If a Minister or parliamentary secretary had given some of the permissions which have been approved in the major street of the capital city there would be an outcry, with all sorts of implications attached to them.  I am not alleging any impropriety on the part of An Bord Pleanála but there has certainly been a lack of judgment which should be cause for a review of the legislation.  There should be a procedure whereby An Bord Pleanála are held accountable for some of the decisions they made.</P>
    <P>If you compare Dublin city with <Col N="527" /> another Georgian city &mdash; Edinburgh &mdash; it is very disappointing to see what has happened in many of Dublin's main streets.  Dublin was the second city of the Empire, Edinburgh was the third, and in the 19th century London, Dublin and Edinburgh were probably the great centres of trade.  Those of us who visit Edinburgh for rugby internationals or other reasons observe that the Georgian influence has been maintained to a greater extent than in Dublin.  The local authority or central Government by the appointment of An Bord Pleanála have allowed developments to take place in our city centre, mainly in O'Connell Street, which would not be allowed in any other city of the standing of Dublin and certainly not in a Georgian city like Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>One problem we have is that our city councillors do not take their macro duties seriously.  Councillors are very good at getting things done in their own electoral areas, and I should point out that I am the only member of Dublin City Council present &mdash; sorry, I look at the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and say I am one of two members of Dublin City Council here present.  Councillors on Dublin City Council do a good job for their electorate. However, at a level of planning the long term lay-out and design of the city, councillors have failed mainly because too much politics has been introduced at City Hall level and not just in the current situation where Fianna Fáil have a majority.  For many years past people have been seeing the city council as a mini Dáil and an opportunity to debate all sorts of issues.  Really the city council and their standing committees, who do an excellent job in other areas, should concern themselves more directly with the policy and planning of what should be going on in our capital not just now but for the future.</P>
    <P>Many things need to be done and we miss many touches which other cities have.  For instance, the introduction of searchlights to highlight the Ha'penny Bridge was a welcome development. <Col N="528" /> However, we could have water cascades on the Liffey and the canals, and more could be done particularly in Georgian Dublin.  We do not use our imagination as do people in other cities.</P>
    <P>At some stage the role of the Metropolitan Streets Commission might be enlarged or, alternately, they might goad the city council into having a look at the whole question of dereliction between the canals.  One of the problems is the many plans for roadways which the corporation have had for some considerable time.  Why do the Minister and the Department come along and recommend that we put that matter into the hands of the Metropolitan Streets Commission? Why does the Minister recommend putting the examination of many such issues into their hands or into the hands of a transport authority?  It is because the councillors who are elected to make policy have not got the guts to implement that policy.  I am one of them.  I am not leaving anybody out or casting my net of criticism just on others.  When we tried to introduce some sort of roadway to Clanbrassil Street there was a big problem. That proposal could be amended to meet local issues, but there was a hue and cry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy who has just made his maiden speech will know that he should not interrupt others particularly when he does not know what he is talking about.  The city council simply could not get their act together and sit down and decide what they thought was best.  Then we had the eastern bypass in Deputy's McDowell's constituency and at every step of the way, every single group, resident, individual and local organisation had to have a say. How are we to get things for the common good if every hundred yards we have to appease every single voter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had nothing to do with promising anybody any grants during the election.  The problem is that every hundred yards they are being pandered to by public representatives, be they councillors or TDs.  Until we ourselves have the guts to set down the policy and hear the arguments for and against and, having heard the arguments for and against, make our minds up on what is the best policy rather than simply what policy suits the greatest number of voters, we will continue in situations where power is taken away from the representatives by ourselves under pressure and given to An Bord Pleanála, transport authorities, the Metropolitan Streets Commission and others.  This is the difficulty we face.  O'Connell Street was once frequented for window shopping on a Sunday night by engaged couples and all sorts of people who could go down O'Connell Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks that is what they were doing in the shop-ways he is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was frequented on Sunday nights for window shopping by engaged couples and people who enjoyed walking through the city.  Now the centre city is just a city of locked-up premises, or where they are not locked-up people stand in doorways carrying on precarious sort of businesses while youngsters move in and out of chip shops and one-armed bandit joints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the proposals which have been put forward, particularly the proposal to have mobile police groups with a facility on the main island of O'Connell Street where callers could come in, could be considered.  The street could be made again a street where people could be happy to walk instead of as happens at present where visitors to the city are warned by a certain hotel not to wander out after 9.30 p.m.  The main street of our <Col N="530" /> city could be a fine thoroughfare where people would feel safe as they walk along it.  Included in the proposals is a suggestion to put Garda kiosks where people could go for advice or to report matters and where gardaí would be present so that people would feel safe.  That idea should not be dismissed.  It could be very useful and beneficial and could give people a certain sense of security in the centre city.</P>
    <P>O'Connell Street in particular is without doubt an architectural blot in that it lacks a monument on the lines of Nelson's Pillar.  If you compare older photographs of the street with more recent ones it is apparent that something is missing from the streetscape.  I hope the proposal to go ahead with some sort of monument on that site is pursued.  That could be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>How will we pay for all of these things? I think there will be a major influx of tourists into the city.  The presence on the Metropolitan Streets Commission of people involved strongly in the tourism industry is an indication of the way they are thinking and of the sort of attractions that can be incorporated in the streets which would attract tourists.  Revenue from such tourists would, in turn, make a major contribution towards the costs of such work.</P>
    <P>Despite the presence in the House of a new party, the Progressive Democrats, I feel very strongly it is time we named more of our monuments after people who gave their lives to building up this city and this State.  Would it be too much to consider naming the new construction the Cosgrave-de Valera Monument?  Would that be too much to expect in our capital city?  Such does not seem to be a problem in any other capital city in the world. Even in Paris where the people are notoriously republican, major buildings are named after even recent holders of political office.  The two people I have named, now no longer with us, made a major contribution to the development of the State, and that should be borne in mind when we are thinking about the main street of our capital city.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will find it possible <Col N="531" /> to allow the Metropolitan Streets Commission to go ahead with their work. There is a huge job to be done.  If we improve the environment in general in the main street of our city, we can help to clear out many of the shysters, drug pushers and others who hang about in doorways.  The streets are not frequented by the sort of people who in times gone by frequented them.  If the streets are made attractive again that practice will return.  Therefore, I hope that the Minister will find it possible to allow the commission go ahead.  I do not think that in essence it will cost as much money as the Minister might feel it will.  I think that tourism will contribute to the cost.  I hope the Minister will do everything in his power to ensure that the commission go about their work as a matter of urgency rather than putting in its way any obstacles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Mitchell for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I thought for one moment that the commission was going to achieve many of the very laudable aims to improve the visual quality of Dublin city I would embrace wholeheartedly their setting up but one has to question their potential and their capacity to achieve the aims that have been laid down.  One has to question the role of the corporation, the dual role of the city manager who is also a member of the commission, the transferring of a principal officer from the parks department of Dublin County Council to the commission and not replacing him or making any funds available to carry on the excellent work that needs to be done in the county and the taking over of some of the functions of the Dublin Transport Authority before it even comes into operation.  I ask the Minister to consider, now that the general guidelines of what is necessary to be achieved have been formulated, addressing the Dublin city council and outlining his priorities under the guidelines that everybody believes are necessary for the <Col N="532" /> centre of Dublin.  He should direct the corporation, in many cases by order under existing legislation, to proceed with what needs to be done.  Unfortunately, I get the impression that we are setting up another layer of bureaucracy and another cost centre.</P>
    <P>If the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission are to be responsible for such matters as refuse collection, road traffic signals, maintenance, repairs and technical functions, there will be an administrative arm to oversee that but I presume they will not have to acquire all the equipment and expertise that will entail, that they will parcel that work back to the corporation who supposedly have this responsibility at the moment and are capable of carrying out those functions.  If it is really a question of pointing the finger at various inept planning decisions of the last 20 years one can endeavour to redress much of that without another great bureaucratic layer emerging in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know the problems of Dublin city council and of the county council, the dual managerial function and the great layers of overheads that exist there already.  I am somewhat confused also about the capacity of this commission to function when the corporation are in the process of a review of their city development plan.  Will there not be contradictions there and where will the commission interface with the city and county planner and his functions?  The city council will make decisions and designate areas for certain zones and so on. We are having a great debate about putting more residential development into the centre of Dublin.  While one arm of the system is doing that we are endeavouring to set up a commission that is to be abolished in three years' time.  This commission would not seem to have the capacity to achieve the very laudable aims that have been laid down.</P>
    <P>There is something very odd about the &ldquo;funny&rdquo; money that has been allocated in the form of £3.4 million as originally announced, without any budgetary considerations to its implementation and without telling us where this money will <Col N="533" /> come from.  Whatever percentage of it will go in administrative overheads will be a take-out of the moneys that could have been given to the corporation with a directive from the Minister to achieve what this commission are setting about achieving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruairí Quinn spoke about Patrick Shaffrey, the planner, drawing up some excellent programmes of work to be done.  There is no reason the corporation cannot embrace that report and implement its contents.  The Minister should look at the position again and try to introduce many of the recommendations that are embodied in the proposals for the commission without setting up a commission which will supposedly self-destruct in three years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to a very good Department.  I congratulate also his Minister of State and wish them both well.  However, I would like to commiserate with the Minister of State in that in only his first days in office he is being spancelled.  He is Minister of State with responsibility for work and renewal but the Government are going to strangle at birth this Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  This is being done in a vindictive way just as our Bill was opposed in this House in a very vindictive way.  We tried to get it through prior to the summer.  We all realise how bad the situation is in Dublin city.  The Opposition opposed it and we had to leave it until the autumn to pass the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State asked what is the reason for putting down this motion.  The answer to that is self-evident.  We flushed the Government out.  They have no intention of implementing this legislation.  It is a fine piece of innovative legislation designed to bring some life back to our capital city but looking across the House one does not find much reason for hoping for innovation.  There is no imagination there and very little else.  One can well understand why Fianna Fáil oppose this legislation.  Their attitude is regrettable because the legislation is in tandem with <Col N="534" /> the Custom House Docks Authority and with the designated areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad he is being kept spancelled and quiet.  I can well appreciate the Minister not understanding this legislation.  He is probably not long enough in the Department or maybe he does not know our capital city well enough.  There are proposals, as the Minister knows well, for a proposed trade centre and conference centre and for a major international hotel on the Custom House Docks site.  To attract that kind of business to a city it is important that the rest of the city look well, something that we as citizens of the city and of the nation should be proud of.  I invite the Minister, as I did myself one Saturday morning at eight o'clock, to walk from the top of Grafton Street through the town and to look at it when there is no traffic and very few people around.</P>

The corporation have been in control of these streets for a long number of years but there has been a gradual deterioration of our standards.  When I was young O'Connell Street was a street that Dubliners and everybody else was proud of.  It was the widest and the finest street in Europe and it had all the qualities we all liked but look at it now.  Can anyone of us honestly say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Bill is not intended to remove the responsibility totally from the local authority. We realise that local authorities have a myriad of other jobs to do.  From time to time we should look to commissions such as this to get work done and done quickly.  In three years the city centre will be handed back in mint condition to the city authority, so the standards will be uplifted.  I can see the Minister laughing.

      <P>This is to get the work done.  I weep at the concern on the far side of the House whose Members are saying that we are removing from the local authority their powers.  In 1982 they were responsible for an Urban Renewal Bill which gave them the authority to set up a body and within that Bill to set up as many bodies as they wanted without reference back to the local authorities, or indeed to this House.  When I was putting through the Urban Renewal Bill last year, Deputy Ray Burke wanted to introduce an amendment which would have allowed this to happen and I refused.  If we want to set up a commission of any kind we should get the approval of this House.  The Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 and while in Opposition last year proposed, at the signature of a Minister, <Col N="537" /> that this be done.  They now have the audacity to come in and lecture this side of the House as to what we are doing to this poor unfortunate local authority, depriving them of their powers and they themselves without reference back to this House were doing that.  Let us cut out this type of sham.  Let us be honest about it.  The only reason they are opposing this legislation is that the Taoiseach and their leader did not himself bring it forward. That is the reason.</P>

It is said to be ill-conceived and to be depriving the unfortunate local authority of their powers.  The facts are at variance with that.  The commission members are all eminent people.  They are not political hacks; they are people who have made a contribution.  The city manager is one of the members of this commission.  He agreed to serve on it. There is no question of the local authority having no voice or say.  They are part of the commission by way of their city and county manager.</P>

Now I notice the deathbed conversion and that they are trying to get the country's finances right.  I am glad that the former Taoiseach and our new Leader have said that we on this side of the House will support the Government in this endeavour.  I am glad that the Government are converted to some form of monetary stability.  We are not asking for anything which was not in the current abridged Book of Estimates.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Connolly, talked about the business people.  It is the business people who tend to keep our city alive.  They have welcomed this commission and if it is not proceeded with, there will be no more disappointed people than they.  They see this as their lifeline to expanding business, leading to a greater influx of people into the capital city, wanting to play a part in the real life there.  What makes a city is the number of people that come to it.  The general complaint is about shutters, about vandalism and all the problems that urban decay brings.  People tend to go elsewhere. This commission will bring real <Col N="540" /> life back into the central spine of our capital city, with the quays as a designated area, the Custom House Docks site a major international development. The Minister is well aware that plenty of interest is being shown in this site.  We all welcome that interest but it does require that the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission would be favourably disposed to all of this.  I appeal to the Government to make the necessary funding available to have this work continued. It is not a political issue.  It is a development we believe will be good for the country as a whole, for our capital city, bringing business and a re-invigorated atmosphere to our capital city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy David Andrews gave me notice of his intention to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Our time is limited.  May I suggest that the Deputy takes six minutes and the Minister four minutes.  Is that satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would like to give one of my constituency colleagues some of my time to say a few words, so I will be brief.  We all know what this dispute is about.  It is a commercial dispute between a State company, the B &amp; I, and the private company, Sealink. Having regard to the failure of the talks yesterday it appears that the resolution to the problem may be found elsewhere. I believe it is unfair to invite the Minister for Communications to get involved in this dispute because the solution lies with the two companies.  Far be it from me to take a jaundiced or prejudiced view of <Col N="543" /> this matter, but I respectfully suggest that B &amp; I are adopting a dog in the manger attitude to Sealink who are operating from Dún Laoghaire port.</P>
      <P>This dispute arose from the failure to bring into Dún Laoghaire the <i>Stena Sailor,</i> a supplementary roll on roll off vessel to the <i>St. Columba</i>.  The purpose of the invitation to bring in the <i>Stena Sailor</i> by Sealink was to leave the <i>St. Columba</i> free for tourist traffic and to use the <i>Stena Sailor</i> for haulage and heavy goods vehicles.  I am not blaming the Minister for this refusal, because I believe B &amp; I are operating part of an alleged agreement between themselves and Sealink in a very unfair way.  We see the failure of the <i>Stena Sailor</i> to come into Dún Laoghaire as an attack on the future development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  As a long serving Deputy in the constituency I have called for a harbour authority on the one hand and a unified car ferry terminal on the other.</P>
      <P>We in Dún Laoghaire do not have any row with B &amp; I but we are concerned with their failure to provide a haulage vessel and penalising Sealink for providing a roll on roll off vessel.  I am asking B &amp; I to look at this area in the context of the future development of Dún Laoghaire as a commercial harbour with a unified car ferry terminal.  The failure to allow the <i>Stena Sailor</i> in is a symbol of what we consider to be an attack on the future development of Dún Laoghaire. The consequences of this refusal may have a ripple effect on Sealink's commercial attitude to the future development of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospect of Sealink totally withdrawing their operations from Dún Laoghaire is too horrific to contemplate. We are talking about a workforce on land and at sea in excess of 400 people.  We are talking about the future development of Dún Laoghaire as a commercial centre.  We are talking about Dún Laoghaire in the context of tourism &mdash; its hotels, guesthouses, the already severely pressed local shop owners and storekeepers and so on.  These are what we consider to be the drastic consequences <Col N="544" /> of the refusal to allow the <i>Stena Sailor</i> to come into Dún Laoghaire.  It is more than a refusal to allow a ship to come into port.  It symbolises all those elements to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we operate an open ports policy.  I understand that to mean that a commercial operator can bring in as much shipping traffic as he wants.  It is very unfair to victimise Sealink, as is happening at present arising out of a dispute to which they do not want to be party and I want to remind the House that the future of Dún Laoghaire depends on the urgent resolution of this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to correct any misconception which may have arisen in relation to the action the Minister for Communications took last week of requesting the Commissioners for Public Works not to provide facilities in Dún Laoghaire for the Sealink vessel the <i>Stena Sailor.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>B &amp; I had informed the Minister that the Sealink proposal to operate this additional vessel into Dún Laoghaire was in breach of the agreement which exists <Col N="545" /> between B &amp; I and Sealink.  As the House is aware, the ferry operations of the two companies on the Irish Sea are the subject of a revenue pooling and capacity sharing agreement which both companies entered into last year covering the two year period 1986-87.</P>
    <P>The Minister was and remains anxious that the issues in dispute between the two shipping companies on this matter should be resolved between the parties themselves as rapidly as possible.  He was aware that discussions at a very senior level between the two companies had been arranged for yesterday, 24 March.</P>
    <P>He took the view therefore that, pending the outcome of those discussions, the <i>status quo</i> in relation to shipping services into Dún Laoghaire should be preserved. His views in this regard were conveyed to Sealink and the Commissioners of Public Works.  Sealink, nonetheless, indicated their intention of proceeding with the introduction of the service in advance of the discussions arranged.  At the Minister's request, the Office of Public Works indicated to Sealink that in that event facilities would not be made available for the Sealink vessel.</P>
    <P>Sealink were accordingly aware in good time of the Minister's position and that of the Office of Public Works.  The Minister was, therefore, disappointed that Sealink chose, nonetheless, to sail the vessel in question into Dún Laoghaire on Friday last, 20 March.  In line with the position which had been indicated earlier to Sealink, offloading facilities were not provided for the vessel by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Later on Friday, representatives of <Col N="546" /> Sealink sought a meeting with officials of the Department.  At that meeting, the Sealink representatives confirmed their agreement to discussions with B &amp; I on Tuesday, 24 March 1987, on this issue. They also asked if the Minister would agree to the unloading of the vessel, on the basis of an undertaking from Sealink that the vessel would not operate into Dún Laoghaire pending consideration by him of the outcome of the discussions arranged for 24 March.</P>
    <P>On the basis of that undertaking, and having regard to the difficulties which had arisen for those with cargo on board the <i>Stena Sailor,</i> the Minister requested the Office of Public Works to provide the necessary unloading facilities for the vessel.</P>
    <P>I understand that the talks held yesterday between the two companies were not conclusive, that both companies are considering their position, and that further talks are envisaged.  The Minister expects to hear from both sides when talks have been concluded and he will consider the position further at that stage.</P>

      <P>As recently as 1985, the fines for allowing animals to wander on the public road were substantially increased.  The Animals Act, 1985, increased the maximum fine from a nominal 10p, in existence since 1851, to £150 for a first such offence and to £350 for a subsequent offence. These fines also apply to the offence of turning animals loose on the road.  The previous fine in this case was 50p.</P>
      <P>The maximum fine for poundbreaking was increased from £50 to £750 in the 1985 Act and pound fees were increased in the Pounds Regulations, 1985, to a level that should closely correspond with the cost to the local authority of impounding animals.  I am happy that the above fines are adequate and I have no plans at present to increase them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in regard to the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>1.  Since 1968, when the courses for the group day vocational certificate and the intermediate certificate were brought into co-ordination, it has been generally accepted that, in the case of subjects which are common to both examinations, the group certificate syllabus, followed for two years, is about ? of the corresponding intermediate certificate syllabus, followed for three years.</P>
      <P>There are still some subjects which are uniquely provided at group certificate (GC) level.  These are shorthand, typewriting and the practical examinations in cookery, needlework and laundrywork.</P>
      <P>2.  The syllabuses for the GC examination are set out in Memo V. 50, &ldquo;Rules and Programme for the Day Vocational Certificate Examination&rdquo;.  This memo is supplied to schools each year, free of charge.</P>
      <P>3.  The Department of Education is responsible for the syllabuses.</P>
      <P>4.  All recognised pupils who have followed the approved course for two years and are eligible on age grounds may be entered for the group certificate examinations. Some pupils take it as a terminal examination; others may take further examinations.  Candidates normally take the GC exam at the age of 14 or 15.  A significant number of candidates sit GC shorthand and typewriting examinations post-leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  The rules provide that a pupil must follow an approved course.  An approved course must include the subjects of at <Col N="450" /> least one of the &ldquo;groups&rdquo; of subjects specified in the rules, as well as Irish. English and civics.  Notwithstanding this, a candidate who is entered for examination in even one subject will be issued with a result and a certificate (provided he attains 10 per cent of the marks of better) in respect of that subject.</P>
    <P>6.  Many schools enter two streams of candidates for examination in secretarial subjects, mainly shorthand and typing. One stream would be aged 14 or 15 years, i.e. the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; type of candidate; the other stream would be aged 18 or 19 years and would usually be &ldquo;adding&rdquo; shorthand and typing to the subjects already secured in the leaving certificate.  The Department also offers technical schools (TS) examinations in secretarial subjects at a number of levels.</P>
    <P>7.  No.  The &ldquo;pass&rdquo; rates do vary between subjects, but it does not follow that the level of intelligence needed to pass varies widely from subject to subject.</P>
    <P>8.  The Department of Education is responsible for setting the group certificate examination papers.</P>
    <P>9.  The arrangements for marking are the same for group certificate as for the intermediate and leaving (IC and LC) examinations.</P>
    <P>In regard to superintending the position is that the Department directly appoints the superintendents of the LC-IC examinations; the GC superintendents are appointed by the appropriate vocational education committee (VEC) or by the school authority in a case where&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(i)  a non-VEC school is involved, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the VEC has declined to make the appointment.</P>
    <P>In all cases the Department specifies that the person appointed should not be on the staff of the school.  Where the appointment is not made by the VEC the Department will refund the fee involved, on request.</P>
    <P>10.  Originally the group certificate examination was taken only in vocational schools.  The Department agreed that the <Col N="451" /> VEC, being the local education authority for the schools concerned, should assist in the appointment of superintendents.  It is only since 1968 that non-VEC schools have become involved in taking the group certificate examinations.  The trend for non-VEC schools to make their own appointments is a trend which has only developed in the last ten years or so as, with the increasing participation of non-VEC schools, some VECs have declined to make appointments for schools under different management.</P>
