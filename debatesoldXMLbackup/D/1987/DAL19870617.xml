      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12, 13 and 14.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and not later than 12.30 a.m. tomorrow and business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight tonight.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 13 shall be taken not later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 11 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that all Stages of No. 14 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 12.00 midnight tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which, shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
      <P>Private Members' Business shall be No. 25.</P>

      <P>I find it most unsatisfactory that two Bills of this kind &mdash; the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill and the Tourist Traffic Bill &mdash; should be taken <Col N="2186" /> in their entirety in just a few hours tonight and, in particular, that the Tourist Traffic Bill, which deals with tourism policy which one would think was a matter of some importance, is taken in one hour, between 11 p.m. and 12 midnight tonight, and that no amendments can be made on that Bill or on the other Bill unless in the name of the Minister.  All this is apparently because of the unwillingness of the House to sit during the months of July or September, so far as one can judge.  This is not satisfactory, particularly when taken in the context that the rest of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill has to be finished by 7 p.m. today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill is simply an enabling Bill to increase the amount of expenditure at the disposal of Bord Fáilte.  This is a routine enabling, minor piece of legislation.  The Second Stage of the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill has been dealt with by the House, and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, as everybody knows, has to be through by a certain date.  The procedure proposed here is not unreasonable and is one which has been followed on countless occasions in this House, many a time when Deputy O'Malley was a Member of the Government or Government Chief Whip and proposed exactly the sort of arrangement we are proposing now.</P>

      <P>I am simply asking if the Whips of the Government and the main Opposition parties would reconsider this matter and extend the discussions on the Finance Bill from 8.30 <Col N="2189" /> p.m. until midnight because of the importance of this legislation.  Would they reconsider the guillotine which has been imposed on this most important Bill, particularly today's sections which are of vital consequence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the reply by the Taoiseach to Deputy O'Malley, does he think it right and proper that the Bill dealing with tourism, to which he referred as a fairly minor matter, should be taken in one hour without any limitation on the length of speeches?  This effectively means that parties and Deputies generally will not be able to comment on the measure because the limitation of one hour means there will be no democratic participation.  It would not be unreasonable &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the summary scheduling of the Order of Business is desirable and essential, otherwise we will have dissatisfaction every day?  It is unreasonable to expect the House to debate any Bill &mdash; particularly a Bill of significance &mdash; in one hour.  It means the Minister can speak for half an hour and one Opposition spokesman can speak for the remaining half hour.  Nobody can accept that and I ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider my remarks as a genuine attempt to be constructive.  Everybody wants to particpate in the processes of this House but the Order of Business means we cannot do so.  It is not reasonable, fair or democratic and the Taoiseach and everybody else knows that.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on my remarks.</P>

When will the Government meet their commitment as promised in their recent election manifesto to decriminalise homelessness by <Col N="2194" /> repealing the Vagrancy Act, 1824?  I wish to raise on the Adjournment the failure of the Department of Justice to adequately investigate a serious incident of assault involving members of the prison staff at Mountjoy in September 1986.</P>

Those consultations are taking place at this very moment.  As soon as they are completed the Bill will be brought forward.</P>

      <P>May I inquire from the Taoiseach if he proposes to intervene to change the present situation whereby Whips' meetings in this House are held between only the Government Whip and the Fine Gael Whip?  Does he propose to restore the situation that existed here for upwards of 60 years whereby Whips' meetings were held between the Whips of all the parties in the House?  In restoring the previous situation, the difficulties <Col N="2195" /> of trying to get information on the Order of Business, as was the case today as well as on other days, could be avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point.  The Whips are not discussing anything. That is why the inquiry has to be made here.  By virtue of the silly answer the Taoiseach has just given, it is obvious that he approves of and wishes to retain the present situation.  That is part of a larger picture which is fairly ominous and about which quite a number of people are becoming rather concerned.  It does not just include the members of the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 12, but in Chapter II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>12. &mdash;(1) Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1984, is hereby amended by the insertion, after subsection (1), of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1A)  (a)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), a qualifying company whose trade consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on of qualifying shipping activities within the meaning of section 26 (1) of the Finance Act, 1987, may have one or more subsidiaries which do not satisfy either of the conditions in paragraph (b) of subsection (1): Provided that the condition mentioned in paragraph (b) of this subsection is satisfied.</P>
      <P>(b)  The said condition is that the subsidiary or each subsidiary is a company which exists for the purpose of carrying on a trade consisting wholly or mainly of the carrying on of qualifying shipping activities.</P>
      <P>(c)  In paragraph (b)&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualifying shipping activities&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 26 (1) of the Finance Act, 1987, as if, in the definition of a &ldquo;qualifying ship&rdquo; for the purposes of the said meaning, paragraphs (a) and (b) of that definition were deleted, and</P>
      <P>(d)  In this subsection, the question of whether a trade consists wholly or mainly of the carrying on of qualifying shipping activities shall, with any necessary modifications, be construed in accordance with the proviso to section 16 (2).&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1984, is hereby amended, by the substitution for paragraph 1 of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;1.  The shares issued by the qualifying company may, instead of, or as well as, being issued for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1) (b) of section 12, be issued for the purpose of raising money for a qualifying trade which is being carried on by a subsidiary (other than a subsidiary by virtue of section 26 (1A) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1987) or which such a subsidiary intends to carry on; and where shares are so issued subsections (1) (c), (4), (5), (7) (b) and (8) of section 12 shall have effect as if references to the company were or, as the case may be, included, references to the subsidiary.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment and its related one, No. 18, is to provide that the holding of a foreign shipping subsidiary will not debar Irish shipping companies, being brought within the business expansion scheme under the provisions of section 11 of the Bill, from being qualifying companies for the purpose of the scheme.  At present companies wishing to avail of the provisions of the business expansion scheme are precluded under section 26 of the Finance Act, 1984 from holding foreign subsidiaries unless such subsidiaries exist solely for the purpose <Col N="2207" /> of carrying on any trade which consists solely of any one or more of the following trading operations: the purchase of goods or materials for use by the qualifying company or its subsidiaries, the sale of goods or materials produced by the qualifying company or its subsidiaries or the rendering of services to or on behalf of the qualifying company or its subsidiaries. This condition is considered to be too restrictive in so far as are concerned shipping activities which can be carried on on a global basis, with ships constantly traversing international sea routes.  It may be necessary for a shipping company to have foreign subsidiaries carrying on qualifying shipping activities which would not meet the existing requirement of the business expansion scheme &mdash; that the shipping activities should be carried on wholly or mainly in the State.  The extension of the provisions of the business expansion scheme to shipping is one of a number of incentives for the maintenance and development of a strategic shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it has been decided that the holding of a foreign shipping company, as a subsidiary, will not debar a qualifying Irish shipping company from the provisions of the business expansion scheme if that foreign shipping company would &mdash; if resident in the State and operating a qualifying ship &mdash; meet the requirements of the provisions of the business expansion scheme by reason of the fact that it carried on qualifying shipping activities.  Provision is being introduced into the business expansion scheme to prevent any money raised under the scheme by a qualifying shipping company from being used directly or indirectly for the benefit of such a foreign subsidiary.  This qualification is considered essential to conform to and maintain one of the basic principles of the business expansion scheme, namely, that investment should be channelled into businesses operating within the State.  If this principle were not rigidly adhered to in effect the Irish taxpayer would be placed in the position of subventing the <Col N="2208" /> expansion of employment opportunities abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to debate this amendment because it arises from sections we have passed already without debate.  In that sense it places us in a somewhat awkward position. On the face of it I have no objection at all to the amendment.  It seems to be one that we can welcome.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the provisions of the business expansion scheme to the shipping area and also the extension of the 10 per cent tax regime to shipbuilding, as announced by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matters to which I will return on Report Stage in relation to the business expansion scheme and the later sections dealing with the shipbuilding industry.  I am not too clear on how ships being built for the fishing industry will be dealt with.  As I understand it one of the conditions of the business expansion scheme is that an appropriate grant will be given by the relevant grant-aiding authority, whether that be Údarás na Gaeltachta or the Industrial Development Authority.  So far as I can ascertain ships being built for the fishing industry are excluded.  It seems to me that it would be well worth investigating a proposition in which a number of people in one of the fishing towns on our coast could come together and invest for the purchase of a fishing vessel.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the combination of this and the link with the grand-aid mechanism.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether fishing vessels are excluded from the provisions of the business expansion scheme as a result of the tie-up which I suggest.  If so, would he consider putting down an amendment on Report Stage allowing for the possibility of community-based investment in the fishing industry for the purchase of a vessel.  There is a number of people who might be interested in becoming involved in this and it would be well worth investigating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat inhibited because I cannot revert to sections already passed <Col N="2209" /> but we will be returning to it on Report Stage.  I have no enormous objection but there are two matters on which I want clarification and in respect of which I may be putting down amendments.  The first is the issue I raised in regard to the fishing industry.  The second is: does the Minister envisage any possibility of the business expansion scheme applying in this and other areas, within the provisions of the sections we have passed, in circumstances in which the appropriate Government agency do not grant aid?  It seems to me that there are circumstances in which the grant aid mechanism, as a criterion, will be difficult to apply.  There may be circumstances in which one of the grant-aiding agencies, when involved in consultancies, would be in direct competition with people who might want to set up consultancies under the provisions of the business expansion scheme, where consultancies would be investing in projects, or advising in projects, under the provisions of the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a whole area there about which I would like the Minister to say a few words but I am not opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might reply to a couple of the points Deputy Noonan has made, first, the ships that will qualify are defined in section 26 to which we will come later &mdash; but they are mainly cargo, passenger and sea-going ships.  It excludes fishing vessels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the fishing industry is excluded.  The Deputy will appreciate, as will other Members of the House, that the fishing industry is fairly substantially supported at present by way of the grants system operated by An Bord lascaigh Mhara, FEOGA and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the question <Col N="2210" /> of qualification for grant.  In the case of fishing qualifying under the provisions of the business expansion scheme, they would have to qualify for a grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I understand it there are two different investment stimuli being given to the shipbuilding industry: one is the application of the 10 per cent tax regime and the other is linked to that so that shipping activity will be an appropriate investment for the business expansion scheme.  I do not suggest that the 10 per cent tax regime should be extended to fishing vessels. There is merit in examining whether, even though there is an exclusion in section 26, the business expansion scheme should not be allowed to apply to fishing vessels so that there could be a Community involvement in the purchase of fishing vessels, and investment would come from the Community rather than the taxpayer, or at least there is an alternative other than putting in BIM grants, which are taxpayers' money, to get investment in Killybegs from people who are interested in Killybegs and the fishing industry.  They would get the appropriate tax breaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point that can be considered but in relation to what we are doing at present it does not arise, because fishing is excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with amendment No. 24 I would like, with your permission, to indicate at this stage my acceptance in principle of amendment No. 35 in the name of Deputy McDowell and amendment No. 36 in the names of Deputy Noonan and Deputy Desmond. It is possible that these amendments may not be reached this morning.  These amendments propose that any regulation extending the list of accountable persons in section 13 should first be approved by a resolution of Dáil Éireann and I am agreeable to this.  I am not fully satisfied <Col N="2211" /> with the wording of the amendments, however, so I will be bringing in an amendment on Report Stage to provide accordingly.  I also accept the principle of Deputy Noonan's amendment No. 34 which I assume means that any extension of accountable persons should be confined to public sector bodies.  I consider, however, that it is not necessary to provide statutorily for this, given that with my acceptance of amendments Nos. 35 and 36 it will be necessary for the Dáil to approve in advance any extension of the list of accountable persons.  I assure Deputy Noonan that it is my intention that any extension of the list of accountable persons which I may propose in the future will be confined to public sector bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is very welcome.  I thank the Minister.  That improves the Bill.  I ask him to incorporate an amendment, along the lines of amendment No. 34 in the text of the Bill. He will have noticed that The Workers' Party, in the names of Deputies Tomás Mac Giolla, Proinsias De Rossa, Joe Sherlock and Pat McCartan, have already sought an amendment to extend the withholding tax to the whole private sector.  As the section is drafted, it is possible that the Minister, by order, could require, for example, John Sisk &amp; Company to pay 35 per cent to the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of an architect or an engineer employed by them.  I do not think that is the intention of the Minister.  I can see that the Minister would want to apply the withholding tax to the new Bord Glas when it is set up, and that is not in the list of accountable persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make that change. It is a simple drafting change in the Bill so that the Minister, or any of his successors, does not have the capacity under this Bill to extend it by regulations to anybody who is paying a bill to anybody else.  One could end up by changing the definition of &ldquo;specified person&rdquo; as well and one would have to withhold 35 per cent of what one would pay to the window <Col N="2212" /> cleaner and send it to the Revenue Commissioners. If we are to move along those lines it should be in primary legislation presented to the House in a Finance Bill. It should not be done by regulations.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance of my amendment together with amendments couched in the same way by Deputy McDowell and Deputy Desmond.  In accepting amendment No. 34 I ask the Minister to make the actual change on Report Stage because it is a serious issue and financial legislation should not be beyond doubt.  While I accept the assurance of the Minister, I think he should make the change.</P>

      <P>I am a little confused as to the manner in which we are proceeding.  The Minister has jumped ahead to amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 36.  I agree with amendments Nos. 35 and 36 in regard to ministerial orders.  I hope the Minister will accept that amendment in the wording in which it is put down, because it is positive wording.  In other words, if the Minister wishes to make a regulation he must bring it before the House and it must be approved by the House.  There is another procedure for this and the Minister may intend to reword it.  A period of 21 days is given and if the House does not reverse the ministerial order in that time it goes through without being debated in the House.</P>

      <P>However, the point about that amendment was that what is good for one employer should be good for all employers.  The general intention of the withholding tax is to extend the PAYE principle to as many areas as possible. This is what we like about the withholding tax.  A principle which has been applied for the past 30 years to workers on wages and salaries is now beginning to be applied to self employed people.  If that principle is accepted for the public sector employers &mdash; the Civil Service, or semi-State bodies, or whatever &mdash; they are employers who pay fees to consultants or professional people in the course of their trade or business.  If it is right for them to deduct a withholding tax &mdash; and I say it is a reasonable principle &mdash;why would the Minister not be allowed to extend it?  He can wait to see how it operates this year and next year in the public sector and he should have full power to extend it to other employers as well.  Deputy Noonan thinks the very idea is so appalling that it should not even be considered by the Minister.</P>

That is why I agree with that amendment.  The Minister should then be allowed the full scope of application.  I also have an amendment down about the VHI, as has Deputy Desmond, and they should be included.  The Minister might wish to include many others as time goes on and he should not be precluded from including employers in the private sector.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy Mac Giolla.  I want to advise Members that while the Minister referred to certain amendments which we have not yet come to which he is accepting, naturally I allowed a brief discussion on that aspect of the matter but the Chair is obliged to proceed <i>seriatim</i> with the amendments before me.  The next amendment before us is amendment No. 24 in the name of Deputy McDowell. We must proceed in an orderly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), to delete lines 3 to 9, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a sum equivalent to one-fifth of the amount of the relevant payment (excluding from the amount of the payment any value added tax);&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of this amendment is to delete from the definition of appropriate tax to be withheld the standard rate of income tax which is now 35 per cent and to substitute for it 20 per cent, one-fifth of the amount of the payment, excluding VAT.  This raises the issue as to what rate of deduction should be made if a withholding tax is to be implemented.  I want to make it very clear that my party are totally opposed to this tax in principle and in its effects.  Therefore, while I am suggesting a lesser rate, it is for the purpose of mitigating what I consider to be <Col N="2215" /> an undesirable tax.  It should not be taken that I am going along with the principle of the tax.  The rate of 35 per cent, viewed in any way, is penal to the point of absurdity.</P>
    <P>It seems a logical error is being made by the Minister and is being accepted somewhat unquestioningly by some of the media &mdash; and Deputy Mac Giolla reechoed it again in error &mdash; that this is merely applying to the professional sector the same conditions as apply to the PAYE sector.  It is doing no such thing. It is effectively putting the professional sector onto permanent emergency tax.  It is no fairer to do that to the companies who are providing professional services than it is to do it to the PAYE workers. Deputy Mac Giolla would not ask that PAYE workers be put onto emergency tax.  There is no excuse for saying to a company, all of whose directors are paying PAYE on a current year basis, that a withholding tax should be imposed at a rate which is very damaging to their cashflow, to their working capital and so on.  The proposal here is simply to reduce the amount of the withholding tax, bad and all as it is, to a more manageable amount.</P>
    <P>Like every other Finance spokesman in this House, I have been inundated with representations from various bodies &mdash; perhaps Deputy Mac Giolla has not been &mdash; in relation to this tax.  They pointed out in detailed form the financial effect that the imposition of this tax would have on their viability.  The Minister thinks they are exaggerating.  I do not accept that but he is entitled to his view.  In all the major cases of hardship and of danger to employment, as I see it, the margins of profit of large engineering companies, consultancy firms and architects firms are very much less than 35 per cent and in most cases they are between 5 per cent and 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that we take into account that income taxation or corporate taxation has never in any other part of our taxation code been imposed on gross receipts because the very nature of corporation tax is that it relates to <Col N="2216" /> profit and income tax relates to the surplus a person has after all his legitimate expenses.  If the general rate of profitability on the bulk of the services provided here is between 10 per cent and 20 per cent then it seems the withholding tax should not exceed the general level of the surplus or profit involved.  In those circumstances the 35 per cent rate is penal, is confiscatory and is unjustified. On that basis, I suggest that the relation of the rate of withholding tax to the standard rate of income tax paid by an individual is wholly misconceived because we are not dealing here with profit for the purpose of income tax or corporation tax; we are dealing with turnover and that is a very different issue.  I suggest the rate should be mitigated and reduced to 20 per cent which is more appropriate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be accused in any way of prolonging this debate but I want to make one thing very clear.  I will conclude my remarks on this amendment because there is a lot to be done and that is because very little time has been provided for it.  The reason for that is well known to Members of the House.  It arises from the Order of Business which was determined yesterday.  Nobody who supported that Order of Business, either implicitly or explicitly, in this House has any right to complain if any individual matter is put to the House or if a vote is insisted upon.  If I am excluded from taking real part through my Party Whip in determining the Order of Business, I do not consider myself either morally or politically bound to accept unacceptable infringements on my right to put an issue before this House and to have the matter decided upon by a vote.  Without trespassing into these areas, I believe it will not be possible to get through all the business on this Bill if we continue as we are doing.  I am faced with the dilemma as to whether I should make way for other speakers or fail to move amendments because there are other people waiting in the queue.  This issue is of such fundamental importance and the thinking behind the rate of 35 per cent is so wrong and so logically flawed that I have no <Col N="2217" /> option but to indicate that I will be pressing a vote on this discreet amendment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are all very anxious that the debate should proceed and that we will be able to comment on the major sections of this Bill. There were three hours allocated to the debate on sections 12 to 20 which include the withholding tax but the first hour and a quarter went on votes on the Order of Business and, therefore, the time is restricted.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister on putting down a time motion.  The practice previously was &mdash; Deputy McDowell may not be aware of it &mdash; that if there was not a time motion many amendments were front-loaded on the Finance Bill, the debate proceeded for three or four days, people did not get to discuss more than the first six or seven sections and the rest of the Bill was then voted on by one question. That happens no matter how much time is given to the Finance Bill as a whole. If the Deputy considers the number of amendments on income tax that were frontloaded before section 1 yesterday, he will realise that even if we had a week to debate this matter we would be still talking about income tax on Friday night. A time motion is absolutely justified in that there is no other way to debate the Bill properly.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I hope we can now proceed with an orderly debate.  I and my party will be working on the basis that we will want a full debate on as much of the Bill as possible and we will not try to filibuster or try to keep people from speaking.  I ask the other Deputies in the House to facilitate everybody and to give us all a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind if the amendment before us is put to a vote.  Fine Gael are opposed <Col N="2218" /> to the principle of withholding tax and we have put down a series of amendments to improve the administration of it because by tomorrow night we will be faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  It is debatable if the amendment will improve the position. Obviously, 20 per cent is a lower rate than the standard rate of income tax but this is not as simple as that because it depends on the amount of the professional service which is concerned with the public sector.  If 100 per cent of a person's activity is involved with the public sector that person pays 35 per cent of the turnover, or 20 per cent if the amendment is accepted.  However, there are cases where 35 per cent of a person's activity in the public sector will be less than 20 per cent of somebody else's activity.  I do not think there is a whole lot for the amendment and, in the interest of proper debate, if the Deputy would withdraw it with a view to submitting it on Report Stage he would make a lot of friends and give us another 20 minutes to debate other issues where the Minister might be more disposed to accepting amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in defining &ldquo;public bodies&rdquo;.  Companies like John Sisk, a public liability company, could be included if we have &ldquo;public bodies&rdquo; because of the difficulty of defining that phrase.  I should like to tell Deputy Mac Giolla that we are dealing only in the non-commercial sector.  The reason we are not dealing in the commercial sector is because of competition in that area.  The alternative to leaving public bodies out would be listing everybody. That would be a very long list.  It is my intention only to deal with public sector bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy McDowell that I cannot accept his amendment. What we are talking about in regard to the withholding tax is a cash flow addition of £25 million to the Exchequer this year. Acceptance of Deputy McDowell's amendment would immediately reduce that by £11 million.  Such an undermining of the yield in the light of the present <Col N="2219" /> budgetary difficulties is unacceptable and I cannot accept the amendment for that reason.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been made about the rate of reductions and why it should be 20 per cent instead of 35 per cent.  The 35 per cent rate is the standard rate.  It is the rate used in regard to the DIRT tax and deductions from the PAYE sector.  We have all received representations from public bodies in regard to this.  They were well organised and they pumped representations to us.  I understand and appreciate their difficulties. Nobody likes to have additional impositions on them whether it is taxation, accountancy procedures or administration but this is the only way the Government could do this.  I do not want to be jumping up and down and taking up the time of Deputies who may wish to make contributions.  I will be brief at this stage.</P>
    <P>There has been unfavourable comment in the impact of the withholding tax on professional firms whose employees and directors already pay tax under PAYE. It has been suggested that because of this situation such firms should be outside the scope of the tax.  The point to be stressed here is that directors' remuneration and employees' income is not affected by the withholding tax scheme.  In the case of a company, which is a separate entity, director's remuneration and employee income are items which are deducted in arriving at net profit on which a charge to corporation tax is levied.  If the amount of withholding tax deducted under Chapter III proves to be excessive there is <Col N="2220" /> provision for the making of interim refunds if the conditions set down in section 18 of the Bill are complied with. This will modify the impact of the deductions and assure, so far as possible, that the tax deducted under the withholding scheme is related to the actual liability of the firm so that the withholding tax will not exceed the agreed and paid tax bill of the previous accounting period, a bill which, as indicated above, is based on net profits, that is after various deductions including directors' remuneration and so on.  In these circumstances and provided that the claims are properly vouched, interim refunds of the tax will be made. In other words, where a firm incurs substantial outgoings in respect of directors' remuneration and employee wages this will be reflected in a lower corporation tax liability and as interim refunds are to be related to such reduced liability of the previous accounting period they will, therfore, come to be made all the sooner.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's position and also what Deputy Noonan has said.

I must press the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 25 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 26:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 15, subsection (1), lines 1 <Col N="2223" /> and 2, to delete &ldquo;whether or not such services&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;which&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to the portion of section 12 which deals with a relevant payment.  Section 12 (1) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>... &ldquo;relevant payment&rdquo; means a payment made on or after the sixth day of June, 1987, in respect of professional services whether or not such services are provided to the accountable person making the payment...</P>
    <P>My amendment wants to exclude the words &ldquo;whether or not such services are provided to the accountable person&rdquo;.  I see two difficulties here and I should like the Minister to clarify them.  The Revenue Commissioners have already suggested, and subsequently contradicted that this would allow them to apply the withholding tax to costs which would be awarded to people who litigate against the State or any of its agencies.  A number of points arise here.  Costs awarded to a litigant are the property of the litigant and not the solicitor.  Even though they are transferred to the solicitor or barrister, they are done so by the litigant and the primary award is to the litigant and not to his legal team.  One is deducting 35 per cent from a citizen to whom the courts have awarded costs.</P>
    <P>I followed with interest the debate in the newspapers but I would like clarification here.  It seems the Revenue Commissioners interpreted this as meaning that the 35 per cent would apply to legal costs but subsequently they said this would not be the case.  Whatever the practice of the Revenue Commissioners will be in relation to legal costs, the section as drafted is putting a law on the Statute Book which allows a deduction of 35 per cent from legal costs.  That is not the intent of the withholding tax and it is certainly unjust.  I also suggest that it is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>One of the appropriate precedents would be the Sinn Féin funds case.  It is definitely unconstitutional in so far as it applies to costs which were awarded before 6 June this year and which have <Col N="2224" /> not been paid by the appropriate agency of the State.  If awards made prior to 6 June this year were to attract the withholding tax of 35 per cent, there is no doubt that this would be an interference in the judicial process and there are several precedents which would regard this as unconstitutional.  This matter was raised by Deputy Shatter principally in <i>The Irish Times.</i> The point I am making is this: once we have a section in the Bill which can be interpreted along the lines I am suggesting, the Bill is open to challenge whether or not the Revenue Commissioners operate that section.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the intent of various professional bodies to challenge this Bill.  I am aware of at least six professional groups who have got legal opinion from senior counsel, but I have no doubt that this section is unconstitutional so far as it applies to costs awarded in court prior to 6 June 1987 but which have not been paid.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is this. As the Minister and the House are aware from our ordinary constituency work, in the building of schools it is the practice for many chairmen of boards of management to hire their own architect.  One has the option of hiring one's own architect or working with the Office of Public Works.  This money is fully reimbursed subsequently by the Office of Public Works but the point is that the payment is not made to the architect; it is made to the chairman of the board.  If this section is not amended the chairman of the board of management of a primary school who has retained an architect for an extension or for the building of a new school is liable for the full fees to that architect and the State, through the Office of Public Works, under this section will deduct 35 per cent.  Will this be passed on to the board of management and the parents and will the local contribution for the building of primary schools be increased as a result?</P>
    <P>To put the Bill beyond challenge and to clarify the points I have made about legal costs, school buildings and the relationship between the chairman of the <Col N="2225" /> board of management and the professional people he retains, I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  There may be other ramifications but the net point is that, as drafted, whether the professional service is provided by the accountable person or provided to the accountable person, if it is provided to third parties the deduction of 35 per cent can still be made if the accountable person is actually issuing the cheque to cover the cost at the end of the process. This section has very serious implications and the Minister would be well advised to amend it because, as it stands, it will not work and will be challenged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a Dáil Deputy for a long time and during that time I have received correspondence on various issues which arise from time to time in the House but I have never received as much correspondence as I did protesting against the retention tax.  I realise that I was elected to represent Fianna Fáil in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and I have no difficulty in following the Minister for Finance into the division lobby on this or indeed any other issue in relation to the Finance Bill.  However, as a result of the protests I received in relation to this tax, I took it upon myself to protest, with others, at the parliamentary party meeting when this issue arose.  I also undertook, on behalf of the various people who wrote to me, accountants, surveyors, engineers and others, to reflect their views in relation to this tax and the amendment before the House.  I studied the tax and came to the conclusion that it is unjust and unfair.  It was thought up within the bureaucratic machine and then spewed out to become a section in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that taxes must be collected and that people say all taxes are bad in the sense that they hurt some section of the community.  However, the withholding tax is unusual &mdash; I congratulate the Government for taking a strong line on various economic issues and I support them 100 per cent in that regard but you must combine a micro-economic <Col N="2226" /> approach with compassion.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister, to whom I have already spoken privately on this matter to express my concerns to him regarding this tax, that it is less than compassionate, with the greatest respect to its originators. ]I realise that the Minister has to accept responsibility for the tax but I strongly believe that he was not its author.</P>

      <P>I also read the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> and I am grateful to Deputy Shatter for crystallising the thinking of the Revenue Commissioners, however complex their final thought processes were on the issue and however unconvincing the final making up of their minds seems to have been.  They seem to think that costs awarded against the State are not the subject matter properly of a withholding tax under the provisions of the Bill.  If the State at any stage sues an individual in the wrong, if that individual pays his own lawyers to defend him and a court tells the State that the State will now repay what the man paid to his lawyers to defend him, to defeat the unfounded case against him, it is wholly and completely wrong and, as Deputy Noonan said, unconstitutional, for the State to say that they will not pay him everything, only 65 per cent, because his barristers and solicitors provided a professional service to him.  In that context, when I read the report of the ruling of the Revenue Commissioners, I was surprised that they would interpret the Bill in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own view is that it is based on a legal misconception and that where one party to litigation is directed to pay another party's costs, the issue as I understand it is that he is merely indemnifying that other party for outlay made.  He is not making a payment to anybody for professional fees.  The manner in which the costs are computed and aggregated is no concern of his except to see that there is no injustice done.  He is merely required to indemnify the successful party for the fact that the party had to incur those costs to defend the proceedings. ]In this case it would be wholly wrong for the Revenue Commissioners to interpret the Bill in a manner in which the barrister, solicitor or the other people involved in the costs, such as medical witnesses, expert witnesses and so on are taken as providing a professional service <Col N="2228" /> in such circumstances at the Bill defines. It is not a payment in respect of professional services, it is a court order indemnification which is substantially and qualitatively different.  The Revenue Commissioners were wrong so, the point I made in amendment No. 30 to try to achieve the same position is redundant. Deputy Noonan's amendment is very widely cast indeed but I like it because it exempts a lot of people, apart from lawyers, from the provisions of the Bill. It would exempt the GMS because they do not provide the professional service to the State, dentists do not drill fillings in the mouth of the body corporate of the State, they provide these services to patients.  So do doctors and many others. The amendment would exempt a greater number of people than was originally intended when the amendment was tabled to deal with the point raised by the Revenue Commissioners.  I am happy, if the Minister's interpretation of the Bill is that it does not cover indemnification for successful parties' costs by the State, to withdraw amendment No. 30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can categorically state that costs awarded in court are not included.  The Revenue Commissioners gave wrong information in the first instance which was corrected as soon as the personnel concerned were made aware of it.  I fully agree with the interpretation of Deputy Noonan and Deputy McDowell of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment before us, its purpose would be to exclude payments for personal services, which are not provided in the accountable person making the payment, from the operation of the withholding tax.  This would, if accepted, have the effect of removing important payments from the ambit of the scheme such as payments made to doctors by the general medical services payments board.  A move of this kind would result in a decrease in the yield of some £7 million in respect of payments to doctors and chemists by the board. On cost grounds alone this cannot be considered.  I see the reasoning behind the approach adopted by Deputy <Col N="2229" /> McDowell in amendment No. 30. Because of this hare that was raised a misinformation resulted in these amendments. ]I can assure the Deputies and the House that they need have no fear in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another point was made by Deputy Noonan in relation to school grants to emphasise the case he was making, namely, that the architect working for the particular nun, priest, brother, group, committee or whatever would be involved.  He is not.  The grant concerned is a payment made and it is not in respect of professional fees.  Therefore, withholding tax does not apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear the Minister recognises there is not a rational explanation or justification for the impact on the type of architectural work that is being referred to.  I shall bring the Minister back very briefly to the legal costs issue.  Let me make the point that whatever is the current view of the Revenue <Col N="2231" /> Commissioners on this issue &mdash; the commissioners presumably must properly operate under the powers conferred by legislation passed by this House.  Equally the local authorities, health boards and others who are named as accountable persons are required to comply with the provisions of the legislation.  I accept it may not have been intended that when costs are awarded against the State for a local authority or a health board or other bodies named here, in court actions, that 35 per cent would be docked from the sum in regard to costs in respect of which the individual litigant had been indemnified. ]I would put it to the Minister if that is not his intention then his provision requires amendment.  There is no other logical interpretation.</P>
      <P>If he takes the definition of professional services, that definition includes services of a solicitor or barrister and other legal services.  It also includes services of a medical doctor and others. Relevant payment means a payment made in respect of professional services, whether or not such services are provided to the accountable person.  If I am run over by a lorry owned by Dublin County Council and I suffer serious injuries, I take Dublin County Council to court and succeed in getting damages from them and I am indemnified from my legal costs. Dublin County Council is an accountable person.  An order for costs is made in respect of legal services provided, which would be professional services within the definition of this legislation.  Medical evidence whould have been called, medical services within the definition of this measure would have been provided for.  The services would have been provided to me as the litigant but the fact that they were provided to me does not exempt them from being included within the concept of a relevant payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that any lawyer advising a health board or local authority in those circumstances would advise that under the provisions of this statute they would have to dock 35 per cent of costs awarded in such cases, be they concluded before or after 6 June.  To my mind, if that is not <Col N="2232" /> done the local authority are at risk of the Revenue Commissioners demanding moneys and at risk of being held in breach of the terms of this measure.  If it is done, the local authority are at risk of a constitutional action being brought against them.  Whether or not it was the intention to affect legal costs in this way &mdash; and I accept the Minister's bona fides in saying he did not intend it &mdash; it seems clear that somebody in the Revenue Commissioners reading the section realised that it did have this effect and somebody else said that that could not be done constitutionally so it cannot be implemented.  It would seem that this provision does require amendment in this context.  I would suggest that this has not been fully thought out.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's description of the thought process behind this provision is probably right, that the effect was not properly understood.  I have no doubt there are people who brought actions against the State on constitutional or other matters who if they find themselves affected by this will end up back in court. If either the amendment tabled by Deputy Noonan or that tabled by Deputy McDowell is not acceptable, this matter should be dealt with on Report Stage with an appropriate amendment to deal with this particular issue.  I will guarantee, regardless of what Deputy Andrews says, that this would be one of the specific provisions of this Bill which would be held to be unconstitutional if there was a constitutional challenge to it.  More importantly, it is a provision which seriously places at risk the civil and constitutional rights of every individual in the State to bring court actions and proceedings against central Government, local authorities and other State bodies in circumstances where their legal rights are infringed.  It puts those people at risk of not being properly indemnified for any legal or incidental or medical expenses they might incur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I reflect on this and from listening to what has transpired here the more positive I am that <Col N="2233" /> the Revenue Commissioners first statement was wrong, that the Revenue Commissioners second statement is right and that an indemnity given to a person in respect of his costs is not a payment for legal services.  Incidentally, I should say I have an interest in all of these matters. I suppose there are some cheques on their way to me which are going to be the subject matter of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;just in case people think I am speaking on a matter in which I have an interest without saying so.  If the nature of costs is examined, they are not a payment by the unsuccessful party in respect of professional services.  They are a payment by way of an indemnity to the other party to the litigation to compensate that person for their out-of-pocket expenses in relation to proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and Deputy Boland raised a point which is of great importance in this case.  It now appears the Minister is saying that the State does not intend to disaggregate lump sums paid to individuals and that it does not intend to look to a lump sum paid by the State to, say, the promoters of a school project to see what portion of the lump sum paid out is or is not in respect of professional services.  That is not apparent from the tenor of the legislation and it is most welcome if it is the case because it cuts back the effect of the Bill.  Such an interpretation as is now adopted by the Minister, and surprisingly as far as I am concerned, will give rise to huge anomalies in that people providing effectively the same service will by the interpolation of a middleman, be it a grant receiver or whatever, be able to escape the effects of this statute.  The net effect will be that totally artificial distinctions will be drawn between identical situations based on the question of whether or not the Department concerned imagine they are giving a block grant which all just happens to go for professional services or to an individual or whether they make payments <Col N="2234" /> through a middleman to various architects and the like.  Where money is paid to a building contractor and he puts in his bill, including the architect's fee, on the Minister's account if the amounts are not disaggregated the architect is going to walk away with his gross fees.  On the other hand, if one cheque is sent to the architect and another cheque to the building contractor the architect is going to have to pay.  This is a very unsatisfactory situation which has now emerged.  It is surprising that the Minister should conceive that the State is not going to disaggregate lump sums.  This needs clarification.  If the Minister would bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to clarify the question of lump sum payments it would avoid huge litigation in courts later on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), lines 4 and 5, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  payments in respect of professional services which are made to a specified person, whether the specified person is an individual, partnership or company, where the individual or the partners or directors, as the case may be, and the employees of such person, are liable to pay tax or are paying tax on a current year basis, pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and emoluments within the scope of Chapter IV of Part V of that Act, to which that Chapter applies, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be very brief in relation to this amendment.  The purpose of amendment No. 27, Deputy Noonan's amendment No. 28 and Deputy Desmond's amendment No. 29 is to prevent the application <Col N="2236" /> of the withholding tax in situations where payments are being made to companies, partnerships or individuals who are in any event liable to pay taxation on a PAYE basis in respect of current year's income. The Act as it presently stands excludes emoluments within the scope of Chapter IV of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  These are effectively payments in respect of employment and are the subject matter of PAYE as things stand.  It is proposed in this amendment to take into account the situation of large firms of engineers, architects and surveyors all of whose members &mdash; be they directors, employees who are providing professional services or employees who are providing mere back-up services such as secretarial services, from the very top of the firm down to the bottom who rely on the income of that firm &mdash; pay tax by way of PAYE.  It includes owner directors of the firms whose payments in their capacity as directors are subject to PAYE.  It is grossly unjust to ask people who are paying taxation on a current year basis also to bear the weight of the withholding tax on their cashflow.</P>
    <P>The Minister said &mdash; and he has gone a good way down the road to say it in press publicity &mdash; that he is trying to put people who are providing professional services on the same basis as PAYE payers.  Where he finds PAYE payers providing these services he is now going to cripple them twice: not only will they have to pay PAYE but they will have to pay it out of a fund of money which has already been decimated by the effect of the withholding tax.  That is a manifest injustice.  If an architect's practice with four partners has incorporated itself and each of the four partners is classified as a director and they pay PAYE the same way as the cleaning lady in their firm pays PAYE, it seems monstrous to say that they should be now subjected to this system of taxation and to offer as a moral excuse for it the suggestion that they are being put on the same basis as other PAYE employees, a basis they are already on.</P>
    <P>There is not much between the proposals of Deputy Desmond, Deputy <Col N="2237" /> Noonan and myself.  The Chair can take his pick as to which is the nicest.  The three amendments are genuinely aimed at exempting a group from the effect of this tax in circumstances where the imposition of it would be most unjust and would not have a moral force which the Minister has contended for, and which I reject, in relation to other people who are on a previous year's taxation.  People who are paying income tax on the same basis as any PAYE employee are to be drastically affected by this Act.  I am against it and the Minister cannot really defend it in view of the excuses he has given publicly for the introduction of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The three amendments would have a similar effect.  A relevant payment is defined on pages 14 and 15 and there are two exclusions, one relates to payments to people who are employees of accountable persons who pay tax in the normal way and the second relates to people in the construction industry who have what is known as a C2 certification that their tax affairs are in order.  My amendment is to make an exclusion of payments for professional services from the professional bodies who are paying tax on a current basis and whose tax affairs are in <Col N="2238" /> order.  There are situations where one can get a design office where the directors pay themselves a monthly salary and they pay PRSI and PAYE in the normal way as do their employees.  The tax in those cases is a 35 per cent withholding tax on the turnover of the company which accrues from public bodies.  It is a double taxation which is most unfair and which will impose a penal imposition on the turnover of companies.  The hardship clauses which allow for interim refunds does not meet the case at all.  That will obviously drag on to a degree that interim refunds will not be made until the following tax year anyway.  I would ask the Minister to accept one or other of these amendments.</P>
      <P>Another way of excluding people such as we have here is to model this on exclusion (6) of section 12 and apply the same regime to professional services as is applied to the building industry.  In circumstances where specified persons get a certification of authorisation from the Revenue Commissioners stating that their tax affairs are in order, they should be exempt from the implications of this tax.  This is the most unfair element of all of this withholding tax.  I understand that the Minister wants to get as many people as possible paying tax on a current year basis, but if people are already paying tax on that basis they should not be a target for this tax.  The Minister may come back-and say that if we do this it will provide a loophole through which many professionals can escape, by incorporating themselves, but that is not so.  Neither the legal profession not the medical profession can do it and if they did set themselves up as a public liability company they would be liable for tax as directors, on a current basis, for any payments they would make to themselves and their employees would also pay tax on a current basis.  If the Minister does not want to accept these amendments he should model this on the consequential amendment, No. 30a to section 18, which we are not taking, and apply the exclusion already in the Bill for the building industry to professionals, under section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2239" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is fundamentally a question of tax equity.  I recall prolonged discussions at Government in the past four years, in endeavouring to rectify obvious anomalies in the collection of taxation.  As a consequence we brought in an elaborate system of tax clearance certificates which have worked quite well and which by and large cleared up a good deal of the avoidance, evasion and late payments endemic, particularly in the construction industry.  Where an architect, consultant, a quantity surveyor or an engineer is paying tax up front and where the directors of the companies are paying A1 class contributions of PAYE and PRSI and where all partners, principals and employees in such companies are on a par in tax treatment, unquestionably there should be an exemption.  I can see some merit for this tax in the case of barristers where delayed payments are a tax issue, because they have to wait for 18 months or two years before payment. Nevertheless, in some professions people are paid up front.  I have very strong views which I expressed in relation to medical consultants, for example.  There is an anomaly, a gross unfairness which we are trying to incorporate into the Finance Bill, whereby an architect running a company paying his PAYE on a current year basis and where his staff and fellow partner are paying up front, can be double taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI payments are paid within one month of a claim being made directly to the subscriber who transmits it to the consultant.  Indeed the level of bad debts in that area is not more than 3 or 4 per cent.  A consultant may never declare that payment to the income tax people and the Revenue Commissioners cannot find out because the VHI are not legally obliged to tell the Revenue Commissioners what they have paid out.  A consultant may pay some tax on it at the end of the year, whereas the quantity surveyor who might have had to wait for 18 months to get paid, will immediately have a 35 per cent clawback despite the fact that throughout that period he has to keep himself and his company going in a period of construction recession.  I am <Col N="2240" /> very much of the view that auctioneers, estate agents, solicitors, barristers, dentists, opticians or veterinary surgeons should pay tax on a current year basis.  I have no hesitation in advocating that and firmly pressing it through.  However, there should be a specific exemption for those professions who are totally up front on payments.  It is rough justice at the moment.  There are doctors who will be getting GMS payment cheques at the end of this month and instead of getting their £3,000 cheque they will get a £2,000 cheque.  It is pretty rough justice at the moment and many of them are going to find themselves in considerable cashflow problems in that area, but those who will find themselves worst off of all will be those who are being charged on, effectively their State turnover into their company, a straight clawback of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying that the measure was rather a panic stricken one to find revenue.  It was ill thought out but with a bit of finesse and thought it could have been brought in on a certificate of exemption basis just as we in Government brought in tax clearance certificates on the construction side which, although in terms of some home improvement grant procedures were fiddled, nevertheless, in their application were generally quite successful and meritorious.  I ask the Minister to consider this on Report Stage particularly in relation to the construction industry.  Maybe £3 million or £4 million will be involved in that immediate impact because there are unquestionably some who are not on a current tax basis.  However, the vast majority are, and particularly in that area some exemption should be given because, apart from anything else, the hardship provisions and the interim refund provision are unlikely to meet the serious hardship which will be imposed on some professions in the immediate future, indeed in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I find a sympathy with these amendments and more than a sense of discomfiture with the concept of the withholding tax.  As speakers have indicated to the House, it has been conceived <Col N="2241" /> out of immediacy of gaining revenue rather than as a practical operation.  I worry about this and I doubt the machinery within the Revenue Commissioners to enable this form of taxation to operate. This is the kernel of the issue.  Any delay in issuing refunds to people who are due refunds is going to result in strangulation of the cashflow and consequently a loss of employment.  This would not be the Minister's intention, but I feel strongly that this taxation will lead to unemployment. ]That, of course, is most undesirable, certainly in professions that are very hard pressed.  I am speaking particularly of those non-medical professions, those in the construction industry, quantity surveyors, engineers and so on.  For the life of me I cannot see how people who are keeping their taxation up to date on a month to month basis, paying staff and so on are about to be levied with a 35 per cent taxation on gross turnover. How can that be?  How can the concept of it be even justified?  A case could be made where taxation level is measured for one calendar year and set off against the following year, and there would be a cut off point where a person would not be expected to pay withholding tax in a continuing year.  To let this mount over a period of one year at 35 per cent could involve an enormous sum of money.  I can see cases where the danger will be to construct a system of operating businesses, say, by way of a peak and valley system.  Take the building industry where it is possible to take in so many contracts over a period of time and then let staff off; the pressure is then straight back to the Department of Social Welfare.  These people could be re-employed when business picks up when the peak of the business year is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recent strongly the view being flouted about professional people not paying their tax and so on.  In a sense this view is popular but certainly not founded on fact.  If the Minister examines the position he will realise that very many people who are paying their taxes up to date will be levied with this extra form of taxation at such a high rate and that out of this rate <Col N="2242" /> staff costings, the running of practices costings and so on must be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made an interesting point about differentation between fees and services in what I might call inert professions where one is not dealing with human beings.  It will be very necessary, if this taxation goes through, that the Minister set about some means of instigating within the Revenue Commissioners the highest standards of efficiency to cope with the payment of refunds and the immense hardship that the measure will cause.  Like the previous Deputy who spoke on these amendments being put forward, I have been inundated with representations from varying professions, from the legal profession right down to chiropodists.  That is not for one moment to imply extremes of professions, but it is one issue that has caused a great deal of informed representation, so to speak, and certainly not ill conceived notions or people saying that they are opposed to this tax, that that is the end of it.  Certainly that was not the case, but to come in at such a figure as 35 per cent is blunt, to say the least of it and could even be termed a plunder on the resources of people.  Where did this figure come from?  Why not 5 per cent and let us at least see how the taxation operates? If it is a question of just gaining the projected £25 million, that might not have been the best approach.  If we become tied up in legal strangleholds, as this House has indicated &mdash; with respect to the illustrious participation of many of the legal profession in this House &mdash; if we are to become tied up in the courts in cases as to whether something is deemed to be professional or not, it will be a lost cause.  That would not be the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>I, for one, am opposed in principle to the withholding tax.  It is a taxation working on gross income.  It is not an accurate form of taxation, it is not within the spirit of taxation, and the only avenue open to the Minister if this form of taxation goes through is to give the House a guarantee that sufficient staff, sufficient <Col N="2243" /> measures and most undated, efficient systems of refunds will operate.  I say without casting any eye to any particular Department that out there in the world at the moment, out there in business or in any profession at present, it is very difficult to make ends meet, that it will be difficult to cost this taxation.  I appeal to the Minister to give a guarantee that a highly efficient system of refunds will operate for this new taxation.  Perhaps the Minister could flesh out some system of innovation within the Department to ensure that there will not be a hold up. If there is a hold up of a refund this could necessitate an employer having to lay off staff and that would be highly undesirable.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that we are in favour of the withholding tax.  It is a good, innovative tax beginning to widen the tax net about which everybody has been speaking, particularly the Progressive Democrats, for quite some time.  On Second Stage the Progressive Democrats had an amendment down to provide for reform of the system of taxation.  In a small way I see this as the beginning of the reform of taxation.  To aspire to alleviate the tax burden on workers, to halt the growth of the burden of income tax, and at the same time oppose the withholding tax seems to me to be contradictory.  How can this be achieved if the tax net or base is not widened?  I would pose the question to those opposing this tax: what taxes are they in favour of?  It appears, none.  We saw the introduction of the deposit <Col N="2244" /> interest retention tax by the last Government vigorously opposed by Fianna Fáil. That tax also broadened the tax net, affording an opportunity to reducing tax on personal incomes particularly on the part of the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to be very careful about these amendments.  As I see it, they will open up a whole new area of avoidance.  If the Minister concedes these amendments it could lead to a system under which any partnership, company, group or individual could arrange to make payments &mdash; say, of figures of £5,000 or £6,000 &mdash; just to remain within the PAYE system.  Then one is excluded from liability to withholding tax and one can pay the balance by way of profit-sharing, expenses or by a whole series of other devices by which one can allocate oneself the balance of one's money.  The point I am making is that once one remains within the PAYE bracket one can avoid liability.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to examine these amendments very carefully.  It is my contention that they would erode the whole purpose of the withholding tax because of the manner in which they would open up avoidance possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being taken from people simply because they work on behalf of the State.  It has nothing to do with equity.  I am all in favour of people paying their taxes at the right time but this amounts to a confiscation of earnings. I would contend that not alone should the Minister not accept these amendments but that he should throw out the whole principle of this tax altogether.  Not alone does it amount to confiscation of earnings but to phoney money.  All it does is bring forward into this year what the Exchequer would receive next year anyway.  As has been outlined by our <Col N="2245" /> party spokesperson on Finance, it will also cripple a number of well established firms and practices here who engage in work on behalf of the State, who have developed to a stage at which they can compete for work abroad.  I envisage a break up of these firms and practices as a result of that confiscation of earnings.</P>
      <P>I do not see why we should apply one rule to somebody who engages in work on behalf of the State and another to those who engage in work on behalf of a private company or individual.  I envisage also that, resulting from a severe cash flow problem being experienced by a number of such firms and practices, a number will be forced into a position in which there will be delays in the payment of their PAYE and PRSI contributions. They will not have the money to make payments rightfully due to the State.  As a result of a confiscation of 35 per cent of their earnings they will not have a sufficient cash flow to pay their PAYE and PRSI contributions when due.  What the Minister may think he will get from the imposition of this tax he will lose in another direction as a result of delays in payment of PAYE and PRSI contributions. ]I contend that the State should not request anybody to engage in any work on its behalf unless that person can show they are up-to-date in payment of their taxes and have a clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the concept contained in these amendments.  When commenting on the principles perhaps the Minister would explain what would be his attitude to the effect of implementing what is outlined in amendment No. 30a and the related amendment whereby partnerships or firms up-to-date in their payments would receive, as do contractors in the construction industry, a certificate of authorisation which would eliminate the cumbersome and unworkable procedure outlined in relation to refunds as matters stand at present.  It seems absolutely inequitable that firms in respect of whose employees all relevant tax is being paid on a current year basis. <Col N="2246" /> on an up-to-date basis, will be subject to the rigours of endeavouring to recover through the cumbersome refund system any withholding tax that might be deducted from them.  When the concept was introduced in relation to the construction industry it worked well.  It also has the effect of encouraging firms and partnerships to bring their tax affairs and those of their employees up to date, on a current year basis.</P>
      <P>If the intention of the withholding tax is as the Minister says it would appear that the introduction of the system outlined in Deputy Noonan's amendment, No. 30a and his related new amendment, No. 41a to section 18, would constitute an equitable way of achieving this.</P>
      <P>My concern relates particularly to firms who supply specialised services to the construction industry.  The Minister will appreciate that that is an industry which has gone through a very difficult period. Bearing in mind the attitude of the present Administration regarding public sector capital contracts it is likely that such firms will experience continuing difficulty in ensuing years.  It appears to me that a number of such firms who rely heavily at present on public contracts for the major part of their turnover will not be in a position to continue in operation without a largescale shedding of staff, many of whom will be non-professional people, staff who provide the support services.  It appears to me that firms like that, who endeavour to comply with all of the provisions of the law, should not have their continued existence threatened by the manner in which it is envisaged the imposition of the withholding tax and the refund system would operate under the provisions of the Bill as drafted.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear Members' contributions on these amendments.  The facts are that, if any of these amendments were accepted, payments to individuals, partnerships or companies that had even one part-time worker up to date with their PAYE contributions, would be excluded from liability to withholding tax.  Having said that, Deputies must appreciate that it would not be possible for me to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the same sort of argument advanced on this withholding tax as we had at the time of the introduction of PAYE, PRSI, VAT at point of entry, deposit interest retention tax and so on. Nobody likes additional taxation.  Equally nobody likes to have to pay tax earlier than the date on which they have become accustomed to paying it.  It is not a question of there being the same reasons for the introduction of the C2, in relation to the construction industry, which was to eliminate the possibility of evasion or avoidance as had obtained in that area. This is a mechanism to bring forward tax payments earlier than they would normally become due.  Its impact will not be anything like what has been described by the media or by Members of the House provided all concerned are up to date <Col N="2248" /> administratively, when the relevant interim refund and hardship clauses can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I can give a positive assurance so far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned that they will be doing their utmost to ensure that where interim refunds or hardship repayments are involved they will be given immediately. It is no harm for all of us to realise that, while this is not an anti-evasion or avoidance measure which is being introduced but a measure to bring forward certain payments, at this stage, 17 June, about 40 per cent of the taxpayers concerned in the withholding tax have not finalised their tax liabilities for 1986-87.  If the measure does no more than speed up that process it will be of benefit to all concerned, to the Exchequer and to all taxpayers, particularly the PAYE sector.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing <Col N="2254" /> for each local authority area the statute acreage and adjusted acreage of all holdings included in the classification lists issued by the farm tax commissioner in September 1986.  No classification lists have been issued since that date.  As the classification lists giving details of individual assessments were put on public display by the local authorities I do not think it necessary to give details of the outcome of each assessment.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister for Finance if, given the valuable work that has been done by the tax assessment office, he does not consider that this work should continue?  When we consider that the last overall valuation was prepared in the first half of the 19th century, will the Minister, taking into account that he was a former Minister for Agriculture, not accept that this work should continue in the interests of the economy irrespective of whether one is in favour or against a land tax?

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of assessments which have been raised under the provisions of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983; the amount of tax collected as a result of these assessments; and whether profits from illegal drug-dealing have been assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, provides that profits or gains are to be charged to tax under Case IV of Schedule D and described in the assessment as &ldquo;miscellaneous income&rdquo; notwithstanding that the source from which they arose was not known to the inspector, or that they were not known to the inspector to have arisen wholly or partly from a lawful source, or that they were known to the inspector to have arisen from an unlawful source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the section as a Revenue measure is that it removes the possibility <Col N="2260" /> of a challenge to assessments to tax on the grounds that the source of the profits has not been identified by Revenue or that the activity from which the profits were derived was unlawful and therefore not a proper subject for taxation.</P>
    <P>The section is an integral element of the charging provisions of the Tax Acts and assessments under the section are made as part of the general administration of the taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  For that reason statistics are not available in such a manner as would enable the details sought by the Deputy to be given and the information could be provided only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>As regards the final part of the question, it would be inappropriate for Revenue officials to seek to pass judgment as to whether profits or gains had been derived from any particular unlawful activity such as dealing in drugs.  This is the primary reason any income assessed to tax by virtue of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, is described in the relevant assessment as miscellaneous income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the Minister's bona fides in attempting to answer the question I must confess that it struck me that there was a lot of evasion in the reply.  Is the Minister in a position to give any indication to the House as to the frequency of tax collected from illegal earnings, whether illegal drug earnings or any other source?  The Minister's reply did not give us any indication.  Is the Minister in a position to give us an indication of whether any amount of money was collected from illegal earnings for the purposes of taxation in the last four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply statistics are not kept of the number of assessments made under this section throughout the tax districts.  However, the larger and more important cases are dealt with by the investigation branch. Section 19 has been invoked on six occasions by that branch to assess income <Col N="2261" /> alleged to be of illegal origin.  In two of those cases the tax is in the course of collection but the persons concerned are outside the jurisdiction.  In another case the assessment was discharged by the Appeal Commissioner, another case is under appeal and investigations are on-going in the two remaining cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total amount of farm income in Ireland; the proportion of that amount which is considered to be taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Farm income for 1986 is estimated by the Central Statistics Office at £1,125 million.  It is not possible to say what proportion of this represents taxable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In computing the figure of farm income no account is taken of the many legitimate personal and business allowances which farmeres may use in calculating <Col N="2262" /> their taxable incomes.  The figure also includes the incomes of a substantial number of full-time farmers &mdash; perhaps as many as 70,000 &mdash; who have not yet been assessed for income tax.  These latter farmers will be brought into the effective income tax system progressively over the next few years by means of the farm profile system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the finance year is the Minister in a position to say whether the income tax received from farmers in 1987 will show an increase or decrease on the 1986 figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the estimated amount for tax was £36 million.  I do not have the up to date figure for this year but it will be above that.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, in the Finance Bill which is going through the House there is a provision for a reduction in the VAT refund payable to farmers from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent which will bring in an additional £9 million. That fact is lost sight of in the debate and argument on the abolition of the farm tax.  Last year it was supposed to have brought in £6 million and roughly the same figure was expected this year but only £250,000 was collected last year. This year we do not have to wait for the collection mechanisms to work in regard to £9 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from his time in Government there was a dispute in the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the issuing of these forms some years ago and that delayed the issuing of them.  It is no harm to remind the House that up to a few years ago farms with a certain valuation were not liable for tax.  We are moving in the right direction in an area that has been a bone of contention with the PAYE sector.  We are progressing and issuing <Col N="2263" /> additional profiles to farmers.  Some minor adjustment have been made on the profile form first used.  The adjustments have been clarified and we will be issuing forms to another 10,000 to 20,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is it not correct to say that since the Minister announced the abolition of the land tax and its replacement by income tax through the method of the farm income profile form that no form has been issued to any farmer by the Revenue Commissioners to date?  When is it proposed to issue the forms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that some minor adjustments had to be made to the form.  The Deputy may be correct in saying that no forms have gone out but we must take into account what has happened in regard to the VAT refund which will bring in an additional £9 million from farming.  We must remember that many farmers are on an income that is much lower than many of those already in the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the VAT adjustment constitutes money coming in from farmers? Surely it is properly described as a reduction in moneys going out to farmers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  Farm income, as described by the Minister, is taxed in terms of personal taxation to the extent of less than 3½ per cent.  Has the Minister any target to establish over the next five to ten years a different return from farm income?  Has he a target of 5 per cent or 10 per cent?  Has he any view on what percentage of farm income should be the subject matter of personal and/or corporate taxation?  How does he propose to reach those targets?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Deputy did not listen to the reply or <Col N="2264" /> else he does not know much about how income tax is computed.  I said quite clearly that in computing the figure for farm income no account was taken of the many legitimate personal and business allowances which farmers may use in calculating their tax bills.  That is the position in regard to any taxpayer.  It is my intention and that of the Government to ensure that everybody in the community will pay tax according to their incomes, and that includes farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it is possible for farmers to deduct substantial business expenses.  Supposing even half of the farmers' incomes, £500 million, was taxable as against the return of 7 per cent, which is ludicrous, is there not a suggestion that the Minister is hiding behind a difficulty in computation?  Is not the reality that only between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of farm incomes are being taxed at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add something I had intended to say in reply to the Deputy's first supplementary.  As many as 70,000 farmers are not taxable at present.  That is something that successive Governments in the past 10 to 12 years have failed to take action on.  We are now working towards that.  I do not think any Deputy would contradict the wish of the Government to ensure that everybody will pay tax according to their incomes.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that as a marked contrast to the previous Government, discussions have taken place at the highest level between the Government and the farming organisations and that the latter have now ensured that the existing outstanding land tax due is in the process of being paid together with greater co-operation in the payment of health contributions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm what the Deputy is saying but I do so with <Col N="2265" /> caution.  I would ask farmers to increase their payments of land tax and health contribution arrears.  Already there has been an improvement.  They should make every effort, like every other sector, particularly those PAYE taxpayers, to pay their health contributions and employment levy.  I refer, too, to the self-employed who probably have more tax outstanding than the farming community.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to have future Revenue Commissioner circulars in relation to the collection of taxes and arrears of taxes submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>The issue of circulars of this nature is an administrative matter and arises in the context of the Revenue Commissioners' responsibilities for the care and management of taxes entrusted to them by the various taxing statues passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Department of Finance have statutory responsibility for the Revenue Commissioners but that the commissioners are independent in the discharge of their functions, surely the Minister would agree this is a necessary development when one considers that in the interest of greater accountability £800 million of VAT liability was written off recently?  Surely the Minister is answerable for that to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the speculation that has been going on for nearly 18 or 19 years about the amount of outstanding tax.  In many instances such speculation has been a load of nonsense.  Changing figures occur on any given day.  On one day the figure could be X and the next it could be X minus Y or plus Y.  I will refer generally to the control of the Minister for Finance. Ministers are bound by the various taxing statutes of the Oireachtas and the commissioners in discharging their duties must act conscientiously and with total integrity within the limits of their staff and resources.  These resources must be managed by the Revenue Commissioners as cost effectively and as economically as possible consistent with obtaining and if possible exceeding the tax yield specified in annual budgets.  The activities of the Revenue Commissioners are subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public <Col N="2267" /> Accounts.  In order to achieve management objectives, the Revenue Commissioners must be allowed a sufficient measure of freedom of manoeuvre which is a feature of any large undertaking if it is to make the best use of its resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the Minister for Finance who is accountable to the House and the country for the level of taxation imposed?  It causes great upset to people when they hear that there can be write-offs involving millions of pounds without the Minister being answerable to the House for it.  In the interest of tax equity and tax reform does the Minister not agree that he should be able to answer for major actions by the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with precedents established before the House came into existence.  Perhaps they need to be updated but until they are I have to go by established precedents.  Those of us who pay our tax on the button are always concerned when we read this speculation, and rightly so.  However, we must be realistic.  For nine years from 1969 I had the honour to be a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, an excellent committee, now reformed. Every item of write-off above £100 had to be notified by the Revenue Commissioners to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Subsequently, that would appear in his report and could be examined by the committee, all-party body of this House.  I do not have any complaints in regard to any massive write-offs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the principle behind Deputy Kennedy's question is a reasonable one? It causes a great deal of concern to the public when they read that company X, Y, or Z has gone into liquidation owing the commissioners, say £600,000.  It is fair and reasonable to ask how this could arise.  Were checks not carried out?  We meet other people who complain very regularly that are being hounded by <Col N="2268" /> inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners despite the fact that their taxes are up to date.  It appears the Minister for Finance should have some control over the overall running of the Revenue Commissioners and the manner in which they go about their business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being misleading when he says people are being hounded where taxes are up to date.  On the other hand, he rightly points out the concern we all feel where companies are defaulting mainly through liquidations and how such situations are brought about.  A debate could be held on that point alone.  I am sure there is no Deputy in this House who is not at present dealing with a case where there is difficulty in meeting demands from the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; payment of arrears, interest accumulated on those arrears and so on.  It is very easy for the Minister for Finance of the day to go to his office, ring the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and tell him to collect overnight the money from all the cases which are under review.  This could close down a very large percentage of industries because for one reason or another they may be in financial difficulties and may be owed money and cannot remit their taxes to the Revenue Commissioners.  As I said, we could have a debate on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in this House is advocating that the Revenue Commissioners should go easy on anybody.  The point is the tax is due and it should be paid as the PAYE sector pay every week, fortnight or month.  It is important that the Revenue Commissioners are left to do their job, as they have been doing since the foundation of the State.  As regards taxes which are outstanding or which have been assessed, <Col N="2269" /> I do not believe anyone would suggest the Minister for Finance should ask why a certain person or firm has not been paid by 11 o'clock this morning or 12 o'clock tomorrow morning or so on.  The care and management of the taxes of the State are given to the Revenue Commissioners and they do a very good job.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister take steps to ensure that Revenue speak with one voice about these controversial matters?  We get the official version from the Minister in the House and the unofficial version from employees of the Revenue Commissioners in the daily newspapers.  The fact that the Revenue Commissioners and their staff are at odds is causing great concern.  They are saying opposite things about the collection of revenue.  The people on the job are saying the money is not being collected and the people with responsibility for collection are saying it is.

Since last Monday I have been carefully considering a point which was discussed in the House this morning in the debate on the Finance Bill, that is, the misinformation given out by Revenue.  I have been carefully examining this matter with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners over the past few months and we have come to the conclusion that it is time to provide a proper press and information office in that Department to ensure the accurate <Col N="2270" /> and authoritative supply of information at all times.</P>

I make a wider point. The Minister is responsible on a political basis for all the decisions as to arrears of tax, the manner in which they are implemented, in particular the amount of resources made available to the Revenue Commissioners to follow up arrears of tax, and the employment of staff to carry out that aspect of their work but Deputy Kennedy is asking, Deputy Noonan is backing her and I re-echo that there should be political accountability.  I am asking the Minister if he accepts political accountability for the decisions which are made in the administration of the tax system.</P>

God knows, there is enough to be done at the moment.  I have full confidence in the way the Revenue Commissioners handle their affairs.  Deputy Noonan covered the point very realistically. ]We have had difficulties on numerous occasions in recent times, the previous Government, the Government before that as well as the present Government, about inspired leaks from all sorts of agencies, but in particular from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>St. Laurence's Gate, Drogheda, which is owned by the Corporation of Drogheda, was placed in the Guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works in 1965.</P>
      <P>In the intervening years, substantial repair works were carried out by the commissioners and of course, any maintenance works required in the future to protect the national monument will also be carried out by them.</P>
      <P>However, financing of works to enable the monument to be opened up for tourist purposes, which is what I presume the Deputy has in mind, would be beyond the function of guardianship.  This would properly be a matter for the owner, aided if desired, by other interested parties and subject to the consent of the commissioners under the National Monuments Acts.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware that this is indeed a very important monument being a barbican of one of the town gates in Drogheda and regarded as the first of its kind in the country.  I agree that if it were re-opened to the public it would be a most welcome added tourist attraction in the Boyne Valley region.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Corporation of Drogheda have made the refurbishment and opening of the gate to the public an objective in their draft development plan and I would be very happy to see them achieve this goal.

      <P>The legislation under which the national lottery operates provides that the surplus generated by the lottery may be used for the purposes of sport and other recreation, among other things.  The Government recently decided in allocating the first £7 million of lottery revenue that £3.15 million should be spent on youth and sports projects. ]The Minister of State at the Department of Education, who has responsibility for sport and youth affairs, is responsible for preparing the detailed list of projects which he recommends for funding from the lottery.

      <P>The Minister's reply was very peculiar and it is hard to ask a question if we do not know whether it is possible to allocate this money from the national lottery.  Is the Minister aware of the benefits to the economy of the £250,000 grant given by the Coalition Government last year to national hunt racing in terms of increased attendances at meetings and increased receipts from the tote?

Could the Minister make a recommendation to the Minister responsible for sport that an allocation equivalent to the figures given by the last Government to national hunt racing for 1987-88, that is £250,000, will be made?

My Department's review is still on-going and before any proposals are finalised consultation will be required with a number of interested parties, including, of course, the Comptroller and Auditor General himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister disposed to widening the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General in principle?  Is he willing to put any timetable on introducing legislation to bring about that effect?  Does the Minister agree that there is widespread public concern that the Comptroller and Auditor General is limited to asking very technical questions which effectively deal with whether money was applied technically in the area where it was supposed to be rather than whether it should have been applied or if it was wasted?  Finally, will the Minister agree that the White Paper on a better way to conduct the nation's finance produced, I think, by Deputy Bruton brought up the question of whether these powers should be amplified or whether there should be a commissioner on public expenditure.  Many years have passed since that White Paper was floated and we still seem no nearer to legislation in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that the areas being reviewed are very complex and sensitive. ]The Deputy will appreciate that. This is the first major review since the twenties.  The present legislation requires <Col N="2278" /> that the Comptroller and Auditor General audits Government accounts for accuracy and regularity.  However &mdash; and this I have had experience of myself &mdash; over the years he has expanded his role on a non-statutory basis to identifying and reporting on instances of loss, waste or uneconomic expenditure.  That is a fact and it cannot be denied, as members of the Committee of Public Accounts will accept.  This portion of his work has involved the Comptroller and Auditor General in examining questions of economy and efficiency but on the whole he has not become involved in the area of effectiveness.  Any proposals for giving him a role in relation to effectiveness must ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not become involved in commenting on or criticising Government policy or the merits of policy objectives.  I think all Members of the House would agree with that, as would the Comptroller and Auditor General himself.  It would merely lead the Comptroller and Auditor General into conflict with the Government and draw him into the area of political controversy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to that portion of Deputy McDowell's question which asked whether the Minister, in principle, believes it would be right that legislation be introduced formally to extend the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General in view of his apparent endorsement of the creeping role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in that area of valuation of expenditure?  Secondly, is the Minister aware that in the Comptroller and Auditor General's most recent report, in the introduction there is a specific reference to the fact that with the optimum utilisation of his existing resources the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Mac Domhnaill, clearly states he is unable adequately to evaluate and do his present task.  That is also a matter of immediate and urgent concern.  There is a question of the principle of whether we should have some form of valuation of expenditure and, secondly, the immediate virtual crisis in relation to the auditing <Col N="2279" /> of present Government expenditure. This is, incidentally, already two years out of date, the last report being 1985. The Comptroller and Auditor General puts down the marker then that he cannot do any further work.</P>

      <P>It is very relevant. The internal departmental review is expected to be completed in the autumn and it is from there on that we can start the consultation with interested parties. In talking about acceptance in principle, we are talking about very sensitive and complex issues here.  It is not a question of being for or against in principle.  It is a question of having the review, which is ongoing at present, completed and the necessary consultations taking place with the Comptroller and Auditor General and other interested parties.  In my time around here, regardless of the role, I have yet to hear of any Government agency saying they have surplus staff.  There is no agency of whom I know that have not on numerous occasions stated that they never have enough staff.  That is a fact.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the plans, if any, he has for the valuation of ESB property for rating purposes; and whether he accepts the reported claim that rates on their property would rightfully yield £16 million less than the levy being collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 36 together.  I would like, first, to explain that I have no function in determining valuations of property for rating purposes.  This is a matter for the Commissioner of Valuation who has statutory independence in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, I can give certain general information regarding the matters raised. There are two categories of property to be looked at in this context.  The first is that category of property on which the ESB actually pay rates to individual local authorities, that is, mainly showrooms, offices and stores, which are valued in the normal way.  I understand that the total of rates paid to local authorities under this heading is in the region of £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second category is the generating and transmission property which, under the Electricity Supply Acts, 1927 to 1981, are exempt from rates.  It was in relation to the second category of property that the Electricity Supply Amendment Act, 1982 provided that the ESB should make an annual payment to the Minister for the Environment.  For 1986 the amount determined to be due was £24 million, and this has now been paid.  This contribution &mdash; and earlier contributions &mdash; was determined by the Government in the light of advice from the Commissioner of Valuation.  I am satisfied that <Col N="2281" /> the contributions paid by the ESB were not excessive.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to assure the House that I am anxious that the contributions payable by the ESB in lieu of rates be put on a more formal basis.  I hope to bring proposals before the Government in this area shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £24 million for generating and transmission plant which is exempt from rates but is charged on the basis of an annual levy seems to have no connection whatever with the figure that would more appropriately be paid if these properties were rated in the normal commercial way, or if the rates bill were calculated in the normal way for properties generally.  I understand that the figure of £24 million is approximately one-seventh of the total amount of money collected nationally for rates and properties.  This is clearly excessive and is undoubtedly a major reason for electricity costs being the highest in Europe, particularly for industry. ]Will the Minister recognise it has no relationship at all with property rates generally and is a very severe burden on the ESB?  It is adding greatly to the cost of electricity for the ESB.  In consequence, will he not consider reducing that amount drastically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept either of the points made by the Deputy.  I have tried to be as helpful as I can in so far as my responsibility goes.  The questions of how rateable valuations are done or what they are, are matters for the Commissioner for Valuation who is statutorily independent.  The contribution in lieu of the rates paid by the ESB is paid to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy has responsibility for the ESB and the governing legislation. What is being done at the moment is being done under the 1982 legislation. The contribution in lieu of rates has very, very little to do with the cost of electricity.</P>

      <P>I refer more specifically to efforts towards increasing productivity that would be across the board and not just affecting those areas where there seem to be excess numbers.  I want to ask the Minister if there would be programmes introduced which would improve the efficiency in each Department and if the results could be built into the monthly returns.</P>
      <P>As a further supplementary I would like to ask the Minister how many meetings he has had with other Ministers specifically to examine the areas of overlap and duplication in the public service. In that regard can the Minister say if a programme of priority areas has been drawn up which the Civil Service will look to where there might be overlap and duplication.</P>

      <P>I can reply to both <Col N="2288" /> the Deputy's questions in the same way. As the Deputy is aware and as most people outside of the House are aware, the Government have decided that expenditure reviews should be undertaken in every single Department.  The Taoiseach has been involved in this.  A number of Departments have already undergone the process and many are undergoing the process.  All of those reviews will come before the Government for decision.  In that context staffing, programmes, services and so on will be taken into account not only in relation to additional savings that might be made in 1987 but also for the purpose of continuing the efforts of this Government in effecting savings in 1988 and beyond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says about the review of the expenditure in various Departments but I am interested in whether we will have programmes drawn up which will be effective not just in the immediate future but in the long term.  Is the Minister satisfied that there will not be a real reduction in services by reason of the cuts in numbers? It is in that connection that I ask about productivity and the efforts towards it. Will the Minister agree or disagree that there will be a reduction in services attached to the cuts in numbers?</P>

      <P>In connection with any area of expenditure covered by the word productivity.  I am not arguing against the principle outlined by the Deputy.  I fully agree with her approach to this.  To achieve what we would like to see this process must be undergone.  I am quite satisfied that arising from that review we will have a much better, more streamlined and cost effective service generally.  This is our approach in the <Col N="2289" /> context of the national debt and in the context of the high level of taxation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> asked the Minister for Finance the total national debt; the cost of servicing this debt in 1987; the proportion of the debt which is domestic and foreign; in respect of foreign debt the currencies in which it is borrowed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The national debt at 31 March 1987 is estimated at £25,380 million, including £15,617 million of domestic debt, representing 61 per cent of the total, and £9,763 million of foreign debt, 38 per cent of the total.  The 1987 cost of servicing this debt, including the cost of servicing new borrowings up to 31 December 1987 is £2,146 million.</P>
      <P>Almost 88 per cent of the foreign debt at 31 March 1987 was denominated in five currencies.  These currencies and the proportion of the foreign debt they accounted for were: Deutsche Mark (28.4 per cent), US Dollar (25.8 per cent), Swiss Franc (14.6 per cent), Japanese Yen (12.5 per cent) and European Currency Unit (6.5 per cent).  Apart from the Dutch Guilder, which accounted for 5.8 per cent and Sterling, which accounted for 4.7 per cent, no other currency accounted for a significant proportion of the debt.</P>
      <P>The budgetary measures introduced by this Government are a significant step towards stabilising the debt/GNP ratio, which had been increasing at an unsustainable rate.  The Government are determined to pursue their policy of restoring order to the public finances and reducing dependency on borrowing.  So far as the foreign debt is concerned, we will continue to ensure a balanced currency distribution and good maturity structure in the debt.  Every effort will continue to be made to achieve the maximum savings in debt-servicing costs.</P>

Has there been any change in recent times in the percentage holding of foreign currency?  Is there a policy which requires a certain proportion to be kept in domestic and a certain proportion to be kept in foreign currency?  What are the parameters of this policy?  Could the Minister also provide the House with some information about how the local loans fund is treated in the debt?

      <P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy's question, there are no appreciable changes.  I do not have the exact information but from my experience I suggest that it is an ongoing thing that would be reviewed on a three and six monthly basis.  In reply to the second part of the Deputy's question about the ratio of foreign and national debt, that is something that is decided on a management basis.  Obviously, as was the case in the past, it is intended that the highest percentage would come from national debt, rather than by way of increasing the foreign debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1986, shall apply and have effect as if&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;designated area&rsquo; were substituted for &lsquo;Custom House Docks Area&rsquo; in subsection (1).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this is to seek to apply the provisions that relate to the provision of residential accommodation in the Custom House Docks area as defined in the Finance Act, 1986, section 43, to what is elsewhere in that Act defined as designated areas of the inner cities.  The five cities to which it applies are Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. In each of these cities an area has been designated for these purposes and the local authorities and others are endeavouring to promote this commercial and residential development in each of the areas.  In so far as many of those areas are concerned and particularly in so far as the area in Limerick is concerned, the proposals which were in existence for the provision of private residential accommodation by way of apartments either for sale or for rent have largely been put at nought by virtue of the decision of the Government at the time of the budget in relation to housing grants, and it is <Col N="2371" /> understood that none of the proposed 200 plus apartments and inner city houses that were to be provided at no cost to the Exchequer, other than grants, in the designated area in Limerick will now be proceeded with.  While I do not know the exact position in relation to the other cities, I would imagine that the same problem arises in respect of them it may well be that either a reduced number of such proposals is going ahead or that none at all are going ahead.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, under the section in question, there is considerable encouragement for development of this kind at the Custom House Docks area in Dublin. The purpose of designating the Custom House Docks area was the same basically as that in relation to other designated areas in the inner cities, to try to promote urban renewal, to try to clean up the rather run down aspect of all the inner cities, particularly Dublin and Limerick which, unfortunately, are the worst in this respect, and to try to promote development there that would not otherwise take place and by promoting that development to encourage other development to take place in the vicinity or the locality.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks area as defined in the 1986 Finance Act as far as I can ascertain extends only to an area of 27 acres and in the context of inner city Dublin or the inner city of any city, that is a very small area indeed.  Since most of this Custom House Docks area is intended for commercial development in any event, there cannot be a great deal of space left for residential development. Therefore, it is important that this area be extended to include the whole of what is defined in the 1986 Act as the designated area not alone in relation to Dublin but in relation to the four other cities also.  This will have the effect of enabling development to take place in the five inner city areas which would not otherwise take place.</P>
    <P>The cost to the State in relation to a matter such as this must be very small indeed because the encouragement is mainly by way of foregoing things that <Col N="2372" /> the State would otherwise be entitled to, but the State is entitled to nothing out of these areas for the moment because they are lying derelict and producing no revenue and no commercial or economic activity.  Since the cost in net terms would be negligible and since the investment would be by definition by way of private finance, the State is not called on to make any capital allocation.</P>
    <P>Such investment would be a valuable way of creating development in these designated inner city areas, particularly as there is now danger, due to the abolition of the grants, that no residential development would take place in any of them.</P>
    <P>The one in which, to my knowledge, the greatest degree of such development was proposed, relatively speaking at any rate, was Limerick.  It is very disappointing to see that that whole proposal, which up to a few months ago would have amounted to more than 200 dwellings in a relatively small area designated in the inner city of Limerick, is not now going to go ahead.  This is a way of overcoming that problem.  It applies these rights to the five inner cities, including Dublin and not just to one small designated area within the overall designated area of Dublin.  Because of the manner in which it is proposed to be dealt with, I hope that the Minister will find it acceptable and that this proposed new section will be accepted and enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The proposal for the development of inner cities was one of the major proposals for the construction industry which was sponsored by the previous Government.  It was not an original idea.  Inner city development has taken place now in many cities in the UK, on the Continent and in the US.  The arguments are pretty much the same wherever you find a derelict inner city area.  We have had a kind of doughnut development in many of our cities where we got an increasingly developing suburban area around the perimeter of the city with a great big hole developing in the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of the home improvement <Col N="2373" /> grants, which we opposed, had a devastating effect on the development plans for inner cities because while commercial development will go ahead the total concept of restoring life to inner city areas, bringing back the living city, using existing infrastructure, has been totally obstructed by the abolition of those grants.  In particular it has been obstructed by the removal of the £5,000 grant for people who move from local authority houses.  Quite frequently in cities such as Limerick people who live in local authority houses on the fringes of the city are people who originated in the city centre and who would be quite prepared to go back if the £5,000 grant were available.  It was a great tragedy the grant was removed in respect of designated areas in the inner cities.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider treating the inner city designated areas in the five cities in the same way as the Gaeltacht areas are being treated, exempt them from the abolition of the home improvement grants.  I do not think there would be a great net cost involved.  It would lead to greater activity and would restore the living city.  There is a precedent by way of order when the Minister for the Environment was able to exempt Gaeltacht areas and I cannot see why inner city areas could not be exempted also.  If we had that commitment there would be no need for this amendment but in the absence of that kind of commitment I will be supporting this amendment.  It is a tragedy that a scheme that captured people's imaginations, which was well on its way to fulfilment &mdash; planning permissions having been granted for several hundred houses, with tenants available to move from local authority houses back into small inner city dwellings &mdash; suddenly ceased as a result of the side-effect of the discontinuance of the home improvement grants in the last budget.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider that suggestion, ascertaining whether he could exempt these areas just as the Gaeltacht areas have been exempted?  Could he ensure that the grants would still apply over the period of development attaching <Col N="2374" /> to the designated areas, which is three years?  Certainly it would alleviate local authority housing lists.  The Minister would be able to recoup the money from his allocations to local authorities in respect of housing.  It is a side-effect the Minister did not intend but I can assure him it will have a devastating effect in not fulfilling the intent of the proposal for inner city development.  While commercial development will go ahead people will not be in a position to live in the inner cities.  To put it bluntly, the people who originated there, who now live in areas such as Moyrosses and Tallaght are the people who are prepared to go back and live in the centre.  It should be remembered that the churches, schools, gasmains, water and sewerage, facilities, electricity supply and so on are there, the total physical infrastructure is present. What is needed is the incentive for people to go back and live in the inner city areas.  I do not need to remind the House of the beneficial effect of that on such areas.  It would bring the inner cities alive again, leading to an immediate reduction in crime.  One of the reasons there is such an incidence of crime in inner city areas is that they have become areas that close down after 5.30 in the evening, becoming a concrete playground for the vandals of the city.  Restoring an ordered, living community to the centre would eliminate many of the social problems also.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give the House a commitment that he will exempt the inner city designated areas from the abolition of the package of grants which was removed countrywide?  The precedent exists already in respect of the Gaeltacht areas.  Perhaps the Minister would give us a commitment to examine the matter between now and Report Stage, telling us what he thinks about it.  I do not think it will cost anything and would constitute a progressive decision.  It would help enormously to fulfil the intent of those of us who framed the package for inner cities.  It would help my city of Limerick in particular and also the city of Dublin where the inner area is absolutely devastated. ]If we cannot have that commitment, then I support the intent of <Col N="2375" /> Deputy O'Malley's amendment, in that if we cannot achieve our purose one way we will try another.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am talking about the whole package but particularly the housing grant.  The one which has the most effect in this regard is the £5,000 grant.  If the Minister could allow that to obtain in respect of inner city designated areas, it would have an enormous effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>When the designated areas for the scheme were being selected it was decided, as a matter of policy, that special treatment should be given to the Custom House Docks area so as to direct developers' attention to that area as a priority.  Accordingly the package of incentives was tailored to achieve that objective by allowing section 23 relief in its original, unrestricted form in respect of the docks area only, giving capital allowances for commercial buildings in designated areas of Dublin, other than the docks area, at one half the rate only allowable in the docks area and in the provincial designated areas.  The extension of this form of section 23 relief to all designated areas would negate the desired preferential treatment of the docks area and, by virtue of its widespread availability, would diminish the value of the relief as an incentive to the renewal of the Custom House Docks area as a special case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment I can give the House is that as we see the progress of development on the docks site area and the part being played by the operation of section 23 relief in that area, the question of extending the relief to other designated areas can then be considered.  Even though Deputies Noonan and O'Malley suggest there is no cost involved, I should say there is always a cost involved.  There is no such thing as introducing relief of one kind or another, or taxation of any kind without it being a cost on the <Col N="2376" /> Exchequer.  That is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point raised by Deputy Noonan about the package of grants &mdash; the £5,000 grant, the reconstruction grant and so on &mdash; which involves resources.  Already in the pipeline, as I said when replying to other queries raised in the course of this Committee Stage debate, £100 million is allocated to those grants this year.  We know there is another £100 million committed for next year as works reach completion. That may not be the end of the story.  It should be remembered that that covers applications up to 27 March last only. Until such time as those things come out of the pipeline and we have an opportunity of reviewing the progress made by way of the operation of section 23 relief on the docks site &mdash; the advantages that area will have compared with other designated areas &mdash; until such time as all of that can be assessed, then I do not foresee any possibility of accepting what is proposed in the amendment.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's response.  I find it very difficult to accept what he has to say.  He appears to dismiss this whole matter in a somewhat facile manner.  The main argument he advances is that there would be no advantage to the Custom House Docks area if the same provisions applied elsewhere.  Theoretically that argument might be true so far as other parts of the inner city of Dublin are concerned but what competition is there between the Custom House Docks area in Dublin, and, say, the inner city of Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Galway?  There is none, and the Minister's argument falls down.  If the Minister wants to maintain his argument in relation to Dublin, I will amend my amendment to exclude the remainder of Dublin if he wants to ensure that the Custom House Docks area is developed first.  But who, contemplating the possibility of building residential accommodation, or living in residential accommodation in the Custom House Docks area of Dublin, would be influenced by the existence of similar accommodation provided under similar terms <Col N="2377" /> in inner city Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Galway?  The answer to that is that nobody would and there is no competition between those four cities and the Custom House Docks area of Dublin. Therefore, the Minister's argument falls down so far as those four cities are concerned.</P>
      <P>He knows as well as I do that the section 23 provisions of the Finance Act 1981 were very successful.  They were the cause of a tremendous amount of building in the country that would not otherwise have taken place.  They were foolishly, I thought, abolished by the last Government under the type of Department of Finance thinking which is that any tax relief is <i>ipso facto</i> bad and must be discouraged. ]I would have hoped that with the change of Government we might have had a change of vision but obviously that is not so.  I could just as easily be listening to Deputy Dukes or Deputy Bruton on these matters, particularly Deputy Dukes who found it very hard to imagine that economic activity was worthwhile and that frequently it could pay for itself both in fiscal terms and in terms of overall economic development.  I find this very disappointing.  I would have expected more from the present Minister for Finance. ]His main argument is wrong in so far as four of the five cities are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall many members of the Fianna Fáil Party deploring the ending of the section 23 incentives.  They have an opportunity here to restore them, not in relation to the country generally, but only in relation to five run-down inner city areas and God knows they are run-down, especially Dublin and Limerick which are badly in need of this sort of development. The other three cities are not as bad. Every country has recognised that there will not be worthwhile development of derelict inner cities unless the State gives some kind of incentive of the type we are talking about.  Everywhere this has happened it was as a result of encouragement having been given by the State and not by giving grants for capital allocations. ]That is not what I am asking for; I am asking for some kind of reasonable <Col N="2378" /> incentive of the type that existed previously for one part of inner city Dublin but not for the remainder of it.</P>
    <P>If this is invalid why does it relate to the Custom House Docks area?  There is a lot more to inner city Dublin that is derelict than the Custom House Docks. As I well know, a lot of inner city Limerick is derelict because of its age.  It seems to me that when the Exchequer is not called on to pay out anything, whatever notional cost there may be, is more than offset by the economic activity that is generated.  It is very disappointing that the Minister will not accede to this in particular when its success has been proven in the past and when his main arguments about other areas being in competition do not apply in so far as four of the five cities are concerned.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether amendment 49 in the Minister's name covers this point to some extent.  It certainly deals with some cognate or analogous matters by extending the definition of designated areas for urban renewal relief.  We know, the older type of urban renewal relief has now been rendered useless, by the abolition of the grants in so far as residential development is concerned.  All buildings in Limerick have stopped.  There were to be over 200 dwellings built in that city but none of them is going ahead as a result of that decision.  That is a pity because development will not now take place.  I do not think the other cities were at such an advanced stage as Limerick in this respect but they could be and they could have taken an example from Limerick. Now none of those areas will be developed other than presumably some commercial development.</P>
    <P>That is unhealthy.  Those five inner cities should only have commercial development.  There is nobody living in them because it is prohibitively expensive to do so and there is no form of support or incentives to live in them.  All the premises will be locked up at 6 o'clock every evening and they will be subject to gangs of youths, often with criminal intent, roaming around them.  Iron bars and grills have to be put on the premises to protect them.  We can get rid of that <Col N="2379" /> atmosphere in our inner cities by encouraging people to live there.  For centuries people lived in the inner part of all our cities but that is no longer the case.  If the Minister refuses to accept this amendment, the Minister is taking the view that people can stay out of the inner cities and that is a pity.  That is what they have decided to do and post 31 March all residential development has stopped.  The only way it will resume again is if this is extended beyond the Custom House Docks area of 27 acres to inner cities generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could repeat all I have said already but the Deputy still would not be satisfied.  We would all love to agree with everything he has said and to be able to implement all the incentives that would be required to do exactly as he has said, whether in Limerick, Sligo or anywhere else, but that is not possible. We do not have the resources to do so or to forego such an amount of money in taxes of one kind or another.  The incentives are there.  I agree they are greater for the Custom House Docks area than they are for the designated areas or for the rest of Dublin but there are many towns and cities that do not have the incentives that are available in the five areas the Deputy talks about.  They want those incentives and if they had them, work would go ahead.  In some places work would probably go ahead with or without the incentives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 26, amendment 49 in my own name I am seeking the support of the House to have those designated areas extended because of the interest that is shown in many other towns that are not included in the five borough areas.  I cannot understand how the Deputy can throw such cold water on what are important incentives for the development of these designated areas, whether it be in Dublin, Limerick, Waterford or wherever. ]One can always say that this should be expanded but, as I have said already, there are a number of areas that do not even have the kind of incentives that are being criticised by Deputy O'Malley.  It <Col N="2380" /> is unfortunate that there are not people with the foresight to take advantage of these incentives because there will be people living in centre cities.  We have seen the enormous developments of residential property in Dublin that have taken place and that continue to take place.  I know of several examples in other towns.  I will not be parochial in talking about any town but if the incentives that are available for the five designated areas were available in those towns much work would be created.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the attitude adopted by Deputy O'Malley in this regard.  As I said when suggesting to him that I could not accept this amendment, when I see the progress that is made particularly in the Custom House Docks area, with the advantage of the section 23 incentives and the part it has played, maybe there will be an opportunity of extending it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That might hold water if we did not know what the advantages, the benefits or the likely effect of section 23 would be.  Section 23 was in operation for a number of years before it was done away with by the last Government. ]We know exactly the tremendous benefits that accrued as a result of it.  It kept thousands of people in employment in the building industry who would otherwise have lost their employment and who have lost it since section 23 came to an end.  The Minister's argument does not hold water.  He said we have to wait and see whether this section 23 incentive for the Customs House Docks area will work.  We know it will work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We know it will work and why not extend it now?  Presumably there will not be another Finance Bill until this time 12 months and that means that as far as the inner city areas in the five cities mentioned are concerned we are saying we can forget about them now for the next 12 months and that nothing will happen.  The Minister has said it is <Col N="2381" /> now necessary under amendment No. 49 to extend the existing inner city reliefs or incentives to other places.  That is grand but he misses the point which is that the places it is being extended to are not in cities.  Those places do not have the terrible problems the inner parts of cities have, particularly those that are 800 or 900 years old and have large populations. By virtue of their size they do not have the terrible social problems or the appalling pressures that exist in the inner parts of those cities.  The scale of the dereliction is only a tiny fraction of what it is in the larger cities.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 49 for what it is worth but even if the Minister extends it to every town on the basis of the experience we have over the past three or four months in the existing designated areas of the five cities there will not be any dwellings built because the buildings proposed have now come to a stop.  It is a tragedy as far as Limerick and Dublin are concerned &mdash; they are the ones with the worst problems &mdash; that this has come to an end.  If I was proposing something we had never heard of there might be some validity in the Minister's argument that we will have to wait and see but this is not new.  What I am suggesting has been well tried and proved successful.  Section 23 worked here for a number of years.  It kept thousands of people in employment but they lost their jobs when it came to an end.  We can put those thousands back into employment if we accept the amendment. ]It is a matter for the Dáil to decide and to help the Dáil decide that in a positive way I ask the Minister to bear in mind the historical facts I have outlined. He should agree to accept our amendment now so that we can get between 3,000 and 4,000 people back to work in the building industry within the next 12 months.  We can do that by accepting the amendment which consists of two or three lines.  What is proposed will not cost the Exchequer any capital and there will probably be a net gain to the Exchequer.  Therefore, the arguments that are usually made about reliefs or incentives of this type do not apply.</P>

      <P>I see this as a commencement of the work in the inner city. No Member has taken a closer view of what has happened to the inner city of Dublin than I in recent years.  It could be stated that what is proposed is ten years too late but, however, it is a beginning and we should support it to the fullest extent.  I wonder about the advantages of section 23.  The building industry can be perceived to be an industry that can be turned on and off by the injection of moneys and incentives but one of the great problems in the capital city is that while section 23 encouraged builders to supply a stock of apartments in outlying areas, unfortunately it created a glut of apartments some of which are substandard. ]Some of those apartments do not comply with the rigorous planning conditions.  There was a rush to get as many apartments as possible built.  If there is to be any extension of section 23 it should be to refurbish the existing stock in the inner city.  We should give incentives to people to improve their property in the inner city.  Many fine properties in that area could be improved by an extension of this grant.  However, money is not available today for that type of development and that is regrettable.</P>
      <P>The Custom House Docks site is unique and I would like to see it perceived as a model for other developers.  I am disappointed we could not see a blueprint for an extension of the inner city on the north and south sides bordered by the canals and with less emphasis on a particular section of the city.  I accept that would be very difficult given the conflicting planning between our local authorities in urban areas and the new powers that will be given by the Minister to such areas.  There is no doubt there would be a conflict and a slowing down of the rate of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued vigorously for the Bill dealing with urban areas when it was moved in the House five years ago because I felt it was a means of designating areas in need of renewal such as areas in the capital city, in Limerick, Cork and other cities. I am familiar with the region in Limerick referred to by Deputy O'Malley and I <Col N="2383" /> agree it is in need of renewal.  There are other areas in Cork and Galway in need of renewal.  What is proposed has been welcomed by the business community as a good approach to inner city renewal. We should not do anything that will inhibit the success of this project.</P>
    <P>Members representing inner city areas will accept there are attendant problems such as the lock-up concept at night and difficulties caused by vandalism.  It is important that the areas surrounding the Custom House Docks site protect themselves by proper policing.  The former Minister for Justice who introduced the highly successful community watch scheme is present and I cannot help complimenting him on his work in that regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley made a lot of play about the advantages of the incentives and said they were nil when compared to the Custom House Docks scheme.  However, I should like to point out to the Deputy that other designated areas get a 50 per cent write-off over the years for owner-occupied dwellings and that does not apply in the case of the Customs House Docks scheme.  That concession is contained in section 44 (2) of the 1986 Act.</P>

The Minister has now dashed the hopes of people who thought their inner cities would be developed.  The commercial development will go ahead but the development of residential property has been stopped stone dead by the Minister's decision.</P>
      <P>Even if Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted it would apply to section 23 accommodation only, which historically is at the upper end of the market.  It would apply to young single people who frequently are transient. There is income tax relief of £500 but in places like Limerick inner city we do not have any incentive to take people out of corporation houses and put them back where their fathers and mothers came from because the £5,000 grant is gone.

      <P>The purpose of the section is to enable the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, to designate by order certain areas in addition to those provided for in Chapter IV, Part I of the Finance Act, 1986, to be designated areas for the purpose of incentive relief for urban renewal provided for in the 1986 Act and to extend by order the boundaries of the Custom House Docks areas defined in that chapter.  In general, designated areas are areas in which there is a special need to promote urban renewal and development.</P>

      <P>I will draw the Minister's attention to the genuine concern for our <Col N="2388" /> inner cities.  I represent two satellite towns.  I do not represent Tallaght which is probably one of the most pressing cases but which has been left without any incentive package.  I have listened to some other Deputies pointing out the benefits of the development incentive scheme for inner city but the new satellite towns should not be neglected.  There are only 75 per cent completed.  I ask the Minister to recognise that there is probably £100 million of immediate construction work to commence in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown town centres with private sector funding.  Hundreds of millions of pounds from the public sector have been invested in these new satellite towns.</P>
      <P>There is a high risk element involved especially in the Tallaght area &mdash; where more than 70,000 people are living and do not have a town centre.  At least the people living in the inner city have a city centre but in west Tallaght, Blanchardstown or some of those outlying areas they have a very inadequate transport service to the city.  When these people bought houses or were moved to these outlying areas they were promised all the necessary services, but they have been denied a town centre which should be the first element to be provided in any new town.  Some of these satellite towns have a higher population than Portlaoise, Limerick and other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to broaden this section and amend it to take in areas other than the inner city.  A very positive contribution can be made to job creation and the construction industry if we complete what was started in the late sixties in those satellite towns.  It is often forgotten that a great deal has been achieved in the inner cities.  Many new houses have been built in the Dublin inner city.  Deputy Noonan might feel that his £5,000 grant scheme was very imaginative, but it had the effect of clearing many community leaders from the large corporation housing schemes and the scheme had a detrimental effect on all those living in these areas.  Deputy Mac Giolla and I have correspondence from community leaders who saw the economic folly of that <Col N="2389" /> scheme &mdash; saving the national purse £20,000 by giving a £5,000 cheque to local authority dwellers if they moved into the private sector.  The scheme had economic merit but its social merits were suspect.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to ascertain on reading it a few times the precise effects of this amendment.  The Minister had very little to say, he read a few lines which were given to him, and that was it. Is it a fact that under subsection (1) the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, may redefine these areas?  Does this not have much the same effect as my earlier amendment, which he would not accept, because this allows him to redefine designated areas?  He explained earlier what he had in mind in regard to that, to include other towns and possibly larger areas of the existing five designated inner cities, but it also allows him to redefine what is called in section 41 the Custom House Docks area.  There is no limitation on the areas he can define.  It does not seem to have to be simply an extension of what is set out in Part II of the Fourth Schedule of the 1986 Act.  It could be anything.  He could define a part of Limerick for the purposes of this section as part of the Custom House Docks area.  Is it not the case that in effect paragraph (1) (b) of this amendment does what I suggested, except that it leaves it to the discretion of the Minister to define or extend it rather than make it obligatory, <Col N="2390" /> as my amendment would, in extending it to the designated areas as they are at present defined.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to this amendment because it cannot but be useful.  In spite of the vituperation visited on me in connection with it from the other side of the House today when I tried to be helpful, similar to the bitterness content of what was visited on me from this side of the House yesterday because unfortunately, this party is making an impact out of all proportion to its numbers and that probably causes these constant daily outbursts in our direction and in order that I might be even more enthusiastic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell us if the effect of paragraph (1) (b) is that it allows a wider definition because there does not seem to be anything which prescribes that it should be Dublin only, or an area bounding the existing Custom House Docks area as defined.  Could it not be anywhere in Dublin or anywhere else in the State?  If so, this goes a long way towards meeting the requirements in my previous amendment and for that matter, it would meet the point Deputy Lawlor makes.  For the purposes of this section, we could have the Custom House Docks area defined to include parts of Tallaght, Blanchardstown or whichever outer towns he is interested in.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At least today we have a framework, although we do not have enough time within that framework, to do our work.  I have serious reservations about this amendment. ]It is the classic &ldquo;me too&rdquo; syndrome which we have in Ireland.  If we have a scheme operating everybody says &ldquo;me too&rdquo; and wants it to apply everywhere.  I think it was very rational that we should have particular measures which would apply to the inner city areas of five specific cities &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  There is a particular package for commercial development, a particular package for social development and getting people to live in what I call the heart of the doughnut, a large hole where three or more generations have lived.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister comes into the House and seeks to get permission by order to extend designated areas to towns in the country.  We all know what will happen.  The Minister's colleagues, all the Deputies on the other side of the House and most of the Deputies on this side will ask the Minister to apply by order the designation of their own county towns and when they have the interests of their constituents in the county town satisfied they will proceed to every town and village in the country.  We have already heard Deputy Lawlor looking after his constituents, and no blame to him.  He wants the centre of Tallaght designated as a decayed urban area and it has been in existence for only 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are limited resources in any country and only a proportion of limited investment resources are available for the building industry, commercial or housing. ]If we disperse the benefit of this scheme by ministerial order to every county it will have no effect.  The only <Col N="2392" /> way this will work is by concentrating it.  I also object to it being done by ministerial order.  If we want to extend the designated areas to other towns the Minister for the Environment should amend the appropriate section of the Bill which designated the areas in the five cities in the first instance.  This sort of thing should not be done by order and we should not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, to proceed in this way.  I have serious objections to that kind of carry on.</P>
    <P>In so far as it also applies to extensions of the Custom House Docks area, I am fascinated by the concept that Deputy Desmond O'Malley introduced, that one could amend this so that the provisions in relation to the Custom House Docks could apply to a part of Limerick and that, as a consequence, his amendment would be redundant because section 23 would apply to the inner city in Limerick. That kind of debate is technically and theoretically correct but is a kind of nonsense which brings this House into disrepute. ]The Minister for Finance, being a sensible man, will not extend the definition of the Custom House Docks site to the inner city in Limerick and he would be an ass if he did.  I do not think that the leader of the Progressive Democrats intends to make an ass out of the Minister for Finance or out of this House but that would be the effect of the codology in which he has been indulging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy show me where in the amendment the Minister is precluded from defining some part of Limerick, Sligo or any village in the country as a Custom House Docks area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no problem in that regard.  You can define a cat as a dog or an ass as a cow if you like.  You can say that the Phoenix Park is a People's Park, Limerick.  It is nonsense even though it is technically correct.  The idea that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is redundant and that we can all relax and feel that the Minister in his wisdom will <Col N="2393" /> extend the definition of the Custom House Docks so that section 23 will apply to the inner city in Limerick is tautology. Deputy O'Malley should table his amendment again on Report Stage where we can debate it, line by line, and vote on it.</P>
      <P>I oppose this because it is wrong in principle and will diminish the impact which the package will have in the designated areas that already exist.  As I said, I also object to the fact that it is being done by order.  This is primary legislation and that is the way to proceed.  In so far as it refers to the Custom House Docks, does this allow the Minister, by extending the definition of that site, to extend the range of the financial service industry in Dublin?  There is no reason to extend the definition of the Custom House Docks site outside its immediate area, certainly not outside Dublin city.  To give credit to Deputy O'Malley, I can see a Minister defining the Custom House Docks site as going down the two sides of the Quays as far as Heuston Station if appropriate finance houses are to benefit from the 10 per cent tax regime which is attached to the Custom House Docks site.  Again, that is a matter for primary legislation or for a Finance Bill.  We know that the intent in the financial service industry in the Custom House Docks site is not to allow it to drift into the city.  However, if a Minister for Finance can, by order, extend the definition of the Custom House Docks site and the package which applies to the financial service industry, we can have them in Dame Street, along the Quays or Ballsbridge.  It depends on whether the Minister for Finance wants to extend it.  That is not the way to legislate in serious matters; this is a very bad amendment to which I am opposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment for a variety of reasons. There is a race against time in the question of developing our decaying city.  We do not have time on our side.  This amendment and its spirit gives effect to speeding up the ensnarled bureaucratic process in which local authorities are caught up in designating areas directly through the <Col N="2394" /> Department of the Environment and the Office of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It is very welcome because, for far too long, the Department of the Environment have been somewhat aloof from the development of the inner city.  There is a plethora of legislation either in direct development or in other legislation concerning the environment, including Acts dealing with litter, air pollution and so on.  This amendment will give effective powers directly, in consultation with the two Departments involved, to get on with the job.  It is an effective and imaginative amendment and the House should take cognisance of it because for the past five to eight years we have been almost in conflict with urban authorities, particularly &mdash; I do not mean to be parochial &mdash; in regard to Dublin Corporation.  The problem is that the local authorities involved, for one reason or another, did not have the muscle or the will to get on with developing the decaying city with the result that we got a system of hotch potch development throughout Dublin. There was no effective progress in regard to protection.  If financiers were prepared to inject money into the city or tried to develop an area, it could not be designated quickly enough but this amendment gives effect to such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be misinterpreting the amendment to link it with the Custom House Docks site.  It will give effect to developing other areas.  I suggest to the Minister that he should ensure in any negotiations with the Department of the Environment and in the context of the Custom House Docks site, that the entire area is screened archaeologically before development takes place.  That is not an expensive exercise as many archaeologists are readily available to undertake the task.  As the Minister is aware, his Department are directly responsible for this.  There is a wealth of archaeological treasure in the city which could also be in the docks site.  The Minister would show good faith, particularly as next year is the millennium in Dublin, by appointing a city archaeologist to do that work.  I strongly support the amendment which <Col N="2395" /> will give effect to freeing the bureaucratic tangle.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is considered in the spirit of its intention by the Opposition looking upon it as a means of catapulting forward urgently needed development in the city, it would be a step forward.  I do not regard it as dangerous legislation and there are far too many agencies acting as watchdogs and too many people concerned about our capital and other cities to allow the wrong type of development to take place, particularly after the debacle of Wood Quay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have some of the misgivings that have been expressed in relation not just to the concept but more particularly the capacity in our country to apply the concept.  Let me give a classic example of receiving a direction from the Minister for Finance to sell Jervis Street Hospital.  The capital moneys would accrue to the Exchequer and inevitably would be built into the allocation of the Department of Health.  The old line in terms of the designated area did not go near that hospital; it kept about 300 or 400 yards down towards the quay.  I told Government if we designated that area on a special basis that we would get a better price for selling the hospital, that the State presumably would get the money from the trustees and the State would have an enhanced price so that it would be easier to sell.</P>
      <P>Then at least two or three others of my colleagues came up with equally legitimate reasons as to why particular areas should be rapidly included in the designated area.  This brings me to the conclusion that in this dear country of ours no sooner does the concept of a designated, tax break area come into operation than the capacity to adapt an international concept and apply it in a city area could result in having the inner city of perhaps Edenderry designated as a special area.  We may even in Deputy Lawlor's area find the inner city of Rathcoole suddenly assuming a monumental attractiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2396" /> No sooner did Fianna Fáil come into office when dear old Sheriff Street was included, the Custom House suddenly expanded in all its glory to include the railway station, the back of the railway station and before it knew where it was it had the old post office building in it. Now we have a massive designated area. This capacity of Irish politicians did not originate in the Department of Finance; it started in Environment.  How could we flog those awful sites and get somebody to do something with them?  So we gave a tax concession and made it 10 per cent. With regard to the Fianna Fáil approach, bringing in the gloss of international financial services on top of a designated area made it look even more attractive. It is also a mirage.  In fairness, while we have inner city problems in Dublin and Limerick and I am sure Sligo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not least the falling down boutiques in the main street.  We have a serious problem in that the endemic temptation to expand the concept could result in the whole country becoming one designated area with one huge tax exemption.  It shows that in the country it is unwise to start out on that road.  I remember the reservations of successive Ministers for Finance on this but the multi-coloured maps and multi-coloured brochures looked wonderful in terms of activity and in bringing in prospective developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are inner city problems in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and to a lesser extent, in Waterford.  Many of these problems, in fact, have been solved and for the most part in the remaining segments, whether you go down Sean MacDermott Street, Fenian Street, into the East Wall, around the Custom House, or down to the inner city of Cork where <Col N="2397" /> there is major development, designation is not necessary at all except for some prospective developers who have the thumb on prospective politicians and Ministers and see themselves with a little bit of prosperity prospecting in terms of property development to gain from that.</P>
    <P>The net benefit to the Exchequer and the country is, indeed, quite marginal. The massive requirements of legislation, and above all else the problem of confining designation to within some degree of rationality, are beyond us.  It is beyond the capacity of most Ministers of the Environment and most Ministers for Finance to tell developers to hump off, to tell them if they go 200 yards down the road that they will not be given a designation. Instead the designated area is extended and a soft option is taken.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was out trying to sell hamburgers to get a few shillings for Temple Street Hospital today and was late back to the House but when I heard on the monitor that designation throughout the country is now going to become a universal application by virtue of a ministerial order, I thought we will have to call a halt.  There is no better man than the Minister for Finance to call a halt to this caper.  Presumably he will elaborate on it and his elaboration, presumably having been teased out here by Deputy O'Malley, will result in this amendment being treated with very considerable reserve by the House.</P>

      <P>I sought to draw the attention of the House earlier to the fact that it seemed that under this amendment any part of the country could be defined as a designated area, although designated areas at the moment are small areas of the inner parts of the five cities and that any part of the country could be defined as is the Custom House Docks area. Before the last four or five people spoke <Col N="2399" /> I asked the Minister to confirm if my interpretation was correct but he has not ventured any opinion.  He has not said anything in relation to the matter.  I can only assume from his silence that that is so.  While another Deputy was speaking I rechecked my reading of this and to my amazement what I had read earlier in the amendment did not seem to be in it when I read it again.  Then I looked around me and I have here two of these green books of amendments.  One of them is in respect of amendments that were circulated towards the end of last week, and printed in a green book which was circulated to Deputies yesterday morning.

      <P>I understand it was decided that the quickest and best way for the new list to get to Deputies was to leave it in their pigeon holes on the presumption that every Deputy would check there rather than have it sent to somebody on behalf of the Deputy who would not indicate to him that it had arrived.</P>

      <P>In any event, a large number of Deputies in the House would not have received it.  It is immaterial whether it is their fault or anybody else's fault.  There is a major difference between the two amendments.  In the amendment which was circulated by the Minister last week and reprinted in yesterday's green book, there is nothing about the Custom House Docks area but there is in the paper that was introduced last night in substitution.  On rereading both of the green papers and, in particular the new one of 17 June, it seems to be perfectly obvious that what I thought was the position earlier, and which the Minister has not denied, is the position and that is open to the Minister for Finance to designate, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment &mdash; which may not of course be an insuperable problem in the context &mdash; to direct that anywhere in the country is a designated area; in other words, any part of the country no matter how rural, remote, or under-populated is to be taken as the same as the centre of Limerick, Dublin, Cork or Waterford.  That is a slightly startling thing to discover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is infinitely more startling to find that any part of this country, no matter how far it is from a docks, even if it is on the top of a mountain, can be designated the &ldquo;Custom House Docks area&rdquo; with all that goes with that.  It is not a question, as Deputy Connolly tried to suggest, that the Minister makes an order and the House has to approve of it.  It does not. The Minister may make an order and it immediately becomes law when he makes it.  It is disallowed or becomes ineffective <Col N="2401" /> only if Dáil Éireann, within 21 sitting days, disallows it without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously thereunder.  As we all know one cannot get a motion to disallow debated in the House.  It is years since any such motion was debated or voted on.  In practice, once the Minister for Finance makes an order it is law and virtually remains law for all time.  That is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to some more of an explanation in relation to this new section which was put in overnight.  Many Members of the House are not aware of it because they could not be aware of it. We are entitled to more of an explanation for it than we got from the Minister.  The Minister's opening remarks were mainly directed at me.  When he got over that, he did give us a few lines of the amendment. They were not particularly informative and did not go into all these matters. They did not draw the House's attention to the fact that the amendment was very materially changed overnight and that even the remotest part of the country can now be defined as being in the Custom House Docks area and there is nothing we can do about it.  The power lies entirely within the hands of the Minister for Finance.  He can designate a village in County Sligo, County Leitrim or County Limerick and it becomes the Custom House Docks area for a whole load of financial purposes.  That is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The matter would have been properly dealt with by the acceptance of my earlier amendment which would substitute the words &ldquo;Custom House Docks&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; and where the Custom House Docks provisions would apply to the small bits of the inner city of each of the five cities and not to anything else.  It is ridiculous to allow this to apply to villages and townlands.  Does the Minister not think that it is unwise for him to put himself in a position that property developers could come along and say: &ldquo;You have total unfettered power under section 26 of the Finance Act, 1987, to designate my field as the Custom House Docks area and I require you to do it because there are certain reasons you <Col N="2402" /> should.&rdquo;  I would not like to be Minister for Finance in that situation.  I would not like to have this total power because no matter what way I exercised it.  I would be open to suggestions that I was doing it improperly, for some improper motive or under some improper pressure which should not have been applied.  This is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Arguments have gone on for many years about various designated areas. The old designated areas used to be ones that were designated for industrial development for the purposes of higher grants.  I can remember when I was Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy &mdash; and before it also &mdash; taking part here in impassioned debates about extending the designated areas.  This is the way of solving it.  There need never be a debate again on this because not alone can anywhere in the country be a designated area for inner city purposes, even a tiny village of 100 people, but anywhere in the country can be the Custom House Docks area. This was introduced only last night and it was put in in substitution for an earlier amendment.  I find it curious and there is an onus on the Minister to explain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I pointed out to the House already, I have been working from the original amendment circulated and from the white version circulated last night and there is a difference between them.  The Custom House Docks appears in one, and not in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to my original point, we already have the &ldquo;me too&rdquo; syndrome. Any town, village or city can now be a designated area and the whole tax package can apply.  The consequences are easy to see.  During the next election campaign I predict that the Minister for Finance will announce towns all over the country, in every constituency and especially in every marginal constituency, as new areas for tax packages.  The Minister will be under colossal pressure from his own Deputies and he will be under greater pressure when he goes to a town and tries to draw a line down a street so that the property on one side will be subject to <Col N="2403" /> enormous tax breaks and the property on the other side will not.</P>
    <P>The sort of accusations that will be made as a result of a Ministerial order making fish of one and flesh of the other will not be pleasant to behold.  It was difficult enough to define the areas in the five cities but that was debated in the House and it was a matter of primary legislation.  On the basis that a line had to drawn somewhere, the House was guided by the Minister of the day as to where the line should be drawn and there was an input from all Deputies.  Now, the powers being taken by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance are out of all proportion to the intent of the statutory order system as we know it.</P>
    <P>A designated area is defined as including such area or areas described in the order, which, but for the order, would not be included in the definition.  One makes an order which defines what is in the order.  The order will say what is being designated, and then it shall be specified in the order, in relation to that area.  We have had no opportunity to debate it in this House.  If it is laid before the House, that is done for 21 days.  We cannot activate the motion.  One can see what will happen when anything that happens in the intervening period is allowed go ahead.</P>
    <P>We already have situations where people claim compensation when planning permission is refused.  Can one imagine the situation if there was a designated area with colossal tax breaks and development was commenced and the House subsequently annulled the order? Can Deputies imagine the claim that would then accrue on the State when we have enormous claims already arising from the granting of planning permission in this city.</P>
    <P>I do not see the situation with the Custom House Docks being as farfetched as Deputy O'Malley suggests.  It is going beyond the bounds of reasonable debate to conceive that the Minister could define the Custom House Docks area as extending to any place in the <Col N="2404" /> country, but it is conceivable that he can by stages add to the Custom House Docks site and he can certainly run it from the Custom House Docks site in any direction.  If the Minister wants to bring in Dame Street, all he has to do is to have an intervening corridor like the Danzig corridor.  The effect of that is that the 10 per cent tax régime which was always a matter of primary legislation and section 23 which we have already talked about, can now be implemented by ministerial order in areas of Dublin city.  Applying the 10 per cent tax régime for development purposes to new areas is a serious step indeed.  Three sections of this Bill deal with trading houses, the Custom House Docks site and with shipping, with the Minister coming before the House to extend the 10 per cent tax régime.  We have not time to debate it, but at least it is up-front and it is primary legislation.  Now, if the Minister wants to make a geographical extension of the 10 per cent tax régime for financial services, all he has to do is provide himself with a corridor and he can pick any place in the city.</P>
    <P>Until the banks and the finance houses are built on the Custom House Docks site, the Minister is getting power under this measure to designate, for 10 per cent purposes, financial services activity carried out anywhere in the city.  If an American bank comes in on Friday after the passage of this Bill they can set up shop in Ballsbridge and provided they intend to move to the Custom House Docks site they will benefit from the 10 per cent tax régime.  That is in the Bill.  Now, they will not have to move at all if they are well established in Ballsbridge.  All that will happen is that the Minister can designate the shortest route to Ballsbridge as the Custom House Docks site, and they can stay there and benefit from the 10 per cent régime.</P>
    <P>I am not casting aspersions on the Minister's integrity.  We are talking about the Minister and his successors and we do not know who the successors will be.  We have an obligation to nail things down in primary legislation if there is a possibility of abuse and this section could be subject <Col N="2405" /> to colossal abuse.  I am not casting aspersions on the Minister who has been honourable in all his dealings with me but colossal pressure could be exerted to designate any place in the country for tax purposes.  Also, by an extension of the Custom House Docks site, there is the power for the Minister by order to organise tax régimes anywhere throughout the city.  We cannot accept that.  If the Minister were to make a commitment on Committee Stage that he would make the change he has already decided to make in the witholding tax and that he would proceed by affirmative order rather than laying an order before the House for 21 days, I would not be opposed to this section.  I can see some merit in not having the five Stages of a Bill if the Minister wants to designate an area, but the order which designates some new area or which extends a tax régime to some new area in the city should be brought before the House and it should be possible for Members to debate it.  We are opposing this section as it stands, and we will have a vote on it but if the Minister can make us an offer which makes it more democratically acceptable we will consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Noonan's call for, at the very least, an affirmative order under this section.  I would prefer primary legislation when it comes to the extension of the tax base both for designated areas and the Custom House Docks area.  The wider one spreads any incentive for designated areas the more their effectiveness is diluted.  There are many precedents for this and I could nearly be accused of speaking against my own, because on two previous occasions when the original inner city areas were being designated I made a case to my Government for Wexford to be included, as I am sure did many another Deputy for his own area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please allow me to finish. When the issue of free ports and free <Col N="2406" /> zones was being debated and Cork and no other areas seemed to grab the attention, again I made the case that Rosslare Harbour in County Wexford should be considered.  On both occasions, I was told, with a degree of firmness and I presume of sense and rationality, that the more you spread the base for these tax free incentives the less attractive you make them and the more you dilute the effectiveness of them.  At the risk of speaking against what I would love to see in my county, as other Deputies would in theirs, I see the common sense and rationality of restricting what we are talking about to ensure that it is effective and it can be effective only if you limit it to the areas most in need, the wider you spread the umbrella or the blanket the less effective it can become.</P>
      <P>Under no circumstances could we accept that just by laying a simple order before the House could any area be so included.  No Minister should require that.  Any Minister for Finance or any Minister for the Environment, to the extent that they are involved in this legislation, should be protected from unnecessary pressure from outside in relation to giving them this power.  In section 24 we had what some might suspect to be sweetheart legislation.  This could be open to the same interpretation. What is there to protect the Minister from complying if this passes, if pressure is put on him by the powerful and mighty organisations or financial institutions outside?  How will the Minister be able to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  This Minister may be and I respect that, but as Deputy Noonan pointed out, this legislation will be on the books for years to come and it is the principle rather than the particular that we are talking about here.  The very least we can accept is an affirmative order, though I would prefer primary legislation in relation to this if only to protect the very issue that is before us here under this section.  The more you spread the base the more you dilute the attractiveness of what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about the definition of the Custom House Docks <Col N="2407" /> site and the circumstances in which his amendment to the Bill came itself to be amended at such a late hour.  This evening this House is supposed to be considering an Urban Renewal (Amendnent) Bill which has itself a new power given to the Minister for the Environment this time with the consent of the Minister for Finance &mdash; as opposed to the other way around; I do not know if there is any difference in those two procedures &mdash; to extend the definition of the Custom House Docks site for the purpose of that code of legislation.  It is legislation being brought before this House this evening but it differs dramatically as to the wording of the amendment now being proposed by the Minister and the wording of the Finance Bill.  In the Urban Renewal (Amendmend) Bill we are told that the area of extension can take place only in certain prescribed areas.  Section 2 of the Bill proposed to be discussed tonight provides that the Minister for the Environment may by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, extend the Custom House Docks area to include land described in the order as contiguous to the boundaries of the area and lying between the southern boundary of the area and the centre of the River Liffey.  What land lies in the centre of the River Liffey?  I do not know, but since we are with Alice in Wonderland today we might as well start designating the Liffey as land.  Secondly, this provision applies east of the area between the centre line of Sheriff Street Upper and Sheriff Street Lower and the centre of the River Liffey &mdash; more sea being described as land &mdash; and where an order under the section is in force every reference in the principal Act or in the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill &ldquo;is to be construed as a reference to the area in the Schedule to the Principal Act as extended by the order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we have the curiosity that in one piece of legislation the Custom House Docks area can be extended only in a manner which is a real extension, that is involving land which is contiguous to the existing area, but under legislation <Col N="2408" /> carefully drafted, presumably by the Minister, and brought before this House today, any area in the country can be designated as part of the Custom House Docks area.  Why is there this difference? Is this just a mishap in drafting?  I do not believe that.  I believe there is a deliberate intent which seems to follow because certain areas, certain buildings and certain places are going to be designated for the purpose of the Finance Bill in any event, irrespective of whether they lie near or contiguous to the original Custom House Docks area, as Custom House Docks area for the purpose of attracting certain financial service industries to them.  That is serious enough and it should be acknowledged explicitly if that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>Why have we two separate codes?  The Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for the Environment can declare Knock Airport to be part of the Custom House Docks area but the poor old Minister for the Environment with the consent of the Minister for Finance is restricted to declaring parts of the River Liffey as land.  Ever since King Canute started to put back the sea by directive, never has part of the River Liffey been declared to be land.  Now two different Ministers, each relying on the consent of the other, can describe an area of land using the same term but one of them cannot describe some land as the Custom House Docks area for some purposes whereas the other can do so for financial purposes.  What is it that requires the powers of the Minister for Finance in this matter to be greater than those of the Minister for the Environment?  What is the distinction between them?  Why does the Minister for Finance want to be allowed to designate places such as the Custom House Docks area which the Minister for the Environment for the purpose of the urban renewal code cannot do? We are entitled to an explanation as to why there is a difference between these two powers.</P>
    <P>This differentiation in the extent of the powers is not accidental.  It is an implicit acknowledgment that the Custom House Docks scheme is not going to let off the <Col N="2409" /> ground unless certain buildings in this capital city and perhaps outside it and certain areas can be in the interim designated as Custom House Docks area. The Minister is asking for too wide a power here.  If he wants only to designate areas which the Minister for the Environment under the urban renewal code could do, such as extending the Custom House Docks area, why does he not accept the formulation set out in the Bill before us this evening in that respect?  If he wants to resist the kind of pressure of which Deputy Doyle and Deputy Noonan spoke, which will be put to him, to confer on individual buildings, concerns and projects wherever they may be situate the status of Custom House Docks areas, the most obvious way in which he could achieve that would be to accept for the purpose of this amendment the same constrictions and constraints on his powers as the Minister for the Environment will have under the legislation proposed to be introduced this evening.  For the life of me I cannot see why there should be a difference.  I ask the Minister to explain why there should be differences in the powers of one Minister with the consent of the other to declare a certain portion of land for the purposes of one Act rather than another to be portion of the Custom House Docks' area.</P>

      <P>The second point is to extend by order a very small section to square off the Custom House Docks area, no more and no less than that.  The arguments we heard about extending the Custom House Docks area to the top of any mountain, down to Limerick or wherever are utter nonsense.  It is obvious that Deputies wanted to waste quite some time discussing what is a very simple approach by me on behalf of the Minister for the Environment.  No matter what the pressures from any source to extend any of these areas we will not do so unless there is very good reason.  As I said in relation to our other discussions on reliefs in these areas in reply to Deputy O'Malley. I know of towns and cities &mdash; I think Wexford is described as a city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How many will be considered by the Department of the Environment to be a matter of environment, subsequently referred to the Department of Finance and approved by Government before any such order would be made?

He comes along now with this recently amended amendment of his &mdash; amended overnight &mdash; and potentially extends the definition of the Custom House Docks area, not to the small areas in the cities I had suggested <Col N="2415" /> earlier and which he refused, but potentially to the entire country.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Doyle reads the Minister's amendment again she will see that it does not have to be contiguous, because a little bit of some remote townland can be picked out.  It may be that the background to all this is that the Government have run into difficulty trying to sell the idea of what was supposed to happen in terms of financial services in the Custom House Docks area and that they feel it may be necessary in the interim, or perhaps for all time, to designate other places where these international services might be carried on.  Those places could quite easily include existing office blocks elsewhere in Dublin.  There is nothing in this new section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a possibility. Irish Life are literally yards away from this site as it has been defined up to now. How will they develop the site they have which is directly opposite the Custom House area on the south of the River Liffey if, literally yards away from them and contiguous to them, there is another site which has infinitely more attractive provisions and incentives relating to it.  I do not think they can do it.  It may be that Irish Life have brought much pressure on the Department and on the Minister, although I would have thought the level of communication might not be too good after the changes in directors or the circumstances in which they were changed recently by the Minister or perhaps by the Taoiseach after the Minister had originally reappointed two people.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this personal <i>contretemps</i> that may have arisen, I am sure in their official capacity Irish Life must have conveyed their disquiet to the Department of Finance in their official capacity and said it was essential that the Minister would have power to designate other areas, not necessarily contiguous, as Custom House Docks areas.  That is possibly the reason this has happened. We have not been told very much in spite of considerable efforts to get information. When I put forward this proposal which is uncontradicted the Minister's attitude is that Deputy O'Malley is stupid.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Thank you.  The Minister of State said that a designated area under this order would have to be confined to an urban area. There is nothing in the section which confines it to urban areas.  All that is required is that the Minister should include such area or areas described in the order which, but for the order, would not be included in that definition.  It can be any place in the country.  The Minister's explanation was that the original package of tax incentives was for urban areas and that that package of incentives could then be applied to anywhere that is specified in the order but they do not have to be urban areas.  That is far too wide a definition.</P>
      <P>What concerns me about the Custom House Docks is there is provision in the Bill before us for the Minister to temporarily designate buildings anywhere in the city as locations to which the 10 per cent tax regime applies for financial services on the understanding that people in those buildings will subsequently move to the Custom House Docks site when the infrastructure there is built.  Once this Bill is passed an office block in Dame Street, Ballsbridge, Tallaght or anywhere else could be designated for the 10 per cent regime.  I am concerned that when people establish themselves along the quays or in Dame Street where there are many banks already, rather than suffer the discomfort of moving they will ask the Minister to extend his definition of the Custom House Docks, reminding him that they will have been enjoying the 10 per cent regime for five years.  All the Minister would have to do is to put the ring fence around them.  If he does that the Custom House Docks Project will not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is putting himself under the most colossal pressure.  He knows politics as well as anyone.  His Deputies, his constituents, every lobby in the country led by the building industry and every <Col N="2420" /> developer will beat a path to his door to ask him to designate X, Y and Z for the package of incentives and to extend the Custom House Docks regime right along the quays and around the inner city area. Will the Minister accept an affirmative order at the very least?</P>

      <P>In the first part of this evening's discussion Deputy O'Malley, to some extent supported by other spokesmen, maybe Deputy Noonan, sought the extension of the incentives for the Custom House Docks area, but mainly to Limerick.  It was a parochial type debate and was made mainly because of pressures from concerned builders in that city.  Now the opposite argument is being made in relation to this amendment, that the Minister will not be able to withstand the pressures.  This has been blown out of all proportion because obviously some Members are trying to keep from discussing some proposals.  The Progressive Democrats may be having second thoughts about the next amendment they have tabled, which is on the abolition of the advance corporation tax.  That was the next amendment for discussion but in the past hour we have spent a lot of time blowing the importance of this amendment out of all proportion.

      <P>This section makes two changes in section 1 of the VAT Act. First, it inserts deer and goats into the definition of livestock in order to confirm the application to them of the 1.7 per cent rate.  Secondly, this section also amends, with effect from 6 June 1987, the definition of moneys received consequent on the introduction of Part I, Chapter 3, of a tax deduction scheme in relation to certain professional fees.  This is to make sure that the amount of tax which is withheld is covered for VAT.</P>

      <P>A professional person charges a particular State body for services, say, £1,000 plus £250 VAT.  On deduction of withholding tax at 35 per cent he receives £650 plus £250 VAT, which makes £900.  Were it not for this amendment, his VAT liability would be £900 at 20 per cent, tax inclusive, that is £180, leaving an Exchequer loss of £70 &mdash; £250 less £180.  This is to ensure that VAT on all payments will be returned.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 63 is in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla, Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Sherlock and Deputy McCartan, and amendment No. 64 in the name of Deputy Desmond is an alternative.  I suggest that we debate amendments Nos. 63 and 64 together if that is satisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 64.</P>
      <P>In page 33, line 28, to delete &ldquo;1.7 per cent.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1.2 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that when the Minister indicated he proposed to reduce the rate from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent the Labour Party indicated there were such difficulties facing the Government in raising revenue we thought the £9 million accruing to the Exchequer was inadequate. This also arose from the Government decision relating to the farm tax. The Government decided that the net cost of the abolition of the farm tax would be £9 million in 1987.  They then decided that the amount would be recouped by the equivalent reduction in the flat VAT rate addition to farm prices.  We feel the rate of recoupment should be reduced to 1.2 per cent and this would give an extra £6 million to the Exchequer by way of a further clawback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know, the Government have imposed very harsh expenditure cuts on the social services and £6 million would be gold dust in terms of maintaining those services.  Equally, there have been very substantial net additional transfers to the farming community from Exchequer resources in recent years.  We are totally opposed to the abolition of the farm tax. We regard the reduction in the flat VAT rate addition to farm prices as being meritorious in terms of eliminating those payments as such and while, I am tempted <Col N="2427" /> to suggest there should be a zero rate, I wish to reduce it from 2.4 per cent to 1.2 per cent in 1987 and the Exchequer would benefit accordingly.</P>
    <P>Because of time constraints I do not propose to speak at length on this amendment except to reiterate the amazement and disgust felt by the Labour Party and by many Members of this House at the Government decision to abandon the farm tax from 1987 onwards.  The alternative recoupment of the loss by way of VAT change should not have happened. The tax should have been maintained, an extra £9 million would have accrued to the Exchequer and that would have been all to the good.</P>
    <P>I repeat that uniquely in Ireland at least £580 million of Exchequer resources are transferred each year directly to about 120,000 families.  I would stand over £400 million of that amount, but the rest is a transfer which is not matched by a contribution either in taxation or social insurance contributions which would merit a transfer payment of that nature. When I see £25 million or £28 million child benefit being paid out and £150 million being spent in non-contributory pensions and not one shilling coming back by way of taxation or social insurance contributions, the appropriateness of adopting this policy change becomes apparent.</P>

      <P>I am totally opposed to the amendment and the section. Speaking on this issue, I feel like Custer, making a last stand on the land tax.</P>
      <P>The proposal to reduce the flat rate refund to farmers is intrinsically wrong and is of course directly linked to the Fianna Fáil decision to abolish farm tax and to replace it with a full accounts system for all farmers.  The sum of £9 million to be clawed back from farmers is to reimburse the Exchequer for a similar shortfall resulting from the decision to abolish the farm tax.</P>

Section 38 imposes the charge on the farmers and the reduction from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent.

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that the connection between the decision to reduce the flat rate credit from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent is directly related to the decision to abolish the land tax.  The sum of £9 million accruing from this measure is to make up the shortfall which the Exchequer estimates will result from the decision to abolish the land tax in the current year.  The net result of this manoeuvre is unjust and inequitable because the smallest farmer will now be asked to compensate the Exchequer for the reluctance of the bigger farmers to pay land tax.  We are talking about a VAT refund which is legitimately payable to those who are not registered for VAT, to reimburse them for the VAT paid by them on production imputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, we are not talking about any special concessions, it is a payment carefully calculated to provide reimbursement for payments made in respect of which the farmer would be entitled to a refund if he was registered.  A small number are registered but they have large holdings or intensive operations.  Accordingly, as a result of this manoeuvre, the medium and small farmers will be mulcted by the Government because of their blind insistence on bending to the <Col N="2429" /> will of a small section of the farming community, i.e. those with large land holdings.</P>
    <P>This tactic constitutes the reverse of all reasonable, social thinking.  The Government have now put themselves in the unique position of expecting the smaller and weaker farmers to pay for deals made with the large and stronger farmers.  The obvious correct course for the Government is to reverse engines at this stage, to pay the farmers the VAT refunds to which they are entitled and to restore the land tax.  The effect on the Exchequer would be the same, the £9 million lost as a result of paying the proper entitlement to VAT refund will be reimbursed by the £9 million which will come in from the re-establishment of the land tax.  There is a coincidence here between the interests of the Exchequer and those of the farmer because the farmers will not be paying anything net in addition as they now pay that kind of money to accountants.  Figures were quoted in the <i>Farming Independent</i> this week in relation to bills presented by accountants and taxation experts ranging from £470 to £1,260 which gives an idea of the size of the problem.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy O'Keeffe but he will appreciate that another question must be put at 7 o'clock in respect of sections 34 to 50, inclusive, and in respect of the Title.  It is desirable that as many Members as possible and the Minister should speak in the intervening period which is less than half an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I only need about two minutes.  A further benefit which would accrue if the course of action I am suggesting is followed &mdash; apart from the fact that such a system is far more acceptable to the farmers &mdash; is that it would allow the farm classification office to complete their work.  We all know that the Griffith Valuation is totally out of date as it is 150 years old.  We need a new, detailed valuation of land holdings and that would have been a major benefit of the work involved in establishing a land tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2430" /> A tax which acts as an incentive to production has obvious merit.  We intended this year to introduce interim valuation procedures which would have ended all accountancy bills for those up to 80 adjusted acres.  Instead there is a proposal which will involve all farmers, down to the smallest acreage, paying for accountancy services.  Do not tell me that will not arise because already they are coming into my clinics with the updated farm profile forms for which accountancy expertise is necessary.  Having abolished the land tax and involved the smallest farmer in paying for accountancy service, to add insult to injury the small and medium farmer will lose a substantial proportion of their VAT refund entitlement to make up for the loss of the land tax which was largely collected from the bigger farmers.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I consider the present proposals to be utterly unfair and unjust and are totally opposed by the Fine Gael Party.  In County Galway, there are about 22,000 farmers and, of those, it is estimated that 11,000 are totally exempt from land tax.  That is because they are so small nobody in the House suggests that they should pay tax.  Even those 11,000 farmers will be paying tax because of the loss of their VAT refund.  The same will apply all over the western seaboard which is the result of the Robin Hood approach and one of the reasons for our total opposition to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a number of points Deputy O'Keeffe made but I totally disagree with him on the question of VAT refunds to farmers.  I had an amendment done to section 36 which I thought dealt with that but then I discovered that it dealt with the reverse. That amendment was allowed but amendment No. 66 was ruled out of order.  It sought to reduce to zero the VAT refund for farmers.  Why should farmers not be registered for VAT?  The small shopkeeper around the corner is registered; why should the farmers not register, keep records and show their entitlements?  What is their entitlement? Nobody has any idea.  I do not have the <Col N="2431" /> figures with me now but the amount has escalated over the past five years from something like £15 million or £20 million to £79 million last year in VAT refunds. Where were the farmers suddenly buying all these commodities?  What made it increase at such an enormous rate?  I believe that this is not based on any figure for VAT refunds.  It is simply used as a system of grants to farmers.  Where other systems would be ruled out by the EC, here was a very convenient system of giving handouts under the guise of VAT refunds.  There is no VAT on fertilisers, or on many other inputs to farmers.  On farm buildings where a grant is received VAT is refunded in any case.  The whole method used here is wrong.  Farmers should be required to register for VAT just as every shopkeeper must; then one would know their entitlements.  I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe entirely.  We are told in the explanatory memorandum that the reason for the reduction &mdash; I commend the Minister for reducing the amount &mdash; from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent is to compensate the Exchequer for the yield foregone on the abolition of land tax.  In other words, the Minister is doing this to make up an amount for the Exchequer which is lost on the land tax.</P>
      <P>If the VAT refunds were justified funds based on some records or some entitlement, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, then the Minister could not take this percentage off them.  However, it is not based on any entitlement, it is simply a hand-out from the Exchequer.  The Minister is saying that they have already been given a handout by the abolition of the land tax and that he will reduce the amount by the equivalent and the total they will receive will be the same as last year, £79 million, but it will be in a different form, some will be from the abolition of land tax and the balance reduced VAT refunds.  I have been saying for many years that this whole system of VAT refunds to farmers should be reviewed, that they should be asked to register, show their VAT payments where the refunds are due, as every little shopkeeper in the country has to do.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are taking sections 36 and 38 together.  We are opposed to the abolition of the land tax, but find it very difficult to express that by means of vote because we understand that the Minister is abolishing the land tax by order.  He is certainly not abolishing it on the face of the Finance Bill.  We are using the procedure he has here for rebates of VAT to collect extra revenue from farmers and want to vote on that to indicate our opposition to the abolition of the land tax.  We do not particularly like the content of section 38 either, but our main purpose in opposing it is so that the House has an opportunity to show its displeasure at the abolition of the land tax.  That is why we are looking for a vote on section 38.  I do not want to delay the House any further.  I have no difficulty in conceding sections 36 and 37 if that is with the approval of other Deputies and we could proceed to vote on section 38.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with what Deputy Noonan is requesting but it is a matter for the House.  In reply to a few points made, let us get things in proper prospective.  On the land tax supposedly there would be £6 million for the Exchequer last year but the actual figure was £700,000 while we were at the same time spending £6 million on the farm classification office.  It just did not make sense.  Since then there has been quite a substantial amount of additional tax paid. I am still as concerned as any Deputy about non-payment of arrears, whether it be in the land tax, health contributions, youth levies or income tax generally in relation to farmers or the self-employed, as I said earlier today in reply to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very much disposed to amendment No. 4 of Deputy Desmond on the question of coming back to lower than 1.7 per cent.  However, in fairness we have given the opportunity to the farming organisations to make whatever <Col N="2433" /> case they can, and their members should pay their due taxes just the same as everybody else, in the PAYE sector particularly. If that does not come about in the course of this year then this is a mechanism whereby we will not have to be waiting for anybody to pay; we will just stop the amount.  That was the reason for the reduction of the 2.4 rate down to 1.7. That will bring in £9 million this year plus the additional amount through the extension of the farm profile scheme. Nobody need be in any doubt.  The Government and I have come in for much criticism that we abolished the land tax and let the farmers off £6 million.  That is half true but the more important half is that we took £9 million off them in the change of the VAT refund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he agree that payment, or non-payment in this case, of the £9 million will affect small loss-making farmers as much as large farmers?  Would he further agree that the whole system of the VAT refund was increased and built up over the years on the basis of an increase in the rate of VAT on costs to farmers such as hired work, contractors and so on?  That is why it reached the level of 2.4 per cent.  That is an arbitrary and unfair way of dealing with what was a technical device for dealing with the cost of goods to farmers.  In this way the Minister has ensured that small farmers will suffer.  It is unlike any previous system, for example, tax on account, the land tax or any other system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to share the rather limited time available to me with Deputy Madeline Taylor-Quinn and Deputy Dinny McGinley.</P>
      <P>Last evening before I moved the Adjournment of the debate on the Private Members' Business I had time to make a few general remarks about the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i>.  I commend our present spokesperson on Education, Deputy Gemma Hussey, for reintroducing the Green Paper on to the Order Paper.  She is doing a service to education in general and I compliment her for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not here for the Minister's full contribution but I read it twice.  She was a little too dismissive and perhaps too arrogant in her approach to the Green <Col N="2445" /> Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i>.  The whole thrust of this paper lies in its subtitle, &ldquo;Serving Community Needs&rdquo;.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey, introduced it for the sole purpose of giving the community better value for the money spent in education at post-primary level, particularly at VEC and regional college level.  It is with that in mind that this Green Paper was initiated and produced. Much time, energy, money, thought and research has gone into its production.  It is a good thing for education that unlike many reports and many other Green Papers and White Papers it was not just left to gather dust on the shelves.  Deputy Hussey has resurrected it and brought it to the attention of the House, of the Minister and of the Department so that the very salient facts and advantages of it can be discussed again and, I hope, implemented.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Green Paper was to stimulate discussion and debate so that the students, the Department and the country will get the best value for the taxpayers' hard earned money.  In the production of the Green Paper there was no question of steam-rolling public opinion.  There was to be consensus and the most wide-ranging consultative process was to be used to get all those who are involved in the educational field to work together on an equal basis so as to produce the best possible programme of education for our young people.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper had to be produced because latterly a number of reports emanated from various sections.  There was a report on adult education the main thrust of which was the establishment of local adult education committees.  The Green Paper addressed itself to that aspect.  Likewise, there was a report of the National Youth Policy Committee and that also suggested that local youth committees would be established and that the members of those committees would eventually find a place on the boards of management of local education councils and RTCs.  Various other new developments in education have indicated that a Green Paper was absolutely necessary.  I regret that the Minister is <Col N="2446" /> not here to hear my remarks and that she was not a little more constructive in her approach to this matter because after all it was not just the brainchild of the then Minister for Education but the combined wisdom of all the members and staff of the Department of Education that produced this very fine paper.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when she says that the Vocational Education Act, 1930, has stood well the test of time.  It is flexible and adaptable.  It is a backhanded tribute to the then Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1930 that they could produce an Act that still has a rightful place in the educational system 57 years later.  Any Act 57 years old needs renewal and it was from that point of view that the Green Paper was published.</P>
    <P>Two of the central themes of the Green Paper was to have a more decentralised and a more democratic approach to education. It was to effect education at local level where the people who were best aware of local conditions could make a worth-while contribution.  It was also to give a more democratic approach to education, to widen and broaden the scope for participation by parents, teachers, industrialists, trade unionists and all others who would have a constructive role to play in the formation of an educational policy.  It is from that aspect that I commend the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i>, to the House.  There are also other aspects but time will not permit me to elaborate on them.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Green Paper deals specifically with regional technical and other colleges.  At present there are nine RTCs in the country.  These were first mooted in May 1963 and even though they were established more recently than the vocational schools they could do with revamping in the light of educational developments and of advances that have been made in the technological and educational fields and in every field.  When the regional technical colleges were conceived they were built around post-primary schools and the concept of post-primary education.  We have seen an evolvement in the RTCs and now they have aspired to third level education. <Col N="2447" /> Many diploma and degree courses are now being run in regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper recommends on page 24, paragraph (ii) that: &ldquo;The RTCs and the Limerick College to be reconstituted so that each would have a much expanded and more independent Board of Management.&rdquo; That would be a good thing. It states that the board would be a sub-committee of the appropriate LEC or VEC and therefore it would still remain under the aegis of either the LECs that were implemented or the VECs as they are presently constituted.  There is food for thought there.  The Minister and her advisers could have another look at the summary of recommendations and see if they could, in the future, reintroduce another Green Paper with this one as a basis.  As I said initially, much time, expertise, money and research went into the production of this paper and it would be a pity if it was to be dismissed off handedly by any Minister for Education. It would be a great disservice to our young people and to those who are genuinely concerned and involved in education.</P>
    <P>Finally, in giving way to my two colleagues, I urge the House to accept the Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education</i>.  The subtitle &ldquo;Serving Community Needs&rdquo;, is appropriate because the Green Paper serves the needs of the community in a much better fashion than the 1930 Act or than the RTCs as established in May 1963.</P>

      <P>Sílim gur tráthúil an t-am é seo leis an Pháipéar Glas a d'fhoil igh an t-iar Aire Oideachais a phlé anseo. <Col N="2448" /> Tá sé dhá bhliain beagnach anois ó foilsíodh é agus bhí gá go ndéanfadh iad siúd a bhfuil plé acu le oideachas scrúdú air.</P>
      <P>An chéad chúis go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra i gcúrsaí oideachais, san Roinn Oideachais cosúil le gach Roinn eile, ná go bhfuil ganntanas airgid agus gearradh siar sa Roinn.  Sílim gur ceann des na moltaí fiúntacha san pháipéar ná an iarracht atá ann úsáid níos fearr a bhaint as an airgead a chuirtear ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Deir an páipéar go bhfuil iar-bhunoideachas ar fud na tire scoilte suas i mórán páirteanna.  Cuir i gcás i gceantair áirithe sa tír tá scoileanna cuimsitheacha agus scoileanna pobail, coláistí pobail, meán scoileanna agus mar sin de.  Go minic i gceantar amháin b'fhéidir go bhfuil cúpla scol ag déanamh an rud céanna agus gan aon chomhoibrú eatarthu.</P>
      <P>Ceann des na moltaí atá sa pháipéar agus ceann a chuaigh go mór in a luí orm féin ná go ndéanfaí an 38 coistí gairmoideachais atá ar fud na tíre agus a chosnaíonn £11 mhilliún sa bhliain chun iad a reachtáil, a chur ar ceal agus in a n-ionad go mbeadh comhairlí áitiúla oideachais, 13 ar fad agus go mbeadh na scoileanna seo go léir a luaigh mé faoina gcúram. Moladh eile sa pháipéar ná go mbeadh ionadaíocht ar na comhairlí seo &mdash; suas le 32 duine ar fad &mdash; ag gach dream a bhaineann le hoideachas agus le traenáil aosa óig.  Chomh maith leis sin bheadh bord bainistíochta ag gach scoil.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam ó mo dháilcheantar féin na deacrachtaí a chothaigh sé seo sna blianta a chuaigh thart: cuir i gcás, b'fhéidir go mbeadh cúpla seanscol i mbaile agus go bhfuil gá le foirgnimh úra.  Bíonn sé iontach deacair go minic comhoibriú agus tuiscint a fháil idir na scoileanna ansin.  I mo dháilcheantar féin i mBéal Átha Seanaigh, tá trí scoileanna: tá an clochar ansin atá ag déanamh anchuid oibre; tá an gairmscoil agus Coláiste de la Salle ansin &mdash; níl na bráithre ann faoi láthair ach tá an coláiste ann go fóill agus daltaí agus míle nó dhó thíos an bóthar tá Bun Dobhráin.  Tá sé an-deacair ar fad comhoibriú agus aontú logánta a fháil ar cad é an rud is fearr a dhéanamh sa cheantar sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2449" /> Mar a dúirt mé, tá airgead gann de thairbhe cúrsaí eacnamaíochta, agus i gceantair mar sin b'fhéidir go mbíonn na fearaistí céanna ag gach scoil, seomra adhmadóireachta, seomra miotalóireachta, seomra eolaíochta agus mar sin de, trí cinn sa mbaile amháin, agus mar atá cúrsaí airgid anois ní shílim go dtig linn leanúint ar aghaidh le rudaí mar sin. Ceann des na cuspóirí sa Pháipéar Glas a chuir an t-iar-Aire, an Teachta Hussey, an oiread sin oibre ann ná deireadh a chur leis an chineál seo anchaithimh.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh tuiscint ag na coistí áitiúla oideachais ar an saghas oideachais a bheadh ag teastáil ó dhaoine in a gceantar féin.  Cúpla lá ó shin léigh mé sa pháipéar, cuir i gcás anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath go bhfuil an Coiste Gairm Oideachais cheana féin i ndiaidh sampla a thabhairt dúinn cad is féidir a dhéanamh. Chuir siad cúrsa maisiúcháin ar bun. Smaoineamh an-mhaith é sin mar éinne gur maith leis cúrsa i maisiúchán go dtí seo, chosnódh sé £2,000 é a dhéanamh go príobháideach agus tá an Coiste Gairm Oideachais i mBaile Átha Cliath ag cur cúrsaí ar fáil fá choinne é sin a dhéanamh faoin a gcúram féin.</P>
    <P>Rud ba mhaith liomsa a fheiceáil nuair a bheimid ag plé an pháipéir seo agus á chur in bhfeidhm, tá súil agam sna blianta atá romhainn, ná gur cóir smaoineamh ar na deacrachtaí oideachais atá i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Bhí sé molta sa pháipéar 13 chomhairle a chur ar fáil, agus sílim gur fiú cuimhneamh ar cheantair Ghaeltachta a thabhairt le chéile ó Dhún na nGall, Maigh Eo, Gaillimh, Ciarraí, Corcaigh, Contae na Mí, go Port Láirge agus ceann des na coistí seo a chur ar bun a dhéanfaidh scrúdú ar an saghas oideachais atá ag teastáil ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus clár a dhéanamh amach a rachadh i bhfeidhm agus a bheadh fóirsteanach don chineál oideachais atá ag teastáil uathu sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí móra ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá deacrachtaí acu i dtaobh, b'fhéidir, múinteoirí a fháil a bhfuil na cáilíochtaí cearta acu agus gur féidir leo teagasc a thabhairt i nGaeilge.  Ba chóir smaoineamh ar cheann des na coistí seo a chur ar bun a mbeadh freagarthacht <Col N="2450" /> acu fá choinne oideachas a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Níl sé luaite sa Pháipeár Glas ach is fiú aird a thart air.</P>
    <P>B'féidir go mbeadh páirt le glacadh i gcúrsaí oideachais chomh maith ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar tá baint acu le gach ceantar Gaeltachta de bharr forbairt tionscail, agus tá tuiscint acu ar an Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Moladh eile atá sa Pháipéar Glas ná i dtaobh chigireachta.  Aontaím go gcoinneofaí an chigireacht taobh istigh den Roinn agus go mbeadh seasamh náisiúnta acu, agus in ionad cigirí a bheith ag na comhairlí seo, go mbeadh comhairleoirí oideachais acu, is é sin daoine a rachas thart go dtí na scoileanna agus a thabharfas comhairle agus cuidiú agus treoir dos na múinteoirí nuair a bhíonn gá lena leithéid.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor eile go mba mhaith liom a rá ach sílim gur mian le mo chomhleacaí, An Teachta Taylor-Quinn, labhairt sna cúpla bomaite atá fágtha.  Arís, ní raibh mé anseo fá choinne éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire aréir ach de réir tuairiscí sílim go raibh sí patuar maidir leis na moltaí atá sa pháipéar. Cuireadh a lán smaoineamh agus oibre isteach ann.  Tá go leor molta ag dul don iar-Aire, an Teachta Gemma Hussey, a d'fhoilsigh é dhá bhliain ó shin, agus is mór an trua nár ghlacadh an seans é a scrúdú go mion agus é a phlé.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Green Paper.  I thank Deputy Griffin for sharing his time with me.  This is a very important document and I am rather disappointed at the attitude the Minister adopted in her speech last night.  The former Minister for Education must be complimented on her initiative and progressive approach.  It has been recognised throughout the educational field that Deputy Hussey was a Minister of initiative, courage and determination who set about preparing <Col N="2451" /> our educational system for the eighties and into the next century.</P>
      <P>Education is extremely important for the future of our young people and unless we adopt a progressive approach to bring us into line with the rest of Europe, our young people will not be properly equipped to compete in a more integrated Europe.</P>
      <P>Evidently the Green Paper was presented because of the concern of the Minister and the Department at the time about the overall structure, particularly in regard to second and third level education, with emphasis on the management of the RTCs.  I commend the document to the House and hope the Minister will see fit to implement many of its proposals. In the past 20 years, second level education has changed with the coming on stream of more community colleges and comprehensive schools.  As well, we have the traditional secondary schools and vocational institutions.  There are many types of schools taking care of secondary education.  Some secondary schools are now adopting technical subjects and the vocational schools are taking in more academic subjects, with the result that many of them are at cross-purposes, resulting in much wasteful overlapping of finance, teachers and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations in the Green Paper are very commendable.  It recommended that 13 LECs be developed throughout the country.  The Minister now in office should look at the boundaries. She may not agree totally with the suggested boundaries, but the basic principle is commendable.  There will be one authority catering for the particular needs of the different regions.  Especially in rural Ireland, there have been calls to amalgamate vocational schools, traditional secondary schools, Christian Brother schools and convents.  There are difficulties.  Amalgamation of management rather than of educational requirements of the areas would be retrogressive for young people who have very specific educational requirements.  If the LECs were put into operation they could ensure <Col N="2452" /> that the structure of the education services could be improved.  In many towns throughout Ireland we have one second level institution providing a very extensive educational curriculum and the young people are being discriminated against because amalgamation has not taken place on many schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Under the LECs the board would employ the CEO and the administrative staff.  One suggestion concerns me.  It relates to the employment of teachers and it is suggested it would be left to the boards of management of individual schools.  I think that would be unwise.  I suggest that specific instructions would be given to the boards of management that the teachers' terms of employment would be protected as they now are by the Department.  The Green Paper does not go into detail in that regard but I am sure the Minister had it in mind and I hope the Department will consider it in detail when the decision is taken in regard to the LECs.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Education will be whole-heartedly behind the proposals in this document so that there will be local education committees in the different regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the Green Paper deals specifically with the RTCs and other colleges.  I do not welcome that section because at present the boards of management of the RTCs are governed by section 21 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Sub-committees of 12 are set up from the VECs of the different areas to manage the RTCs.  It is regrettable that heads of RTCs have to refer back to the local CEO for sanction for expenditure and in relation to maintaining progress in the respective colleges.  It is my belief that members of VECs have very little to offer in the educational development of RTCs and therefore the less influence they have in running the RTCs the better.  Over the years the RTCs have <Col N="2453" /> become very professional and have progressed enormously in modern technology, VECs were well able to provide good technical education in the thirties.</P>
    <P>It is recommended that college councils would work in the respective colleges. I would like to see greater representation of students on these councils and on boards of management.  In relation to RTCs we are now talking about students who have reached the age of majority and who are masters of their own destiny and therefore should have a greater input in their educational future and partake more in the management of the colleges at third level.</P>
    <P>It is recommended that the Dublin Institute of Technology would be constituted as an independent institution. This would be done by legislation.  This is highly commendable but I suggest that the other RTCs and the Limerick college should be similarly constituted to make them completely independent of the VECs.  RTCs have progressed so much at this stage that they merit complete autonomy from the VECs, though I would allow one or two members from the VEC in each area to have <i>ex-officio</i> membership on the boards of management. Otherwise, I would not give them too much influence in regard to the future of the RTCs.  I was very disappointed to learn that the Minister had decided to abolish the Youth Services Board set up to assist the VECs.  It was a retrograde step.  The fact that the Minister has decided to do otherwise is a bad move at this time.  I am looking to the Minister for a gleam of light and a more positive approach to education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on these important issues which are fundamental to our education structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister mentioned that the proposals in the Green Paper clearly <Col N="2454" /> failed to achieve a consensus.  The reservations about the proposals in the paper came from right across the education spectrum &mdash; the primary area and all sections of the post-primary area.  The variety of the reservations expressed is too wide for me to spell out here, but it stresses the necessity for the further consideration for review for dialogue and for negotiation, which the Minister already talked about, before any firm proposals could be made.</P>
    <P>Without goodwill and co-operation from all those who would be affected, no plans will work irrespective of how effective they may be.  Deputy Hussey in her arguments reinforced the points made by the Minister, that the many divergent responses to the Green Paper which she, as Minister for Education, received were a clear indication of the difficulties of implementing the proposals of the Green Paper.  As framed in the Green Paper, implementation of these proposals would have been an impossible task.  Yet Deputy Hussey is calling on the Government to implement these proposals as they stand something the previous Administration failed to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that it was not anticipated that substantial additional current expenditure would arise on foot of the proposals to establish local education councils as there were enough compensatory factors in the proposals.  This is a very doubtful statement.  Take, for example, the proposals to delegate to the local education committees the functions of the payment of teachers' salaries and second level capitation grants.</P>
    <P>With the exception of vocational teacher salaries all teacher salaries and pensions are paid centrally from the Department of Education by an extremely cost effective system.  The same applies to the second level capitation grants.  To argue that 13 different payroll and grant paying systems would be more cost effective than a large central system when there are identical rates of payment seems to me to be a very doubtful proposition.  At the same time it would <Col N="2455" /> be necessary to maintain a structure within the Department to maintain and update such items as pensions legislation, pay regulations, and so forth.  If you will permit me to divide my time with Deputy Liam Fitzgerald, I wish to move on to youth services which were referred to by Deputy Hussey last evening in the context of the establishment of the local education councils and by Deputy Taylor-Quinn this evening in the context of the establishment of the local youth service boards.</P>
    <P>I believe that the most efficient and most effective delivery of youth services takes place in the context of a voluntary movement of adults and young people. The youth service in Ireland has always been characterised by its voluntary nature.  This has permitted innovative and rapid responses to changing circumstances and needs.  Indeed, the voluntary nature of our youth service has often been held up as a desirable model to be emulated by countries with highly developed statutory provision for young people.</P>
    <P>On taking up office, and even while in opposition, I was concerned that this voluntary provision was in danger of being submerged in unnecesary and costly bureaucratic structures.  There was a real possibility that an over reliance on institutions of the State would inhibit innovation and instead of responding to real needs these structures would become ends in themselves, losing sight of the very reason they were created.</P>
    <P>For this reason our Government decided not to proceed with the local youth service boards as they mainly constitute the setting up of a further administrative structure.  We need anything but further administrative structures.  What we need is an innovative and developmental approach to the youth services and to give assistance to people at the coal face of youth work.  The central strategy in our proposals is to set up local youth service councils which will not cost the Exchequer anything.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, therefore, <Col N="2456" /> that the policy of the previous Government, especially in relation to the establishment of statutory local youth service boards would be discontinued and the whole question of support and delivery of youth services would be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that while that is the central change we have made, we are quite happy with the contents of the Costello report and we are prepared to go along with almost all the recommendations in the report, subject to consideration of certain minor aspects.  It is not our intention to delay the production of any further reports, policy documents or further consideration using delaying tactics.  We are anxious to implement the recommendations of the report, with the exception of the local youth service boards because we do not feel they will assist in the local youth service provisions without the necessary resources, estimated by Costello at about £20 million. In brighter days ahead when that kind of money is available for youth services, we can look at such a proposal.</P>
    <P>The object of this re-examination is not to embark on a negative exercise.  Its objective is to try to create the proper atmosphere in which volunteerism in the youth work service will be encouraged, not only as a means of providing important leisure and personal development opportunities for young people and adult leaders, but also as a means of encouraging development of community leadership and participation in resolving the issues and problems surrounding any community.  It was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who, as Minister of State, initiated the principle of supporting volunteerism with an input of professionalism. That is the central plank in the promotion of our policies.  We want to promote a comprehensive youth service built on the principles of volunteerism which will be the establishment and development of local voluntary youth councils.  I am already working on this process and invite representatives of all interested groups to work with me to help map out the future for the youth service. I hope to be in a position shortly to announce certain initiatives with regard <Col N="2457" /> to the setting up of those local youth service councils.</P>
    <P>Youth work is educational.  It is concerned with the development of the person and it takes place normally in a voluntary, out of school and leisure environment.  It goes without saying, therefore, that the educational establishment, at local and national levels, must be sympathetic to the cause of youth work.  In many respects, youth work is complementary to the formal educational environment.  It is neither subservient to it, nor totally independent of it.  In this context the voluntary youth service must be in a position to tap into the more formal side of education.  At local level this means that the expertise and back-up which can be provided by vocational education committees, or by other youth serving agencies, must be available to and utilised by the youth service.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by referring to our initiatives in regard to disadvantaged young people.  The most important aspect of our youth policy will be to implement several aspects of our youth policy as they affect disadvantaged and disaffected young people.  We are concerned that there is a growing gap between the haves and the have nots.  We are committed to putting resources into areas which affect young people and are the cause of disaffection and disadvantage and lead to crime and vandalism.  I am thinking of areas such as homelessness, absence from school, absence from reasonable training and work opportunities, especially in the inner city areas and the more deprived areas of this city.</P>

      <P>I was going to concentrate on the Dublin Institute of Technology, one of the issues referred to and about which very little seems to be known.  However, in view of the number of things that have been said, I must respond to some of the wild, sweeping statements made in relation to VECs.  According to some speakers this VEC monster seems to be strangling the educational system and to be <i>persona non grata</i> with some people who think it should be pushed out of existence.  We must talk a little about what VECs have been doing.  An explanation needs to be given to those who do not know the meaning of vocational education, how it has contributed to the needs of urban and rural communities and responded so positively, caringly and effectively to the commercial and industrial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting the amendment put forward by the Minister, I am quite curious as to the motive of the spokesperson for <Col N="2459" /> Fine Gael in putting down a motion seeking an endorsement from the Government of her Green Paper.  My curiosity is aroused by her failure as Minister to have her own Government adopt this Green Paper when there were people in the Cabinet who wanted and succeeded in having it thrown out.  To put it mildly, it is baffling that the Government are now being called on by the former Minister to endorse the Green Paper.  It is very clear to anyone involved in education or acquainted with the educational structures and services that a review and constant re-examination of the system is not alone desirable but, in certain instances, essential.  It is an ongoing process and the Department and the Minister need to have that process firmly under control and to have a clear understanding of what it involves.  Sadly, however, it seems that decisions can be made and the process adopted in haste while ignoring all the partners involved in education.</P>
    <P>Education is about partnership and if we do not accept that central concept we will not get very far with educational reform.  It is grandiose to come up with high-falutin statements and radical comments every now and again; we all love to do it and I enjoy doing it around committee tables and occasionally in the Dáil Chamber.  However, it is sadly misleading and lacking in understanding for a Deputy or Minister to make decisions involving radical changes in educational structures while totally ignoring the involvement, essential goodwill and co-operation of the partners.  Over the past few years, we have seen more than one of those examples.</P>
    <P>A number of fine and laudable objectives have been stated in the Green Paper and, as someone who has been involved in education for 14 or 15 years, I acknowledge that.  Some of those objectives are to make the administrative structures within the educational system more centralised, to make their responses more flexible, to devolve to local bodies matters affecting their welfare and development, etc., to achieve a degree of community orientation, to improve <Col N="2460" /> regional and local co-ordination and so on.  They are lovely phrases and include concepts like decentralisation, devolution and other matters.  However, when you examine those concepts and pitch them against the proposed structures, it is obvious there is a very serious mismatch between the fine aspirations and the mechanisms of the proposed structures. I commend the wisdom of the Minister in not simply adopting a document which, to put it mildly, is at least flawed.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology was referred to by Members who showed a total lack of understanding of what they have achieved, the recognition they have enjoyed not alone from educational institutions but from professional organisations outside this State.  People have come from Britain and Europe to ask the Dublin Institute of Technology, under the aegis of the City of Dublin VEC, to take on courses to provide graduates.  I want to make a number of other points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yesterday I outlined the reasons behind the publication of the Green Paper as they affect second and third level education.  I stressed the difficulties facing local communities and the Department of Education in their mutual anxiety to get agreement for new and much needed schools in their areas.</P>
      <P>We detailed the multiplicity of services which should be available in all schools in the training youth services and adult education areas.  We also touched on the importance for the RTCs of a new freedom and self-governing characteristic which would enable them to develop their research and industrial liaison capabilities as well as the urgent need to give the Dublin Institute of Technology a statutory governing body which would unify and streamline the duplicated and diverse activities at present of six expanding colleges.  I am very glad that when in Government we established the international study group to look at technological education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that this is the second last week of the Dáil and that the study group is due to report by September.  I certainly did not expect the Minister to bring in the legislation next week so the Deputy is a little intemperate in his remarks.  It is a pity he does not listen to what is being said.  The Green Paper could not be described as revolutionary or premature. Indeed, many commentators at the time of its publication welcomed it as a timely addressing of the areas it covered.  I stated at the time and on several occasions since that it did not have the status of holy writ and that it was a very strong indication of the way we felt these problems should be addressed after all the interested parties had been fully consulted and their considered view given, thus clearing the way for ministerial and Government decision.  I was not surprised by the very many and diverse reactions to it because, as I well know from being Minister for Education, that is the nature of things in Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did expect, however, something more positive from the Minister and the Government in response to this debate. Perhaps I should not have expected that because their record on education in the recent past and particularly since they came into Government has been very disappointing.  If I had expected anything positive, then I would have been very disappointed by what I can only describe as a vague and I have to say slightly offensive and wholly defensive protection of the <i>status quo</i> which the Minister gave us last evening I do not believe that is good enough for a Minister and a Government who claim on the air waves <Col N="2463" /> constantly to be innovative and caring at the same time, who claimed all during their four years of Opposition and more particularly during the election campaign that education was special and would be getting special care.  Not only have they attacked education with a series of wild cuts in vulnerable areas, particularly the VECs right across the country, without planning or cohesion but since obtaining office their every pronouncement shows that the dominant characteristic of the attitude of the Minister and the Government to education is a fear of tackling reform, a clinging to what is safe, and a narrow tunnel vision when it comes to any proposal, any legislation which did not originate with them.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister &mdash; who I am very sorry is not here tonight although I am very glad that the Minister of State is &mdash; indicating at tedious length that she has plans to improve the governing structures of the RTCs.  I would urge her to take out the files which are already in her Department which relate also to the second level area, the files on the Dublin Institute of Technology, the comprehensive range of submissions from all the interested groups and the Green Paper which are there in her Department following discussions which were held by the Department when the Green Paper was published.  After having done that bit of homework, I hope she would shake off the apathy which seems to paralyse her at the moment, the inability to address the real problems.  To do that requires courage and there is nothing that the education world needs more at this time than a courageous Minister.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the improvement and streamlining of services to our school population, which is the fundamental and basic reason for the Green Paper proposals, there is the imperative which all responsible people in Ireland today recognise, to make the kind of financial and administrative sense out of our long standing institutions which a modern society should have.  What is the sense in five different kinds of second level schools competing with each other for <Col N="2464" /> students and for scarce resources?  What is the sense in 38 vocational education committees costing £11 million to run their administrative structures alone in 1986, to deal with the minority of schools across the country?  What is the sense in a plethora of agencies dealing with training, adult education, youth services, community recreation facilities channelled through small committees which again by their very statutes deal only with the minority of the school population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That indeed is a very important part of the Green Paper proposals, to democratise the whole education system which I agree with the Deputy is not democratic at this time.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Government therefore in the Green Paper have been presented with a golden opportunity to prove their mettle.  They have suggestions here from a previous Government and the largest Opposition party which give them unprecedented comfort in Dáil Eireann if they only have the courage to grasp the nettle.  I regret very much the non-committal and, I must say, dismissive tone of the amendment which I and my party unfortunately find it impossible to support.  I would ask Fianna Fáil in the education area to try looking forward for once.  The looking back in which that party indulge becomes very tedious and is possibly damaging, not only to the education world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We referred earlier to the possible amalgamation of vocational education committees which the Minister has mentioned on several occasions and from which she seemed to be rowing back fairly fast last night.  Her speech was a model of rowing back on every possible advance on education.  She was at pains to point out that she had taken no decisions whatever on that area.  I am glad to hear that because I will certainly deprecate any attempts at the kind of <i>ad hoc</i>-ery we have seen in the wild slashing of the health services.  I urge the Minister and the Government to plan properly for the <Col N="2465" /> rationalisation and improvement of the educational services right across the country, to use the blueprint she has on this and many other areas in the Department. The kind of damage that could be done to the education system by any more of the kind of cuts we have seen already and which we had an opportunity to discuss last night would be unthinkable and would set education back 30 years.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will support the Fine Gael motion this evening in asking the Government to implement the proposals <Col N="2466" /> in the Green Paper because they are fair, reasonable and, above all, approach major problems in the educational area which, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil would like to say do not exist, really do exist.  The people who are suffering from those educational problems are the young people whom we all wish to serve.  I commend the Fine Gael motion to the House.</P>

      <P>Here we have amendments in the names of Deputies Boland and Gay Mitchell.  Amendment No. 1. I observe that amendment No. 3 is cognate.  I suggest that we deal with amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 14, to delete &ldquo;centre&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;southern boundary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate I indicated my intention to table an amendment to this effect.  I believe that the southern boundary of the Custom House Docks Authority is a particularly important one, it being one of the few windows providing access and sight lines into the inner heart of the development area.  One of the difficulties that will be encountered in the successful development of the centre is the fact that very many Dubliners and others have relatively little, or no knowledge whatever, of this area.  It is a part of the city to which people do not go unless they have specific business to conduct in relation to the docks.  Consequently, the western, south western and southern boundaries, the boundaries, relating to the river, are particularly important.  They should be carefully and tastefully designed so as to attract attention and persuade the general public to come and use the Custom House Docks development area.  It was the intention of the previous Government that, when the development had been completed, the area would form an integral and important part of the renaissance of the Dublin city centre.  For that reason no opportunity should be lost to exploit the relatively few boundaries that abut onto areas used widely by the general public.  The southern boundary, being the boundary of the river, offers a unique opportunity of spilling the development over onto the quays.  In particular, because of the almost certain use of the inner dock for some marine development purposes it offers a unique opportunity to allow the marina or the usage of whatever sort is finally decided, to spill over into the river itself.  It would thereby create a <Col N="2473" /> colourful picture attracting the attention of the general public to the development going on within the area.</P>
    <P>In the planning of things possibly it would be a little restrictive at this stage to try to confine that spill-over into the river.  I understand it is also the Minister's desire to allow the development spill over into just one half of the river.  It would be a pity if, in the context of an overall development plan, the developers found they were restricted in extending the marina development into one half of the river only.  The Minister suggested, when replying to Second Stage, that the reason for that was lest, at some time in the future, a similar development was attempted on the southern boundary and developers or owners of the land to the south of the river might want to have a corresponding development, as it were, in their section of the river.</P>
    <P>There is some little confusion in that the Minister suggested that that might apply in relation to the Irish Life George's Quay development.  My understanding is that that development is not exactly opposite the Custom House development, the frontage of which is comprised, to some extent at least, of City Quay church and the recently built Dublin Corporation housing.  For that reason it is very unlikely if not impossible that, when the George's Quay development would go ahead, it could be related to that southern section of the river contiguous to the boundary which the Minister now wants to place on the extended area.  It would be altogether cleaner if the entire width of the river was allowed into the order, regardless of whether ultimately it was felt necessary or beneficial for the development to include the entire width of the river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>These are non-controversial amendments.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept them. I note that pedestrianisation is among the developments hoped for in that area and that that may include an overhang of the Liffey in some shape or form.  However, in that case, access to and servicing of the <Col N="2474" /> area and its development as an environmental facility or amenity would be placed in jeopardy and considerable difficulty if the boundary was to extend simply to the centre of the river.</P>
      <P>In considering the amendments the Minister might permit the maximum pedestrianisation of that area and how that might best be achieved.  As in other cities, it may well be possible to have a pedestrian overhang of the Liffey.  In any event the use of the River Liffey itself for leisure purposes should be envisaged.  It would help if such aspiration could be brought within the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I note from the Dublin draft development plan that the population of the inner city now stands at 82,000, approximately half of what it was in 1961, and that the area loses 3,000 people every year. Therefore, it is not merely a question of Dublin Corporation housing.  It is a question of the need for mixed housing and private housing there.  We need to ensure that there are other incentives to attract people into the area.  Part of such incentives would be the enhancement of the area by allowing for an extension of the boundary in this way.  It is fair to say that the city planners contend that imaginative incentives are needed now to encourage the private sector to become involved in building houses and flats in the area.  The whole prospect of bringing pedestrians into the area and of providing leisure facilities there would be enhanced were the Minister to accept these technical amendments.</P>
      <P>I note that trading operations or activities brought within the definition of &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; for the purpose of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will not qualify under the provisions of the business expansion scheme in the case of the financial services centre to be located at the Custom House Docks site.  There is an amendment in my name on Report Stage of the Finance Bill which will be discussed tomorrow but I urge the Minister for the Environment to consider the matter because it could easily be an amendment to this Bill.  It is only included in the Finance Bill for technical purposes to keep all taxation measures together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2475" /> I ask the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to include the financial services at the Custom House Docks site in the business expansion scheme for tax purposes, I do not think it would cost the State a lot of money but it would result in a greater investment in that area and we need all the incentives possible.  I think the Minister will find that these two amendments enhance the Bill and would encourage the sort of incentive and investment and also the development which we all want to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say I do not find the implications of what is contained in section 2 or what is suggested by the amendment to be as non-controversial as the previous Deputy thought them to be. There is a very important principle to be discussed in the context of section 2 and that is the whole question of the erosion of democratic control in relation to a major portion of the city as now envisaged in the extended definition of the Custom House Docks site.  I wonder if the Minister, when replying, would explain the need for the definition at the northern end and the southern end to have reference to the centre of the River Liffey.  The proposed amendment suggests that the definition include the far side, the southern side, of the river.  It is important that we appreciate why there is any need for the inclusion of the river in the proposed development of the land site.  If one were to intrude onto the waters of the Liffey in the development of this site one should go the whole way to the far side and not leave the developers sitting halfway across.  I cannot see how the proper development on land incorporating the river can be envisaged by leaving as the boundary the centre line of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern is, and I address this to the Minister, that as opposed to the piecemeal development of the river as an amenity in the city, there is clearly a need for an overall plan for the river itself.  It should be part of the brief of this Minister in Government to see that, in consultation with the local authority, Dublin <Col N="2476" /> Corporation, there is a proper plan implemented for that river.  It would be very undesirable if, because of the hoped-for massive investment on the Custom House Docks site, we are left with a portion of the river front developed in the way Deputy Mitchell has suggested, perhaps with overhang walkways and the like on only one side alone or in only one portion alone as the amendment implies. I need your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle, as to whether we are now addressing merely the amendments or the section as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister, when replying, to explain the implications of including in part, or entirely if the amendment is accepted, piecemeal development of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the concept of treating the river as a whole rather than drawing some kind of imaginary line down the centre of it.  If it is ever envisaged, that the river should be included as part of any form of development, it is perfectly clear it would be more advantageous to give to the Minister the right to deal with it in its entirety rather than creating some kind of artificial line that might theoretically cause some obstruction or difficulty later.  The point has been well made and, therefore, I do not intend to labour it.  It seems to be perfectly reasonable that we should be able to treat the waterway and its potential development as one unit rather than some artificial creation based upon some outdated ward boundary lines or some other notion such as that.  It is a reasonable suggestion and I commend it to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Members recognise that the amendments are non-contentious and are purely a matter for discussion among ourselves to see if we can come to a consensus on the matter in that everybody is supportive of the <Col N="2477" /> legislation and of the thrust of the legislation. I am happy that all Members recognise the importance of the water in the overall plan.  Perhaps Deputy McCartan does not quite see it that way but I will try to explain to him the reason I and the Authority feel this is necessary at this time.  The other Deputies have recognised the importance of the water.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland is quite right when he says that it is to be expected &mdash; and it is very clearly outlined in the planning scheme as published &mdash; that the George's Dock and the inner dock will play a very big part in the design of the overall development.  I hope they do because it is a significant and a unique feature attached to the whole area and one that has attracted very great notice by the designers and the people who have shown an interest in the site to date.  I am quite positive the George's Dock and the inner dock will be part of the overall plan and will go a lot of the way towards what Deputy Mitchell sees as a great need in the area, to attract people in great numbers.  That is what it is all about, creating jobs for people, developing the inner city and getting people back to live and to continue to inhabit that side of the city.  The Deputy quite rightly said that the population of the inner city has dropped significantly over the years and this will go a long way to arrest that.  That is the whole intention of the development apart from the economic benefits attached to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland seems to think there will most likely be a marina dimension attached to the overall design and so do I.  I sincerely hope that when developers bring their overall package for development to be considered, the dock side and the water will form part and parcel of the overall design.  The marina aspect has been a very significant part of similar type developments in other countries on both sides of the Atlantic.  It was the real attraction to the developers in many instances.  I would like to say to Deputy McCartan that is the fundamental reason the Authority wished to extend the development to the river at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When developers come to prepare <Col N="2478" /> overall designs for an area such as the 27 acres on the docks site they have to be given a clear indication of exactly what the future holds for the overall area.  If it did not include the proposed extension a lot of the development would be looking in towards George's Dock and the inner dock with no outward-looking vistas to the river.  In other parts of the world where such development has been successfully carried out, and where there was an availability of water as an extension of a site, they always included the water. In fact, those designers, instead of having an inward looking design for the overall area, had a lot of the windows and vistas looking towards the water.</P>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity of the inner dock, George's Dock and the Liffey &mdash; continuous running water &mdash; as the three elements making for the possibility of a great attraction.  I understand, having discussed this with designers and architects who have shown an interest in it, that this is regarded as an absolute essential. They are pleased we took the initiative to get the extension.</P>
    <P>Gandon, who designed the Custom House, had the most beautiful aspect of the building looking towards the river. The river was the focal point.  We are trying to make the river the important feature of the whole area.  One could go further up the quays, as far as the Four Courts, and one will see that that was what was intended hundreds of years ago. Something happened along the way and if we got back to that we would encourage people to return to use the river-side. The original planners many centuries ago were correct.  There is a need to see the river as a central feature of that part of the city.  That part of the river will be important for the city from now on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland felt that if the new extended area crossed to the far side of the river it might help the marina development.  I considered that suggestion carefully and discussed it with those involved but I must stand by my original proposal.  It may be an old-fashioned principle to go to the middle of the road when carrying out road development or use the middle of a stream as a boundary <Col N="2479" /> even though it only amounts to a line drawn on a map, but that division is important today.  I accept the view of Deputy Mitchell that the pedestrianisation of this and other areas of the city is important.  Was he suggesting the provision of an over-hang that could go to the far side of the river?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have been considering an over-hang over a part of the river and it is my view that that will be a feature of the development, that it will go from the existing dock site across the road and on to the marina.  That should prove a major attraction and I am sure Deputy McCartan will agree that it will be a unique feature of the development. It will be an attraction towards the pedestrianisation of the area and should attract many visitors.  If we were to go to the other side of the river the southern boundary would have to be extended to the wall of the river.  I cannot see an advantage in extending the site to the other side of the river and then stop at the wall.  What would be accomplished? It was for convenience that it was decided to go to the middle of the river.  If in the future development is undertaken on the other side they will have the same facility to go to the middle of the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to contemplate a pedestrian way from the proposed site over the river towards Westland Row it would be necessary to have a type of bridge.  That would interfere with navigation on the river and it is not a runner at this time.  All types of problems for navigation on the river would be created and it would involve the Port and Docks Board and others.  I cannot see the rationale in going to the far side of the southern wall of the river unless we were to go further to the docks on that side.  That would raise a lot of other issues and I do not think that extension is necessary.  I put the point made by Deputy Boland to the authority and asked them if they felt it was necessary but they did not think so.  They felt the extension was satisfactory and was the <Col N="2480" /> type of development that had been indicated to them by many of the developers who had viewed the site.  I understand that some firms are working on designs for the area and all they required was an understanding that they could have in their design a view outward to the river.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan has some difficulty with what he saw as the erosion of the democratic control over some parts of the inner city.  I do not know what he intended by that statement but as far as we are concerned the development is being carried out in a democratic way. We are trying to develop and enhance the inner city in the best way we can.  We are trying to entice as much investment as possible there to create a new image for the area and to bring back the population, as Deputy Mitchell suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will probe that further when we move to the next section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the reason for the development in the first instance and the reason for the extension suggested in the amendment.  If one extended the areas the full width of the river it could limit the possibility for redevelopment of property on the other side of the Liffey at some future date.  City Quay or Sir John Rogerson's Quay would be squeezed a little by an extension beyond the middle of the river.  There is no hard and fast rule about this boundary line but we decided on a line up the middle of the river to ease the legislation.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter with those involved in the development and they do not think it necessary to go any further than we have suggested and, consequently, I recommend to Deputies Boland and Mitchell that they consider accepting my point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the planning scheme, on their 1.6 methodology the board make it clear that the authority would aspire in the medium term to the creation of a pedestrianised river front which it feels would consolidate the basis for an extended river front environment in Dublin's city centre.  If they are to <Col N="2481" /> develop the pedestrianisation of the area and the river front in the centre it is obvious that the river, not half of the width of the river, plays an important and vital role in that regard.  Surely it is not beyond the realms of innovation in Government Departments that the new Department of the Marine might have some use to put the width of the river to. That would give incentive to people not only to go to the area, which is important, but to work there, invest in it and live there.  Could it be used for some form of sporting development which would have some element of private enterprise involved in which case the whole of the river could be used as an incentive?  I think the Minister is making a mistake and that before Report Stage he should consider his attitude to this non-contentious proposal.  If he sits back and looks at it carefully he will agree it is beneficial to this measure dealing with urban renewal.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sections which we are proposing to amend, what are his plans and those of the Department and the Authority for the part of Sheriff Street adjacent to this site.  Apparently the Minister wants to see this site developed at an early date.  There are many corporation flats in the Sheriff Street area, some of them vacant.  Proposals put forward here, in the planning scheme and by the tourist board would welcome more local authority and private development there.  Can the Minister tell us if it is his plan to have that street demolished, and, if so, what consultation will there be with local people?  This lack of knowledge is a disincentive to people who might want to develop the site.  Many people are living in very poor conditions there.  The Minister should tell us what is to be the future of those living in flats in Sheriff Street, what is to be the future use of that site, what are the precise plans, what type of consultation will there be with local people and what steps will be taken to ensure that the site will be made attractive for private dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister decides he cannot accept this amendment on Committee Stage, he should look at this proposal <Col N="2482" /> again in regard to the boundaries on the other side of the river and let us know on Report Stage.  If we do not know then, we will have to press this later.  We regard our proposal as a perfectly reasonable way to go about development there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I heard the Minister and Deputy Mitchell pursue their points the more I came to the conclusion that the boundary mark should be at the northern side of the Liffey as opposed to the reverse.  I want to be clear that I accept unreservedly that obviously the development of the water, and more particularly the integration of the water into the plan for development of the Custom House Docks, is crucial.  One would have to be a fool to think otherwise considering the vast area of the inner portion that is covered by water, such as the inner dock and George's Docks. There is no need to hand over jurisdiction or ownership of any part of the river to the developers but that is what is envisaged in this part of the section.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the Principal Act the definition of land includes any structure or any land covered with water.  The proposal to have the boundary limit to include the centreline or the southern line suggested by the Fine Gael group envisages in time ownership to be handed over of portion or all of the section of the river to the developers.  We can all appreciate the position of the Greater London Council in developing along the Thames.  That seems to be the example we have most closely followed in our plans for this site.  I would challenge the Minister to concede that no definition of the land in any part of the Thames scheme involved a definition of the centre line or indeed any portion of the river.  I have visited many of the schemes along that river but none of them involved development of the inner docks.  Such a development would offer no obstruction to a developer to encroach on the water, but when it came to the actual river line itself none of those developers was allowed to encroach onto the river, for the very good reason that the river is a vital lifeline of commerce to the city of London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2483" /> One has to concede that the Liffey does not enjoy the same great status at present in regard to commerce, though there is important commercial activity in the section of the river opposite the Custom House site.  I would be concerned that if we were to pursue the definition of land as contained in the section or, more particularly, the boundary line as suggested by the Minister and Fine Gael, we would create major legal impediments for the future commercial development of the river, be it for the movement of stock or for leisure development.  There does not appear to be a legislative basis in this Bill or in the Principal Act for the delimiting of responsibility for the corporation on the bankside or the Dublin Port and Docks Board when it applies to the water.</P>
    <P>I come to the principle involved in this. If one were to begin the development of berths for private boating opposite the river site, who would have the responsibility? Who would be responsible for the maintenance of the berths and for the charge and regulation of any of the traffic on the river?  I will come back to Deputy Mitchell's reference to the Sheriff Street site.  This is extremely important because there is no reference at all to the eastern boundary.  One wonders where it will end.  When we get on to dry land we will have to discuss this and the delineation of responsibility between Dublin Corporation and the Authority for the proper development of the land included in the 27-acre site.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the Thames, along that river the developers exploit the expanse of water.  They look at and move towards the river but it does not involve ownership of any part of the river being handed over to the developers.  The developers are not allowed to encroach onto the river but they can exploit the very logical advantages that can be gained from using the river as a reference point.</P>
    <P>That is relevant to the Custom House Docks site and any other great development along the river here.  Gandon <Col N="2484" /> exploited them in his time as land developers today will do, but Gandon never owned any portion of the river.  The river then was a very important commercial mode of transport in the city and it was only sensible that those developers would look in that direction.  The Minister should not suggest that anything I have said is an effort to thwart any of the good principles and ideas involved, but I am very concerned about the implications for the development of the river in the future and its legal status and ownership when one applies the definition in this section. That is one aspect.</P>
    <P>We now come back to the other point I made.  What is a river to look like if we have a very well developed over hanging, under hanging, or whatever kind of hanging walkway one wants to have at the river front servicing what seems to be a very grandiose plan for a very privileged section of the community?  I am concerned about the overall effect of piecemeal development around the river front and I hope the Minister will see that what needs to be done is promotion through the local authority, Dublin Corporation, in conjunction with the Dublin Port and Docks Board, of a planned development of the river so that we will not have a piecemeal operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard every word of the debate so far and I will come to that point in a moment.  I can understand that the Minister has difficulty in having parameters on the area which is about to be developed, but a degree of flexibility is needed.  The Minister's hands cannot be tied because we cannot have a sharp line of definition as far as boundaries are concerned in an area where it might be <Col N="2485" /> needed to extend in varying directions. Those familiar with the development of the River Liffey &mdash; going back to the seventeenth century &mdash; will realise that areas have been reclaimed from time to time and that the wall of the river has been changed quite appreciably.</P>
      <P>Rather than thinking in terms of another generation looking at the southern side of the river, I would like if the Minister could treat this area as urgent as the north side because there are vast areas lying waste, needing development.</P>
      <P>On a section of the Finance Bill today I spoke about the need for a ministerial order to speed up the action and to make sure this development takes place very quickly because it will be a model for future development in Dublin.  It is important that there is no delay with this development.  That is why I believe it was necessary that the Minister should have the powers to take decisions and not be caught in the never ending bureaucratic tangles we find ourselves in, particularly with urban renewal.</P>
      <P>If it were possible within the context of this Bill to extend the boundaries to the south side, I would ask the Minister to take this opportunity to do so.  Perhaps it could be annexed in a codicil or phrased in such a way as to give the Minister the opportunity at some time in the future to extend the Custom House Docks site to the south side of the Liffey because there is a great need for development of that wasteland.  This is needed as much as the development of the Custom House Docks site.</P>
      <P>I welcome this part of the Bill because it is important that there be a degree of flexibility.  I suppose there would be no question of difficulties for shipping as a result of the development of the Custom House Docks site.  If anything, I believe it would enhance that part of the Liffey and would set a headline to other areas to speed up their developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When striking the boundaries I hope the Minister will treat this as an open space area which should be screened by archaeological excavation and development. I am not thinking of something which would delay development for a <Col N="2486" /> long period, but it is possible with modern techniques in archaeology to screen out an area very quickly and to satisfy informed people who are interested in it that the green light has been given to development and that future problems will not arise during the development by finding precious archaeological artefacts or buildings of any kind around that important, busy, trading and commercial area which Dublin has enjoyed for quite some time.  That would satisfy many people who are concerned about archaeological finds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see much point in pursuing these amendments further.  I can only reflect on how extraordinarily times have changed.  The Minister for the Environment is apprehensive about taking unto himself powers which have been given to him by this House, that is, leave to extend the boundary of the Custom House Docks area by a marginal additional few yards in a southerly direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without disclosing trade secrets, it was always traditional that the Department of Finance were cautious in defining the boundaries of any of these areas for special development purposes, for tax incentives or whatever, and the Department of the Environment were anxious to see the greatest amount of space which could realistically be included in any designated area, but the wheel has now turned full circle.  The Minister for the Environment is not prepared to take on a small additional area which, it seems, the majority of the House is disposed to give him.  Yet earlier today the Minister for Finance introduced a belated amendment to the Finance Bill giving himself the power to extend the Custom House Docks area by order, allowing for the rates incentives to be applied to the extended area.  Because the tax incentives are defined in the 1986 Finance Act, they would not have been available in the extended area.  Today the Minister for Finance brought in an amendment, the effect of which is that if the Minister for Finance chooses, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, he <Col N="2487" /> may redefine the Custom House Docks area to include such area or areas described in the order which, but for the order, would not be included in that definition.  That means that the Minister for Finance may, if he chooses for whatever extraordinary reason, to include Burtonport in the Custom House Docks area, he may do so.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the boundaries of the possible extension are defined clearly, except as Deputy McCartan said for the eastern boundary for which there may be some merit, but the principle always was that the area would be extended to include areas which were contiguous to it.  As I said, the wheel has turned full circle and the Department of Finance, which traditionally might have put the brake on these methods, seem to have released that brake in such a startling way that technically on foot of the amendment to the 1987 Finance Bill today the Minister for Finance will be allowed to designate any area, whether contiguous to the Custom House Development Authority area, as being part of that area.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is so reluctant to accept the small suggested extension put forward in these two amendments.  I do not see any point in wasting any more time of the House in view of the Ministers attitude.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point should be raised during the debate on the Finance Bill.  However, a few points deserve to be answered.  I have an open mind on the question of the extension in the river. If the advice had been that it was the wise thing to do, that it was needed or that the Authority thought it was necessary there would have been no difficulty in conceding it.  It was being done by consensus <Col N="2488" /> as far as I am concerned.  The advice is that the Authority do not require it, the interested developers have not requested it or think that it is necessary and going as far as the southern boundary of the river would not enhance the development prospects of the site.  The middle of the river, as the line defining the extension, would not hinder the pedestrianisation of the area or the development of the marine aspect in that it would be on the northern side of the quay anyway.  It certainly would not hinder the possibility of leisure or sporting activities in the river to which Deputy McCartan referred. Obviously, we would not like to do anything which would impinge on the possibility of getting the best advantage from the development.</P>
      <P>There was a question about the Sheriff Street area and how it might be developed.  I am looking forward to giving a new lease of life to the area and, as I said on Second Stage, a working party of officials, including the corporation and the Authority, were established to decide the best way of dealing with the flat complex. The first meeting of that party took place yesterday and from my understanding of their brief they will consider all the proposals and options in so far as that area is concerned.  They are considering it but nothing will happen in the immediate future for the simple reason that the extension eastwards of the site will not be undertaken until the first 27 acre site is developed and under way. That was put in to give developers the indication now that not just would it be extended to the middle of the river &mdash; and that will be made as soon as this Bill is passed in the other House and signed by the President&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the existing planning scheme indicates that there will be decent housing accommodation in the area.  It would not be wise to have a development which did not include residential accommodation because it would defeat the whole purpose of keeping the area live after 5 o'clock in the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be public or private housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be mixed. That would be an essential part of the planning scheme because there is not much point in a nice new development which will be dead after 5 o'clock.  We hope that as the area develops it will attract many visitors.  It creates terrific opportunities for people living in Sheriff Street and I understand that they welcome it with open arms.</P>
      <P>I should clear up the question Deputy McCartan raised about the ownership of the river because it seems to be causing a problem.  Before I get to that, I should like to mention that the area consists of 27 acres, about seven will be included in the inner dock, there will be two and a half acres in St. George's Dock and about four and a half in the inner dock. We are talking about the development of 20 acres and seven acres of water.  We hope that the extended area which will cross the road and go as far as the quay wall, will be approved by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the water area is concerned, the bed of the River Liffey is foreshore and, under the Constitution, is vested in the State.  There will be little benefit attached to including it in the whole river area.  However, a lease of the foreshore could be granted by the Minister for the Marine under the Foreshore Acts but the erection of any structure on the foreshore would require a licence from the Minister for the Marine under those Acts as &ldquo;foreshore&rdquo; includes tidal waters of any river estuary and that part of the Liffey would be regarded as tidal waters.  Consequently, the Foreshore Acts would take <Col N="2490" /> precedence over anything that might be included in this legislation and would be subject to control.  The Deputy seemed to be concerned that we might be handing it over to someone to do what they liked with it but that is not so.  They would have to do it strictly in accordance with the planning scheme and whatever licensing would be required in so far as other, superior legislation would be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the section to which the Deputy refers but we can be sure that the Foreshore Acts take precedence over any other legislation in that area in that they have a constitutional basis.  For that reason, they cannot be breached by anything we might do here. The site would only be allowed to be developed under strict licence granted by the Minister for the Marine and, in normal circumstances, by licences granted under the Foreshore Acts.  That is how any development built on the river bed in estuarial waters takes place.  The Deputy need have no worry in that regard.  I do not like the Deputy's reference to the development as a grandiose plan for privileged people.  Deputy McCartan should not talk like that.  We are hoping that it will be a super plan available for everybody.</P>

They conveyed to me that they were eagerly looking forward to the opportunities that this would bring, not just in the construction but in the possible jobs thereafter.  It has really got a first class welcome.  I take Deputy Brady's point very well about other areas that need to be developed on sides of the river.  In due course, if this is the success we think it will be, obviously there will be other urban renewal amendment Bills.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful once the eastwards direction comes to pass that we will have the extended developments. Happily I can report that there are interests showing up for the extended area before the original 27 acres are even under way.  It is happy news all the way so far as this area is concerned.  The need is, as Deputy Brady said, to speed up the whole process. That was the one reason I asked leave to introduce this amending legislation now before the House rises to accommodate the activity that will be going on in our city during the summer and the early autumn.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's and Deputy McCartan's concern about Gandon orienting the major vista of his building on to the river.  What other way would one build a Custom House except to have the major vista face on to the river?  Bearing in mind the minute attention that Gandon gave to that southern aspect of the Custom House one would be perplexed to know, as it often perplexed me, what was the particular architectural concept that the Board of Works architect had in the hoarding or scaffolding which he has designed on that vista and which has hung out of it now for three years and seems designed to be there for another 30 years.</P>

The Deputy will be delighted to know that it <Col N="2493" /> was one of the first things that occurred to me on going down there and I have given suitable instructions for that to be removed at the very first available opportunity. The Custom House was built for a purpose with the river as its major frontage as to vista and it should be entered from that side.

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 15, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and, subsequently, in addition,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is included for two purposes.  The Minister indicated clearly to the House that it was his intention immediately to extend the boundary to take in the northern half of the river on the southern boundary of the development area and that subsequently at a later stage it would be his intention to include some of the sections to the east of the <Col N="2495" /> existing area.  It seems that the section would better have been worded in the way in which the amendment suggests.  It also seems that, from the point of view of drafting, the section as drafted appears to offer the Minister a choice either to extend the boundary in a southerly direction to take in the River Liffey south of the existing development area or to extend the boundary eastwards to take in the area which the Minister hopes to include at a subsequent stage.  If he wants to do the latter, he seems to be prevented from doing that if he has already included the former.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is both unnecessary and unacceptable.  The section as it stands expresses the intention of the proposals adequately and correctly. There is no element of exclusiveness implied here by the use of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; and the section can be used from time to time to extend the Custom House Docks area in either a southerly or easterly direction or both within the limits set out in the section, of course.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment by contrast would, I am advised, create a section which would be impossible to construe in any logical way.  For that reason it would make the meaning less logical or less possible to understand and I am advised it would render the section useless for the purposes intended.  I would ask the Deputy to appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>It seems that the wording of the section is defective in the way to which I adverted.  It also seems, if a landowner in the area to be covered by paragraph (b) were particularly aggrieved and wanted to contest the extension by order under section 2 (1) <Col N="2496" /> (b) he might well resort to the device that I have taken the trouble to point out to the House.  I would hope that is not the case because if that subsequently does form the basis of a court action the Minister and I and the House would remember this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (2), line 20, after &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the Finance Act, 1986,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises because the Minister came marching into the House last week with this Bill to allow him the power to extend the Custom House Docks area inside certain defined limits as set out in section 2.  Were he to do that it would mean that, for instance, the concessions in relation to rates remissions and the rest would apply in that area.  However, the tax concessions which form an integral part of the initial proposals for the development of the 27 acres of the <Col N="2497" /> Custom House Docks area are all contained in the schedule and one of the sections of last year's Finance Act is a very clear and watertight definition of the boundaries of the area.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last week that it was strange that there was no attempt being made in this year's Finance Bill to bring in a similar provision to match the Minister's intention here.  As late as this morning there arose an amendment to the Finance Bill in the name of the Minister for Finance which amended an earlier attempt of his which <i>inter alia</i> allows the Minister for Finance to designate any area in the country as a designated area for development purposes.  This power should be used with care because if the areas designated are extended to such an extent that the urban renewal drive is dissipated across too many areas the entire impetus will be lost.  The Minister for Finance amended his own amendment which would amend in turn section 26 of the Finance Bill.  He included in amendment No. 49 a paragraph which says:</P>
    <P>the definition of the &ldquo;Custom House Docks Area&rdquo; contained in the said section 41 shall, with effect from the date of such order, include such area or areas described in the order which, but for the order, would not have been included in that definition,</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has taken unto himself the trouble to make it clear that any extension he might make by order would have to be, logically enough, into an area contiguous to the existing designated area of the Custom House Docks site and that any future extensions would have to be in a southerly direction into the river.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister for Finance brought in his amendment today on foot of my pointing out last week that the tax provision would not apply in that area. He has extraordinarily granted to himself the authority to designate any area in the country as being an extension of the Custom House Docks area.  One can only assume that that was not intentional.  In either event if the power that has been <Col N="2498" /> given to the Minister for Finance today was to be used it would make an entire farce of the Custom House Docks concept.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about this because the Dáil previously agreed &mdash; and the Minister will recall this &mdash; to give special tax concessions over and above those in the other designated areas to the Custom House Docks area.  It appears likely that pressure will develop on the Administration to extend that Custom House Docks designation into other areas to give those concessions.  This is dangerous in so far as it is apparently the intention to allow financial service trading houses to set up in other parts of Dublin under licence so long as they give an indication that they intend to move to the Custom House Docks area when the development there is ready to take them. I fear that pressure now develop to extend the Custom House Docks area to include the location, perhaps temporarily, of those financial services offices prior to their moving to the Custom House Docks area.  This in turn will remove from them the urgency to make the transition to the docks area.  I would have thought that amendment No. 4 &mdash; which I introduced prior to the Minister for Finance introducing his amendment to the Finance Bill &mdash; was a neater way of achieving the same objective while ensuring that the two orders which might be made by the Ministers would end up with the same Custom House Docks area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a logical enough desire on the part of the Department of Finance to want to have all financial provisions and taxation matters contained in the various Finance Acts and for this reason I will not press the amendment.  However, I will press the Minister to endeavour to clarify with his colleagues what appears to be some confusion in drafting which gives to the Minister for Finance far greater latitude as to what might be designated as the Custom House Docks area than this Bill will give to the Minister for the Environment if it is accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>Rates remission is covered by the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, but capital allowances for commercial developments, the double rent allowance, the section 23 relief and matters of that kind are contained in the Finance Bill.  Amendment No. 4 is reasonable and logical.  I would like to hear from the Minister as to whether he views the extension of the business expansion scheme, as proposed by me in the Finance Act, to include the financial services at the Custom House Docks site which otherwise qualifies for the 10 per cent corporation tax rate as something which would add to the incentive for development on that site.  The technical amendment proposed here would allow for reference to that in a tidier way.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister to inform the House when he is replying to the section what the present state of the development is in the designated areas. The amendment to the Finance Bill proposed by the Minister for his colleague the Minister for Finance this morning appears not to extend designated areas but to extend specifically the Custom House Docks site.  I want to ask the Minister what has happened to the designated areas.  What development has taken place and what plans have been made?  What headway has been made by the local authorities in Dublin, Waterford, Limerick and elsewhere?  Have they made any progress. If there has been development, what is it?  Is the Minister satisfied that they are up and running and that the local authorities are genuine, sincere and committed to trying to remove urban blight by promoting the designated areas in the first instance.  I ask the Minister to refer to this in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the Deputy's last point first.  The question of designated areas has been raised under the 1986 Act.  They are the five borough councils.  Designated areas in Dublin are slow to move.  However, development is taking place in the other designated areas.  There is some activity in Cork and Waterford.  A major development is about to start in Limerick and there is <Col N="2500" /> also a project in Galway.  I cannot give the Deputy the exact names of the projects. Following the Deputy's intervention on Second Stage I made some inquiries and found that development has taken place in the designated areas as outlined in the 1986 Act.  It is not as good as one would have expected or hoped for and Dublin is the worst of the designated areas.  Perhaps there are reasons for that, but it is understood that under the urban renewal legislation other areas may be designated. The reason is that there are other old towns which are in need of urban renewal.  I will not go through the whole list of them now.  Deputies would agree, however, that there is a need to rejuvenate the city centre.  It was with that in mind, seeing that we were dealing with urban renewal, that we included the possibility of taking on board some other areas in need of renewal.  Deputy Boland was right in that, following the discussions we had here last week, we found it necessary to provide financial incentives to the extended area as well as the the 27 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, I told the Deputy that I would think about it.  In consultations, it was agreed that it had to be done.  If we gave certain incentives to the 27 acres of dockside and we extended the area across the road as far as the river, we had to give the same incentive to the extension of the site.  That is the reason it is in the Finance Bill.  My thanks to the Deputy for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to amend the Finance Act, 1986, and it is not appropriate to the Bill for that reason.  The Deputy understands that, and the matter has already been catered for in the Finance Bill.  That is the reason for giving the right to the Minister for the Environment, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to add other areas where decay is setting in in the older towns. The list has been drawn up and Kilkenny <Col N="2501" /> occurred to me as being a suitable town for consideration.</P>

      <P>There is an irony in that the Minister for Finance has gone overboard, if I may return to the aquatic analogies, in the amendment which he introduced this morning and has given himself greater authority in the extension of the designated Custom House Docks area for taxation purposes than the Minister for the Environment is being given by the House in this measure.  Last week I pointed out that the Minister for Finance was lagging behind, but this week I must point out that the Minister has taken a quantum leap ahead in the manner in which he can now designate any part of the country to be part of the Custom House Docks area.</P>

      <P>The definition of the Custom House Docks area contained in section 41 of that Bill says that, with effect from the date of such order, that site shall include such area or areas described in the order which but for the order would not be included in that definition.  That is a much wider enabling power which section 2 would give to the Minister for the Environment.  I made a point last week and the Minister took it up.  I am merely suggesting now that the Minister compare the Finance Bill as <Col N="2502" /> amended in the committee today with section 2 of this Bill.  It will become apparent to the Minister that his colleague has made an almighty leap.  I hope he has not left the ball swimming somewhere in the water of the Liffey, as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a genuine need to ensure that inner city areas throughout the country are adequately dealt with. However, in the early seventies we embarked on creating three new satellite towns around Dublin and up to today none of the town centres has commenced. The Minister could do well by recognising the need to ensure that an initial financial incentive could be made available to Tallaght, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Lucan.  Construction work valued at about £100 million is ready to commence in those towns, funded by the private sector and not requiring Government finance.  There is urgent need to commence on this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play can be made of cases deserving of renewal.  A lot of inner city renewal has been achieved in Dublin under consecutive Governments, and that is to be applauded, but there is a very great need in the satellite towns to provide town centres.  The 70,000 people in Tallaght out-populate many of the major towns in this country, yet they have no centre, either derelict or otherwise. All they have is an illegal itinerant settlement site of about 40 or 50 acres.  The Minister should not neglect those new <Col N="2503" /> towns.  Let us finish the job on which we embarked in 1972.  Deputy Boland played a key role in the initial development of these towns in his capacity as chairman of Dublin County Council.  The Minister and the Department should recognise the job creation potential in that area if some financial incentive was given to those satellite towns, starting with Tallaght which has a population in excess of 70,000 people.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, can designate areas other than the borough councils that have already been designated, but I had not up until now really considered the type of towns to which the Deputy has referred.  I take the Deputy's point about the satellite towns of cities.  They can be just as much in need of a financial injection as the older towns that have fallen into decay.  When it comes to considering naming towns that will be designated to get the incentives, and which will hopefully get the development, I will consider the Deputy's point.  I am taken with the amount of development that is in the list of developments. Deputy Mitchell will be getting those lists in the post and he will get a good indication of what designation can mean to a town.  I would be happy if I thought that the kind of development that is taking place in some of the designated areas to date could be expanded upon and applied to other towns.  There would be a number of happy Deputies around.  If Deputy Lawlor's Tallaght and other satellite towns around the capital city can be included, I will certainly give it consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Afterwards it is a question of getting suitable investment in order to do the job.  I have talked to some people about this, and one reason behind getting <Col N="2504" /> this urban renewal legislation applied to areas other than the existing designated ones was that it had been brought to my attention that there are developers available and willing to become involved in pretty big investment in many of these town centres if they got the right package of incentives, and perhaps now is the time to do it.  Certainly, if it comes to reforming matters of that kind, the present Minister will not be found wanting.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made it clear that his intention is to extend the designated areas, apparently perhaps quite substantially.  I gather from his remarks in relation to Deputy Lawlor's suggestion that the new town developments in the conurbations were not foremost in his mind.  I suspect that it was probably in relation to various parts of <Col N="2505" /> the country, more the county seats that he intends to start with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to counsel seriously, as I did earlier, that the great danger in designation is that if an over large area or over large number of areas are designated simultaneously the potential pool for investment and effort can be dissipated to such an extent that the concept of intensive urban renewal taking place in centres at the one time, so that one development provokes another and all come in, in an integrated way, can easily be lost.  There is a fine balance to be achieved in the amount that might be designated at one time.</P>
      <P>That being so, it is well to remember that the designated areas were established by order and outlined to the House clearly in relation to the tax incentives in the Finance Act, 1986.  The Minister for Finance, in the amendment he moved to the Finance Bill today, is allowing himself power to designate in areas other than in five county boroughs which were defined in the Schedule to the Finance Act.  But recognising that the House designated and participated in the designation of the areas previously, he introduced subsection (2), which would allow the House to annul any order made by him within 21 days thereafter.  Within section 2 here it does not appear as if the Minister had that intention.  It appeared that as the Custom House Docks area was defined by legislation in 1986, its extension by ministerial order should, as a continuation of that concept, be agreed specifically by the House through the process of applying an affirmative order, which is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not want anyone to think that it is our intention to designate a green field.  The Finance Act sets out clearly that this is in regard to urban renewal.  Any extension will be studied very carefully on the merits of that urban renewal to consider <Col N="2506" /> what it can do to build up that area.  I have no doubt that this House would like to see areas which need attention in urban or inner city areas being developed, and lest anyone think that that attention would be light &mdash; if that is the word to use &mdash; that is not so.  It will be looked at very carefully for its potential value for money, job potential and so on.  I think that is the aim of everybody here in the House.  I want to make that clear because some people might be of the opinion, rightly or wrongly, that we would be doing this in a green field.  That is not so. The situation is set out in the Finance Bill in regard to urban renewal.  The Government, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance will study the matter very carefully to see that all the details will apply in regard to all of this.  Any decisions we make will be considered very carefully.  I assure everybody here that that will be so.</P>

The legislation is specific.  It is something like a company being created by statute rather than under the Companies Act.  The statute here specifies precisely what refers to the Custom House Docks site in the area of urban renewal.  Will the Minister not agree it is appropriate that, since specific legislation is the origin of this power in this matter, specific legislation should continue to circumvent the Minister in so far as he cannot widely declare all sorts of areas designated areas?  Is it not perfectly reasonable to continue with the original source and at least have the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 days on matters where the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas may wish to express views on such extensions?</P>

      <P>I join with Deputies Boland and Mitchell in their concern in pursuing this amendment, which is a useful one.  It deserves support in the context that one end or boundary of this site is not sought to be delineated.  That is the eastern boundary.  It is not just a question of green fields because the Minister of State, no matter how hard he looks at this area, will find no green fields there.  However, it is an area of great concern in its implications for the local authority.  The Minister made reference to the very encouraging interest that was being shown by developers, even at this stage, outside the 27 acres currently reserved.  It is no secret that the current 27 acres, as they stand, given the area under water and the area consumed by the two stacks that must be retained, will not have the great potential that one believes is there for developers unless there is more to the east to be consumed in the overall development.  There the whole existence of a huge area of local authority houses comes under threat.  I am concerned, not just as a Deputy of the city but as a councillor in the city, about how those plans progress.</P>
      <P>I do not want anyone to take what I am saying as a reservation.  The Workers' Party welcome whole-heartedly the plans as envisaged, but we recognise that there are major implications for a number of authorities in the area.  We recognise there are major implications for a number of authorities in the area concerned with the land and the water that must be considered, as must the whole question of housing, traffic and other issues.  In that context it is important that this House be given an opportunity &mdash; if and when any Minister intends to extend the area &mdash; to consider that and make our views known.  The amendment adequately meets that requirement.  It should not present any difficulty for the Minister because all Members of this House have the best interests of that area and of the city generally at heart.  I would ask the Minister to take the amendment on board.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the section, and indeed of the Bill, is to enable the Custom House Docks area to be extended by Ministerial order, as may be required from time to time, without the need to refer to Dáil Éireann. That is what it is all about.  I might point out that an extension of the area requires the formal consent of the Minister for Finance and that extensions are confined within the parameters set out in the section.  Those restrictions appear to me to be quite adequate for the purpose of the section.  I suggest that a proposal to extend the area within the limits laid down should not require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as would the amendment if taken on board.</P>
      <P>I might also point out, by way of pertinent comparison, that an order designating an area for urban renewal under section 6 of the Principal Act does not require the advance approval of either House of the Oireachtas, nor is it capable of annulment by either House.</P>

For that reason I do not think the Deputy was unduly happy with the Principal Act in so far as that activity was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is wrong in that the provisions of section 2 seek to give the Minister power to extend the Custom House Docks area by order.  In the Schedule to the Principal Act the exact boundaries of the Custom House Docks area were defined and the Minister was not given power to extend the area by order.  Consequently, the exact boundaries of the area were enacted by statute and discussed specifically in this and the other House before that legislation was passed.  The Custom House Docks area was treated specifically and differently from other urban designated areas.  It was for that reason and from the point of view of consistency I suggested that the House should affirm any extension of the area as defined in the Schedule to the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>The difficulty the Minister has was not displayed earlier today by the Minister for Finance who placed on himself the restriction, if he extends an area into either a designated area or the Custom House Docks area, to table the relevant order before the House and to allow an annulling order to be tabled within 21 days.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the failure of the section to cite a definition <Col N="2510" /> of eastern boundary.  The Minister has partly indicated the thinking of his Department in not delineating that boundary for the moment, perhaps seeking to do so by order as matters progress. It is a cause of concern to know to what extent this development will eventually extend.  It is a very welcome one within its present confines.  Many of us would countenance a reasonable development to accommodate a plan that would be attractive to a major developer.  I accept the view of some developers that the present 20 acre site potential is probably not fully realised.</P>
      <P>Once one goes beyond the immediate area of the Custom House one is immediately encroaching on a very important area of local authority housing.  While it may not be the most attractive at present, nonetheless it is very strategically positioned. It would be unfortunate if the type of scheme envisaged in the Custom House Docks area development was allowed to extend to the detriment of a major area of local authority housing at this point.  Perhaps the Minister would give some indication of the long-term thinking in his Department in respect of this site, for example, where he and his planners envisage the development will ultimately end.  Dublin Corporation and other local authorities working there are anxious to know that so that they can get on with the very important task of developing and refurbishing the existing local authority housing there.  We do not want them abolished or people sent out of the area altogether.  Certainly we do not want to see a second Ballymun somewhere on the outskirts of the city to accommodate the exodus that would be involved in the dispersal of a large segment of local authority dwellers.  Dublin Corporation are at present actively consulting with people in the Sheriff Street area with regard to the refurbishing of the flats there, and other houses in the area, to accommodate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other concern with regard to the provision of section 2 is the effect of the development on traffic in the area.  It is clear from what is now envisaged that Sheriff Street will itself constitute the <Col N="2511" /> major access route for traffic to and from the East Wall area, along the North Wall, moving up onto Amiens Street.  From what has been said here, it would appear that the river front will be pedestrianised. I am anxious to know the full implications of the road development implicit in the new definition and the powers now vested in the Minister under this section with a view to extending the whole area of the Custom House Docks development site.</P>
    <P>I will revert to the point I raised earlier about the implications for the relevant local authorities and the encroachment on their responsibilities.  I would like the Minister at some stage of the discussion, not necessarily tonight but at a further stage in the Bill, to advise the House on issues such as who will maintain the roads in this extended site, who will have responsibility for the normal statutory duties currently vested in the local authorities, such as pollution by air, water and sea, malicious injury, dangerous buildings supervision and so on?  That is not clear from the discussion to date and I would welcome some comment from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to refer to the definition of the extension of the whole area as the eastern boundary is still undefined. Because of the large area of local authority housing in that area, has the Minister anything to say with regard to the future role envisaged for Dublin Corporation in the development of housing? Is it envisaged that there will be joint venture housing schemes incorporated into the extended plan, will Dublin Corporation be invited and allowed to develop exclusively, or is this matter to be moved entirely into the hands of the developer?  These are some of the points I wish to make on the section.  I do not expect the Minister, if he does not wish to, to take them up at present, but I would welcome some observation on them as the debate develops through this and the next Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to think that a problem will arise with the development in so far as controls are <Col N="2512" /> concerned.  He can rest assured that the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and other Acts concerning pollution will be just as applicable to that site as they would be to any other part of the metropolitan area.  If the Deputy wishes me to expand on that point later, perhaps in the Seanad, I would be delighted to do so.  I take the Deputy's point and I am sure it will be cleared up to his satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The traffic arrangements to the site will have to be included in the whole planning of the scheme.  I accept the Deputy's bona fides in that matter.  It is very important that this is included so that there is a proper traffic flow, organised in such a way as not to cause any congestion.  That is also included in the overall planning scheme.  I do not know whether the Deputy has a copy of the planning scheme but, if not, I would be delighted to make one available to him.  It gives a good broad outline of how flexibility is built into the planning scheme and how it is intended in the long term to see that all the matters the Deputy referred to are catered for adequately and in the public interest.</P>
      <P>I would like to finalise this discussion by saying that the extension of the site in the eastern direction will be dictated by the show of interest and the level of demand.  The Deputy admitted earlier that, as seven of the 27 acres were under water, it would probably stay that way and that 20 acres was a small amount of ground anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the two stacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that 20 acreas is a small amount of ground particularly when there was some reference to some of the stacks having to be protected, not necessarily all of them.  Some of them have an archaeological value and it is intended to preserve what is right and good down there.  For that reason, as the Deputy will agree, the extension would be needed, hopefully, at an early date. Much of the property east of the existing site, and down as far as Spencer Dock is in public ownership &mdash; for example, <Col N="2513" /> property owned by B &amp; I and CIE. Some of it is also in private ownership.  The Deputy quite rightly said that the extension will have to be made by way of consultation, particularly in so far as the flats complex is concerned.  There are powers under the legislation for the rest of the ground which is in public ownership to be acquired by order with compensation being duly paid.  There is also room for compulsory purchase acquisition for a ground that is not readily available in the normal way.  I would hope that, if it is necessary to make modifications in the compulsory purchase order regulations, it would be done as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed there is a need to allow for the extension in a southerly direction immediately and later in an easterly direction when the need demands it.  This legislation gives power to the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance to do that.  I think it augurs well for inner city Dublin and I hope we will have good tidings as to the ongoing developments between now and the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section of the Bill to which we are totally opposed.  The Authority was established with a small board with the task of playing a real role in the development of the site.  Its membership was chosen carefully.  The Minister paid me a compliment to which I was not entitled.  When I joined the Department of the Environment the then Minister of State, now Fine Gael Party Whip, had handled this matter for some years and introduced the Principal Bill, which is now the Principal Act, and steered it through.  Any credit which is to be given should in fairness be given to him. He outlined to the House his views as to why there should be a small board with a full time chairman.  The board consists of people of great calibre and with enormous experience in property development and in the world of financing, two of the areas which the Minister felt were lacking within the existing board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say it is most unusual that an incoming administration is seeking to vary the size of a board established by a previous administration, apparently for no other reason but to introduce on to that board a heavy political input in so far as they had not got within their remit at the time the authority to make any of those appointments. It is wrong and regrettable that this board is being unnecessarily increased in size. The board will be politicised as a result of this extension.  There seems to be no other justifiable reason for tampering with the size of the board at this stage. We can only reluctantly conclude that <Col N="2515" /> this board is being unnecessarily extended to give to the present Government the right to appoint political cronies. The difficulty in relation to this is this. I outlined an amendment which would allow the Minister to increase the board by one if there was a particular field of expertise which was not on the board. The Minister refused to accept that amendment and he insists he wants to increase the size of the board by three. That does not seem to us to be correct or necessary.  It seems to be only an attempt to give political advantage to one party.</P>

      <P>The amendment sought to facilitate the Minister in so far as any professional expertise was missing from the board in the Minister's view. The people who are in charge of the operations at the Custom House Docks, the board and the executive, are a small tightly knit, able and professional group and it would be a shame and a sham if the Minister was to politicise that body by adding party political hacks in the way that An Bord Pleanála was brought into disrepute by the addition to the board of people who were appointed for political reasons.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1987. - Tourist Traffic Bill, 1987: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Molaim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille don Dara Uair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for increasing the statutory limits on the total amount of grant-in-aid which may be paid out by Bord Fáilte for development purposes. The current statutory limit on grant expenditure for amenity development will be reached before the end of this year while the limit on Exchequer grant assistance for the development of tourism accommodation will be reached sometime in 1988.  Consequently, it is necessary to increase the amenity limit immediately to permit Bord Failte to make full use of its capital allocations for 1987.  It is also appropriate at this stage to increase also the accommodation limit.</P>
      <P>The statutory limits were last raised to £30 million and £14 million respectively by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1983.  The increases of £6 million and £4 million on accommodation and amenity limits, respectively, now being proposed in section 2 of this Bill, under present policies, could be expected to cover grant payments until at least 1990.  That seems to be a rational situation.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that this does not imply continuation of existing grant schemes or introduction of new schemes in the foreseeable future.  The existing schemes are subject to review each year during the annual Estimates exercise and their continuance would be subject to rigorous appraisal and also require approval by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I should like to articulate further the importance of tourism for our economy and the Government's strategy for its development.  Sustainable increases in employment numbers and opportunities are the Government's number one priority. To achieve this we must develop those sectors where we have a natural advantage or the materials to develop and sell a good product in international markets.</P>
      <P>One such sector is tourism which has been singled out by the Government as a target area for the generation of wealth and jobs.  Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world.  If present trends continue, it will, by the end of this century, be the largest single industry in the world.  I repeat, it will be the largest single industry in the world.  It is difficult to believe that manufacturing industry claimed the headlines in this area hitherto. They used to say what was good for General Motors was good for the USA, and what was good for the USA was good for the world.  Tourism will soon be the largest single industry in the world. Provided we can produce a good quality product at the right price and market it professionally, there is no reason why we cannot increase our share of this rapidly growing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within six weeks of coming to office the Government had agreed the broad strategy for developing the tourism sector.  It has five essential elements: to revive confidence in the industry by demonstrating the Government's commitment to it; develop and improve the competitiveness of our existing products; expand the range of products we offer in line with changing tastes and new demands in international markets; provide extensive and cheap access to Ireland for foreign tourists; and, I want to emphasise this, to be more selective and aggressive in our marketing of Irish tourism.  The Government's package announced on 3 May was the first phase in implementing this strategy.  It has worked magnificently well.  Confidence in the industry has revived and all the major operators have offered significant price reductions to improve our competitiveness. I would like to pay a tribute to them for having done so.  They realised this was in their best interests and they did it. <Col N="2521" /> The contents of this Bill mainly deal with product development.  Grant assistance is only one of a range of incentives provided to stimulate investment in product development.  These incentives include concessionary loan finance run by the Industrial Credit Corporation in conjunction with the European Investment Bank and availability of funding from the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism provided for in the Finance Bill currently before the House will act as a further stimulus to investment by the industry in tourism.  I have received many congratulatory messages about the extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism.  Obviously people were anxious that this should happen and they are now ready, willing and able to participate. It completes what is now a very comprehensive and attractive series of investment incentives for tourism. However, incentives and a willingness on the part of the industry to use them are not in themselves sufficient to ensure maximum return for the national economy on resultant investment.  Investment must be directed at developing a range of products for which there is clear demand and a well organised marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector is complex and diffuse and, consequently, more dependent on the State than other sectors for the overall leadership which is now an absolute pre-requisite for success.  The application of the business expansion scheme to export tourism will be designed to channel investment into the kind of tourist facilities which offer the best possibilities for a speedy return to the economy in terms of foreign revenue, tourism numbers and jobs created.  It is my intention that a similar sense of market sensitivity will also be applied to the future allocation of grant assistance.</P>
    <P>For too long the tourism sector has been left bereft of the strong, forceful leadership it urgently needs.  Although the international tourism market has been growing rapidly over the last decade, our share has been declining. <Col N="2522" /> To realise the full potential for job and wealth creation of this sector we need not only to recover lost market share but to increase substantially our performance in a market currently projected to double between now and the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Already the Government have shown quite clearly their determination to give the kind of leadership the sector needs for a return to growth.  On assuming office we carried out a full appraisal of the targets which Bord Fáilte had set for the 1987 season.  We were frankly shocked by the complacency and lack of ambition which they showed for the sector.  The new revised targets which have now been set by the Government reflect more accurately the industry's capacity for growth, and the current opportunities in the market.  If we do not set out seriously to pursue and seek growth, then we will not achieve it.  We are perturbed about the continental market, particularly the German market.  We want to target that market and increase the numbers of tourists coming from that area.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of tourism with transport in one Department at this time of change, especially in international aviation, provides unique opportunities to encourage and facilitate increased foreign tourist traffic.  Our policy is to ensure that the benefits of increased competition are, first and foremost, concentrated in our main tourist markets.  Our success in persuading the carriers to agree to sponsor the attractive fare packages on key tourist routes announced in the Government's 1987 tourism programme provides powerful testimony of the Government's determination to implement its drive for tourism growth with greater efficiency and competitiveness in the transport sector. Government efforts in providing an additional £1.25 million for foreign promotion this year provides further proof of our commitment to this sector.</P>
    <P>There are strong indications that Government action on tourism is working. Reaction from the tourism industry has been overwhelmingly positive.  This is underwritten by their willingness to <Col N="2523" /> offer significant price reductions, something I mentioned already, to complement our programmes for this year. Prospects for the 1987 tourist season are excellent.  The director general of Bord Fáilte has stated that Irish tourism is on target for one of its best ever years with great buoyancy being shown in all sectors &mdash; both foreign and domestic.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the domestic market.  We hope to strongly emphasise the importance of this market, so that holiday money which might go elsewhere will be spent at home.  Preliminary results for the first quarter of the year show that traffic from Britain grew by nearly 19 per cent.  Traffic from America jumped by 24.6 per cent over the same period last year, which was not a good year for US tourist traffic.  I should point out that the period to which I am referring, in which we had a 24.6 per cent increase over the same period last year, was before the Libyan crisis and the Chernobyl disaster. Those two events had a great impact on our tourist industry last year, to its detriment.</P>
    <P>Continental European traffic grew by over 8 per cent, making an overall growth of overseas visitors of 17 per cent for the January-March period.  The figure of 8 per cent is not satisfactory as far as continental European traffic is concerned and we intend to target that sector very strongly with a view to substantially increasing it.  I had a meeting today with a French based group and they indicated that they would be bringing 20,000 visitors to Ireland in the autumn, which is very welcome news and shows considerable enterprise on the part of the south of Ireland tour operator.</P>
    <P>Preliminary results for April show that this trend is continuing; inquiries at Bord Fáilte overseas offices are up, while air and sea operators and the large tour operators and organisers of travel to Ireland from our main markets are all confidently forecasting growth on 1986.  I do not want to emphasise 1986 because it was not a good year for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>This momentum will be maintained. <Col N="2524" /> There will be no let-up on the Government's part.  I intend to put in place in time for the 1988 tourist season a strategy which will build on this year's success and guide expansion in the sector up to 1993. We are promising a new era for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Bill now before the House.  I should explain that the main elements are contained in section 2. Section 2(1) deals with the limits on grant aid to holiday accommodation.  Grant assistance of over £5 million has been provided by the Government, through Bord Fáilte, for the development of holiday accommodation since the limit was last raised in 1983.  This grant expenditure has had a positive effect on the upgrading and expansion of our accommodation stock.  Specific grants have been available at various stages for the hotel and guest-house sector, the caravan and camping sectors, town and country homes, farmhouses and also for the expansion of the youth hostel network.</P>
    <P>Accommodation schemes in operation at the moment are for caravan and camping and for the supplementary holiday accommodation sectors which cover town and country homes and farmhouses. There is a special need in these areas to continue to improve standards and upgrade facilities.  They represent a very important element of the accommodation sector and are particularly well suited for growth, in line with the trend towards more outdoor-activity type holidays.</P>
    <P>The scope of the supplementary holiday accommodation scheme was extended earlier this year, and now applies nationwide.  Previously the scheme excluded County Dublin and premises within a seven mile radius of Cork city and a three mile radius of towns of over 3,000 population.  How far is Kilkenny from Cork?  However, the widening gap between standards of similar accommodation in urban areas and in rural areas in recent years justified this extension.</P>
    <P>This particular accommodation category has the highest satisfaction rating <Col N="2525" /> from foreign visitors of any accommodation product and we are most anxious that this level of satisfaction be maintained.  It is interesting to note that all the information coming to Bord Fáilte indicates that the degree of satisfaction is very high.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year Bord Fáilte will have paid out almost £29.6 million in grant aid for accommodation since first introduced by the Tourist Traffic Act of 1959.  This leaves less than £.4 million remaining before the statutory limit of £30 million in reached.  I, therefore, propose that the statutory limit be raised now from £30 million to £36 million.  This will be adequate to cover existing accommodation schemes until 1990, at the earliest, as well as allowing some leeway for their extension or possible introduction of new schemes should the House decide that this is warranted.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) deals with grant expenditure for the development of tourism related facilities and amenities.  The existing statutory limit on grants of this nature is £14 million and expenditure up to the end of 1986 amounted to almost £13 million. The 1987 allocation for this type of grant expenditure is just £1.2 million, bringing aggregate expenditure on amenity development by the end of this year to over £14 million.  The current statutory limit of £14 million must, therefore, be increased now to ensure completion of this year's amenity development programme.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 the Government, through Bord Fáilte, have provided almost £4 million in grant assistance for the development of tourism amenities and facilities in the non-accommodation area.  This expenditure has stimulated the development of a wide variety of facilities including angling &mdash; of great interest to my area &mdash; inland waterway development projects, heritage centres and the upgrading and extension of the local tourism information network, which has been marvellously improved.  Other areas of major grant expenditure include water sports facilities, equestrian centres, historical and cultural sites, parks and great houses and gardens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2526" /> As I said earlier, the statutory limit covering this particular area will be reached during the current year and I am accordingly proposing that the limit be increased from £14 million to £18 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill and indeed anything that will generate growth in the economy and which will attract tourists to our country.  The Government and the Minister have their priorities right in this case.</P>
      <P>Some of the figures which were trotted out may be a little premature and flattering. To use the years 1984-85 instead of 1986 as a yardstick when measuring the increase in traffic and income from tourists in 1987 may not be reliable because 1986 was a particularly bad year for a variety of reasons, due to the Americans staying away because of the Libyan backed terrorism in the Middle East and further afield and also because of the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>The figure for January-March in the Minister's statement of a 17 per cent increase is very encouraging.  I hope it is true and that it will be maintained, because obviously that is the low season. The months of June, July, August and September, and even October, are the peak seasons and the numbers in those months will really tell the tale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of very important factors when it comes to assessing or viewing the performance of the tourist industry.  One, obviously, is the cost involved for the individual tourist.  It is the Government's job to bring down costs.  We had the job of curbing inflation, which we did extremely successfully.  The Government now are endeavouring to reduce, in the medium and long term, the level of taxation.  That is designed to cut costs and it is to be lauded.  I wish the Government the best of success with that, <Col N="2527" /> without bringing about a certain amount of trauma by way of those cuts.  They have to be done in the least painful manner possible.  We support the Government in that effort because getting costs down is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Another very important factor, and one which is not going to go away in the immediate future, is the Northern Ireland problem.  Our greatest potential market, which is Britain, is seriously depleted because of the continuing troubles and the fear of British people regarding the situation in all of Ireland. Unfortunatley, they do not realise that the southern part of the country is very trouble free.  That problem does not extend just as far as Britain.  We get people from southern Ireland who are afraid to go to Northern Ireland.  One could hardly blame the British for not wanting to come even to sourthern Ireland. People do not understand that 99.9 per cent of the time things in Northern Ireland are perfectly all right.</P>
    <P>There is a mental block there where the British tourists are concerned.  I do not know what can be done about it but I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that it is a major impediment to the tourist industry.  Hopefully the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the recent general election results will help to make progress in that field.  There is a coming together there now.  There is a greater understanding that violence will not win out at the end of the day.  The hard line Unionists and hard line Republicans in significant numbers have come to realise that there is a better way through constitutional politics.  It is a major barrier to our tourist industry; let us not underestimate the impact that it is having.</P>
    <P>Another major impediment affecting the industry is access to this country, access at a reasonable price.  Again, I compliment the Minister; but, in doing so &mdash; and I wish to be perfectly balanced in saying this &mdash; we owe a tremendous vote of thanks to the previous Ministers involved in tourism and transport, and the access matter spills over from tourism into transport.  They are interlinked; one <Col N="2528" /> cannot separate one from the other. When Deputy Mitchell was Minister for Transport he really set the whole thing in motion by starting off the process of deregulation or liberalisation of air fares and also the licensing of independent airlines which are now bringing a vast number of tourists to this country.  They thereby boost the figures that the Minister has already referred to.  We should be very grateful for airlines like Ryanair, Club Air and Danair, and it is hoped Virgin Airlines will help.  We need carriers also, as we did have in previous years, on the North Atlantic run, bringing a cheaper rate.  Access is a very important factor; and let us not forget the contribution that Deputy Mitchell made in his capacity as Minister.  He started the process going.</P>
    <P>There are very important points in the Minister's statement and I am glad to see that he is not afraid to pinpoint difficulties. He does make the point that, while international tourism is growing at a very fast rate, our share of the market has actually declined and we should judge the 1987 figures in that context.  He said: &ldquo;We carried out a full appraisal of the targets which Bord Fáilte had set for the 1987 season.  We were frankly shocked by the complacency, and lack of ambition which they showed for the sector&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is a very revealing statement.  It supports many of the views expressed about the industry over the year.  It pinpoints the very pertinent question: are we getting good value for money from Bord Fáilte?  Are there too many people in offices in the headquarters in Baggot Street and around the country?  Are there enough competent people out there selling Ireland as a tourist centre?  That is a very important question which really needs to be answered, to be probed into further to see if the £25 million or £27 million &mdash; I think it has gone down to £23 million this year &mdash; which is being provided for Bord Fáilte is being put to the best possible use.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to seasonality.  The Minister mentioned possibilities of fishing holidays.  When the old gentry had nothing better to do, they would go either <Col N="2529" /> hunting, shooting or fishing.  We have magnificent potential in what we would call the tourist off-season for activities like that.  When Europe and the northern parts of the USA are frozen over, Ireland has these facilities available in abundance. Those areas could be highlighted, advertised and sold.  There are small numbers of Americans coming here, for hunting in particular.  The Minister referred to discussions he had today with a French group.  For the past two or three years French groups have been coming to Killarney and Kerry in general and to Clare, for that matter, in very large numbers.  Twenty thousand would not be anything extra to what have been coming over in recent years.  That scheme is already in operation and can be expanded.  It is something to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Another activity which is a considerable asset and under-utilised, particularly in wintertime, is golf.  Again this should prove a tremendous attraction to the Americans and the Japanese, the Japanese who do not have the space and the golf courses to play what has become a tremendously popular sport worldwide. If is an off-season type of activity which can be sold successfully.  We should be very concerned about the seasonality of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>We do not have enough bedroom accommodation at the peak period.  We find that ourselves in Dublin.  Any of us poor devils who have to come to Dublin and suffer this place at times for three or four days in the week will know that. It can be extremely difficult.  There is a shortage of beds.  That problem is acute for three, four or five months of the year. We should be thinking of developing the off-season tourist market because there is considerable potential.</P>
    <P>What worries me most in this country about tourism is that we are not the best in the world where business is concerned. I do not mind saying that, because I am used to being abused.  Our business acumen leaves a lot to be desired.  We are nice guys and we are good to work when we are put to work, but we are not the best people to organise ourselves. <Col N="2530" /> There is a lack of real go-getting individualism in this country.  It is a quality we do not have in abundance.  One of the more mercenary reasons why we should have reunification of this country is that the Scots and the Ulster Protestants seem to have that business acumen which we in the South seem to lack in a similar degree.  We have a tendency to want to make the quick buck, which means that people do not get good value for money and that the service is not as good as it should be.  We need to be more professional in our outlook.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, has been slated in the last few days because he said a few unkind words about restaurants and the quality of food.  He has a point.  Most of the restaurants are good, but too many are not good enough.  All these things turn off the foreign tourist.  The quality of service needs to be tip-top and the whole approach needs to be very businesslike.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the time for this debate is so short.  Other people are very anxious to contribute and will not get the opportunity to do so.  We support the Bill and support the Government's efforts to increase our tourist potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has touched on a wide range of issues in his speech.  I am sure he would agree with me that it is deplorable that all Stages of such an important and wide ranging Bill should be put through in about 40 minutes. However, I will do the best I can to deal with the important issue at hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism, as the Minister has rightly identified, is one of the fastest growing industries in the world today.  Within a very short space of time it will become <Col N="2531" /> the largest industry worldwide.  The implications for us are quite serious in that there is enormous potential for us from the world tourists coming into this country.  I am surprised that there is such urgency in relation to this Bill.  As the Minister is aware, the Price Waterhouse report will be a very in-depth study of the Irish tourism industry and will cover a wide range of issues.  This report is forthcoming in the immediate future so why is there the urgency to get this Bill through when the report will contain some references to the activities of Bord Fáilte? Some of these references, I am sure, will be positive.  The question of what sort of money will be needed in this area could be better reviewed in the light of that report.  The Minister in his speech made a staggering statement, but a very honest one, when he said:</P>
    <P>On assuming office we carried out a full appraisal of the targets which Bord Fáilte had set for the 1987 season.  We were frankly shocked by the complacency, and lack of ambition which they showed for the sector.</P>
    <P>This asks many questions with regard to the activities of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must assess what we want to do with the Irish tourist industry.  What we are selling today has changed drastically.  The general picture of Ireland of the welcomes has served us well in the past but that day has passed us by.  The definition of holiday time has changed and is now combined with leisure time.  The amount of spare time available to people nowadays is increasing and the disposable incomes of many people throughout the world is also increasing.  We must change to a hard product-based tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It is about time that we identified the various opportunities and areas of the country that are on offer to the world markets.  We should be aggressively marketing many aspects of our country.  I refer in particular to golf and the angling industry, which the Minister said his heart is very close to.  In Scotland the angling industry is responsible for revenues in <Col N="2532" /> excess of £250 million per annum, and this is growing.  The question must be asked why this is occurring in Scotland and not in this country.  It is because the selling of the product-based industry by many countries has changed in the past number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite rightly identified many markets throughout Europe.  What he did not say in his identification is what attracts tourists to the various markets they go to.  From my experience what attracts tourists, whether as individuals or families, is the specific product base they require for their leisure time.  This must be the direction of Irish tourism in the future if we are to grow in this area.</P>
    <P>The structure of this approach would, of course, question how Bord Fáilte is organised today.  We know that Bord Fáilte is a national institution.  They match many other countries in the area of expenditure.  But they do not match other countries in the area of regional expenditure in the open market.  This leads on to the secondary development which could occur in this country, namely, integrated regional development on a very large scale.  I am not saying to the Minister that this type of activity necessarily involves huge sums of money; I do not believe it does.  It needs a change of marketing structures and how the people who are paid to promote this country decide to operate in that area.</P>
    <P>There are one or two areas I would like to question the Minister on.  I am heartened by the Minister's approach to access transport such as provided by Ryanair and other airlines operating in and out of the country.  I hope the Minister has called in and spoken to the British Ambassador because of the U-turn by the British aviation authorities in their attitude to the Cork-Luton, Shannon-Luton and Dublin-Manchester routes.  I suggest that the Minister should expect that these access routes would be an integral part of the development of the package which he has quite rightly put together for 1987.  We are fast approaching the peak time he has quite rightly put together for 1987.  We are fast approaching the peak time of our tourist season. <Col N="2533" /> If these areas are to be accessible this package must be implemented immediately; otherwise, I would question the 400,000 extra tourists that the Minister has said is estimated to come to this country as a result of the implementation of the package.  This must be quickly and seriously looked at.</P>
    <P>The same sort of thing is occurring on the European air routes from Scandanavian countries, Germany and France.  If we cannot get the access for these countries into Ireland to sufficient levels at realistic prices, the tourists the Minister identified in these countries will not come here because the access cost will be too high for them.  I suggest that the Minister should press this matter and that the Taoiseach should raise it at the forthcoming meeting of the heads of State.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the joint advertising deal between Dan-Air and Aer Lingus.  As commendable as this deal is, I am led to believe that Dan-Air are one of the companies objecting on the British side to the activities of Ryanair into many airports.  How can this be reconciled with the push for greater access from the UK into this country?  It must leave a question mark on our major airline as to what activities are involved here.  I want to be fair in this and I hope that the Minister will look at this area.</P>
    <P>All of the extra services I have identified to the Minister are very essential to fulfil his desire of increasing the Irish tourist market.  He identified also the extreme importance of the domestic market.  One of the problems we have is the cost of activities that people engage in when they are on holidays.  One of our major problems, as the Minister has already admitted by running a voucher scheme in England, is the cost of petrol. Accommodation is also quite expensive. These areas must be seriously looked at. These costs should not rise in real terms during the next few years if we want to attract foreign tourists at a realistic level and, at the same time, keep our domestic tourists at home.</P>
    <P>It is also vitally important that we look <Col N="2534" /> at the whole area of where we are going in the tourist industry.  It is time to face up to the fact that we do not have a sunny climate and that we should not try to sell this country on a six weeks sunshine basis. We should accept that there are many opportunities for expanding the length of our tourist season by looking seriously at the option of a product based tourist market in this country.  This is the route I hope the Minister will look at.  I await with interest the report of Price Waterhouse and we can all look forward to a very serious increase in tourists which will only come about if the appropriate market structures and attitudes are in operation.  While a lot of the Minister's objectives are ideal and commendable, the hard realities must be brought to bear to back up those facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware farmers in regions other than disadvantaged ones are purchasing milk quotas.  It is a shame that farmers are allowed to purchase milk quotas in disadvantaged areas, particularly wealthier farmers who can well afford to purchase them.  I believe there are discussions taking place at present in Brussels the outcome of which will have lasting effects on our national milk production.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the restructuring of the milk quota which I hope will be completed this week at the discussions in Brussels and which will be of great advantage to the west.  However, the restructuring of such milk quotas will be beneficial only if they are allowed to obtain in respective regions, ensuring that farmers in the south are not allowed purchase milk quotas from disadvantaged areas of the west.  As the House will be aware, this practice is taking place at present.  It is happening in my county where farmers are selling &mdash; perhaps through no fault of theirs &mdash; their quotas for considerable amounts of money.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  When the restructuring has been finalised it will be the responsibility of national Governments to decide who should be allowed purchase these milk quotas.</P>
      <P>We are very concerned about this practice particularly in the North Connaught area I represent.  We in the west cannot afford to lose milk quotas to our southern or eastern counterparts, because our climate is not as good as that in the south or east.  Generally our harvesting is five or six weeks later than those other regions.  It is very unfair, therefore, that our milk quotas should be taken from us.</P>
      <P>I would propose that milk quotas be sold or leased only to farmers living and farming in the region where the quotas obtain, that the co-operatives be entitled to purchase quotas in their catchment areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have agreed to give my colleague. <Col N="2538" /> Deputy Leonard, a few minutes of my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea made by Deputy Brennan about milk quotas. The future of farming and many co-operatives in the west would be placed in jeopardy if there were to be a diminution of milk quotas in disadvantaged areas. The former Minister, Deputy Deasy, when announcing the milk quota scheme on 31 May 1984 stated that the quantity of additional milk being made available to small producers amounted to 1 per cent only of the total.  That is when these problems commenced.  Ever since small producers and co-operatives have been placed in a very vulnerable position.  With restrictions on milk production the large powerful co-operatives sought to entice supplies of milk from smaller co-operatives in Connaught/Ulster.  They managed to do so effectively in the course of the first milk cessation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the expression of concern by Deputy Brennan in regard to this matter and the fact that he has brought his concern in relation to the transfer of milk quotas to the attention of the House. It is in keeping with Deputy Brennan's position as a staunch defender of the rights of small farmers in the west, and their entitlement to a decent living.  I can assure him of the sympathetic consideration and understanding of all in Agriculture House.</P>
      <P>I might draw his attention to the fact that under EC and national regulations on the milk super levy milk quotas can be sold or leased only when the lands to which they are attached are also sold or leased.  Likewise when land which has a quota is sold or leased the corresponding quota automatically transfers with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All cases of transfer of quota from one co-operative to another resulting from <Col N="2539" /> the sale or lease of land require the Department's approval.  I can assure Deputy Brennan that the Department's approval will be forthcoming only where we are satisfied, following a thorough investigation and report by the local inspectorate, that it is a bona fide transfer.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied with the monitoring of quota transfers by the Department.  I would invite Deputy Brennan &mdash; if he has any evidence whatever of any shady dealings or any transfers about which he is doubtful &mdash; to bring them to the attention of the Department when I can assure him they will be speedily and thoroughly investigated.  If there is any contravention of EC regulations then the full penalties laid down for such offences will be brought to bear on relevant offenders.  I should say that, on summary conviction, a fine of £1,000 applies in addition to the full super levy penalty of £1.07 per gallon of milk on all deliveries made on foot of any irregular transactions.</P>
    <P>Essentially I am inviting Deputy Brennan to bring to the attention of myself, the Minister or any of the officials of Agriculture House any irregular transactions of which he might be aware when I can assure him they will be fully investigated. I have the greatest sympathy for the less well off farming community in <Col N="2540" /> that I represent an area similar to that of Deputy Brennan and indeed of Deputy Leonard.</P>
    <P>I have always felt it is essential that changes should be made in the Community regulations to enable proper restructuring of milk production to take place within co-operative areas, in other words to prevent leakage of milk out of one co-operative area into another.  We have been actively pursuing with the Commission and the Council a measure to be introduced which would enable co-operatives and dairies to purchase quotas from producers wishing to give up milk production for re-sale to small scale farmers with the capacity to develop, and to other farmers with special needs within the same co-operative area.  A proposal to this effect has now been included in the price-fixing compromise circulated to the Council.  Our Minister will be seeking to have this implemented as part of the price-fixing agreement as soon as possible. I am sure Deputy Brennan will agree that that measure will be enormously appreciated by such people as the North Connacht Co-operative and also by the Town of Monaghan Co-operative in which Deputy Leonard is so interested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which a revision to the end-year estimate may prove necessary <Col N="2295" /> must await an assessment of the likely impact of the Jobsearch Programme.

    <P>The deseasonalised live register figures for the first five months of the year indicate that threequarters of the deseasonalised increase was accounted for by the female unemployed even though females comprise only about one quarter of the total live register.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a range of measures announced on budget day, 31 March 1987, to deal with our present economic and fiscal problems, the Government acted to define a traveller for the purposes of European Communities Directive 69/169, which governs travellers' allowances, as a person who is outside the jurisdiction for a period of at least forty-eight hours prior to his or her arrival in the State.  The measure which came <Col N="2296" /> into operation on 1 April 1987, was given statutory effect through regulations made by me under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The question of permission from the EC Commission did not arise. However, on my directions, a written communication was made to the EC Commission on budget day by the Irish Ambassador to the EC which provided a full description of the measure taken by the Government and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>As is well known, the purpose of this step was to deal with the gross distortion of trade which had developed over a number of years as a result of the abuse of travellers' allowances.  Although the measure has been successful in limiting shopping trips to the North from distant parts of the country for the sole purpose of availing of travellers' allowances, I am conscious that a problem remains in the border-zone itself which is still causing serious loss of trade.  The Government are satisfied that the measure taken is in accordance with our obligations under the EEC Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 28 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>In 1986 the owners of a waterbus placed the vessel on Lough Leane in Killarney National Park without the permission of the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners, because of their concern to effect overall control of boating on the Lakes of Killarney and of the potential adverse environmental effect of the waterbus, sought and got an interlocutory injunction from the High Court in Dublin restraining the owners from operating the waterbus on the lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expert advice submitted in March 1987 to the commissioners indicated that the impact of the waterbus on the natural resources there may not be detrimental and that the granting of a licence for a <Col N="2304" /> trial-period to monitor the impact, if any, was warranted.  In May 1987 the owners of the waterbus accepted the commissioners' exclusive right to control all boating activities and their absolute ownership of Lough Leane.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances a temporary licence was granted for a period ending on 30 April 1988 to the owners of the waterbus so that the effect of its operation on Lough Leane could be monitored.</P>
    <P>I have received no intimation of strong opposition from Killarney UDC but I am aware that there has been local opposition to the granting of the licence.  At the end of the current tourist season the position will be reviewed and, if it is decided to allow a waterbus on Lough Leane in 1988, a licence will be granted on a concession basis in accordance with normal public tendering procedure.</P>

The functions of both bodies are fundamentally different; the Institute is a research agency, while the Council is a consultative forum where the social partners meet to discuss economic and social policy issues and to advise Government on their application.  The work programmes of both bodies are monitored regularly to ensure that any potential duplication is avoided and that their activities are as complementary as possible.</P>

      <P>Youth employment levy due from full-time farmers was collectible by the health boards for the tax years ended 5 April, 1983 and 5 April, 1984.  The levy due from part-time farmers and from other self-employed persons is collectible by the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended 5 April 1983 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Labour that £4.5 million is outstanding in respect of the two tax years ended 5 April, 1984.  The amount which the health boards are likely to collect out of the £4.5 million has not been calculated. The health boards are continuing to use the enforcement procedures available to them to collect outstanding amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that £11.9 million is outstanding from farmers and £40.2 million from other self-employed persons in respect of the years for which the Commissioners are responsible, i.e. a total of £52.1 million.  The amount which is likely to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners out of the £52.1 million is approximately £10 million.  It must be emphasised that the figure of £52.1 million is no more than an estimate and on the basis of previous experience that amount will be subject to downward revision on closer examination, on appeal, and for various other reasons.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that demands and reminders are issued to those who are charged with payment.  The next step in collecting outstanding payments would be to have collection enforced either through the courts or the sheriffs.  The arrears of youth employment levy represents a tiny fraction of the arrears which arise in the collection process under all tax heads. The resources devoted to the collection of any particular arrears must necessarily reflect the scale of those arrears in the context of all arrears of tax.  Available resources have had to be deployed in the enforcement of much larger sums of tax outstanding.  Accordingly it has not so far proved practicable because of overall limitations of staff resources to commence enforcement proceedings through the courts or the sheriffs in relation to youth employment levy.  The situation is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the emphasis placed by the NESC in their report on the need to stabilise the debt/GNP ratio.  Indeed, the Council make it clear that they regarded stabilisation as only the first step towards the ultimate objective of reducing the ratio even more.  The Government fully support that objective and the significant measures in this year's budget represent important progress in this regard.  The process will be continued in the years immediately ahead.  As in the present year, future budgetary adjustment will be accompanied by positive initiatives aimed at stimulating and increasing economic growth.  Thus the strategy will be one of encouraging economic growth through the use of specific developmental initiatives within an overall policy of fiscal restraint.  The approach will, I believe, result in the achievement of the stabilisation objective within the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>My Department are satisfied that the expenditure incurred on the consultancy is justified and that the resultant benefits will substantially exceed the costs.  The total cost of the consultancy was £25,000, £8,000 of which was paid in 1986.</P>

The delegations agreed that the trial period of pre-inspection at Shannon between 1 July and 31 October, 1986 had been very successful. ]They also agreed that a permanent scheme of pre-inspection should be established at Shannon airport and that it was desirable that the scheme should commence, if possible, during the 1987 summer period.  Among the issues discussed were the scale and form of a permanent facility at Shannon, the traffic that might use the facility and associated costs and benefits.  It is hoped that a date for the recommencement of pre-inspection will be settled in the near future.</P>

      <P>The amount of VAT to be collected on goods contained in an imported parcel is assessed and entered by customs on an import duty schedule, a copy of which is delivered to An Post.  The postman collects the VAT due before delivering the parcel.  If the parcel is refused, the postman returns it to the parcel post depot and it is again presented to customs, who cancel the VAT charge and enter the relevant details on a cancellation schedule, a copy of which is also delivered to An Post.  The parcel is then returned to the sender by An Post.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 10 March 1987 and her papers were referred to the social welfare officer for investigation of means.</P>
      <P>These inquiries proved to be protracted due to difficulties encountered in establishing the net income from her parents' holding.  This information was necessary to enable the value of her board and lodgings on the holding to be determined.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has recently been assessed with weekly means of £23.10 derived from the value of board and lodgings on her parents' holding and from her mother's earnings.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of his unemployment assistance claim, made in August 1986 the person concerned was assessed with means of £11.15 weekly, derived from the value of capital. <Col N="2330" /> Although requested by the social welfare officer who investigated the claim to provide specific details of movement of money in his building society account he failed to do so, and the redundancy payment of £6,000 obtained by him in 1985 was accordingly assessed in full.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer on 6 April 1987 also assessed him with means of £11.15 weekly.  In the context of his appeal he had again been asked by the social welfare officer, in March, to provide the information sought in relation to the building society account, but he declined to do this.</P>
      <P>He is accordingly in receipt of unemployment assistance of £31 weekly and his wife is in receipt of a separate payment of £29.70 weekly, the combined total being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £71.85 less means of £11.15.</P>

      <P>Section 127 of the Social Welfare Act, 1981, provides for the issue for benefit purposes of medical certificates free of charge.  The arrangements made under this section are that medical certificates are issued by approved medical certifiers who sign a form of agreement with the Department.  Under the terms of the agreement, the certifier is required to examine insured persons who are claiming disability or occupational injury benefit and to complete and issue medical certificates free of charge where the certifier considers that the person concerned is incapable of work.  The terms of the <Col N="2332" /> agreement preclude the certifier from accepting money or other consideration for the issuing only of a medical certificate.</P>
      <P>Where, however, the insured person separately requests medical advice or treatment, the certifier is allowed under the agreement to deal with the patient accordingly and though still precluded from charging for a certificate, may charge for the advice or treatment.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation 3301/86 (Valoren) does not exclude the availability of funds for private sector projects.  In this instance, it was clear to the Government that the overall national interest would best be served by channelling the available funds into public sector areas of activity.</P>
      <P>This approach has enabled the Government to draw up a programme of measures which will have a beneficial impact in upwards of thirteen counties in all four provinces with a direct employment effect of about 600 jobs.  That programme, which incorporates elements such as peat development, small-scale hydroelectricity projects, wind power evaluation and the promotion of better use of energy, particularly indigenous energy forms, has recently been submitted to the EC Commission for approval and drawdown of the available funds.</P>

      <P>There are at present four marine VHF communications stations, controlled from the manned coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head which provide VHF communications facilities on the north west and south west coasts.

      <P>Under section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, as amended by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and the Housing Act, 1984, it is the duty of each housing authority to make a scheme determining the priorities to be accorded to different categories of persons in the letting of houses.  In making a scheme the housing authority is required to have regard to the primary objectives set out in section 60 (3) of the Act such as the elimination of unfit housing and overcrowding, the provision of accommodation for persons <Col N="2340" /> in need of it who are unable to provide it from their own resources, etc.  A scheme or any amendment to a scheme requires approval.</P>
      <P>There is provision empowering the Minister, as respects any matter in a scheme, to require the authority to vary the scheme in a manner directed by him. The authority have a duty to comply with such direction within such time as the Minister may specify.  This provision may not be construed or operated to enable the Minister to direct the letting of a dwelling to any particular person.</P>
      <P>The implementation of schemes of letting priorities is a matter for each housing authority and the Minister for the Environment has no direct function in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The housing construction programmes of local authorities are financed by way of borrowings, almost exclusively from the Local Loans Fund.  The loan charges incurred on all such borrowings are met in full by a subsidy from my Department's Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of their rented <Col N="2341" /> houses is the responsibility of housing authorities and is funded from their own resources including rental income from housing and portion of the proceeds of sales of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>It is my policy, subject only to the limitations on available resources, to encourage and assist local authorities in carrying out essential refurbishment and improvement works to designated low cost and pre-1940 rented dwellings.  The capital made available for this scheme is subsidised at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent of the loan charges and a total of £7 million has been provided for the purpose in this year's Public Capital Programme. In addition, £1 million, by way of unsubsidised capital, is available for carrying out improvements such as the provision of sanitary facilities, extra accommodation etc., to other rented dwellings. Housing authorities may also, with my consent, use certain housing capital receipts for the refurbishment and improvement of their houses.</P>

      <P>Apart from the limited loan finance available under the special scheme operated by the European Coal and Steel Community for the modernisation of houses for coal and steel workers, I am not aware of any EC requirement or specific assistance in relation to the provision of bathrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of bathrooms in designated schemes of pre-1940 rented local authority dwellings which are in need of <Col N="2342" /> refurbishment may qualify for assistance under the remedial works scheme operated by my Department.  A capital allocation of £7 million has been provided for this scheme in 1987 and the loan charges incurred by local authorities may be subsidised up to a maximum of 80 per cent. In addition, unsubsidised capital is also available to local authorities to assist in the provision of bathrooms and other necessary modernisation works to rented local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>The £600 grant for the provision of bathroom facilities where they did not exist was terminated with effect from 27 March 1987.  Local authorities may make available to householders house improvement loans of up to £6,500 subject to the usual conditions.  They may also give grants of up to two-thirds of the approved cost for the provision of a bathroom in a private house to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household; in the case of a local authority house the disabled person's grant may meet the full cost of the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, the power to set up Joint Labour Committees or to extend the scope of existing committees rests with the Labour Court.  An application for the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee or for the extension of an existing committee may be made to the Labour Court by (a) the Minister for Labour, (b) a trade union, or (c) any organisation or group of persons claiming to be representatives of the workers or the employers concerned.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present for the extension of the scope of existing hairdressing Joint Labour Committees which cover the following areas: the County and County Borough of Dublin, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the Urban District of Bray, and the Cork County Borough. Neither has any application been made to the Labour Court to date by any trade union or by any organisation representative of the relevant workers or employers either for the extension of the scope of the existing committees or for the establishment of a new committee to cover other areas.</P>
      <P>My attention has not been drawn to any widespread abuses of pay and working conditions in the industry though, as is normal in relation to all industries covered by Employment Regulations Orders, my Department has received complaints in individual cases.  These cases are followed up and, where necessary, referred for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the Deputy's allegation about low pay in particular, it is not clear what weekly payment from the National Manpower Service he may have in mind. If the Deputy is suggesting that some employers who are receiving payments <Col N="2352" /> under the various schemes operated by my Department are paying their employees less than the amount they receive by way of such payments, then I would be glad to investigate any cases in which this is alleged to have occurred. My Department has no evidence of this practice.</P>
    <P>Finally, inspectors of my Department have not detected any widespread neglect of the requirement to register apprentices. ]Where any breach in this respect is noted, the attention of the employer is drawn to it and the matter rectified.</P>

      <P>I do not propose at this stage to introduce legislation to provide for State registration for physiotherapists.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the profession has been seeking the introduction of such legislation for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The physiotherapy profession, together with a number of other health professions, was informed last year that a decision had been taken not to introduce legislation of this kind.  This decision was made on the grounds that the protections of the public from unqualified practitioners could not be guaranteed through such legislation.</P>

      <P>At present some 40 per cent of asthma patients are covered by medical cards and, therefore, receive all their prescribed drugs and general practitioner services entirely free of charge.  Significant ongoing medical expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.  In the case of a family a medical card can be issued to one member of the family only, where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2358" /> Persons whose income precludes such eligibility can avail of the benefits of the drugs refund scheme.  The scheme ensures that the net expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines for an individual or a family does not exceed £28 per month.  Persons insured with the VHI can avail of the benefits applicable to their particular policy.  Income tax relief is also available in regard to medical expenses.</P>
    <P>Medical cards can only be issued to persons who satisfy the criterion of hardship, in that they cannot provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants without incurring an undue degree of hardship.  The issue of medical cards is a statutory responsibility of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>The volume entitled &ldquo;Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes 1986&rdquo; (Pl. 4396) published by the Stationery Office was the fourth annual edition, the first having been published in 1983.  In these volumes, public expenditure was taken to include the following expenditure on a gross basis:</P>
      <P>(1)  All Exchequer-financed expenditure;</P>
      <P>(2)  Expenditure financed from own resources of local authorities, health boards, non-commercial semi-State bodies and various funds such as the social insurance, occupational injuries and redundancy funds;</P>
      <P>(3)  Non-Exchequer financed expenditure of commercial semi-State bodies under the Public Capital Programme. (Expenditures and revenues associated with the trading activities of the commercial semi-State bodies are excluded.)</P>
      <P>The administrative costs of an organisation running several programmes (e.g. a Department) were apportioned by programmes. ]These costs include direct pay costs and non-pay overhead costs such as travel, postage and telephones.  The apportionment data should be treated as Estimates since the expenditures are not formally accounted for on a programme but on a Vote basis.  It should be noted in particular that the costs attributed to vocational schools under the second level education programme include, in addition to costs of second level education, the costs of adult education and other educational activities of vocational education committees.  It was not possible to separate the cost of the other activities from the cost of the second level programme.  To this extent, the expenditures outlined overstate the cost of second level education activities.</P>

    <P>The document &ldquo;Proposals for Plan 1984-87&rdquo; (Prl. 2309) published by the National Planning Board in April 1984 contains at page 291 a table entitled <i>Non-capital Annual Unit Costs in Education and Training</i> in respect of the years 1980 <Col N="2364" /> to 1983 inclusive.  Separate unit costs were shown for secondary schools, technical schools/community colleges and community/comprehensive schools as well as a composite second level figure. Separate unit costs were included for AnCO training courses for unemployed. As the footnote to the table indicates, the unit costs in education and training shown are not exactly comparable.  The former refers to annual expenditure per student, while the latter refers to annual expenditure per training place.  Because of the shorter duration of training courses, typically more than one student would receive training for each training place provided.  AnCO training allowances are included in the AnCO costs. The education data in the table represent comparable net current cost to the State per full time equivalent student of educational services provided in each of the establishments listed.</P>
    <P>I accept the operating costs shown as valid and accurate.</P>
