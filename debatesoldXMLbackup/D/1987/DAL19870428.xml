      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the advantages of creating, under the general supervision of the Attorney General but separate from the ordinary work of his Department, a special staff of legal advisers with adequate resources, to concentrate on the whole complex of sea-related matters involving such matters as fisheries, submarine archaeology, offshore exploration and mining, control of marine pollution, prevention and disposal of wrecks, and, in particular, relations with <Col N="2" /> other States regarding the delimitation of the sea-bed and continental shelf.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The sea-related areas referred to in the question are such as to require legal assistance and advice from time to time on a very wide and diverse range of issues.</P>
      <P>I will consider the suggestion put forward by the Deputy but such consideration would have to have regard to the present budgetary constraints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if <Col N="3" /> he will consider the acquisition of Carton Estate in Maynooth, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Carton House and demesne are in private ownership and there are no current proposals to acquire them for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the sale of Carton House has been mentioned in the past couple of years?  Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a strong lobby in the region for the acquisition of the estate by the State?  Having regard to the Taoiseach's interest in cultural and heritage matters will he investigate the possibility of approaching the owners who seem to be disposed towards the sale with a view to acquiring the estate as a national park for use by residents of the region?  Will the Taoiseach consider allocating money from the National Lottery for the acquisition of the estate as a national park?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it would be very desirable and appropriate if this property could be acquired for public use.  In saying that I am very conscious of the enlightened action taken by Dublin County Council in acquiring Malahide Castle, a property of a similar type.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware, budgetary constraints at the moment rule out any possibility of the State acquiring the estate.  However, if some generous benefactor could acquire it and present it to the State, or even to the local authority, that would be very welcome.  I promise the Deputy that I will keep in touch with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach use his good offices to approach the county councils of Kildare, Meath and Dublin, and some Government Departments, with a view to getting them to co-operate in the acquisition of the estate?  I should like to ask the Taoiseach to bear in mind that there has been a huge influx of <Col N="4" /> people into the north-eastern area of Kildare in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the precise responsibilities allocated to the Minister of State at the Office of Trade and Marketing; and how these functions differ from the role of previous Ministers of State in that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Trade and Marketing is being allocated responsibility for all aspects of trade development, export promotion and marketing.  Accordingly, he will be responsible for the activities of the International Trade Division of the Department of Industry and Commerce, including Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.</P>
      <P>The present allocation of the functions of trade and marketing differs from past arrangements in that these functions were not previously assigned to any Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the confusion over the weekend when the Minister of State in question said that CTT were to take over the export marketing of fish and certain agricultural products that were previously under the auspices of BIM and CBF?  Will the Taoiseach clarify that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as any confusion may have been caused I am sorry to have to point out to the Deputy that it was caused by the previous Government who announced that they were going to remove the functions in regard to fish from BIM and transfer them to CTT. The Government had indicated that they proposed to leave that function with BIM.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I am not aware of what the Deputy is referring to but the Minister of State has been looking at this whole area of the respective functions of CTT, BIM and CBF to see how their efforts can be co-ordinated in the best possible way.  As far as fish is concerned the position is as I have outlined.</P>

    <P>2.  Action taken or proposed in respect of each report:</P>
    <P>(a)  First report on Family Law:</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act, 1981, abolished the actions for criminal conversation, the enticement and harbouring of a spouse and breach of promise of marriage.  It also provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the regulation of various <Col N="7" /> questions in relation to the property of engaged and formerly engaged persons.</P>
    <P>Legislation to give spouses equal rights of ownership in the family home and contents is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>(b)  Report on Civil Liability for Animals.</P>
    <P>The Animals Act, 1985, which took account of the recommendations in the Commission's Report, was enacted on 12 June 1985 and was brought into operation by Ministerial order on 20 September 1985.</P>
    <P>(c)  Report of Defective Premises:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to reintroduce shortly the Building Control Bill, which lapsed at the dissolution of the 24th Dáil. When the Bill is enacted and the building regulations and the building control system provided for in the Bill are in operation further consideration can be given to the proposals contained in the report.</P>
    <P>(d)  Report on Illegitimacy:</P>
    <P>The Status of Children Bill, 1986, which is designed to deal with the matters contained in this report, was introduced in the Seanad in May 1986 and was passed by that House in January 1987.  It is now awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(e)  Report on Age of Majority:</P>
    <P>The Age of Majority Act, 1985, which lowered the age of majority from 21 to 18 years &mdash; or earlier on marriage &mdash; came into effect on 1 March 1985.</P>
    <P>(f)  Report on Restitution of Conjugal Rights, Jactitation of Marriage and Related Matters:</P>
    <P>Legislation to abolish the action for restitution of conjugal rights is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>(g)  Report on Domicile and Habitual Residence as connecting factors in the conflict of laws.</P>
    <P>(j)  Report on Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, which came into effect on 2 October 1986 abolished the domicile of dependency of married women and provided that a foreign divorce would be recognised if it was granted in a country where either spouse was domiciled or if it was recognised in the country or countries where the spouses are domiciled.  It also included some consequential provisions related to these changes.</P>
    <P>(h)  Report on Divorce a Mensa et Thoro and Related Matters:</P>
    <P>Preparation of legislation to amend the law on judicial separation is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>(k)  Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences:</P>
    <P>Some preliminary consideration of this report has been carried out.</P>
    <P>(n)  Report on Offences under the Dublin Police Acts:</P>
    <P>The Commission's recommendations in relation to the repeal of a number of obsolete provisions governing offences of a road traffic nature and their replacement where necessary by more modern provisions under the Road Traffic Code are being considered in the context of the preparation of a Road Traffic Bill, which the Minister for the Environment expects to bring before the Dáil in 1987.</P>
    <P>(3)  (i), (1), (m), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s) and (t)</P>
    <P>The recommendations in these reports will be considered as soon as practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that over the past decade, and since the Law Reform Commission were established, the amount of reform advocated by the Commission has not been taken up by successive Houses of the Oireachtas? Does the Taoiseach feel that the expenditure of money on that body is worthwhile? Is there any intention by the Government to change this procedure <Col N="9" /> and adopt the law reform measures suggested by the Commission, something that has not been the practice hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy to some extent, that there has not been the same devotion to the cause of law reform in recent years as there might have been.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that the last major programme of law reform was undertaken by myself.  I could not agree with the Deputy that the work of the Law Reform Commission could be regarded as wasteful. Even if the House is not as assiduous as it might be in taking up the various reports, nevertheless the work on those reports, and their publication, is very valuable.  Recently I attended a function of the reorganised Law Reform Commission and I heard from their president an outline of what the new commission propose to undertake.  I am glad to give the Deputy an assurance that in so far as is possible we will see what can be done to take up and pursue the reports made by the commission in the lifetime of this Dáil and get as much law reform undertaken as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy and the House that this reply is in the form of a tabular statement and, strictly speaking, we should await publication of the Official Report before taking questions on it.  However, I will allow a very brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made comments recently about committees of the House and said he is considering reviewing a number of them.  In line with what he said about the committees, will he consider having some committee of this House to follow up some of the major work and proposals put forward by the Law Reform Commission?  It is obvious there is no follow up in this House after the furnishing and publishing of the reports by the Law Reform Commission. Individual items are taken but not to the extent that everybody would like the matter to be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies with experience in this area will agree that it is a matter for the House itself.  If we are prepared to allocate the time the work will get done, but I do not think that setting up another committee to consider these reports would help.  It is a matter of the appropriate Ministers concerned undertaking the work and securing the co-operation of the House in getting time allocated to law reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá i gceist agam, a Cheann Comhairle, Ceisteanna Uimh. 5, 6 agus 7 a thógáil le chéile.</P>
      <P>Is eol dom go raibh tuairiscí sna nuachtáin le déanaí maidir le tairiscint ón Uasal Michael Taylor Collings chun fáil réidh lena bhfuil de mhaoin aige sa Bhlascaod Mór.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá bhféadfadh Fundúireacht an Bhlascaoid an mhaoin sin a ghlacadh.</P>
      <P>Tá rud níos tábháchtaí, áfach, ná teideal dlíthiúil don chuid seo ná d'aon chuid eile den oileán: sé sin, go gcaomhnófar é mar áit a bhfuil áilleacht mór aiceanta ag baint léi agus mar áit oilithreachta dóibh siúd uile a bhfuil dúil acu ina cuid traidisiúin liteartha agus béaloideasa agus, go háirithe, go gcumhdófar na tithe a bhfuil ceangal acu le scríbhneoirí cáiliúla an oileáin, Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers agus Muiris Ó Súilleabháin.</P>
      <P>Chun na críche sin, tá i gceist agam na céimeanna go léir is gá a ghlacadh d'fhonn a chinntiú go mbainfidh na heagrais Stáit go léir a bhfuil baint acu leis an scéal, agus an t-údarás áitiúil, lánúsáid as na cumhachtaí atá ar fáil dóibh chun cosc a chur le haon fhorbairt mhíshásúil, nó le haon cur isteach eile nach mbeadh inghlactha, ar thaitneamhachtaí an oileáin.</P>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent press reports of the offer by Mr. Michael Taylor Collings to dispose of his interest in the Great Blasket Island.  It would be appropriate if the Blasket Island Foundation could acquire this interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is more important, however, than the legal title to this or any other part of the island is its preservation as a place of great natural beauty and of pilgrimage for all who cherish its unique literary and oral traditions and that in particular the houses associated with the <Col N="12" /> island's celebrated writers, Tomás Ó Criomhthain, Peig Sayers, and Muiris Ó Súilleabháin be protected.</P>
    <P>For this purpose I intend to take all necessary steps to ensure that all the Government agencies concerned and the local authority make full and active use of the powers at their disposal to prevent any undesirable development or any kind of unacceptable interference with the amenities on the island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the general tenor of the Taoiseach's response.  I think he accepts that the islands and particularly the Blasket Islands are of such importance from the point of view of our culture and heritage that no undesirable development should take place there and I am sure that that matter will be attended to. Are the Government prepared to intervene in the possible purchase of this island?  I am aware that the offer has been made for a reasonable amount of money. It strikes me that in relation to the preservation of our heritage the sum of money asked for &mdash; which I am sure can be reduced further &mdash; is reasonable and that the individual in question is not seeking to make any enormous profit on his investment.  Are the Government prepared to provide the finance necessary if either a local authority or a local organisation are prepared to purchase and look after the island in future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is personally very interested in this issue.  I would like to suggest to him that perhaps the best way of dealing with the matter at this stage is to leave it in the hands of the fundúireacht to deal with.  I am not sure that the legal position is crystal clear. Furthermore, I would like to repeat to the Deputy I am certain that what is far more important than the legal title to any specific part of the island is that the amenities and the beauty of the island be preserved by rigorous application of powers which reside in the various Government agencies and in the local authority.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of Deputies in the House in their capacity as Deputies have been quite assiduous and determined in following up this issue, and I would like to pay tribute also to a number of individuals in Britain, politicians and others, who have also shown great interest in endeavouring to have this situation resolved.  I think it is better not to be partisan in our approach but rather to endeavour to ensure that all possible influence is mobilised to ensure that the cases are dealt with and the injustices are resolved as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I know that the Taoiseach is probably aware that following the recent Anglo-Irish Parliamentarians exchange, a number of Deputies from this House visited the Birmingham Six in Longlartin, largely at the initiative of Deputy David Andrews.  One of the requests made by the Birmingham Six was that they should, if not allowed out on bail between now and November, at least be allowed for family reasons to transfer back to the prisons from which they originally came.  Will the Taoiseach convey that request through the most appropriate channel open to him, with a view to having it acceded to.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I have a very deep personal interest in this case, an interest which I took when I was in Opposition.  I will certainly continue to take a personal interest in having this matter resolved because it has very important implications for the whole process of Anglo-Irish relations.  At this stage my contribution can be best made in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has specific responsibility in the area. Between us, the Deputy can be assured, we will make every possible effort to have the matters resolved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I met with the President, Mr. John Carroll, and the Executive Council of the ICTU on 15 April.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Ministers for Finance, Labour, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the meeting was to discuss with the Congress representatives their proposals for a national plan for growth and economic recovery.  The discussions were positive and constructive.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the ICTU representatives the Government's intention to bring forward a medium-term programme covering a period of three to five years.  The programme will be based on the principles recommended by NESC in their recent report: <i>A Strategy for Development</i>.  I outlined the principles of this programme and Congress agreed to enter into discussions with the Government on the elaboration of the programme.</P>
      <P>I and my colleagues will be meeting ICTU again tomorrow to discuss the proposed programme further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> A series of meetings to discuss the programme have also been drawn up with the other social partners.</P>
    <P>These meetings are consistent with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which Fianna Fáil published before the last election and in which we made the commitment to examine in consultation with the social partners all the obstacles to higher employment and greater competitiveness, the way in which these should be tackled and the possible solutions.</P>

      <P>Was the basis for the discussions that indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement when he suggested that there would be no scope for increases in public service pay during this year, and did the Taoiseach get a response to that from the Congress delegation?  Will the Taoiseach say whether or not this series of <i>ad hoc</i> discussions is the substitute for the forum which he in Opposition promised to create to discuss obstacles to growth and employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The first meeting was of an exploratory and preliminary nature and confined itself to an outline by both sides of the requirements as we saw them and the need for a programme of economic recovery.

Does the Taoiseach intend that these areas will be the subject of discussion in order to ease the tensions, for instance tensions within the ESB where a strike is looming?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter.  In meeting the Congress on this occasion we were concerned with an elaboration of a strategy for development.

Will the Taoiseach now outline to the House the basis of the requirements needed which were dealt with at that meeting, which may result in job creation which, I presume, is the prime target of economic growth and recovery?</P>

Government policy in that regard has been clearly outlined in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and in subsequent statements of mine and of other Ministers.  The purpose of these meetings with Congress and with the other Social partners will be to formulate a programme of economic recovery generally along the lines laid down by the NESC report.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware it is difficult to set time limits on a process of discussion of this kind because it will necessarily involve all the social partners.  The best thing I can say to the Deputy is that work will begin immediately, discussion with the social partners will commence as soon as practicable and the work will be pushed ahead through the summer months.</P>

      <P>It would help greatly if Dublin Corporation submitted the three year programme requested of them, so that we could establish the corporation's housing needs over that period.  I should prefer if they would conclude that business and send their submission to me. Then we would all be in a position to make a better judgment on their requirements. Perhaps the Deputy might use his influence in that regard.</P>

      <P>While I fully appreciate that it is the responsibility of the Government and the Minister to make capital allocations to each housing authority, would the Minister agree that within reasonable limits it is the responsibility of the housing authorities in question to decide the location and nature of the housing they propose to build?  Would the Minister give the House an assurance that it will not be the policy of his Department, during his term of office, to intervene in the method and selection of areas for rehousing by Dublin Corporation or, indeed, in the type of housing they choose to build on the grounds of cost?  That is a function of the local authority concerned. Does he agree the overall capital allocation, and only that, is the function of the Department of the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I agree with the remarks made by the Deputy.  It is for the corporation and the local authorities to establish where these houses might be best located.  The view of the Department is also an essential ingredient in making the final decision in so far as expenditure is concerned.  I think the Deputy will agree with me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister indicate in principle that policy approach.  If that is the case, does the Minister not agree, from his present knowledge of the way in which some <Col N="25" /> sections of the Department of the Environment may perhaps interpret Government policy, that they could be delaying unnecessarily tenders for various inner city housing proposals on the grounds of unit cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no undue delay in the Department in regard to schemes that are proposed by various local authorities. I suppose it would be reasonable for the Department to have a view on unit costing of housing ranging between £50,000 and £60,000 per house, which was the average unit cost last year.  I expect that the Department, in their overall allocation, are concerned about escalating costs in so far as schemes are concerned. Apart from that, I expect the corporation and other authorities will have a major input as to the selection and type of sites. The Department, because of the cost factors, must have some input into that area also.  I think that will be appreciated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When Dublin Corporation were notified of their 1986 capital allocation to finance their commitments at that time, the Department, by letter dated 31 July 1986, requested them to carry out a review of their house building programme to determine the appropriate level of housing output required in the Dublin area to cater for the likely demand for the next three years.  It is reasonable to expect that we should have that submission before final decisions are made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to the final part of the question.  The answer to the first part of the question and to Deputy McCartan's question is that the corporation have indicated a number of schemes which they would like to commence in 1987.  The three year programme is still awaited in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister said and having regard to the joint housing conference which took place in Wexford some weeks ago, does the Minister now recognise that housing authorities have a dual role, that they not only provide housing but, in inner city areas throughout the country including the Minister's town of Castlebar, they have an urban renewal role also?  Therefore, will the Minister take the necessary steps in his Department to ensure the evaluation of unit housing costs for houses located in such urban areas will include the urban renewal content as well as the overall traditional unit cost factor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that all local authorities should be involved in urban renewal.  It is appropriate that that be considered in their development programmes. The subject matter of another question, which I will answer later, refers to the announcement made following the Government meeting on Sunday concerning the NBA's involvement in that. Perhaps when we come to that question we will elaborate on it further.  It is a positive step forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The acknowledgement of receipt of application in the Department would not convey eligibility under the scheme.  It was always a condition of the home improvement grant scheme that an inspection had to take place before commencement of work.  As far as the decision of 27 March is concerned, all <Col N="29" /> those who had an inspection carried out by the Department's inspector will qualify for the grant and will be paid in due course, as long as they comply with the other terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement outlining the action he has taken or proposes to take to increase public awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of the public awareness aspects of road safety generally is the primary role of the National Road Safety Association which operates under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>Since 1978, the association have been particularly active in promoting public awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving, especially at the Christmas and New Year periods.  I am satisfied that these campaigns, combined with Garda enforcement of the drink-driving laws, have had considerable success in reducing the number of drink-related road accidents and in bringing about a desirable change in social tolerance of the drinking driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> Detailed analysis of road accidents carried out by An Foras Forbartha support this view.  Since 1978, road deaths generally have declined by 39 per cent and injuries by 17 per cent.  Of even greater significance, however, is the reduction that has occurred between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., the hours which are most associated with drink-related accidents. The number of fatal and injury accidents during these hours has declined by 29 per cent overall and the proportion of such accidents has fallen from a third to a quarter of total accidents.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may rest assured, however, that there has not been, nor will there be, any let-up in efforts to drive home the dangers of drinking and driving.  The National Road Safety Association are currently developing plans for 1987 involving a summer drink-driving campaign in addition to the normal Christmas-New Year campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his apparent complacency on this very important issue is misplaced having regard to the fact that there is still far too much drinking and driving?  Will he not agree there is no evidence in the media advertising sponsored by his Department or its subsidiaries of an aggressive campaign pointing out the injuries sustained and the risks people take when they indulge in drinking and driving?  Will he not agree that now is the time to make an allocation to the association and for this Department to initiate an aggressive advertising campaign on this question to avoid the regular mayhem on our roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, there is no complacency as regards the problems referred to in this question but we have to recognise the facts and the <Col N="32" /> statistics I quoted in my replies.  I suggest that these statistics are heartening because there has been a very big improvement.  While we may not be complacent as to the steps which should be taken to improve the overall position, the decision to have a summer campaign should be recognised as a step in the right direction.  The figures for Ireland were low relative to the statistics in the other member states and while we should not be complacent about these figures, at the same time, we have to recognise the big increase that has taken place in the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the electoral code is contained partly in the Constitution and partly in ordinary legislation. In regard to reform in the constitutional provisions, I would refer the Deputy to the statement made by the Taoiseach in reply to a question in the House on 24 March.  It will be recalled that the Taoiseach indicated that if there were a general view among the parties that constitutional reform should be engaged in, he would be prepared to enter into discussions about the mechanism which might be established to look at this matter.  The Taoiseach made it clear that this applied to the electoral provisions as well as other aspects of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In regard to electoral procedures, which are governed by ordinary law, there are some detailed aspects which I would like to see improved, notably the register of electors, and I would hope to turn my attention to that matter in due course.</P>

      <P>Lest the Minister be consumed with megalomania and his leader be fearful of his back, the strange wording of the question is explained by the fact that it was addressed to the Taoiseach and transferred to the Minister.

      <P>The point is the Deputy is not the party leader but the question was originally addressed to the Taoiseach.

      <P>The Taoiseach issued a useful invitation and I am sure the other parties would like to consider it.  In the light of the Taoiseach's invitation, perhaps that meeting will take place.  In 1959 and 1968 there was no cross party support for the referenda dealing with the electoral system but, perhaps, since the party leaders can now agree on some matters dealing with that aspect of reform, it might get a good hearing across the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to issue a White Paper on urban renewal at present. Government policy and Government <Col N="38" /> action in this area are well known and, I believe, well accepted.  The Government will continue Fianna Fáil's traditional commitment to urban renewal and will do everything possible to resolve problems of inner city decay, dereliction and population decline.  The effectiveness of the financial incentives under the Urban Renewal and the Finance Acts, 1986, is being monitored and the Government are also considering the extension of the designated area scheme already in operation for Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, to other provincial centres.  Special attention is being devoted to the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site.  I hope to see substantial progress on this project in the months ahead.  In addition, approval has been given by the Government to a proposal of the National Building Agency to undertake redevelopment works bringing together local authority, private and voluntary interests, in a number of provincial centres, beginning with the Wexford pilot scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the most disastrous reply I have heard for a considerable time.  Does the Minister of State have special responsibility for urban renewal or has anyone in his Department specific responsibility for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has such responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that he is not in the House.  May I ask the Minister &mdash; fresh from his Ógra Fianna Fáil Dublin Conference which he left with a flea in his ear &mdash; if, given the complaints which have been made to him from his own party and from people of standing in Dublin, and since he is not prepared to introduce a White Paper, he would accede to a request from the House for an all-party committee to consider the question of urban renewal in major areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of an all-party <Col N="39" /> committee does not arise.  The basis for an ongoing programme of urban renewal is already well placed and we are continuing to develop policies in that regard. It is a little tiresome to listen to the Deputy referring to the ongoing commitment of the Government.  The Custom House Docks site development, to which I referred to in my reply, will not happen in the distant future.  It is a real live issue.  The planning scheme will be ready in May and, following consideration of the statutory arrangements involved, we can expect to see development work on the site in the early autumn.  That is a very positive move in the development and re-development of the inner city.  We have also taken a decision, announced on Sunday, to allow the National Building Agency to get involved in the development of schemes for urban renewal in other centres throughout the country.  These are positive steps and we are encouraging local authorities &mdash; whose primary responsibility it is &mdash; to include urban renewal in their development programmes.  We are more than adequately dealing with the matter and it will be of primary importance to me and to the Minister of State &mdash; who is now in the House &mdash; to see that these matters are brought to a happy conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Minister said Fianna Fáil had a policy in regard to urban renewal and I should like him to circulate it because there does not seem to be any planned policy for urban renewal on a national basis.  Could the Minister say whether the policy includes plans for the removal of derelect sites, preservation of significant buildings and landmarks, employment in the inner cities, planning on a national basis for housing in the inner city, main roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy can be assured that the few examples I outlined are the first decent steps forward in so far as urban renewal is concerned.  He is not giving credit to the efforts made by the Department, by me and the Minister of State in regard to development of the docks site. Is the Deputy aware of what is going on in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the widespread use by many local authority members of the section 4 process under the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, he has any plans to introduce amending legislation to curtail the use of such motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="41" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to amend section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  This section provides one of the most important powers reserved to the democratically elected members of local authorities.  Should any adjustment in relation to the operation of this provision appear necessary this could, appropriately, be considered in the context of proposals for local government reform generally, which I am currently examining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is unsatisfactory that all that is required for the passing of these motions is a simple majority with only one-third of the members of a local authority voting in favour of a section 4 motion for it to be passed?  Does the Minister agree that in many local authorities these motions are being used, in many cases, to flout the planning laws, as they exist, to the detriment of the community at large? Would the Minister like to comment on the position, for example, in regard to Dublin County Council, of which I am a member, where at the last three meetings of the council there were 36 section 4 motions on the agenda?  This is a very strange use of the section 4 process which traditionally was used only in very rare cases.  Would the Minister agree that these motions, particularly in my own county council, are leading to a situation where the business of the council cannot be conducted effectively by those members who are not involved in this process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise what the Deputy is saying and I would like to point out to her that I am aware of the regulations attached to the passing of a section 4 motion.  It is important for local authority representatives to have that power. Sometimes the question of the involvement of section 4 can be somewhat overstated. Less than half of 1 per cent of all applications involve section 4.  I have a statistic which might be relevant and it is the most recent one available to me.  In 1985, 33,649 planning applications were <Col N="42" /> received of which 88 involved section 4. Taking it in the overall context of all the applications made throughout the country, it is not a large number.  As the Deputy well knows, only a very small number of counties have passed section 4 motions.  The Deputy made a reference to the situation in Dublin and the latest figure available to me is that nine section 4 motions were passed in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be desirable that at least two-thirds of the members of a local authority should have to vote in favour of these motions before they could be passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in the document published by the Progressive Democrats on the environment that suggestion was made.  The question of this particular power will have to be considered in the reform of local authorities and I will bear what the Deputy has said in mind.  It is a pity that the few counties who have a difficulty with this matter do not take a tighter rein on the problem.  I would like to point out to the Deputy also that her own party is the biggest offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that allowing only three members of a local authority to sign these motions is also unsatisfactory and that the minimum number that should be required before these motions could be placed on the agenda should be between seven and ten?  When I say to the Minister that the meetings of Dublin County Council have become a total farce I hope he believes me because councillors now see fit to put down the fixing of drains etc. by way of section 4.  As these motions take priority on the agenda of the meeting obviously they get discussed first.  At some meetings no other business is conducted.  When I say that 36 such motions were on the agenda for the last three meetings of Dublin County Council the Minister can believe me because I have checked these figures and they took up between 90 per <Col N="43" /> cent and 95 per cent of the time of those meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy's party also suggested in their programme that seven members of a local authority might be required to table such a motion.  It is a pity that the Deputy could not influence other members of her own party as the total number of section 4 motions passed could be greatly reduced if she could, but one way or the other it must always be understood that any person has the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála whether or not planning permission has been granted by way of section 4.  That avenue is always available to individuals, groups or bodies.  In all the circumstances and taking into account the total numbers and percentages I have given, it is not unreasonable to expect that such a provision would continue to be on the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I propose to take these questions together.  At the outset, I would like to say that I know I reflect the views of all Members of this House when I express my horror and condemnation of last Saturday's atrocity.</P>
      <P>Allegations of a leak to the IRA from within the ranks of the Garda Síochána, by those who could have no evidence to support them, are regrettable for several reasons, one of them being that they play directly into the hands of those, like the IRA who would wish to reduce the level of security co-operation between the two police forces.</P>
      <P>It is now public knowledge that the travel arrangements of the late judge and his wife were known to many people and the criticism of the Garda Síochána can be seen by everybody to have been made even more rashly than was apparent at the beginning.</P>
      <P>Nobody, of course, can fully disprove an allegation of this kind unless the people actually responsible are detected. What is quite clear, as I have said, is that the allegations were made without a shred of evidence.  Accordingly the least that can be said about them is that they reflect seriously on the judgment of those who made them.</P>

      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, the Minister did not answer my question to him if he agreed that it was normal and good policing practice that radio silence be maintained while VIPs are being escorted, for security reasons.  I asked the Minister that question because play has been made of the fact that there was radio silence between the car escorting Lord Justice Gibson and his wife and the Garda escort. My understanding is that that is normal practice.  I feel that we owe it to the Garda Síochána that that should be stated quite clearly.  I would ask the Minister to state that it is normal practice that radio <Col N="47" /> silence be maintained in such cases and that the sources that are suggesting that because this took place this could in some way have led to the unfortunate murder of the late Lord Justice Gibson&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Members will be saddened to have learned of the death on Sunday last of former Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, the longest serving Member of the 24th Dáil.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was first elected to this House in 1943 and had an extraordinary record <Col N="283" /> of success in every subsequent General Election up to his retirement at the dissolution of the Dáil in January last.  He was a frontbench spokesman for his party for many years.  He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary on two occasions and served as Minister for Defence in 1976-77.  He was a representative on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe since 1977 and was leader of the Irish delegation during the lifetime of the last Dáil.</P>
    <P>Oliver Flanagan devoted himself to the service of his country and of his constituents in Laois-Offaly throughout his long career in public life.  Even during his recent illness, he attended to his public duties with care and devotion.  He was notable for his old world courtesy, his willingness to listen to people's views and to discuss and try to resolve their problems. He was a very able debater, often entertaining in his contributions, but always thoughtful and well informed.  He was a firm believer in the traditional values of Irish society and in parliamentary democracy as the system of Government best suited to the conduct of public affairs, both here in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the spontaneous standing ovation which he received here during the final sitting of the 24th Dáil in December last.  Despite his serious illness on that occasion, he insisted on being present and spoke cheerfully to Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his wife, Mrs. Mai Flanagan, his son Deputy Charles Flanagan and to all his family our deepest sympathy on their great loss.</P>

It is with a sense of humility, Sir, that I recall that the late Oliver Flanagan was first elected to this House two years before I was born and that he served <Col N="284" /> continuously in this House from then until the recent general election.  A great many tributes have been paid to him for his long and diligent service to his constituents. They are all richly deserved.</P>
      <P>Oliver Flanagan's political career spanned 44 years and a great many controversies. When he took up an issue he threw himself into it body and soul with an energy and determination that few could match.  His dedication to each of the causes that he took up was very amply served by his skills in oratory.  He was a powerful speaker and never left any trace of ambiguity about any aspect of his exposition.</P>
      <P>He was for many years the Father of this House, was always a ready source of advice and guidance to new Members and not at all slow to rebuke any departure by existing Members from the proper traditions of the House.  He was a vigorous upholder of the dignity of this House and of his profession.</P>
      <P>His record includes very distinguished service in the Council of Europe and he brought a great deal of the wisdom and experience of his years there to his activities in this House.  We will all remember the last occasion on which we saw Oliver Flanagan in this House and the very spontaneous expression of affection from all sides of the House for the Father of the House on that occasion.  He bore his illness with a most exemplary fortitude and we are all the poorer for his passing.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

He was an institution that will long be remembered in this House and he will be remembered with great affection for his kindness, his diligence and his dedication.</P>

Flanagan.  For 44 years he served in this House and that leaves a proud record in public life in this country.  He had a proud record both inside and outside this House in going about his tasks on behalf of his constituents and, indeed, on behalf of many from outside the counties of Laois and Offaly who contacted him down through the years.  He was a very big man on the Irish political scene for that long period of time.  His passing is an occasion of sadness to all Members of this House, both young and old.  The measure of esteem in which he was held by the public in his constituency was witnessed in the past few days by the genuine sadness that was very clearly expressed at the removal and funeral of Oliver J. Flanagan.  I wish to convey to his wife and family deepest sympathy on the part of the Labour Party.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

Oliver J. and The Workers' Party were, of course, poles apart on most political issues, but that does not mean that we did not admire the many long years of public service which he devoted to the Dáil and to the people of his constituency, or respect the fierce commitment with which he argued the case for the beliefs he held.  Oliver J. was a courteous man who always had a kind word for people, even his political opponents.  On behalf of my colleagues I extend deepest sympathy to his widow and family, especially to his son, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and to his colleagues and friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill and support its overall provisions which are to control and reduce the very serious air pollution problem that now exists in Ireland, particularly in the main population centres.  Since the Second Stage was moved on 24 March there have been many contributions to the debate highlighting the very serious levels of pollution and the greater health problems which this pollution has given rise to. There has also been much comment in the press in relation to this matter and many scientific and medical reports have been analysed, from which it can reasonably be concluded that people who suffered from respiratory diseases have actually died when air pollution levels have been very high.  In addition a great deal of illness has been caused during the winter months, particularly when certain climatic conditions have obtained.  This matter needs to be tackled urgently and effectively.  While this Bill sets about providing a framework, it lacks some of the <Col N="288" /> punch necessary to have this serious problem resolved quickly and effectively.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have pointed out their concern that this is enabling legislation which will empower local authorities to take certain actions to control air pollution in their areas.  I am worried about the commitment on the part of local authorities to taking required action speedily, due to financial constraints or the low priority they would give to such action.  Some local authorities do not have a good record on environmental pollution generally and I should like the Minister to bring in a Bill directing the local authorities on what action to take to tackle the air pollution problems in their areas.</P>
      <P>The primary reason for urgent legislation in this area is the serious health aspect involved.  The provisions of the Bill should ensure that many of our fine public buildings and monuments are protected from the ravages of pollution.</P>
      <P>My main concern in regard to the Bill is the health of those who live in areas where pollution is very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An article in last Thursday's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> outlined the findings of two doctors and they gave me cause for concern.  Their report was first published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in 1984 and the main point of it was that, due to climatic conditions in Dublin in 1982, elderly people were admitted to St. James's Hospital with cardiac respiratory problems at a higher rate than normal. Many of those patients did not respond to treatment as well as they normally would.  According to the article there were 120 deaths at the hospital in January 1982 compared to an average monthly death rate of 54 and an average January death rate of 64.  Between 14 and 20 January 1982 there were 39 deaths and, significantly, those deaths occurred at a time when high levels of air pollution were recorded in Dublin.  The article clearly showed the effects of the combination of high levels of pollution and the climatic conditions which obtained at that time, a condition known as temperature inversion where a layer of cold air traps hot air and prevents it from <Col N="289" /> rising.  In such conditions smoke particles are retained at a low level and consequently people are affected adversely.</P>
    <P>It would appear that, given our high level of air pollution, we are fortunate that that type of climatic condition does not occur regularly.  Otherwise our annual death rate would be much higher. I understand that the use of coal has increased by 150 per cent in the past 10 years and that has given rise to a huge build up of sulphur dioxide and smoke particles in the built up urban areas such as Ballyfermot in my constituency which contains approximately 6,000 houses.  It is a high density area and there is a high concentration of open fires.  The total smoke load in the Dublin area is 16,000 tonnes and about 80 per cent of that comes from domestic sources.  It is well documented that several of the city's monitoring stations have recorded smoke levels far in excess of EC limits which are 250 microgrammes per cubic metre. Those limits are also accepted by the World Health Organisation as an upper limit which should not be breached.</P>
    <P>Medical opinion is that exposure to smoke levels in excess of those limits gives rise to respiratory problems and can, ultimately, lead to death.  One of the highest levels of smoke ever recorded was in Ballyfermot on 31 January 1987 when the level reached 1,429 microgrammes per cubic metre or five times the daily permitted EC limit.  That statistic has been mentioned by other speakers from that constituency but I do not make any apology for repeating it because action must be taken to ensure that such a level of pollution does not occur in the future. Pollution in that area must be brought under control.  The EC limit, I understand, should not be exceeded on more than seven days in one year and yet between November 1986 and February 1987 the levels in Ballyfermot exceeded that limit on a total of 30 days.  That is very much outside what is acceptable and it further underlines the need for the introduction of legislation that will quickly control what is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of control the big question that arises is that of cost.  The <Col N="290" /> high density urban areas of Dublin are where the less-well off members of our community live and those people, even with the best will in the world, are unable to spend money on alternative fuels.  A change over from an open grate system to a smokeless fuel is expensive and I understand that smokeless fuels cost in the region of 50 per cent more than ordinary bituminous coal.  The whole area of cost and funding is crucial to the success of the measures in the Bill.  I understand that before a local authority designate an area as a special control area, they must satisfy the Minister.  It is at that stage that local authorities can seek assistance from the Department by way of grants to help people convert from open fire grates and assist in the purchase of smokeless fuels. The Minister has discretion in this regard but I fear, given the economic circumstances of the country, the old excuse of money not being available will be trotted out and will result in long delays in bringing in effective controls on air pollution.  My colleague, Deputy Gibbons, touched on that point in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Will the Government make finance available to ensure that householders who cannot afford to comply with conditions in the Bill will be given assistance to purchase smokeless fuels?  I have no doubt that a cost-benefit analysis would confirm that huge savings in public expenditure could be achieved if people got assistance to convert to smokeless fuels. Huge sums of money are spent on health care and a lot of that could be saved if we lived in a pollution-free environment. I suggest to the Minister that he should sanction such an analysis for an area like Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>The Bill is another reminder of the necessity for a comprehensive energy policy.  One of our greatest natural resources is Kinsale gas, an ideal fuel for areas of high density housing in that it does not cause pollution.  The Government should consider distributing natural gas more widely on the domestic market. The inter-relationship between the price of the various energy sources must be <Col N="291" /> examined.  If we could have cheaper electricity by charging the ESB less for the natural gas they consume and if we could have cheaper natural gas by an adjustment in the Government's pricing policy, it could lead to greater use of pollution-free fuels with a consequent major decrease in the unacceptable levels of air pollution, particularly in Dublin city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable agreement in regard to the provisions of the Bill which was originally introduced in the Seanad by the former Minister of State.  Overall I believe that most people agree with the general tenor and direction of the Bill.  It deals with a considerable problem which arises from the use in some areas of very dense housing of a type of fuel, particularly coal which especially in heavy, damp weather has a serious effect in the locality on the level of air pollution.  This can be very serious and cause considerable health hazards for many people.  I imagine that the use of coal is increasing rather than decreasing in this country.  As a nation we should endeavour to exploit and utilise our natural resources such as turf, timber, whatever natural gas there is and whatever electricity we have.  Nevertheless, in a great many of our domestic fires coal is the main fuel.  The problem continues and very little can be done in that respect except to try to assist in any way we can to minimise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous Ministers for the Environment and Ministers for Energy were concerned as I am sure the present Minister is concerned about the problem of air pollution arising from the burning of coal by the ESB at Moneypoint.  A number of local authorities, including that of which I am a member, Offaly County Council, have made an effort to assess the level of air pollution caused by emissions from Moneypoint.  There is an obligation under the provisions of the Bill to try to prevent air pollution.  Some years ago the Canadian Government had an all-party committee of their House of Commons investigate the level of air pollution caused by the burning of coal in <Col N="292" /> their generating stations.  I hope this House will take cognisance of the level of air pollution from Moneypoint because we must ensure that it is kept at a very reasonable, low level.  I understand that for this purpose a type of scrubber should be installed on the stacks at the generating station but the cost of installing these instruments is excessive.  I have heard various estimates from £80 million to £450 million of the cost of providing them for the purpose of curtailing and minimising the level of air pollution. Those are vast sums of money and one can well understand the apprehension felt by any semi-State body faced with a cost of that magnitude.  Perhaps the ESB have been somewhat slow in providing the necessary safeguards in an effort to curtail and diminish the level of pollution from their generating stations.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion I have had of speaking to the Minister since he was appointed to his Ministry.  I wish him every success in that and I extend that wish to his colleague sitting beside him who is from my constituency.  The Minister of State was present at meetings of Offaly County Council on a number of occasions when this matter was discussed. In Canada and throughout western Europe serious problems have arisen for forests, wildlife and vegetation and the ordinary amenities of life have been seriously affected.  The environment there has been damaged and if the necessary safeguards are not provided at Moneypoint then some of the problems Canada and western Europe faced could arise here.  This is European Year of the Environment.  I appeal to the Minister to have discussions with his colleague in the Department of Energy to see what efforts can be made to remedy this very serious problem which instead of diminishing may increase when further generating stations come on-stream.</P>
    <P>The ESB have two such stations working at the moment and they intend to bring further stations into operation.  This will exacerbate the problem.  In Canada a special commission investigated the problem of air pollution.  Western Europe failed to take action on it in time. <Col N="293" /> A genuine effort must be made to minimise the level of air pollution coming from the ESB station at Moneypoint.  On a number of occasions I took this matter up with the ESB.  Right across the midlands there is apprehension about the level of pollution from Moneypoint. There has been a huge investment by successive Governments to develop forestry in the midlands and it is our duty to protect our forests from pollution.  One cannot but be worried when one looks at pictures of and reads about the damage done to forestry by smaller generating stations.  We must take action in time.  As yet only minimal damage has been done but we must build in the necessary safeguards to control or avoid pollution.  To date as far as I can see the ESB have not provided the safeguards.  If we do not remedy the situation the people coming after us will be highly critical of this generation.</P>
    <P>We have radar stations to monitor the weather, the rainfall and so on.  Now we should have stations to monitor air pollution. When concluding I would be glad if the Minister would let us know what amount of control he has over methods of assessing air pollution.  Have we sufficient personnel and monitoring stations to monitor air pollution in different areas?  I know efforts are being made to monitor air pollution in Dublin but what efforts are being made to monitor air pollution in small areas, such as pollution from factories that burn products which give off very heavy stenches?  Many people live in the vicinity of such factories and they ought to be protected from high levels of pollution.  I know we are anxious to attract industry and to create employment but I am anxious that we should be able to monitor pollution levels arising from some factories.  The Minister could allay the fears of many people by giving details of the resources available to him in the control of air pollution.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that if people do not comply with certain requests there is in this Bill a power to have recourse to the courts to make people obey orders made under this Bill.  I welcome this Bill and I <Col N="294" /> am sure most people in the House also welcome it.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputies for their many valuable contributions to this debate.  Preserving and improving our air quality is an important issue for all of us. In this European Year of the Environment it is important that we help spread the message that we are all, through our actions and inaction, responsible for the quality of the environment around us.</P>
      <P>There has been a wide consensus in this debate in support of this Bill.  I thank Deputies for the support which they have promised for action to implement the Bill which is more important still.  In the course of his contribution the Minister of State has already replied to some points raised by Deputies in this debate.  I will recap briefly on some of these but concentrate principally on the remaining points which have been made.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies referred to the Dublin smoke problem.  Deputy Brady spoke about detailed arrangements for controlling smoke pollution in Dublin.  He suggested first an early declaration of intent to have a special control area order in Dublin; this would allow the necessary transitional period for adapting to the order.  Deputy Brady suggested, secondly, a system of smog alerts which would be aligned with the weather forecasting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Declaring a special control area order will be something which, in the first instance, the Dublin local authorities will have to consider.  The Minister for the Environment will have a reserve power to direct an order to be made.  The procedure laid down by Part IV of the Bill requires first a decision by the elected members of a local authority; then, if there are objections, an oral hearing; <Col N="295" /> then confirmation by the Minister; and, finally, a transitional period of at least six months to allow adaptations to be carried out.  The transitional period emphasised by Deputy Brady is fully catered for in the Bill.  We may assume that for practical reasons special control area orders would be introduced on a gradual basis, starting with those areas most affected and then based on that experience extending to other areas as necessary.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Brady's proposal for a system of smog alerts, I accept that, with appropriate investment in new technical equipment, this might be possible. However, I am not clear that this system would be particularly useful or cost effective in Irish circumstances.  As operated in certain continental countries, smog alerts generally relate to pollution from sulphur dioxide rather than smoke. Broadly speaking our problem is with smoke and not with sulphur dioxide.  In addition, smog alerts in continental Europe are nearly always directed to major individual sources of sulphur emissions. Closing these large emitters down for a few days, or requiring them to use lower sulphur fuels, can alleviate sulphur levels fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>Smoke problems in Dublin arise from the hundreds of thousands of houses using open burning fires in an area.  Smog alert system cannot be effective in relation to such dispersed sources.  It makes more sense to direct resources to adapting houses in problem areas so that they emit little or no smoke in the first place.  Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the lack of air pollution monitoring in parts of the north side of Dublin city such as Finglas, Kilbarrack and Coolock.  In the absence of such monitoring he wondered if we can ascertain whether the levels of pollution in these areas are severe.</P>
    <P>Smoke and sulphur dioxide have been measured on a regular basis in Dublin since 1962.  Dublin Corporation decided in 1983 to establish a more systematic monitoring network which would sample industrial, commercial and domestic emissions, or a mixture of these, in different representative areas of the city. <Col N="296" /> Dublin Corporation commissioned Warren Spring Laboratory from the United Kingdom, an internationally recognised authority in this field, to carry out an assessment of the Dublin monitoring network and to make recommendations for its improvement.  The method used by Warren Spring Laboratory was to single out the areas most at risk from air pollution in Dublin in terms of the likelihood of their approaching or exceeding EC limit values.  These then were the areas designated for monitoring stations.  In other words, the system has been designed to exclude the possibility that areas outside of those monitored might be experiencing worse air pollution than their monitored counterparts.  The present network is in line with the Warren Spring Laboratory recommendations.  There is not a need for a proliferation of monitoring stations throughout the city.  The representative quality of the information gathered, rather than its quantity, is what is important.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mac Giolla and Brady also referred to the well known article in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in October 1984 which analysed a possible correlation between the mortality rate in St. James's Hospital and high pollution levels in Dublin in January 1982.  The connection between serious air pollution and excess mortality rates was well established following the extreme London smog of December 1952 when it was found that approximately 4,000 excess deaths had occurred, Air pollution in Dublin has not remotely reached the London levels of that time.  But health studies of the kind mentioned by Deputies clearly are very relevant.  It is fair to say that this subject has not been as widely researched in Ireland as in some other countries.  Until more broadly researched conclusions are available, we cannot quantify definitely the contribution of air pollution to morbidity or excess mortality in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to special control areas a number of Deputies referred to the provision of grants towards the cost of adaptations necessary to meet the requirements involved.  Some Deputies <Col N="297" /> mentioned the use of pricing policy in regard to clearner fuels.  Deputy Gibbons in particular asked if grants would be paid under section 45 and whether such grants could be justified on a cost-benefit ground.</P>
    <P>I should like first to address the question of cost-benefit of smoke controls in Dublin.  The fact is that, in certain areas of Dublin, the EC standards for smoke are being exceeded.  These standards are distilled from research carried out by the World Health Organisation on the effects of levels of pollution on human health. We have not the resources, and there is not the need, to duplicate such well accepted conclusions.  In addition to being legally required under EC law to comply with these standards I believe there will be considerable benefit to public health.</P>
    <P>The question of grants being paid is, of course, a budgetary matter.  In the severe financial constraints facing us I cannot pre-empt such budgetary consideration, particularly as expenditure of this kind will not arise this year. However, it is clear that smokeless zoning in a number of other countries has been accommodated by financial incentives of various kinds.  This Bill provides for a similar possibility.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Barnes and Kitt said that, as a country with a relatively clean environment, we should be to the forefront in implementing EC environment legislation to the benefit of our tourism and agricultural industries.  It is absolutely vital to our future well-being that we maintain our clear and unpolluted image. At the same time, EC standards should be appropriate and cost-effective for our circumstances.  The environmental provisions of the Single European Act will be helpful in this regard.  They provide that in future Community environment policy must have regard to economic circumstances in member states, to different environmental conditions in these States and to the balanced development of the regions.  These are appropriate safeguards for the Irish position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Deputies Quinn and de Valera, in particular, argued that in so far as the Community wishes to impose costly standards of pollution control, it should be prepared to provide financial assistance to countries for whom this might represent an unfair burden.  There has always been some acceptance of this principle.  The European Investment Bank already finances major pollution control projects and, under the draft fourth environmental action programme to be adopted this year, the Regional Fund is also to make funds available to this kind of undertaking.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the research and development programmes which have grant-aided demonstration projects in the air pollution area.  The NBST, who represent Irish interests on the management committee for these programmes, have been active in ensuring that as many Irish projects as possible receive EC aid.  Maximising EC entitlements and improving the flow of grants is a priority of the Government.  We shall be ascertaining whether even more can be done about this in the environment area.</P>
    <P>In connection with Moneypoint many Deputies criticised what they saw as the derogation which the ESB were seeking from the draft EC directive on large combustion plant.  The Minister of State has already made some comments on the position of Moneypoint but I think I should now offer some further clarification of this aspect.  First, the draft directive proposes clean technology or scrubbers for new plant authorised after 1987.  Moneypoint would not be a new plant for the purpose of the draft directive and there would be no direct obligation on the ESB to fit scrubbers to that plant.</P>
    <P>The second part of the EC proposal would require total power plant emissions from member states to be kept within various limits which would be different for each member state.  One possible way &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;possible&rdquo;&mdash; for Ireland to keep within its national limit would be to fit scrubbers at Moneypoint.  But it might also be possible to observe the limit by other <Col N="299" /> methods such as the use of low sulphur fuels which would be much less costly and much more cost-effective.  In any event, the draft directive is still being negotiated so that no definite statement can be made yet about its effects on the ESB.</P>
    <P>Taking into account what I have been saying and the earlier remarks of the Minister of State some response has now been made to most points made by Deputies.  I should like to thank Deputies again for their very thoughtful contributions to this debate.  We shall consider all of the proposals on committee Stage, when amendments will be dealt with carefully.  I look forward to that debate.</P>

      <P>Yes, I do.  It is the one plant which emits pollution, even though not on a very large scale which would cause concern.  It will have to be monitored very closely in that area.  That is why the data base and the base line studies have been undertaken.  The monitoring stations are located in the surrounding areas so that on an on-going basis we will be able to establish precisely the emissions taking place.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In introducing the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, 1986, to this House I am conscious that I am not the first to attempt to update the existing national monuments legislation.  Previous Fianna Fáil administrations had decided that a comprehensive Bill to replace the existing Acts of 1930 and 1954 was needed and such a Bill was, in fact, prepared. It was blocked, however, by a challenge to the constitutionality of the existing legislation.  While this challenge failed, another case has arisen which again inhibits the introduction of a comprehensive Bill.</P>
      <P>In view of the growing concern over the future of our architectural and archaeological heritage and the pressing need for measures to deal with underwater archaeology, the use of metal detectors and inadequate fines for offences under the National Monuments Acts, the Government have decided that this interim measure which is uncontroversial in the main should be proceeded with as quickly as possible.  Since both sides of the House have had a hand in it, I trust that we can deal with it expeditiously.  It has been thoroughly discussed and greatly improved during its passage through the Seanad, and I sincerely commend the former Members of Seanad Éireann for the diligent approach which they adopted to this Bill.  I compliment my immediate predecessor, Deputy Avril Doyle, for her positive responses to the many excellent suggestions made in the Seanad.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Doyle on her appointment to her party's front bench as spokesperson on the Marine.  I also congratulate Deputy Enright on his position as Opposition spokesman in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for the care of monuments by the State commenced in 1869 with the passing of the Irish Church Act. However, it should be recorded that the <Col N="302" /> Kilkenny Archaeological Society, a body which has evolved into the Royal Society of Antiquaries, carried out work before this with very limited resources.  For instance, work was done in 1857, on which £180 was spent at Jerpoint Abbey, and the east window of the Franciscan Friary, Kilkenny, was opened up under the direction of Thomas Drew who gave his services free.  Much other good work was done by this society who were the forerunners of the national monuments branch of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the Irish Church Act of 1869 was to disestablish the Church of Ireland.  Churches still in use, as well as the graveyards adjoining them, were vested in the representative body of the Church of Ireland.  Other graveyards were in most cases handed over to burial boards whose powers were subsequently taken over by the county councils.  It was as a result of this transfer to county councils that the Sligo County Council could claim ownership of the early Christian grave slabs which were stolen last year from the Carrowntemple graveyard.  These were, fortunately, recovered and a successful prosecution brought against the person found in possession of them.  Unfortunately, one of the slabs was damaged and the fine imposed was limited to £50.  This emphasises the need to increase the fines for damage to our monuments to the realistic amounts provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To go back to the history, after the transfer of churches in use to the representative Church body and of graveyards to burial boards, there remained a residue of unused ecclesiastical structures which it was felt were too interesting to be neglected.  The category of national monuments was devised to provide for these and the Commissioners of Public Works were given the job of looking after them, for which a lump sum of £50,000 was set aside out of funds in the hands of the Church Temporalities Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works of these ecclesiastical buildings was subject to a ban on their use as places of worship.  This ban on the <Col N="303" /> use of monuments for religious purposes has remained to this day subject to some exceptions where there has been a tradition of such ceremonies like the annual pattern day at Clonmacnois.</P>
    <P>The Ancient Monuments Protection Act was passed in 1882 and this added a fresh batch of monuments to the care of the commissioners.  This specified, in a schedule, a number of monuments which were not ecclesiastical, the owners of which could if they so wished appoint the board as owners or guardians.  The Act was purely permissive and relied on the good intentions of landowners with what now seems childlike simplicity.  The distinction between ownership and guardianship continues to this day and I understand that about one-third of the monuments in the care of the commissioners are not owned by the State but have been placed by their owners in the guardianship of the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The scheduling of a monument under this Act allowed the board to proceed against anybody except the owner in the event of it being damaged or destroyed, completely ignoring the fact that the owner is the likely person to do damage in the course of developing his property. A classic instance occurred in the early 1900s when the owner of the Hill of Tara was persuaded to allow a band of British Israelites to dig up a large part of the Rath of the Synods in the belief that they would find the Ark of the Covenant buried there and there was nothing the commissioners could do to stop them.</P>
    <P>Between 1882 and 1930 there were two categories of monuments &mdash; national monuments under the 1869 Act and ancient monuments under the 1882 Act.  The funds for ancient monuments were voted by Parliament, while national monuments continued to be maintained out of the lump sum of £50,000 referred to provided by the Church Temporalities Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Act of 1930, which is still the principal statute governing the care of monuments in Ireland, <Col N="304" /> abolished the rather meaningless distinction between ancient monuments and national monuments.  All were henceforth to be called national monuments and to be maintained out of the annual Vote by Parliament.</P>
    <P>A monument was defined as:</P>
    <P>any artificial or partly artificial building, structure, or erection whether above or below the surface of the ground and any cave, stone, or other natural product whether forming part of, or attached to, or not attached to the ground, which has been artificially carved, sculptured or worked upon or which (where it does not form part of the ground) appears to have been purposely put or arranged in position and any prehistoric or ancient tomb, grave or burial deposit, but does not include any building which is for the time being habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes.</P>
    <P>This is a long and cumbersome definition but it has served the test of time fairly well and the only substantial amendment now considered necessary is to expand it to include groups of buildings or structures. The new definition is in section 11 of the Bill.  It will be seen that the definition has no restriction with regard to age so that a monument can be as recent as yesterday.</P>
    <P>Having defined a &ldquo;monument&rdquo;, the 1930 Act went on to define a national monument as:</P>
    <P>a monument or the remains of a monument, the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching thereto.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that a national monument is, therefore a matter of definition.  Only a fraction of national monuments are in State care.  This tends to cause confusion in the public mind.  People often ask the commissioners to declare something to be a national monument but there is no provision for such declaration in the Act. In the final analysis it is a matter for the courts to decide whether a monument <Col N="305" /> is a national monument but, thankfully, they have not been called upon to do so very often.</P>
    <P>An important new provision in the 1930 Act provided for the Minister for Finance to make a preservation order where in his opinion a national monument is in danger of being or actually is being destroyed, injured or removed, or is falling into decay through neglect.  The 1954 Act delegated this power to the commissioners.  To date, some 370 such orders have been made.  One of them was challenged in the Supreme Court but it was decided that the order was valid.</P>
    <P>A preservation order does not permit the commissioners to do works to the monument in question but if they feel that works are necessary they may become guardians of the monument.  This allows them to spend public money on conservation works without interfering with the ownership of the property.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Act of 1954 provided the commissioners with a new power to list monuments.  The effect of listing is to compel the owner to give two months' notice to the board if he intends to demolish, remove or alter the monument. The idea is that the commissioners have two months to consider whether a preservation order should be placed on the monument or to allow some interference with the monument.</P>
    <P>The problem with listing is that if the ownership changes, the vendor has no obligation to inform the purchaser of the existence of the listed monument on the lands, nor is he bound to inform the commissioners of the change of ownership. The Bill before us now rectifies this position by ensuring that a Register of Monuments will be established and that once a monument is entered in the register, it can be registered also on the Land Registry Folio.  In that way the purchaser's attention will be drawn to the existence of the monument before he completes the deal and the purchase.</P>
    <P>This Bill also includes a new category of monument entitled historic monument. This is defined as &ldquo;a prehistoric <Col N="306" /> monument and any monument associated with the commercial, cultural, economic, industrial, military, religious or social history of the place where it is situated or of the country and also includes all monuments in existence before 1700 AD or such later date as the Minister may appoint by regulation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore any monument which existed before 1700 is eligible for inclusion in the register.  Once it is entered in the register it will be an offence for anyone to interfere with it without giving two months notice of his intention and it will also be an offence to be in possession of a metal detector at the monument.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is an important addition to the corpus of legislation for the protection of our heritage and, indeed, it will be seen that it is of great urgency.  Indeed, it could be said that the Bill is long overdue.  The Commissioners of Public Works have been doing their best with the legislation that is available to them, but the existing laws are completely outdated.  In particular, the fines which may be imposed under the present legislation are completely unrealistic in present day terms.  We have read in the papers in the recent past about damage to the Goban Saor's grave at Derrynaflan, County Tipperary and to an Iron Age site at Kilcullen.  The fines in the present legislation are no deterrent to such acts of vandalism.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill could be described as an interim measure, it is a very important interim measure.  It deals with the use or misuse of metal detectors for searching for archaeological objects in an uncompromising manner.  It deals with historic wrecks and, indeed, all archaeological remains found underwater.  It reconstitutes the National Monuments Council on a stronger academic base under the title of the Historic Monuments Council.  It sets up a Register of Historic Monuments with the provision for historic monuments to be registered as burdens on property.  It provides stiff penalties for offences in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill's interim nature may have <Col N="307" /> advantages.  We are dealing with problems and issues which are relatively new and still evolving.  When we face the problem of the damage being done to archaeological sites by treasure hunters, we have to try to decide how far we are to go.  Do we try to control the use of all metal detectors and thus also involve ourselves with the legitimate use of metal detectors for tracing pipes and cables?</P>
    <P>Study of the Bill clearly shows that the emphasis is on the safeguarding of sites of archaeological importance.  We will have to see how that works out in practice. In facing up to the protection of our historic wrecks, we have to provide a framework within which underwater archaeology can develop.  We have to knit together conservation requirements and salvage procedures.  Both may be under strain in this marriage.  Nevertheless, I think that the provision of this Bill will provide a satisfactory code for those involved in this new area.</P>
    <P>The Historic Monuments Council, when appointed, will bring together a wide range of expertise which will add greatly to their influence.  The unity, in diversity, of our culture is stressed in having a representative of Queen's University, Belfast, among the academics in the council.  The Maritime Institute of Ireland will also have a nominee on the council to mark the growing interest in maritime archaeology of which the new body will have to take cognisance.  The staggering of the term of appointment of the first nominees will ensure that the council will never again go out of existence due to the simultaneous lapsing of everybody's term of office as happened in 1980.</P>
    <P>Areas of archaeological importance in urban and rural contexts can be entered in the register.  When an area has been so entered, anybody proposing to carry out development work in the area would have to notify the commissioners.  This is a whole new concept for heritage conservation in this country, but a necessary one if we are to respond appropriately to advances made in archaeological <Col N="308" /> research into patterns of urban and rural settlement.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are availing of the Bill to take powers to acquire land in the vicinity of national monuments required for the provision of visitor facilities.  This is a good omen for it shows that the increased interest of recent years in our monuments has not waned and that a programme of developing visitor facilities has to be pursued. Provision is made for the commissioners and local authorities to make by-laws in respect of any national monument in their care.  By-laws are becoming increasingly necessary at the more popular monuments in order to maintain proper supervision.</P>
    <P>On the opening day of the new Dáil, the Taoiseach indicated that tourism is one of the areas requiring specific and more concentrated governmental attention. Our monuments are an essential element in the tourism package and if more of them are developed to cater for visitors, then more visitors will come. The work that has been done in the past decade has produced a steady increase in visitor numbers.  We must, therefore, facilitate this process by granting the Commissioners of Public Works the powers which they need in order to acquire land for such purposes and to accommodate visitors.</P>
    <P>The commissioners, in arranging for the survey of monuments, frequently engage the services of university or other qualified personnel.  Heretofore, those persons had to depend on the goodwill of landowners to be able to inspect monuments. Henceforth they will have a right of entry when authorised by the commissioners to carry out such inspection.  I am happy to mention that the survey of my own county, Galway, is being carried out by personnel from University College Galway and that the Sites and Monuments Record for the county is due to be produced later this year.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the charging of fees for licences to excavate for archaeological purposes, to use metal detectors for such purposes, to dive on, survey or remove objects from a historic wreck or <Col N="309" /> underwater archaeological site.  Fines for offences under the existing legislation are increased to realistic levels and fines are prescribed for offences under this Bill. During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, the upper limit of fines for more serious offences was raised to £50,000.  Orders, regulations and by-laws under this Act will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The National Monuments Advisory Council which were reconvened in November 1986, have examined the Bill and suggested a number of amendments which were incorporated in the Bill as passed by the Seanad.  The council recently expressed their concern at reports of the accelerated pace of plundering of archaeological sites and in particular they referred to the penalties in the present legislation which they state are no deterrent to would-be plunderers. They urge that the Amendment Bill should be enacted with all possible speed. I share the council's anxiety and as the Bill has been thoroughly examined in the Seanad I look forward to the further contributions of Members of this House, and the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, <i>quam celerimme.</i></P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on his appointment and for his kind remarks about me. I hope that his stay at the Office of Public Works will be as enjoyable and interesting as my short one was.  I say, with slight tongue in cheek, that perhaps his will be longer but I am quite sure that it will be interesting, irrespective of the length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reasonably familiar with the Bill having had the privilege of steering it through the Seanad during the last session. I, like the Minister should like to record my thanks to all the Senators who had such a constructive commitment to the Bill and many of whose amendments I was able to take on board.  If you cast your eye over the Seanad records of the time, you will see that it was agreed by all that it was most useful legislation.  Any area in which we experienced difficulty <Col N="310" /> we managed to tease out and resolve to the satisfaction of all parties and interests involved.</P>
    <P>I, like the Minister, hope that the passage of the Bill through this House will be just as speedy and efficient and I hope we will reach a conclusion with a Bill which will do the job it was intended to do, as we have all been waiting a long time for it.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the House is aware of the importance of our architectural and archaeological heritage and of the need for identifying, protecting and preserving it.  To protect and preserve our heritage, we must first identify it.  There are several aspects about identification which I should like to mention.  There is a clear need for a new and consistent system of classification of buildings or structures and this should be done by a central agency.  The job could perhaps be undertaken by the Department of the Environment, possibly through the agency of An Foras Forbartha, or with a new unit within the Department.  The alternative would be to have it done by the Office of Public Works and this is the course I would support.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works already have an established survey unit dealing with national monuments.  They have developed effective policies and methodologies using the latest computerised equipment and systems and have established an enviable publication record in recent years.  While the survey unit has by tradition concentrated in the main on identifying and recording our archaeological heritage up to the year 1700, the scope of their work could be broadened and extended to cover the architectural heritage which is largely concentrated in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.</P>
    <P>A small start has already been made with the commencement late last year of a pilot survey of vernacular buildings in County Dublin.  The Office of Public Works already have responsibility for assessing buildings of significant interest under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, which allows a tax exemption in <Col N="311" /> respect of all expenditure on the maintenance of such buildings.  These buildings are also exempt from residential property tax.  The very fact that the Office of Public Works have this role is an important part of identification of such buildings.</P>
    <P>Operating through the Office of Public Works would also facilitate the involvement of the National Monuments Advisory Council &mdash; hopefully, shortly to become the Historic Monuments Council with the passing of this legislation &mdash; in advising on criteria for the classification of historic buildings and so they would avoid the necessity to establish a separate Historic Buildings Council as has been suggested by some commentators.  The new council, the NMAC, who were re-established last year include many eminent members in the relevant fields.  I hope this council will be invited to advise the commissioners on setting suitable criteria for a classification or grading system for historic buildings as a working basis for the Office of Public Works survey unit is carrying out surveys and recording the results.</P>
    <P>The survey work could be undertaken partly by the OPW's own in-house staff and partly by contracting the work out as they do at present with the archaeological surveys throughout the country.  I would like to see the Architectural Archive play an important role in any such contract work.  Perhaps, the Minister could explore with the commissioners the feasibility of redeploying some of their architectural staff from other areas, and if the Minister checks his numbers he will see he has a large architectural staff, to undertake the in-house work and set standards for and monitor the work of the outside contractors.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister's approval to adopting the foregoing course in relation to identifying our heritage so that steps can be taken to implement policy as quickly as possible in this area.  Basically, until we identify our heritage, both archaeological and architectural, there is little we can do to protect or preserve it if we do not know what or where it is. <Col N="312" /> The second major task is that once identified we must see what our policies are in relation to the protection of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the document &ldquo;Manifesto for the City&rdquo;, published in January 1987, of the Dublin Crisis Conference.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with this document.  On page 8 it states:</P>
    <P>In European Architectural Heritage Year (1975), the Government signed the Declaration of Amsterdam guaranteeing full support for the preservation of Ireland's archictectural heritage as part of the common heritage of Europe.  Ten years later, Dr. Maurice Craig, the distinguished architectural historian &mdash; who is a very eminent member of the NMAC &mdash; could say that our legislation and funding provision in this area &ldquo;is so farcically inadequate as to be virtually non-existent. In this respect, we are at the bottom of the European league&rdquo;.  Indeed, according to An Taisce estimates, of the mainly Georgian buildings listed for preservation in the 1980 City Development Plan, at least 50 have been subjected to material alteration over the past five or six years.  And of those scheduled for protection, up to 80 have already been demolished or planning permission has been granted for demolition.</P>
    <P>One major problem is that there is, in fact, no statutory basis under the Planning Acts for the listing of buildings; indeed, the procedure is entirely <i>ad hoc</i> because it is not mentioned anywhere in the legislation.  The 1963 Planning Act is remarkably silent on architectural conservation.  It lays down no nationally-consistent system for listing buildings, nor is it mandatory on the planning authorities to draw up any lists and there is also no provision for the designation of conservation areas, where special controls might apply.  Thus, the first priority must be to give listed buildings and conservation areas proper status in law.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse those sentiments as I feel the Minister also does.  Basically, what <Col N="313" /> that document says is that under our Planning Acts there are many and multiple provisions whereby local authorities may, that is the word used in the development plans and Planning Acts generally, do this, that or the other.  Bluntly we are asking the Minister to remove the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; or more correctly to get his colleague in the Department of the Environment to remove the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; where it appears in this legislation and replace it by the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  If we make it mandatory on local authorities to list according to certain classifications, we must identify for them what those classification and grading systems are.  That would be the job of the OPW.</P>
    <P>I recommend that we use the National Monuments Acts and the Planning Acts in a complementary strategy to achieve our objectives.  I suggest that historic buildings be classified by the commissioners in two or more grades according to their importance and that the highest grade could be listed by the commissioners under the present national monuments legislation and later registered in the Register of Historic Monuments under this legislation before us today.  Anyone wishing to interfere with, to alter or demolish a listed or registered monument would be required to give at least two months notice to the commissioners who would then be in a position to give further protection to the monument if they saw fit by way of a preservation order, guardianship order, or by compulsory acquisition or, alternatively, to grant permission subject to such conditions as they thought proper for the alteration or even demolition of the building in certain circumstances. Where a monument is protected by a preservation order, the commissioners are obliged to consult the National Monument Advisory Council before giving consent to its demolition or removal so that there would be further scope for the council's overseeing role in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The other grades of buildings could be left to the Department of the Environment and local authorities to deal with. The Department of the Environment <Col N="314" /> might deem it prudent to retain some controlling function over the second highest grade, leaving it to the local authorities to decide about a third grade in the light of local circumstances and local planning needs.  In any event, planning authorities are required to consult with the National Monuments Advisory Council as a prescribed body in relation to planning applications, so there would be an additional safeguard in this context if this requirement were more strictly enforced in relation to all buildings or sites.</P>
    <P>This would still leave unresolved the unsatisfactory provisions for listing historic buildings under the Planning Acts. This, again, is a matter to which many environmental commentators have alluded.  I see no alternative to amending the Planning Acts in an appropriate manner, perhaps making it mandatory on planning authorities to list all buildings recommended by the Commissioners of Public Works, on a continuous basis as OPW lists would become available, and not just in the context of their development plan which has clearly proved to be an unsatisfactory method of meeting the position.  This area will require more detailed examination and further consideration way beyond the scope of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Crisis Conference referred to the necessity for conservation areas and that they should have a proper status in law.  To some extent in section 11 this Bill deals with this.  I will refer to it later. Indeed, the Minister already alluded to it in relation to the amendment to the definition of a monument.  I must say I am particularly proud of the Government amendment during the passage of this Bill through the Seanad which was responsible for amending the definition of a monument, basically from the singular to the plural to put it in its simplest terms.  This could have far-reaching effects and could be an extremely useful tool when some of our heritage is threatened. I will come back to that shortly.</P>
    <P>Basically, there are four categories under which we can protect our archaeological and architectural heritage.  The <Col N="315" /> first is listing.  This is the lowest and most common level of protection at present. Monuments on the order of the Commissioners of Public Works are listed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  Owners must give the commissioners two months notice of any proposed works affecting a monument. Within this period the commissioners must decide if the proposed work may proceed and subject to what, if any, conditions. If a satisfactory solution is not reached the commissioners may resort to further levels of protection available.  At present, there are 1,653 monuments listed in the country.</P>
    <P>The second level of protection is a preservation order.  Here, the Commissioners of Public Works may make an order in respect of any monument of national importance which is threatened with injury or destruction, or which is falling into decay through neglect.  They may make a permanent order or in the case of a sudden threat where the object is to halt work pending investigation, they may make a temporary preservation order valid for six months.  Both types of order may be revoked at any time.  In fact, this does not happen in practice. There are about 400 national monuments currently protected by preservation orders.</P>
    <P>The third level of protection is guardianship. Owners may place monuments in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works or of a local authority. They retain their ownership but the commissioners or the local authority become responsible for the maintenance of the monument and the admission of the public.  However, in handing over guardianship an owner may, if the public authority concerned agree, retain some control over the admission of the public. Where a preservation order is in force the commissioners may, by order, appoint themselves guardian of the monument and, indeed, undertake its maintenance, although with dwindling resources over recent years that becomes less of an option as time goes by.  There are over 250 monuments in the guardianship of <Col N="316" /> the Commissioners of Public Works at the moment.</P>
    <P>The fourth and most effective method of protection is that of public ownership of our heritage.  Local authorities may own national monuments, in which case they are required to maintain them and open them to the public.  The Commissioners of Public Works may acquire, by agreement or compulsorily, any national monument, including the means of access to it.  There are almost 500 monuments in the ownership of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>With regard to listed monuments, many of these are on lands which have changed hands since listing was first introduced. There has been a tendency for new owners or those inheriting the lands on which these monuments stand to injure or remove them in the course of land clearance operations.  It has become necessary to deal with this problem all the more because it is through the listing process that the monuments identified by the archaeological survey are, in fact, to be protected.  The Register of Historic Monuments should become the central record of all protected monuments. Additionally, there may be entered in this register areas which are designated as archaeological areas and which will enjoy the same level of protection as listed monuments under the Bill before us today.  Every entry in the register will be registered in due course as a burden on registered land.  This will mean that in all transactions affecting land, inheritance or sales, the existence of a protected monument will come to the notice of the new owners who then will not be able to claim ignorance of their existence.</P>
    <P>Preservation orders, both temporary and permanent, have generally worked well.  It is noted that no compensation is payable on the making of a preservation order.  This has been challenged up to Supreme Court level, but the courts have held that a preservation order is in accordance with the Constitution of Ireland which provides that the existence of property rights may be limited by law to the extent required by the common good, a most important ruling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Guardianship has worked well in the past.  Nowadays, however, the proper presentation of monuments to the public generally requires extensive work and facilities and the public authorities are less willing to put their money into a monument which still remains in private hands.  Compulsory purchase remains an option, of course, and was used in the case of the Hill of Tara.  However, it is seldom resorted to.  The existence of the power of compulsory purchase is often sufficient to resolve any acquisition difficulties. The acquisition by public ownership of national monuments to the extent that budgetary conditions alone remains the most satisfactory solution in the case of monuments of outstanding national and, indeed, international importance.  Even during the present recession we have pursued this objective. Negotiations have recently been completed for the purchase of Rathfarnham Castle on the outskirts of Dublin and of the core area in the megalithic cemetery of Cairnmore in County Sligo.  Indeed, the purchase of both of those most important monuments was one of the highlights of my year in the Minister's position of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There are two major deficiencies in our present legislation, inability to deal with damage being done to our archaeological sites by users of metal detectors and the lack of specific provisions for underwater archaeology.  The legislation before us today on Second Stage will deal with these problems.  Under the Bill, it will be an offence to be in possession of a metal detector at the site of a registered monument without having a licence.  It will also be an offence to be in possession of one anywhere else without a licence where the purpose of having it there is to search for archaeological objects.  The first case is clear; the second may not appear to be so clear.  The Bill, however, allows the legal presumption, in the case of the prosecution of an offence involving use of a metal detector, that the device was being used for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects.  This, together with the very stiff fines, will greatly <Col N="318" /> strengthen our hands generally in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally is a very fine response to the problems which have been hitting the headlines recently.  Let me mention just some of these; the finding of the Derrynaflan Chalice by means of a metal detector; the discovery of the Armada wrecks off Stredagh, County Sligo; the illicit removal of valuable stone carvings from Clonmacnoise, Carrowntemple and other sites; the damaging of Bronze Age burials at Kilgowan, County Kildare in the course of gravel extraction; the discovery of Lord Cloncurry's treasure ship, <i>The Aide</i>, off the Wicklow coast; the finding of the eighth century reliquary in the lake near Granard in County Longford and again very recently, the disturbance by a contractor working for the Department of Forestry near Tallaght of a stone circle around a burial cairn.  The list could go on, but I mention just a few.</P>
    <P>When we realise that it is over 50 years since the principal Act came into force and more than 30 years since an amending Act was passed, it is fair to question whether the legislation is now grossly out of date or whether it was so good that it stood the test of time.  The answer perhaps is somewhere between the two.  I hope that this legislation will be as effective for as many years to come.  On two previous occasions Bills of similar content were introduced into Dáil Éireann, the first by Deputy John Bruton in 1978 and then another by Deputy Donnellan in 1980.  Regrettably, as the Minister has alluded to himself, both attempts were resisted on the grounds that comprehensive legislation was in preparation. It would have been better to have allowed the proposals to go through.  That would have spared the nation some of the heartaches of the past eight years.  In any case the comprehensive legislation proved illusory, as important issues concerning the constitutional rights to private property and other matters were coming up before the courts.  Some were resolved; others remain to be resolved.  I mentioned that the Supreme Court has recently ruled that preservation orders <Col N="319" /> are in accordance with our Constitution and that they provide the limiting of private rights by law to the extent required by the common good.  It is not possible today and will not be for quite some time to have a definitive answer which will allow comprehensive legislation to be drafted.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are now discussing does two major things; it updates existing legislation and breaks new ground.  One important area dealt with under section 17 requires updating in the level of fines which can be imposed.  Under the present Acts the maximum fine that can be imposed is £50.  Such an amount is derisory by present day money values.  There is, of course, an imprisonment of up to six months which might accompany or substitute for the fine.  The fine still has a deterrent effect.  Under the new Bill the level of fines will go up to £5,000 for the more serious offences.  The level of fines and penalties is, in the end, a test of our seriousness.  We do not wish to err by excess in this area, but we must show that we mean business when it comes to preserving our heritage.</P>
    <P>I referred in the Seanad to an incident which I will now recall here because it bluntly demonstrates what I mean when I say that the fines must be evidence of our seriousness.  Some months ago a farmer phoned asking what fine he might receive if he destroyed a monument on his land.  He was asking, he explained, because if the amount was right he would go ahead and bulldoze, anyway.  The reply that by law the maximum fine was only £50 could hardly have had the deterrent effect one would have wished for. From now on, once this Bill is passed, if an archaeological object is found and the finder fails to report it or falsely reports it he or she may be fined £5,000 instead of £10.  If he or she excavates in search of archaeological objects without a licence the fine will be £5,000 instead of £25 as heretofore.</P>
    <P>In many other ways this Bill places new challenges before us.  Heritage preservation has been progressing in a more united fashion.  The European countries <Col N="320" /> have been co-ordinating their efforts through the Council of Europe.  I have already mentioned that 1975 was European Architectural Heritage Year.  This called attention to Europe's rich and varied architecture and the unique character of her historic towns which are so fast disappearing through neglect, demolition and intemperate redevelopment. This year sought to sound the alarm and produce action before it was too late.  I hope the success of European Architectural Heritage Year is not to be measured by our progress in this country, although it did generate much interest in Ireland too.  Progress has been lamentable. The year culminated in the Congress on the European Architectural Heritage year held in Amsterdam in October 1975.  This signalled the formal adoption of policies of integrated conservation. The preservation of heritage was to be built into the planning process. How often have we heard it?  Twelve years later we are still talking about it. Local authorities were to be more intimately involved.  There should be citizen participation also.  We took a lively interest in these proceedings and participated in the subsequent drafting of the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe.  Again we were good in theory but slow in practical application.  This convention was signed by the former Minister of State, Mr. Joe Bermingham, at Granada in October 1985.  This Bill will pave the way for bringing it before both Houses of the Oireachtas for ratification.</P>
    <P>The reconstitution of the National Monuments Advisory Council on a wider academic basis and under the new title of the Historic Monuments Council is designed to be a major factor in the implementation of integrated conservation policies.  It is a body which will have to be consulted in regard to all proposals which affect heritage properties. Integrated conservation will be carried a step further by the declaration under this Bill that all pre-1700 A.D. buildings or sites rank as historic monuments and, ergo, qualify for protection.</P>
    <P>This, of course, will not mean that this <Col N="321" /> legislation before us is not also concerned with post-1700 structures.  We should be quite clear about this fact as there has been some confusion and concern in many quarters.  There is nothing in the Bill which precludes the OPW from taking protective action in regard to any post-1700 building.  Indeed, the Minister may, by regulation, advance the date from 1700 whenever he or she may think fit.  The Commissioners already have in their care a small number of post-1700 buildings or national monuments and I need hardly mention that the Commissioners also look after a number of post-1700 buildings which are of archaeological or historic importance and which are in use for State purposes.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new concept of an archaeological area is very important. This would cover in a rural area an extensive site such as an ancient field system. In an urban area it would cover any topographically definable area of archaeological importance and, in particular, areas of original or mediaeval settlement.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us establishes a register of historic monuments.  Entry into this register of a monument or an archaeological area will mean that an owner proposing to do some work to the monument or in its immediate area must give at least two months notice to the Commissioners of Public Works.  This will give time for decision on whether the heritage interest in the site should be recorded by an archaeological excavation, if this has not already been done, and the site then either given legal protection, or whether the owner should be allowed to carry on with his work.</P>
    <P>Monuments in areas entered into the register will also be registered in the Land Registry as burdens affecting the land. This should mean that anyone buying land would know if it has a protective site or monument thereon.  This is a serious attempt to avoid the heartbreak and the problems which can occur where someone buys land for development and finds that his or her plans are halted because a monument or archaeological area of which he or she was not aware is found to exist thereon.  It will not be possible to <Col N="322" /> provide for every situation that may arise.  No matter how good the survey, something unsuspected may still turn up. Ploughing or land clearance could reveal souterrains used for storage in olden times and as places of refuge in days gone by.  Studies of urban buildings may discover features indicating a history going back further than anybody suspected.</P>
    <P>I welcome under section 2 the reasonable control of metal detectors.  We should all be aware of the damage that is being done to archaeological sites by treasure hunters.  Reports have been received from almost every part of the country of sites that have been scarred by their operations.  Coins and other objects providing valuable dating evidence have been removed from their context.  This represents irretrievable loss and it is generally agreed that something must be done about it.  When the Bill was originally published there was an outcry from groups representing the users of metal detectors.  It was said that under the Bill no one could use a metal detector, even in their own back garden, without committing an offence.  Some archaeologists have said that we are not going far enough and that metal detectors should be banned.</P>
    <P>I find the provisions of the Bill adequate and justifiable.  Up to now it would have been necessary to catch an offender redhanded in the act of extracting archaeological objects from the ground to be assured of achieving a successful prosecution.  Now anybody found to have a metal detector at a protected monument or site will be liable to conviction unless he or she can prove his innocence.  At the same time, persons using metal detectors for legitimate purposes such as mineral prospecting and tracing pipes and cables have no need to fear that they will be inconvenienced in any way.  However, treasure hunters using metal detectors may no longer bring them on to protected sites on land or under water without a licence; nor may they use them at archaeological sites, even if they are not yet afforded protection under the National Monuments <Col N="323" /> Act.  If a person armed with a metal detector is found using it at a known archaeological site it will be presumed under this new law that the device was being used to search for archaeological objects and he or she will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Treasure hunting with metal detectors is not, however, being made totally illegal, provided treasure hunters keep away from known archaeological areas and sites and that they are not specifically searching for archaeological objects.  The great problem has been that in the past decade or so one archaeological site after another has been ransacked by the users of metal detectors.  Holes have been dug all over certain sites, such as the Hill of Tara, and we have experienced appalling vandalism.  Groups representing metal detector users insist that their members observe a very strict code and that a few people have been giving them a very bad name.  This is probably true.  While it is not the intention of the Bill, however, to outlaw all use of metal detectors as a hobby, treasure hunting, almost invariably involves a breach of common law.  There is trespass on private property, interference with such property and, possibly theft of property.</P>
    <P>The next major development which the Bill deals with, and which I applaud, is that of underwater archaeology.  The growth in the number of amateur diving clubs has inevitably forced the pace in this area, particularly because of the number of historic wrecks that are being discovered.  This has underlined a particular problem.  On the other hand we have the increasing capacity of sports divers, and others, to discover historic remains preserved underwater whether in lakes, rivers or in the sea.  On the other hand we have not enough archaeologists and conservation facilities to deal with this heritage area.  I should like to salute the work of the Maritime Institute of Ireland, and of the CFT, the underwater diving council, and the diving clubs in co-operating in the preserving and recording of wrecks and artefacts <i>in situ.</i></P>
    <P>The question of the increased capacity <Col N="324" /> to locate objects of historical interest underwater and the limited academic and conservation resources to deal with the discovered material has attracted the attention of the Council of Europe.  The provisions of section 3 are in line generally with the relevant provisions of the draft Convention which has resulted. One of the significant features of the draft European Convention is that it avoids interference with the rights of identifiable owners, the law of salvage and other rules of maritime law as these were considered to be too useful to be set aside.  It was felt that that would leave a vacuum filled with new law which would in turn have to be tested in the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 introduces sufficient controls to ensure that satisfactory recovery and conservation procedures are followed.  It is to be assumed that the Commissioners of Public Works would never issue a licence to conduct salvage operations at the site of an historic wreck unless they were satisfied that the operation would be subject to adequate archaeological supervision.  However, once such an operation has been authorised, the existing machinery of salvage law and the role of the receiver of wrecks under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, would come into operation so that salvage claims and claims to ownership rights could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Discoveries of historic wrecks have provided the motive to bring us to this point in our legislation, from an archaeological point of view, wrecks are but one aspect of the very wide field of underwater archaeology.  Crannogs and other early habitation sites have been preserved intact over many centuries by reason of being underwater.  The section has been so drafted to allow the protection of such sites.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of the Historic Monuments Council which will have a broader academic base than the National Monuments Advisory Council which it replaces.  It is hoped that as a result greater attention will be given to the recommendations of the council. As successor to the NMAC it will be a prescribed authority under the planning <Col N="325" /> regulations for the purposes of referral of planning applications which might affect sites of archaeological or historical interest or buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  It is because of the heavy academic representation on the new council that there is less room to accommodate representatives of local archaeological societies.  I recall the passage of that section in the Seanad when Senators called on me to give representation to 15 or 17 other bodies on that council.  Every call had merit.  At the time we amended the section to include a nominee of the Minister for the Environment but that was the only representative we felt we could take on board.  Many interested groups and organisations would love to be part of the HMAC.  In my view the balance in the Bill is about right but that does not mean that at some stage in the future, having learned from experience, we should not decide to alter the provision. However, given our experience to date it is my view that with the eminent people we have on the HMAC they will do the job we will be demanding of them very effectively.  There is a point at which a committee becomes ineffective by virtue of its membership.  It could become too cumbersome if a big number was involved.  The number chosen in the Bill is about right.</P>
    <P>Those who did not manage to gain representation on the committee, particularly representatives of local archaeological societies, could, perhaps, find their real place on the Historic Monuments Advisory Committees which local authorities are authorised to establish under section 22 of the Principal Act, as amended by section 14.  Very few of the local authorities who have authority to establish such committees have done so. Of those that have been set up the vast majority have not met for more than two years.  Those of us who are members of local authorities should re-invigorate those committees or urge county managers and chairmen of county councils to set them up.  They would play a very useful role in co-ordinating and feeding through information to the HMC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> There is little point in claiming representation on a national body when little effort is made to sort the problem out locally.  A difficulty with the old council was that the term of office of all the members lapsed together so that there was a gap between the lapsing of one council and the appointment of the next. On the last occasion that gap was five years.  That problem has now been overcome under an arrangement whereby half of the members' term of office will lapse after three years and half will continue for six years.  At no time in the future will the terms of office of all members lapse together.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broadening of the definition of a monument from the singular to the plural in section 11 to include groups of buildings.  The Minister referred to that amendment this afternoon and described the original definition of a monument as long and cumbersome. He said it had served the test of time fairly well and that the only substantial amendment now considered necessary was to expand it to include groups of buildings or structures.  I agree with those sentiments.  I hope the usefulness of the amendment will become apparent particularly in regard to our urban heritage and where our streetscapes are threatened.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable appropriate protection to be given to groups of buildings.  The Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe, which was signed by a former Minister, defines the architectural heritage as comprising monuments, groups of buildings and sites.  Monuments and sites, that is archaeological sites, are already covered in the Bill and it is only proper that we should also make provision for groups of buildings.  The effect of the amendment agreed in the Seanad is that groups of buildings may now be listed under the National Monuments Acts and, if the circumstances warrant, be protected by a preservation order or taken into guardianship by the commissioners or by a local authority.</P>
    <P>A preservation order may be made when the commissioners are satisfied that a monument is such that its preservation <Col N="327" /> is a matter of national importance and that it is in danger of being or is actually being destroyed, injured or removed or is falling into decay through neglect.  The making of a guardianship order is a further step which the commissioners may take if necessary.  I am particularly interested in preserving groups of buildings and streetscapes in our cities and towns.  Ones that come to mind immediately are Dublin's Georgian streets and squares and any area of special urban design quality such as Mountjoy Square, Henrietta Street or North Great George's Street.  The Bill will add to the armoury of legislation which may be availed of to protect such streetscapes. The provision may also be used for the protection of groups of rural buildings which are of historic or architectural interest.  We may interpret this amendment under section 11 to be the concept of conservation areas as part of our legislation at last.  I hope we can develop this with the OPW hand in hand with the Department of the Environment and using the Planning Acts to ensure that the threat which now exists to our historic buildings will be removed as speedily as possible.  We have taken the first and, in my view, the most important step forward in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is, as I have said, over ten years since European Architectural Heritage Year.  I hope the success of that year is not to be measured by our progress in this country to date.  This Bill is in its own way a small but important step in the right direction.  It has been said that we have an obsession with the past but that we have not matched this with any commitment to it.  We are now into European Year of the Environment. Next year we celebrate Dublin's millennium. The enacting of this Bill together with the Air Pollution Bill and, it is to be hoped, the ratification by both Houses of the Oireachtas of the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe are the best way we can show our commitment to our <Col N="328" /> rich heritage in this European Year of the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill and I welcome even more warmly the statement by the Minister that he sees it as a very important interim measure.  I take it from that that he sees this as being merely an interim measure and, further, that in so saying he is indicating the intention of the Government to introduce more comprehensive legislation as a matter of urgency.  If he succeeds in doing that I assure him that he will have the very full support of the Progressive Democrats Party.  If he drags his feet he will have the Progressive Democrats Party barking at his heels.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that everything said here this afternoon and everything said during a very interesting debate in the Seanad shows that there is a need for much more comprehensive legislation than what is proposed in the Bill before us this evening.  Each speaker lists the amount of very serious damage which has been done to our national heritage in the course of the years and in so doing each speaker is moving a vote of no confidence in the existing legislation.  That must ring a bell and tell us that we cannot drag our feet in bringing in a comprehensive and proper Bill to replace the Act of 1930, an Act passed long before the arrival of the JCB and the metal detector, the twin scourges of those who seek to preserve all that is best in our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would like to compliment the framers of this Bill, the two people who were far seeing enough to bring it before the upper House, Professor Dooge who is no longer in the Seanad, and I regret that, and Senator Ferris who is back in the new Seanad and very welcome indeed.  Also I pay particular tribute to Deputy Doyle, the former Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, who dealt with the legislation and in doing so displayed a high degree of skill and courage.  She has done great work and she is worthy of the highest praise.  I hope for her sake and for the sake of all of us that this Bill will have a speedy passage through the House and that it <Col N="329" /> will be stitched into the existing legislation and implemented and enforced rigidly.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that this is a very small measure it is significant and it represents a sincere attempt to update and upgrade the existing legislation, the Bill of 1930, amended in 1954.  Therefore, all of us who are well intentioned seek to give it all the support we can and to see that it moves through this House as rapidly as possible and is put into place and enforced very quickly.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the provisions of the Bill.  The better things about the Bill are its proposals to come to terms in some way with the users of metal detectors. The damage these people have done in recent years is very well catalogued and very well known now and I am not going to add to our list of shame.  We all can quote from personal experience in our areas.  As recently as yesterday I was told by somebody from Kinsale, a town very well known for its imaginative and creative conservation programme, that Kinsale UDC recently found themselves in possession of a very ancient Norman castle, the property of the de Courcey family who lived in that region many hundreds of years ago.  When they went to examine their bequest they found the place was picked clean, hacked to the bone by people who use metal detectors. Not one artefact was left; nothing was left except the bare stones.  Everything that was in that castle had been taken away bit by bit by stealth, and taken out of the area, and heaven knows where it is to be found now.  That is a sad and bitter experience and a testimony to how we have failed during many years to protect what we should have valued.  When we examine what we are being told about what those metal detector magnates are doing with their finds that is no surprise.</P>
    <P>I read in the <i>Evening Echo</i> of Monday 13 April that a Mr. Tom Kelly of the National Museum branch of the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants told a meeting in Dublin that treasure hunters could make £250,000 a year from the illegal export trade in Irish artefacts. They can make that kind of money now. <Col N="330" /> We talk about the black economy, but I do not know how we describe that economy. I take it that that is a fact.  I doubt that this gentleman would make such a serious statement unless he had solid evidence to back it up.  This is the size of the problem facing us and this is the extent to which people who use metal detectors have gone.  This is how they turned it into a growth industry.  My great fear is that the provisions of this Bill are not strong enough to curb that kind of activity.  A fine of £1,000 is proposed for people found in possession of metal detectors in or about certain designated areas clearly indicated in this Bill, but if people can make sums as great as £250,000 annually they are not likely to be inhibited by a fine of £1,000.</P>
    <P>Our record of enforcement in this kind of licensed area is very bad.  We need only to point to what has happened to our rivers and the depletion of salmon stocks in our rivers despite the fact that we have a licence system.  Our record of enforcement of this kind is so poor that I have grave fears for the outcome of this section of the Bill.  I fear that the aims and objectives and the good motives of those who framed the Bill, or have brought it so far, will not be met unless we can come up with much more severe measures.</P>
    <P>Things have gone so far now that I favour a total ban on metal detectors. The matter is as serious as that.  However, provision is not made for that in this Bill and since there is no scope for amendments at this Stage of the Bill, let me say that when and if the Bill becomes law I hope this section will be enforced rigidly and will be applied equally not alone to our native people but to holidaymakers who come here from countries where metal detectors are used freely and who are liable to bring their metal detectors with them.</P>
    <P>I hope that once this Bill is enacted we will see to it that its provisions, including the fines for infringements of the Act, will be indicated quite clearly at points of entry so that people entering the country who may be tempted to bring metal detectors with them will know the law of <Col N="331" /> the land and the price they must pay for infringements of the law.  I have grave reservations about this section and I will have more to say on it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with historic wrecks.  This is a timely provision and one of the better sections of the Bill in what it sets out to do.  I take issue with the requirement that a wreck must be 100 years old.  That is unrealistic.  How would a team of divers establish how old a wreck is until they have first carried out excavation work and research.  It is impossible to see how that section can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I would be happier if the requirements of the Bill could be applied to more recent wrecks.  The wreck of the <i>Luisitania</i> for instance must be seen as being of historic value by now and must be seen, in terms of the times we live in, as being of ancient historic value.  Things are moving so quickly in this century.  We only have to look at the Act about which we are speaking to see how hopelessly out of date it has become in 50 years.  That gives some indication as to what 50 years can do to a wreck.  The 100 years cut off point is unhelpful and unrealistic and I will put down an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets up the National Monuments Council.  I take the point made by Deputy Doyle when she said that she had so many submissions from different Senators as to who would best be placed on that council she could not possibly find room for them all.  I realise that this is a problem for any Minister setting up any body of that nature.  People will always claim that other people would perhaps make a better contribution than those nominated to serve on the council. However, I am a little intrigued about the inclusion of the Minister for Communications. It would be better had the Minister for Agriculture been included bearing in mind that most of our historic monuments are found on farming land. We should have a Minister for Agriculture who would have this on his desk as a priority.  The Minister for Agriculture <Col N="332" /> would be a much more useful person on that council than the Minister for Communications. I was not here when this Bill was discussed in the Seanad, and even though I read the debates carefully, I do not know the arguments for the inclusion of the Minister for Communications on this council.  I remain to be convinced about that.  I am open minded about it, but I would be very happy to have the Minister for Agriculture on that council, and, consequently, on the side of implementing this Bill.  There should also be a representative from the National Museum specifically mentioned on that list.  If this Bill is to succeed one of our best allies is the National Museum.  The National Museum have held the fort in fields of conservation since the foundation of this State and I will not be happy until I see such a representative included on this list. I will be tabling an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle talked about the wholly academic face of this Bill.  I agree with her.  I would be happier to see more local involvement although I am not quite sure how that can be achieved without having a committee so large as to be unwieldly. In the meantime I see no merit in preserving these monuments if they are to be just academic acquisitions registered in books held in libraries and museums. These artefacts and monuments should belong to the people at local level.  They should be a sense of great local pride and patriotism and should be the centre from which all sorts of local cultural activities should emerge.  They should be linked in with local art galleries and museums, becoming part of the local cultural centres. Unless this happens there is no merit in what we are setting out to do and there will not be the public will to give us the kind of money we will need to give teeth to this legislation or future legislation until we can involve local people.  I would be happier to see a greater local involvement in the composition of the National Monuments Council.  I know that provision is made for local advisory councils. In some counties they work exceptionally well and in others they do not work at <Col N="333" /> all.  We have to work towards a more consistent response from local people. Deputy Doyle made the valid point that if people are not interested at national level they are not likely to be interested at local level.  In reply to that, people can be made to identify more closely with what is found in their own locality than they can identify with something which is found in a county far away.  There must be better ways of involving people.  This Bill provides us with an opportunity to reach out to people and give them a consciousness of what they have.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (a) says that the chairman of the council shall be appointed from time to time as occasion requires by the Minister from among the members of the council.  That is entirely unsatisfactory. On Committee Stage I will be tabling an amendment to provide for a specific time. A chairman appointed from time to time by the Minister could be there for half a generation until all his freshness and innovation is gone and until the challenge has gone out of the work for him.  There should be a definite time limit on it.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the recommendation that the chairman is to be appointed by the Minister from among the members.  The chairman should be appointed from among the members by the members.  We have had experiences of chairpersons who have proved to be failures appointed to certain State boards.  If this council is to succeed we do not want a failure or a flop at the head of it.  The best judge as to the best chairman will be the people on the council. If the council are to discern what is best in how to conserve, preserve and promote national monuments, they will be equally able to discern who would make the best chairman.  I would be much happier if that section were changed to meet that requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 4 aims to set up the register. That needs to be done in a comprehensive way on a national scale.  It is already being done on a voluntary basis in certain counties.  For instance, it is being done with extreme thoroughness in County Cork, being spear-headed by the Archaeology Department of University College <Col N="334" /> Cork.  Again I read in the same paper that the survey is now almost complete in County Cork and that next year it is hoped to publish the first full inventory of archaeological sites and monuments in Cork city and county.  Therefore this work is already being carried out with great success.  I hope the work of those voluntary people can be embodied in that of the Historic Monuments Council, and, furthermore, that the good work being done will not be duplicated because that would be silly, time-consuming and wasteful in a financial sense.  I hope their work will be incorporated in what is proposed under the provisions of this Bill. Indeed I hope that due recognition will be given to such people who have been carrying out that kind of work for generations.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the Bill.  I see it for what it is.  In fact Deputy Doyle rightly described it as a reaction to what happened in relation to the Derrynaflan Chalice and its awful outcome.  It is a welcome response to that but it must be recognised as a stop-gap measure only. It falls far short of what is now needed if we are serious about preserving our heritage.  It does very little, if anything, by way of stopping or preventing this frightful marauding, pillaging, plundering and selling that takes place under the guise of treasure trove.  &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; my foot &mdash; I can think of much less polite words to use.  The word &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; would suggest to most of us something for which one has some respect so that one would treasure or protect it.  What is happening under the guise of treasure trove in this country is frightening.  It is frightening when items turn up in auction rooms in London and so on, when stones are being taken from places like Clonmacnoise and Carrowntemple, sometimes by people who should know better.  It is appalling to see what is being done.  We all know what is going on, look on and shake our heads.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill that will stop that practice.  There is need for a much more comprehensive Bill.  There is nothing in the provisions of this Bill to stop the taking of grave slabs, headstones <Col N="335" /> and so on.  There is nothing in its provisions that will combat the illegal export of antiquities.  That is perhaps its biggest flaw.  I take the Minister at his word when he says this is an interim measure only.  I take it that it is his intention to correct the position as soon as possible.  We should not allow a constitutional fiasco to come between us and the introduction of comprehensive legislation in this area. We are able to deal with the Constitution at other times when it suits us, when we want to do so.  Let us have the courage to do so now.  If there is need for a constitutional change in relation to private property, and its rights as opposed to other rights, then let us face up to it. Other countries did so years ago and to great effect.  Why should we be afraid to do so?  As of now we have an extremely narrow definition of what constitutes our heritage.  We had a sad experience of this not more than two weeks ago in my own city of Cork.  A certain very distinguished scholar in the course of the current controversial debate about Fota Island &mdash; where there are beautiful parklands, woodlands, the most precious and rare trees, most of them more than 200 years old, an exquisite arboretum, the likes of which there is not anywhere else in the country, and Italian gardens &mdash; was asked about the effect that a proposed sale would have on this, our heritage and his response was &mdash; it was quoted publicly &mdash; what heritage?  He did not see that as being part of our heritage.  If he did not see that as being a part of our heritage can we blame those who go around with metal detectors, or those who go around daubing things?</P>
    <P>There is a grave need for us to define what constitutes our heritage and to have that definition stitched into the provisions of a comprehensive Bill which will set out to protect it, the kind of Bill that will be underwritten by positive education programmes at every level.  There is little point in preserving such things unless everybody can identify with them and appreciate them, which will come only from such good educational programmes at every level.  Unfortunately appreciation of our physical environment has <Col N="336" /> been sadly neglected in our educational system over the years.  We must seek to correct that omission.  Unless we do so, this Bill will be superficial only and its provisions will not find a place in the hearts of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>It is my first time to speak in this new Dáil.  I hope that at some stage in the lifetime of this 25th Dáil we will have passed a comprehensive Bill to protect our heritage to be handed on as the natural birthright of the next generation.  As a nation we must not allow ourselves to be so overwhelmed by our political problems as they relate to Northern Ireland, so overwhelmed by our economic problems with regard to our balance of payments, day-to-day running costs or borrowing, we must not allow ourselves to be so overwhelmed by those problems, serious though they are, as to neglect this very vital task that we, as legislators, should face up to.  If we do this we will earn the respect of the next generation.  If we fail to do so, then we cannot rightly claim their respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House I will be brief.  May I first congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well in his responsible post in the Office of Public Works?  Probably it is the oldest office of State within the country still extant.  To that extent he occupies an historical seat of office.  I might also congratulate Deputy Quill on her first speech in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a limited Bill which the Labour Party propose to support fully because we recognise the basis on which it was prepared and the urgency of the implementation of its provisions.  As a socialist party we find it gratifying, in fact satisfactory, that the House in general should recognise that there are certain aspects of private property, owned by individual citizens in this State whose rights and responsibilities extend beyond the benefits which those individuals themselves enjoy, to a greater common good.  The property in question, by virtue of its historical, social, cultural or religious historical background forms an integral part of our cultural heritage and <Col N="337" /> so, in part, belongs to all of us.  The recognition implicit in the responsibilities of property ownership and the collective and shared ownership of aspects of some private property &mdash; because there is a part of every one of us embodied in that property &mdash; is something that is essential to a definition of what constitutes the physical attributes of a nation's heritage.</P>
    <P>In regard to solving the problem of the desecration, thieving and robbery carried on with the aid of metal detectors, until such time as we can get the legitimate balance right in our Constitution between public and private property, between the legitimate rights of the individual citizen on the one hand and the legitimate rights of the nation to own its heritage in so far as it manifests itself in property, the OPW will continually be faced with legislation. I suspect half a dozen Bills have gone as far as the Attorney General's office only to be stalled on difficulties relating to the constitutionality of interpreting where the dividing line comes with regard to property and where the guillotine comes in regard to compensation.</P>
    <P>There was a question on today's Order Paper to the Minister for the Environment from Deputy David Andrews in relation to an on-going case in Dún Laoghaire about a compensation case in relation to planning.  This is the very core of this problem.  I raise that point with the Minister at the outset of his career in the Office of Public Works.  If he does nothing else but bring this issue to the Cabinet table in the context of whatever constitutional discussions may arise he will have ensured for all future generations a correct balance in regard to the rights of property as owned by the individual and the rights of property as forming an integral part of the heritage of the nation.</P>
    <P>I would not go as far as to say, as Deputy Quill said, that we need an elaborate programme of interpretation and education.  If we can afford such a programme that is fine and I would certainly underwrite it but one thing we should do is ensure that no further damage takes place.  We should preserve intact for future generations who will perhaps have <Col N="338" /> less constraints upon their resources, the luxury and the benefit of exploring and extolling their heritage.  That is the general point I wish to make and obviously it could be extended in a self-fulfilling way.  A legal question mark hangs over the whole area of national monuments, as no doubt the Minister and his officials are well aware.  I suggest the Minister should send a memorandum to his Government colleagues pointing out the impasse that exists.  I suspect he will find many sympathetic ears in the Custom House and in every local authority.  As a former member of a local authority &mdash; perhaps he is still a Member &mdash; the Minister is acutely aware of the retort of the county manager at the end of a long debate in a county council that &ldquo;we cannot afford the compensation&rdquo;.  We will never be able to afford the compensation until we get that balance right.</P>
    <P>To turn to the Bill, the restriction on the detection devices and on the sites of historic wrecks are about as extensive and as draconian &mdash; with due respect, I take issue with Deputy Quill in this regard &mdash; as is required.  The presumption that having a metal detector beside an ancient monument site without a licence is one of guilt is probably pushing out the boat in terms of legality.  I fully support it. Such an instrument would hardly be there for the purposes of health or exercise. The fines that have been written into this Bill are very extensive.  Deputy Avril Doyle who had a big hand in framing this legislation referred to fines of £5,000 but that was amended in the Seanad.  As the Minister stated in his speech and as stated in the Bill there are fines of up to £50,000. It would be hard to find such fines for offences of this kind in any other domestic legislation.  There is a substantial deterrent to prevent the kind of destruction that could come about.</P>
    <P>We support the way the Minister handled the question of detectors, historic sites and land in the adjacent areas of historic sites.  In relation to the compulsory powers of acquisition which the Minister can exercise with regard to adjoining lands necessary for access to a <Col N="339" /> monument, the same problems of compensation and value arise.  It is all contained in the Valuations Act, 1919.  The broadening powers are very good ones and the Minister is right to take on those powers.</P>
    <P>In section 11 the change of the definition of a monument is most significant and I warmly and strongly support it.  It is, however, fraught with difficulties.  Let us consider what was stated earlier today in the context of urban renewal, a pilot scheme which is about to be embarked upon by the National Building Agency in the town of Wexford.  If for very good and proper historic reasons, going back to the 1798 rebellion of which Wexford city has a very rich history, you were to designate parts of the streetscape of Wexford city as a national monument for the purposes of definition under section 11, it should be dealt with in a manner that ensures it does not end up with enormous claims for compensation.  Otherwise there will be difficulties.  While I welcome very much the broadening of the concept of a group of buildings to be included under the designation of a national monument, if the question of compensation is not in time resolved it will pose difficulties.  As a former member of a local authority, the Minister is no doubt well aware of some of those difficulties.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the changing of the name of the National Monuments Advisory Council to that of the Historic Monuments Council.  The balance of representation that has been formally listed in section 4 is probably right.  I have some concern about the number of academics that will be on that council but having included one university I presume all the others had to be included for fear of giving offence.  I particularly welcome the inclusion of Queens University. There is great force in the argument put forward about not specifically listing any other body.  When the Minister decides on the appointment of the five other members he should take soundings unofficially with various groups in the area. To take the institute to which I belong <Col N="340" /> which is listed, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, I suggest, and there are various ways in which this can be done, that we do not want just any member of that institute to be appointed. The person appointed must have a particular skill, interest or contribution to make.  There are various ways in which that can be signalled.  Informal discussion between the appointing Minister, presumably the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, and the institute in question would ensure that not just the nominating bodies are represented in a collective and corporate sense but that the individuals who represent them also have a particular skill.  When appointing the other five members the Minister should look at the range of skills of the nominees from the various representative bodies and try to balance them out.  For example, the Irish Architectural Archive in the context of architectural monuments are a more qualified body than the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  There should be some consultation between those two bodies but that is a matter for the Minister. Perhaps we will discuss it further at a later stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill had a very extensive hearing in the Seanad.  I do not propose to give it any further airing at this stage.  I understand Deputy Kemmy wishes to speak. Am I right in assuming Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow, subject to agreement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

In a legislative sense, a great deal of constructive work was done on a bipartisan basis in the last Seanad and we should build on that work.</P>

      <P>This has been a very civilised debate and it would be a pity to introduce a squabbling note at this late hour.  I thank Deputy Brady.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in his new office.  He has been given a very important ministry and judging by his address here today, he has a lot to contribute. He has made a very good start as can be seen from the content of his remarks today.  He has an important role to play not only in relation to the Government but also in relation to the country as a whole.  He has a many sided role involving education and increasing public awareness and consciousness in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the enlightened content of his remarks today.  It was a very clear and honest statement on the position of national monuments in society today.  Unfortunately, all too often we ignore our monuments, and at best take them for granted.  Let us hope the Minister's address today will herald a new awareness of and a new era for our national monuments.  Not only should <Col N="342" /> copies of his address and the Bill be made available to all local authorities, but I would like to see them made available as soon as possible to all schools, colleges and the media generally.  The Minister has put a lot of time, effort and study into his address and it should not be filed away in a pigeon hole and forgotten for all time.</P>
    <P>I would like to see him take a step further and visit as many local authorities as possible and bring home to them their duties and obligations to their local monuments and heighten their awareness of the importance of these monuments. As I said, copies of his address should be made available to all.  It should be used as a catalyst to spark off a national debate on the importance and role of national monuments in our society.  I hope the Minister will address himself to that later.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the role of the local authorities in the preservation and presentation of our national monuments.  I would like to have seen a greater role given to the National Monuments Advisory Committee in this Bill and in the Minister's address.  I would also like to see greater co-operation between the national monuments advisory councils and local advisory committees of local authorities.  That too has been omitted from the Bill and from the Minister's address.  Sadly much has been lost and many fine monuments have been destroyed and demolished.  The Minister mentioned the damage done by a band of British Israelites who dug up a large part of the Hill of Tara in the early nineteen hundreds in search of the Ark of the Covenant, but we do not have to look to the British to find vandals who have disfigured, destroyed and demolished our monuments in the past 65 years.  We have enough vandals in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, apart from a few flaws, this is a good Bill, but it is not good enough for the Minister to just bring the Bill before the House.  He must monitor it in a determined and continuous way. He must also monitor his own office, the Office of Public Works, and their internal policies and operations.  The Minister should not take for granted everything <Col N="343" /> the board tell him.  He should use his own intelligence, judgment and experience, examining and analysing everything put before him by that board.  In particular he should look at how they maintain their own property.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the board have a lot to answer for, and I will give one example. The Custom House in Limerick is one of the finest buildings, public or private, in the city of Limerick.  However, the board have failed to maintain it in good condition over the years.  Most of the remedial work carried out by the board has been crude and incongruous.  They have plaster concrete blocks cheek by jowl with magnificent stonework and stone carvings.  In this connection let me say some words of praise for the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Avril Doyle. She travelled to Limerick to see the Custom House and initiated innovation works which will do much to improve and show off that building.</P>
    <P>May I also express my gratitude to Deputy Doyle and the previous Government for the practical assistance they have given to Limerick City Trust?  The Government gave them £100,000 to help them to renovate the Limerick Potato Market as a civic amenity and a tourist attraction.  The trust are now engaged in the completion of this project and I hope the Minister will come to the city to see the work being carried out.  I invite him to come as soon as possible because he will see what can be done to preserve and renovate a historic monument.  I also hope he will continue the work of his predecessor and provide financial help for the trust to finalise this project.</P>
    <P>The city of Kilkenny is a fine example of what can be done to preserve and maintain buildings.  Other cities and towns can learn much from what has been achieved there.  Those of us who travel there can learn a great deal from seeing how the city is maintaining, preserving and in many cases restoring buildings and shop fronts.  This is an example for other towns and cities.  It shows how one can undo the harm of unhappy planning and <Col N="344" /> building decisions given by planning authorities.</P>
    <P>May I also mention the work of the Cork County Council who have provided an advice clinic in Clonakilty, County Cork, to enable citizens, builders, architects and developers to get the best possible advice free of charge before they seek planning and building permission? This is something other local authorities could learn from.</P>
    <P>I wish to commend the Maritime Institute of Ireland and Dr. John de Courcey Ireland on their pioneering work in maritime archaeology and the salvaging of many valuable artefacts.  In his address the Minister linked national monuments with tourism.  There is nothing wrong with that.  That is a valid and proper link.  It is a cliché to say we have a rich and priceless heritage in our monuments, but in this case it happens to be true.  Sometimes clichés can be true. Let us preserve and appreciate our heritage. I welcome the Register of the National Monuments.  It is a most valuable and important development.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Bill updates and improves all previous legislation in this field.  As chairman of a local national monuments advisory committee, and as a journeyman stonemason, I welcome this Bill.</P>

    <P>The Bill is a contribution towards what needs to be done but it falls short in some aspects of creating an awareness of our heritage.  Our national heritage is under siege at present and all the peripheral talk about it does not take from the fact that on a day to day basis our national treasures are being looted and sold <Col N="345" /> abroad.  It is akin to what happened in Greece where the Elgin Marbles were taken away and sold in England.  It is of such national importance that we must take major steps involving other agencies rather than hoping that perhaps fines will deter people from abusing the national heritage.</P>
    <P>I will suggest practical ways whereby we can create awareness in this regard. We have had a huge success in urbanised areas by the establishment of the neighbourhood watch scheme.  It has worked very well and crime, burglary and vandalism have dropped by as much as 70 per cent in certain areas.  The scheme was fuelled by a need among local communities and this could be applied directly to a community watch scheme in relation to our national monuments which would be a most effective way of preventing, or at least discouraging, the desecration of national monuments by those wielding metal detectors in search of buried treasure or carrying implements for the removal of carved stone slabs. Anything of that nature could be guarded by a community watch scheme.  There is no reason for community watch schemes not being formed to watch over our national monuments.  Admittedly, many of the sites of ancient and mediaeval monasteries, tumuli, dolmens, castles, etc., are in remote areas not easily kept under surveillance.  Equally, predators carrying metal detectors, crowbars and shovels in isolated areas are easily seen and detected by local people.  The fact that communities in surrounding areas are known to have banded together in the interests of protecting the local heritage will, on many occasions, act as a direct deterrent.</P>
    <P>Local historical societies, secondary schools, Macra na Féirme, the GAA, tourist associations, the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides could supply voluntary members to act as watchdogs and to report the despoilers to the Garda.  That is what is needed and would be one way of combating the current wave of treasure hunting and so on.  We need a greater interest in and appreciation of our historic sites.  When criminals are at large <Col N="346" /> they must be matched by a system of community watch in conjunction with the local gardaí.  It would be an ideal opportunity to set this in train, in tandem with the registers of archaeological treasure from each county and to involve local people at that level.</P>
    <P>I should like also to suggest to the Minister that he should use his good office, in conjunction with the Minister for Education, to bring archaeology as a subject directly into the school.  Unfortunately, heretofore, subjects like archaeology and the study of our national heritage and culture were purely for the academics, it was way beyond the thinking of the people who perhaps, <i>en masse,</i> should be enjoying these great treasures. The time is now ripe to bring the subject into schools and to teach an appreciation at secondary level of education.  Indeed, even at primary level, it should be inculcated in the minds of young people that it is their heritage and that it belongs to them, which might avoid the protests and confrontations which build up when an ancient monument is desecrated or interfered with.  The most poignant example for me, as a Dubliner, was the Wood Quay saga which, looking back, should never have happened.</P>
    <P>The third suggestion I should like to make to the Minister is that he should use his good office to recommend the appointment of professional archaeologists. In the capital city of Dublin there is no city archaeologist although the city is rich in treasure dating from preViking, Viking and mediaeval up to the present day.  It is a national disgrace that a nation like Ireland can fall down in regard to such an appointment, it is bewildering to say the least.  When treasure is found nobody knows where to go.  Most people go to a museum hoping to get an encapsulated view on their find.  With the amount of redevelopment taking place in Dublin at present and the breaking down of streetscapes and monuments, it is an insult not to have ongoing consultations with an archaeologist working with the local authority.  The thousands of people who went to Wood Quay to protest in vain against the buildings on that site and <Col N="347" /> its destruction will always remember it. However, it could have been avoided if professional people had been dealing with the subject and if we had not been surrounded by enthusiastic amateurs engulfed in a bureaucratic tangle.</P>
    <P>Another point is that a proper reward should be paid to people who find treasure. I am totally opposed to metal detectors but finds are not always made by this method.  Happily a lot of our treasure was found in the last century before sophisticated ploughing techniques, bulldozers and JCBs were invented.  It was almost a piecemeal type of investigation but now treasure is being found all the time and a proper award should be paid. Many counties are well known for their treasures, the Derrynaflan Chalice proved that, but there is a lot more to be discovered.  A person could unearth a small hoard of coins, ring money, fibulae or gold collars but, generally, people do not go to the museum to declare that they have found items of this nature. They have got too greedy, perhaps because a proper reward is not paid.  Precious metal is committed to the crucible for melting and is permanently lost to the nation.  That has happened time and time again, there are many examples of our treasures having been exported, never to be seen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the first 25 <Col N="348" /> minutes and my colleague the remaining 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann annul the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1987, Health Services (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations 1987, Health Services (In-Patient Charges) Regulations 1987; Numbers 114, 115 and 116 of 1987.</P>
      <P>I want to give notice to the House also that the Labour Party will be rejecting all the amendments circularised to our motion.  We feel that the issues are clearcut and straightforward and that the Members on all sides of the House will have to decide when it comes to the vote where exactly they stand on these issues and whether they wish to have these charges imposed.  We take a jaundiced view of the amendment circulated in the name of the Minister for Health which talks of the provision by the VHI of a special scheme to cover the charges.  We understand that the charges are to be imposed as and from next month.  It is highly unlikely that the scheme the Minister refers to in his amendment could be in force by the time the charges take effect.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Health who was then Opposition spokesman on Health rose to speak in this House on 16 October 1984 his concern was that the state of the health service was in jeopardy.  His proposition was that the health service was being run down and in the course of an impassioned speech in this House he said, and I quote from the Official Report, column 2502.</P>
      <P>If we go any lower in our spending on health services, then we must ask what level of care we want to provide for the people.  Do we want to provide an acceptable level of care?...  I have no doubt that as a result of the Government's policies lives will be lost if we continue on the downward spiral...</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will dismantle the health services that have taken many years and much <Col N="349" /> hard work to build &mdash; health services, I might add, which we can be justly proud of.</P>
    <P>There is an irony in the fact that we are here tonight to try to undo some of the damage which this same man, now Minister for Health, who so recently saw himself as the defender of the health services, has done to those services in the very short period he has been in office. The irony lies in the fact that to many people around the country, including a large number who work in the health services or, indeed, the majority who work in the health services, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Government who had purported while in Opposition to be the staunch defenders of the health services for the last year are guilty of gross hyprocisy in pretending that they would be the ones when returned to office who would look after those who were ill.</P>
    <P>The messages of the billboard posters, some of which still stand around the country, were that the previous Government's policy would hurt the weakest in our community, that health cuts hurt the weak and the elderly.  Those same individuals who paid for those particular pieces of propaganda now propose to continue on the path of dismantling the health services. The attack which has been mounted on the hospitals and other health agencies during the past couple of months has been without parallel in its ferocity.  Every day details are becoming available of more lay offs, more essential vacancies which cannot be filled and more projects which cannot be proceeded with. It all adds up to a deterioration in the health care available to our young people which forces those of us involved to speculate that Deputy O'Hanlon was right in his predictions of three years ago. If this goes on, lives indeed will be lost but it is the Minister who will have to accept responsibility for any tragedies which may occur.</P>
    <P>Not content with bringing about a situation which threatens to produce chaos in the service the Government propose also to charge all but the very poorest members of our community for access to <Col N="350" /> a service which has for many years been free at the point of delivery.  The three regulations to which this motion refers were published on 14 April last.  They are the concrete expression of decisions taken and announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  When they are put together they add up to an outright and vicious attack on a fundamental principle. That principle has underpinned the health services for a generation.  It has provided a basic bottom line guarantee to those who are ill or infirm, to the parents of small children, to the aged and to those who sought the assistance and support of the State in times of great distress.  It is the principle that health care should be free at the point of delivery for those in need.  That principle which informed Fianna Fáil philosophy as well as the philosophies of other political parties will die if these regulations are allowed to take effect.</P>
    <P>The first of these three regulations seeks to limit the number of people entitled to free outpatient services to children with a limited range of severe conditions. Those conditions are set out in the regulations &mdash; mental handicap, mental illness, PKU, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy.  Children who suffer from these conditions are exempt from the proposed outpatient charge, so are the children under six weeks and children referred to outpatient services following a school medical examination.</P>
    <P>In the case of every other child from the age of six weeks until the time that that child becomes an adult there will be a £10 charge each time the outpatient services of a hospital are needed and availed of.  The list of conditions which would exempt a child is so limited that it does not include a whole range of serious illnesses which require frequent references to hospital outpatient services.  Asthma is not mentioned, though it is one of the commonest complaints among children. I come from a county which has an extraordinary high prevalence of asthma. Indeed, there have been cases of young children dying of this condition.  Neither is there any exemption in the case of <Col N="351" /> congenital heart defects or of a range of physical disabilities and handicaps.  These are but some examples of the list of complaints which are not included and which will have to be paid for.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, of even more importance is the fact that where children are concerned the vast majority of cases requiring outpatient services are cases involving accidents.  The number of children taken to hospital for stitches or X-rays as a result of accidents greatly outweighs the number of all other cases.  So far as the imposition of the £10 charge is concerned, it costs relatively little to exempt the categories I have outlined.  It enables the Government to paint a veneer of compassion over what is actually an exercise in vandalising the health of ordinary people.  That is all it is &mdash; a veneer.  No doubt great play will be made in this debate of the categories exempted from the charge.  We will be told about the people who will not have to pay, but the stated intention of the Government is to raise almost £7 million through this charge this year.  This means that almost 700,000 people visiting a hospital will have to pay, or three out of every four non-medical card holders will be asked for £10 in return for a basic service which has become established as a right over many years.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned children in particular because the first regulation covered by this motion deals with exempted children. The second regulation, number 115, specifies the charge of £10 and again sets out a small number of exemptions. The purpose of these exemptions is to provide a cover for the charge itself. Nowhere is it mentioned in the regulations that people who are of limited means will be exempt from this charge. Only those who are so fundamentally in need as to require a medical card will be exempt.  The third regulation will have the effect of introducing a charge of £10 per day for inpatient services up to a maximum of £100 over a 12-month period.  That maximum, I would emphasise, is £100 per patient, not per family, and the charge applies irrespective of <Col N="352" /> income.  Again there are a small number of exemptions.  I must remind the House that the budget target is such that this charge will have to be levied 600,000 times in the remainder of this year.  It is hard to see that many people will be exempt.  The great bulk of people will have to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading the local papers throughout the nation last week will have seen the litany of concern and cries of despair in response to the announcement of these charges and levies.  They will affect in the most wounding way citizens up and down the country and the front pages of local papers testify in great detail to the extent to which the medical profession in the first instance realise how these irresponsible charges will bite, hurt and wound.</P>
    <P>Taken all together, I would classify these charges as immoral and no amount of exemptions or exceptions will make them moral.  They are a crude and vicious instrument whose only effect will be to undermine the standard of health care. If they are applied as rigorously as the Government say they must be and if the financial targets associated with them are to be achieved as the Government say they must, they will cause untold suffering and hardship up and down the nation.</P>
    <P>There will be even worse effects.  It is all too easy to envisage situations where necessary treatments will be foregone because of the fear of these charges, where children will simply not get the X-rays, where old people will try to nurse themselves at home rather than face the humiliation of going to a hospital with an empty purse.  I have already met people who are in terror of the prospect of facing an illness and simply not having the means to cover the charge proposed by the Minister.  I know and every Member of this House knows that hospitals will not turn away people because they have no money with them.  I have total confidence in the ethics and standards of our medical profession, but I know that people have their pride even when they have little else and that there are many situations where they would simply be <Col N="353" /> unwilling to expose themselves to the fear of humiliation which these charges would visit upon them.</P>
    <P>The health services are supposed to be there as a guarantee to people, a fallback in cases which are often very traumatic in themselves.  They are the caring services, the human services to which people turn in the most vulnerable period of their lives.  To introduce a further element of trauma on top of the original difficulties will have the effect of undermining this basic guarantee, this fundamental principle to which I have referred and will ultimately render it meaningless.</P>
    <P>There is yet another reason why these charges are immoral.  Let us consider, for instance, the case of a high income earner on the top tax rate.  If anyone falling into this category chooses to take out the top VHI plan to cover, perhaps, an extended stay in one of our private nursing homes or medical centres such as the Blackrock Clinic, this State, which is so hard pressed for money, will subsidise that patient's stay by giving him full tax relief on his VHI policy.  How is it defensible that the State can be so generous where the health of the well off is concerned and yet will make the poor pay for a basic service? How can there be morality when we turn the screws on those who can least afford to pay while those who are much better off are actually subsidised to choose private medicine?  They are subsidised to avail themselves of care which is not available to the weakest and poorest in the community.</P>
    <P>Consider another example.  We often talk in this House and elsewhere about a free health service but the health service is only free for some.  For the great majority of PAYE workers who pay social insurance, the health service is already well paid for.  They are paying for it on a weekly basis.  Those who have paid week after week through their taxes and insurance contributions are paying for the assurance that the service will be there when it is needed.  They have paid for years in the confident expectation that, if they or their spouse or children become ill, the service will be there to take care of them, without imposing upon them a <Col N="354" /> burden which at that crisis point they would be unable to carry.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, those in the community who do not pay &mdash; the outstanding millions in farmers' health contributions are testimony enough to that.  The thousands of workers who pay their way are entitled to feel now that there is little point in continuing to pay for an assurance that the health service will be there when it is needed and free at the point of delivery because that will no longer be true if these regulations are put into effect.</P>
    <P>Is there nowhere else we could look for the money to meet the difficulties we face as a nation?  Must we as a people, as a community, seek to solve our financial problems at the expense of the sick? Surely we cannot justify such drastic measures as being necessary when at the same time, in the same Budget Statement, we can abolish the land tax and make no effort to raise capital taxation? What sort of mentality recognises a problem and seeks to solve it on the backs of the weakest?</P>
    <P>We are well on the road now to establishing private medicine where you pay for what you get, where if you can afford it you will get the best and on a gradualist basis if you cannot afford it, it is going to be tough.  There are many countries &mdash; I cite Canada as one, which can hardly be classified as a socialist country &mdash; where such an attitude would be anathema to all parties.  More and more, the view is becoming clearer that we are on the road to privatising medicine.  The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 17 April 1987 has a subheading: &ldquo;Hospital Plan, Ward Closures as Grants are Slashed&rdquo;.  Newspapers up and down the country point to the disintegration of our services.  I ask the Minister to think again, to look elsewhere for the resources we need to meet our debts. I ask him to turn back from the path of private medicine and continue on the path of providing a proper, defensible and affordable service for all the people.</P>
    <P>The amendments put down in the name of the Minister and of Deputies Allen, Cullen and Keating evade the fundamental issues.  We have a clear-cut <Col N="355" /> decision to make in this House.  Are we in favour of going down the road outlined by the Minister for Finance, endorsed by the Cabinet, of confronting our economic crisis on the backs of the weakest, or are we going to demand an alternative, another way, another route?  For all those reasons, I urge Members on all sides of the House not to evade the fundamental issue, but to address the core issue and support the very simple, very clear annulling motion that we as a Labour group put forward here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to call a spade a spade in this kind of situation.  The truth of the matter is that the imposition of these charges by the Fianna Fáil Government is a disgrace and an outrage.  There is no other way in which it can be described.  It constitutes a vicious assault on the standards of working people who cannot afford to meet charges of that nature.  We have heard hysterical speeches in Private Members' Time over the past few years about the position of Fianna Fáil, the great caring party, on preserving the rights of ordinary people. What have they done here?  They have even excelled the Fine Gael Party.  The Fine Gael Party in Government brought in a measure imposing charges on out-patients. Was that monstrosity enough for the Fianna Fáil Government?  No, they had the charges imposed not only on out-patients but on in-patients as well. They had to go better than Fine Gael. Let it go down in history where the comparison lies between those two parties. They are imposing £10 on all kinds of visits to hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that there are two tiers of medical services in this country.  One is called the luxury or private system and the other is the public system.  This Government in deciding where they would let their vicious axe fall, chose to apply it, not on the luxury system, the Fitzwilliam Squares, or the Blackrock Clinics, but on the public system, the lower end of the scale where people go <Col N="356" /> who have no money to pay.  That is the system this Fianna Fáil Government singled out to come the heavy on, making a vicious imposition of £10 a visit.  It will be recalled how in the debate on the Christmas bonus, Fianna Fáil waxed lyrical about hunger stalking the land over a once off payment of £5 at Christmas. Here, they impose a charge of £10 when one's child is injured in an accident and up to £100 if the child must have an operation.  I tell the House that this will be remembered to this Fianna Fáil Government for a long time.  We shall wait and see how the other parties vote on this motion because here, for once, is an opportunity to rescind these measures by law.  Every Deputy in this House who has working people in his or her area has an opportunity to show by vote where he or she stands.  It will go out loud and clear where they stand on this.</P>
    <P>Let us examine how this scheme will work.  Never mind hunger stalking the land as the Minister's colleague, now the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, said on the previous occasion. Fear stalks the land, a terrified fear in many families, that a husband, wife or child could be struck down and would not be able to get medical treatment in the out-patient's department or go into hospital for an operation, something they have had as of right since the foundation of this State.  When they had not £10 in their pocket and knew they had to wait for days to get food on the table, it was comforting to know that if disaster struck, if a child was injured or sick, they could take the child down to the Meath or St. James's Hospital where he or she would be given a warm welcome and caring treatment.  They might have been on the breadline, but at least from the health point of view that was always open to them.</P>
    <P>What category has the Minister attacked?  Take the case of a family on gross pay of £125 a week a husband, wife and two children, outside the band for a medical card, living, let us say, in Tallaght but the same would apply in any working class area up and down the country. If a child gets sick, they take him or <Col N="357" /> her to the doctor.  That costs £12.  The doctor says the child must go to hospital. They have to make their way from Tallaght to Crumlin Hospital and back with the child.  That will cost approximately £3 in bus fares.  Just a look at the child costs £10 in hospital &mdash; never mind the medicine or the worry &mdash; that is £25 in all.  Out of a weekly income of £125 a sum of £25 has gone already.  The next stage is that following an examination in out-patients the patient may be told that an operation is required and he will have to stay three or more days in hospital.  If that person has to go to hospital for an operation he may have to pay £100.  How will such people find £100 out of a weekly take-home income of £125, or less?  In the light of those charges, will the Minister explain, comments he and his colleagues made in the House in recent years?  In the course of a debate on a Private Members' Motion on 18 November 1986 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a long tradition of a caring social philosophy which they cherish and of which they are justly proud.</P>
    <P>It is some social philosophy to charge the weakest section of the community, people who can barely scrape by from week to week, for hospital care.  What type of caring philosophy is that?  The Minister's colleague, Dr. Donal Ormonde, on the same day, as reported at column 2639 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>... we in Fianna Fáil are forced to highlight the plight of the poor and the needy and to put down a motion condemning the failure of this Government to provide essential health services for the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>What are Fianna Fáil doing now?  They are taking away a basic facility that has been the entitlement of people here for generations.  That is some medical service. The Minister on 4 December 1986, as reported at column 1602 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Fianna Fáil are concerned and aware of the ever-increasing costs of health care, but that does not mean that we must abandon what has been traditional in Ireland, which is a caring, social philosophy.  Through consultation and planning we must ensure a proper and adequate level of health care for those who are not able to provide for themselves out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>It is quite a different story we have now. Your colleague, Deputy Flynn, now Minister for the Environment, said on 26 November 1986&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminding the Minister, through the Chair, of what his colleague said, as reported at column 649 on that date when he was referring to the once-off £5 reduction in the Christmas bonus:</P>
      <P>What this Government are doing is mean and stingy.</P>
      <P>I wonder what Deputy Flynn would call this new proposal, £10 for a visit to an out-patient department or £10 to bring a child to a hospital following an accident. Deputy Flynn continued:</P>
      <P>Whether they like it or not, real poverty stalks this land tonight.  This Coalition have no understanding of the difficulties of the old and the unemployed. What does £5 mean to the Minister? It is the price of two gins and tonics in the room next door...</P>
      <P>What does £10 mean to the Minister for Health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often said that the three right wing parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, have a similar <Col N="359" /> approach to the question of cuts but that is not right.  I detect a clear distinction on the question of cuts between the three main parties.  Fianna Fáil say they are against cuts but they vote for them while the Progressive Democrats say they favour cuts but vote against them.  The Fine Gael Party say they favour cuts and vote for them.  In their amendment the Fine Gael Party say that the out-patient charges are all right but the in-patient charges are wrong.  They also propose bringing in a prescription charge.  Such suggestions are par for the course for the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on Second Stage of the Bill implementing these charges the Minister was asked who uses this system.  There was a lot of play made of the fact that many people who can afford to pay avail of those free services. That may be correct but we all know that most of those who use those services do so following accidents or in an emergency when a doctor is not available.  Most of all people avail of those services because they cannot afford to pay the local GP £12.  It is those people the Government are attacking by this measure.  What is involved in this?  I understand that the total saving will be £6 million, a paltry sum, which will be saved off the backs of the poorest section of the community. Did the Government not consider any other measures for raising £6 million? Did they not consider other measures that might be more in tune with the so-called caring attitude of Fianna Fáil?  Did they sit back and think that ten years ago capital taxation raised £12 million more than it does today, leaving aside any adjustment for inflation?  I am sure that did not occur to them because when they got into Government they could not wait to abolish the wealth tax.  The money taken in wealth tax would more than have covered the amount being raised by these monstrous charges.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are great for abolishing taxes that affect their supporters.  Those who backed Fianna Fáil were caught under the wealth tax.  It is the interests of such people that Fianna Fáil serve and I <Col N="360" /> hope that message goes out loud and clear from the House.  Fianna Fáil abolished a modest farm tax when they were returned to power.  Can anyone imagine the mentality of a Government who purport to represent the interests of working people who abolish a miserable farm tax and being in a new tax that will raise £6 million from those on the lowest pay?  In some cases those people only avail of the health service when life is at risk.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the general election I heard Fianna Fáil people say that there could be no further taxation, that the country had reached its limit as far as taxation was concerned.  The Taoiseach made a statement to that effect and all the Fianna Fáil documentation carried it. Is not the £10 charge for in-patient and out-patient services a tax?  In my view it is additional taxation and the Government have chosen those who cannot afford to avail of the luxury system to pay for it. The people who use those services cannot afford to go to the Blackrock Clinic.  The Minister has told us that he will provide insurance cover for those people, that he will have rules and regulations coming in in May.  We do not know what the VHI will do but I must stress that this involuntary tax will have to be paid by the weakest section of the community.  There is a choice about some of the other taxes imposed, luxury taxes, but there is no choice about this tax.  If the need arises and people have to bring their children to out-patient departments of hospitals they will be locked into that system and will have to pay.  If the people do not have the money they will be pursued and may have to pay legal costs.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Members to use this opportunity to vote against those taxes. The way Members vote on this motion will be noted in the record of the House for all time.  If they vote for the charge they will be remembered forever as having put the lives of people in danger. It is wrong that such fear should be allowed to pervade working class families. Any Member who votes for that will have to live with it for a very long time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and insert:</P>
      <P>In view of the serious state of the public finances and the need to maintain an adequate level of essential health services and protect the less well off in the community, Dáil Éireann approves the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1987, the Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987 and the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987 Numbers 114, 115 and 116 of 1987 and supports the decision of the Minister in regard to the categories of persons exempted from the charges and the provision by the VHI of a special scheme to cover the charges.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Howlin and Deputy Taylor and it appears that they have not read the regulations carefully because neither of them referred to the fact that there is in the regulations a hardship clause which gives the CEO the right to exempt persons who are unable to pay for themselves in hospital either as outpatients or inpatients. Deputy Taylor suggested that I had brought fear to the people.  I admit that I brought the hospital charges before this House and that the outpatient charges were passed by this House, but we did not bring any element of fear.  We went to great lengths to explain that people need not worry about the charges because if they are not in a position to pay the charges there is that hardship clause that the CEO can implement as well as all the exemptions that are listed in the regulations. I suggest that it was Deputy Taylor's side of the House both tonight and on the night we debated the health charges who brought in the element of fear when they suggested that persons would be turned away from hospital because they did not have £10 in their pockets. That did no service to the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate about the level of resources which should be devoted to health services it is necessary to look <Col N="362" /> beyond current demands when assessing the appropriate level of provision.  The reality is that demand for health services which are provided free at the point of use is, to all intents and purposes, insatiable. This is not a statement of political dogma. It is a matter of fact.  It is, therefore, necessary to analyse this question in some broader perspective and commonsense would suggest historical trends and our standing on the international health spending league as obvious criteria.</P>
    <P>Looked at historically, the health spending in Ireland enjoyed rapid growth in the sixties and seventies and it is only in the period from 1981 to 1987 that this growth trend has changed.  In the period 1973-74 to 1986 net non-capital spending on health services increased from £143 million to £1,194 million.  This represents a real growth in the proportion of national output devoted to health services. Health spending as a proportion of GNP increased from 5.2 per cent to almost 7 per cent over this period.</P>
    <P>This remarkable growth in resources was reflected in a significant expansion in the quantity and quality of health services provided, in the emergence of new services, particularly in the community care programmes, and in the broadening of eligibility for publicly funded health services. The increased level of resources also facilitated the development of a range of personal social services reflecting a broadened remit for the Department of Health and their agencies.  This period of sustained growth in health spending is the backdrop to the efforts now being made to contain spending.</P>
    <P>This situation is not unique to this country.  Similar trends have been recurring in European countries, notably Denmark, for the past number of years where the same problems are being addressed. Every country in Europe has had to curtail their levels of expenditure and, indeed, they have been approaching that task in a pragmatic manner during the past four years.  That is what we should have been doing instead of being in confrontation with the various health agencies and making no progress in <Col N="363" /> rationalising our health services.  Denmark, for example, closed 700 beds per year for seven years consecutively.  In general the responses are the same here, that is, there is a need for the containment of the level of resource than can be devoted to health.</P>
    <P>This historical background is highly relevant to the current debate about health spending, for it was during the decades of growth and expansion that expectations of a continuation of those trends were formed.  These expectations would be realisable in a situation where the economy continued to grow and where spending on the development of social services generally would be funded from the wealth thus generated.  The reality of course is that our capacity to spend has by far outstripped our capacity to raise revenue and a growing proportion of the resources available for current spending is absorbed in servicing the enormous burden of indebtedness which we have incurred in bridging the gap.  Unless we restore order to the public finances, the community's expectations in areas such as the health services will of necessity have to be lowered well beyond what can reasonably be expected in 1987.  This is the reality we must face.  I should say, however, that, despite our over-all financial difficulties, the Government found it possible to increase the approved expenditure on health services from £1.298 billion in 1986 to £1.315 billion in 1987.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that in the health services we have an area of expenditure which has within it an inherent tendency to grow.  There are growth pressures on the health system from demographic factors and due to the continuous development of new health technologies. In our system patients use the service without regard to cost.  Similarly, the incentive structure facing health service providers encourages the consumption of more rather than less.  Thus, if left to its own devices, the health system would simply continue to grow, absorbing an increasingly greater share of the resources available for public services <Col N="364" /> generally.  That is why we need to pay particular attention to the health services in the overall strategy for controlling public spending.</P>
    <P>Looked at from an international perspective, the concern about health spending is not peculiar to Ireland.  The size of health expenditures and their inherent potential for growth is a matter of concern in developed countries generally. This observation is all the more relevant given that our spending on health services as a percentage of GNP compares favourably with other developed countries, given our relatively less favourable position in terms of GNP <i>per capita</i>.  In other words our spending on health services tends to reflect the levels of richer rather than poorer countries.  This is the background to the Government's decision to curtail public spending on health services during 1987.  It is, of course, but one part of the broader strategy which aims to regain control over the public finances.  I find it disturbing that while there is broad agreement both in this House and more generally on the nature and scale of the public finance problem we face, there is a failure in some quarters to make the logical connection between control of the current budget deficit and Exchequer borrowing and the measures which have to be taken in relation to public services in order to bring about the necessary adjustment in spending.  This is not an inability to understand what is at stake but a reluctance to face up to the realities of the situation and take concrete measures which will make a real contribution to the resolution of our problems.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health services, it has to be stated quite plainly that our existing problems derive principally from the fact that the previous administration made virtually no attempt to contain the level of over-spending of agencies which between 1985 and 1986 aggregated £55 million.  In other words £55 million was over-spent by the Coalition during the last two years and that has placed an intolerable burden on our Government who are now faced with the problem of trying to correct that.  Naturally that proves difficult but we will tackle it and <Col N="365" /> deal with it.  This lack of control and the natural tendency of the agencies to spend to the absolute limits of their credit left this Government in a situation where hard measures have to be taken to protect the infrastructure of the services.  If we do not take these measures, and we recognise that they are not popular, the situation of our health services would be worse in years to come.</P>
    <P>Resources which should be put to providing services have to be put to servicing a serious level of indebtedness created by the previous Government.  What is called for now is a rigorous control on personnel and overdraft levels.  This will be the central feature of my administration until the health services are brought into line with what the realistic financial climate can bear.</P>
    <P>In bridging the gap between what would be required to maintain health services at existing levels and what was available, the Government had a number of options open to them.  The challenge was to meet the shortfall in a way which would impact least on the most vulnerable members of the community preserving essential services and protecting those which cater for the handicapped and the elderly.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the specifics of the motion before the House.  At the outset, I again want to make it clear that the charges for in-patient and out-patient services will be imposed only on those who can reasonably afford to pay.  This underlying principle is clearly reflected in the regulations which provide the statutory basis for the levying of charges.  The motion is, in effect, a challenge to this principle.</P>
    <P>I will go into detail later on the protection in the regulations for those on low income, the unemployed and those who will not be charged because of their financial circumstances.  As all of these groupings are exempt from any charge and will continue to avail of in-patient and out-patient services free of charge, I can see little basis to the challenge to charges on those who can reasonably afford to pay, given the budgetary constraints under which the health services are now operating.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> After all, the revenue from the charges will be of direct and immediate assistance to the maintenance of those services not only for those who have been subject to a charge but also for those who will not be asked to pay.  Surely this is a progressive method of redistributing the wealth of the country.  I referred earlier to the economic and budgetary situation which the Government have inherited, an inheritance, I may add, which has placed us all in severe financial difficulties and has lead to the necessity to introduce the charges.</P>
    <P>The grounds on which the measures taken in the regulations have been challenged have nothing to do with equity or hardship but are clearly in the area of political opportunism of a disturbing nature given that it is the old, the vulnerable and disadvantaged who have been needlessly subjected to distress over these measures.</P>
    <P>I have referred to what has been said by members of the Opposition in terms of creating fear in the minds of people that if they turn up at the hospital they will not receive the necessary attention if they do not have £10.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Hospital managers interviewed on radio have pointed out that nobody will be turned away.  We went to great lengths to ensure that in the regulations there will be provision for hardship.  Apart from expectant mothers and those who hold medical cards, the CEO has the right to waive charges where those charges will cause hardship.  Added to that there is the VHI scheme on which I will be saying more later.  The grounds on which the measures taken in the Regulations have been challenged have nothing to do with hardship, but are just political opportunism.</P>
    <P>I wish to state quite clearly and unequivocally and to put it on the record of this House that charges will not be made where they would cause undue hardship.  This fundamental rule is enshrined in the Health Act, 1970, and repeated in the regulations in order to avoid any possibility of doubt as to its reality.  Both sets of charges &mdash; the in-patient and out-patient charges, will as and from 18 May be subject to this rule. <Col N="367" /> I and indeed other Members of the House have received numerous representations from persons anxious about their circumstances. In most cases that anxiety is groundless and in the others the situation will be far less costly than anticipated.</P>
    <P>I would now like to explain in detail the categories of persons who will not be charged.</P>
    <P>1.  Medical card holders and their dependants.  Approximately 40 per cent of the population are holders of current medical cards which covers approximately 1.3 million people.</P>
    <P>2.  Women receiving services in respect of motherhood.  This covers all in-patient and out-patient services which are in respect of maternity.</P>
    <P>3.  Children up to the age of six weeks. Children referred for in-patient or out-patient services arising from a health examination at primary school, health centres or clinics and children suffering from prescribed diseases or disabilities. I will refer at a later stage to this last mentioned group in view of the fact that the motion seeks to annul the regulations which prescribe these diseases and disabilities.</P>
    <P>4.  Persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases prescribed in the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981.</P>
    <P>5.  Lest there be any doubt about it, persons who are deemed by the chief executive officer of a health board to be unable without undue hardship to pay an in-patient or out-patient charge for themselves or their dependants will also be exempt.</P>
    <P>I refer Members to paragraph 4h of the in-patient regulations and 4g of the out-patient regulations.  This provision gives a chief executive officer the discretion to waive charges if he considers they would cause undue hardship.  Contrary to views already expressed this discretion is a reality and is statutorily based.  I hope at this stage we will not hear any more from people trying to instil fear in the minds of the public, that they dare not go to hospital for fear of being turned away, because that will not happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> The five categories of persons I have just outlined will be exempt from both inpatient and outpatient charges.  Due to the different nature of inpatient and outpatient services additional exemptions will be in force in respect of each of the services.  The inpatient charges will not apply to persons in respect of long term care in geriatric, psychiatric or mental handicap institutions as separate provisions already apply to such persons.</P>
    <P>An overview of the exemptions and of those who will be liable to a charge clearly results in a balanced and equitable approach to the levying of charges.  I should add that this is in marked contrast to particular features of the proposed Fine Gael budget earlier this year.  The Labour Party refused to support specific measures including the unbalanced and inequitable proposal to introduce prescription charges.  The proposal was to impose a charge of £1 per prescription item under the GMS with a refund of the amounts over £5 in any one month in respect of each person.  Not one single person who would have been liable to what can only be termed as a disgraceful charge will be liable to an inpatient or outpatient charge.  Medical card holders, by definition, are those who are unable without undue hardship to provide medical and related services for them selves or their families.  Yet they were being asked to be directly responsible for saving the considerable amount of Exchequer funding as proposed in the Fine Gael budget outlines.  On the other hand, the protection of the vulnerable sections of our community is a salient feature of this Government's approach to the raising of additional revenue for the health services.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the collection of the inpatient and outpatient charges which has given rise to concern in some quarters. It is important to state that the charges which will be introduced are statutorily based.  Both sets of charges will have legal effect and health boards and hospitals are legally obliged to levy and collect the charges and, for those <Col N="369" /> persons so levied, to pay.  It is the intention that the charges will be made at the time of receipt of the service or on discharge from hospital as appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the case of scheduled attendance for outpatient services, health boards and hospitals have been requested to give those attending, prior indication of whether they will be liable for a charge and in the case of inpatient charges what the level of charge is likely to be.  Such arrangements will allow for ease of collection as persons will know in advance their liability.  It also provides a mechanism whereby persons, unable because of financial constraints to meet the level of possible charges, can have their position assessed as to whether the charges should be waived on hardship grounds. There will, of course, be situations in which it will not be possible to collect the charge at the point of delivery.  Accident and emergency cases is one obvious example.  I have no doubt that a commonsense approach by both users and providers of the service will avoid any unnecessary difficulties in that area.  I should point out that it is not a question of a hospital adopting a &ldquo;pay up or else&rdquo; approach to the provision of services. It has always been the tradition in this country that those in need of treatment are provided with the required treatment, and this will continue.  As I said a commonsense and reasonable approach will resolve difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>This year's allocations to health boards and hospitals have taken into account that revenue will be raised by the charges for the direct use of the health board or hospital levying the charge.  Accordingly, it is incumbent on the relevant staff to co-operate as fully as possible in the collection of these charges.  If the revenue is not collected the existing difficult financial situation will be exacerbated. Indeed, listening to Deputies on the Labour benches who do not want these charges, who do not want an increase in income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The land tax that was <Col N="370" /> abolished is being replaced by the collection of VAT from farmers so there will be no loss to the Exchequer this year.  I am sure Deputy Howlin would agree that the fairest way of collecting tax from farmers is the same as that applicable to everybody else, on their profits.  Any shortfall in revenue from this source will directly affect the particular health board or hospital in which such persons are employed and will require a reduction in the level of service and in employment.</P>
      <P>The choice is simple: either the charges are collected and the revenue raised or the boards and hospitals will be faced with an even more difficult situation in managing to live within their allocation. Exchequer funding will not be allocated to make good any losses in this area. Shortfalls in the allocation of revenue will also result in a reduction in the scope and level of services already supplied.</P>
      <P>Similarly it is in everybody's interest, and I am sure those employed in the health services agree, that in times of severe budgetary constraints every effort should be made to protect services.  I have no doubt that managers at hospital and health board level will be available to discuss any potential difficulties in this area.  However, the bottom line is that health boards and hospitals require the income from the charges to maintain existing services and also to maintain employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion as well as seeking to revoke the regulations which impose charges also seeks to revoke the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations, 1987.  In order to explain fully the implications of this proposal and to leave nobody in doubt as to its possible effect it is necessary to refer to the Health (Amendment) Act, 1987.  The Act amended section 56 of the Health Act, 1970 which refers to the provision of outpatient services.  The amending Act enables regulations imposing charges for such services to be made.  Regulations made in 1971 under the unamended section 56 of the Health Act, 1970 provided that no outpatient charges could be made in respect of children suffering from permanent or long term conditions or disabilities such as <Col N="371" /> mental handicap, mental illness, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. As section 56 of the 1970 Act was amended I considered it prudent, in order to remove any possible legal doubts as to the situation of such children, to make new regulations under section 56 as substituted by the provision of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1987.  These regulations restate the same conditions and disabilities as prescribed in 1971 and make it clear that no charges may be made on children suffering from these conditions.  The motion seeks to have these regulations revoked which provide a clearcut benefit to such children.</P>
    <P>I should also like to emphasise the point that outpatient charges are not new.  They were introduced in 1982 and were part of the Fine Gael budgetary strategy in 1987.  Furthermore outpatient charges have been levied for some time by some health boards.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the level of charges to be made.  The out-patient charge of £10 will be in respect of the first visit for a particular medical condition and will not apply to return visits for that medical condition.  A single charge of £10 therefore covers visits to consultant staffed out-patients' clinics, hospital casualty departments and referrals for pathology, radiology or physiotherapy services in respect of a particular medical condition.  Regardless of the number of return visits and the number of out-patient services availed of by an individual one charge only will be made.  Given that a visit to a general practitioner would be in or around £10 and in some cases more, I consider the charge to be reasonable.  It is generally accepted that hospital casualty departments are abused, perhaps unconsciously, but certainly without any consideration to the demands placed on hospital staff and other resources to meet genuine accident and emergency cases for which casualty departments are primarily available.  The out-patient charge will bring needful rationalisation to the usage of casualty departments and avoid abuses of such services.</P>
    <P>The in-patient charges will be at a rate <Col N="372" /> of £10 per day during which in-patient services are availed of.  The maximum payment in any period of twelve consecutive months will be £100.  Accordingly, any hospital stay over ten days, regardless of the number of in-patient attendances throughout the 12 month period, will not be charged.  In cases of a serious accident or acute conditions which require hospitalisation for several weeks or months the maximum charge will be £100 in any year.</P>
    <P>To put this charge in some perspective I should point out that it costs around £1,000 to £1,300 per week to treat patients in some acute hospitals and that our expenditure on the general hospital programme will be £657 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>Small and all as they are in relation to the total expenditure involved, these charges might impose some financial strain on a number of people in the middle and higher income groups.  There is an obvious need for insurance services to cover the charges and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board will meet this need.  At my request, the VHI are making the necessary insurance cover available, details of which will be announced shortly.  The scheme will be moderately priced, say of the order of £10 per year for a single person and £25 for a typical family of two adults and two children. Full income tax relief will, of course, apply in the usual way in respect of these premiums.  There is one other point I would like to make to the House.  Existing VHI policy holders will be covered free for the current year.  I have arranged that the VHI will make the new scheme available to all persons who wish to join, irrespective of their age or medical condition. The restrictions relating to age on entry and previous illnesses which apply in the case of new members joining existing VHI schemes will not apply to the new scheme.  Anybody, irrespective of age or medical condition, will be fully covered for the new charges from the day he joins.</P>
    <P>The House should pass these charges. They are necessary to ensure we maintain the proper level of service.  In view of the regulations, the exemptions for those <Col N="373" /> who have difficulty in paying and the introduction of the very reasonably priced voluntary health insurance scheme the House should accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>calls on the Government to rescind its decision to impose a charge of £10 per day for non-medical card patients in public wards; and to raise and introduce instead a modest prescription charge which will reduce the excessive incidence of visits to doctors and the consequent over-prescribing of drugs, to the extent necessary to produce equivalent savings in public expenditure.</P>

      <P>Our approach is socially desirable &mdash; I will give the reasons for that later &mdash; and at the same time will allow the Government to stay within their budget.  In the past few weeks there have been a series of the most savage cutbacks since the foundation of the State.  The decisions made by the Minister for Health will mean the loss of thousands of jobs in the health service, the closure of hospitals, the closure of wards and a serious cutback in the range of services available to the public, as well as longer waiting lists.  One of the fallouts from the recent proposals put forward by the Minister, which I heard only yesterday, was the imposition of a £1,500 training fee for nurses and a drop in their salaries.  How successful that proposal will be remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> The cuts proposed by the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, make his predecessor seem like Florence Nightingale.  The decisions were made with little thought and with a smack of <i>ad hoc</i>-ery of the worst kind.  No attempt whatsoever has been made to deal with the fundamental problems of our health system.  I outlined some of those in my first contribution to the House as Fine Gael spokesman on health.  They are; the management system that prevails at present in the health boards; the irregular practices throughout our health system; the serious wastage of public moneys and public contracts; the common contract, and attending to abuses.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party bears no resemblance whatever to that of the Fianna Fáil Party of January last. They have carried through one of their greatest confidence tricks on the Irish people.  They have changed their minds since assuming power.  It is the old story of power at any price.  I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 9 April an extract from the Minister's speech in January 1986:</P>
    <P>There is no further scope at the present time for cuts.  The health boards have done an excellent job in preventing the level of service from deteriorating further than it already has.</P>
    <P>They all have deficits and it would be wrong at this time to reduce the allocations further.  You would be putting lives at risk by doing that.</P>

      <P>In <i>The Irish Press</i> of 7 February there are headings such as &ldquo;Must the old and sick suffer more vicious health cuts?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Major Hospital Cutbacks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Closures will mean lack of proper care for a large proportion of our community&rdquo;. What about Clonakilty hospital which is on the chopping block at present?  In <i>The Irish Press</i> of 17 February there is also a heading &ldquo;Better Care for the Old and Sick&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to set out clearly his plans for the health <Col N="375" /> service.  I would like him to tell us what will happen to many of our welfare homes, district hospitals and general hospitals.  What will happen to hospitals such as the one I mentioned in my health board region, Clonakilty hospital, where the old are cared for?  What will happen to the North Infirmary Hospital which suffered a 20 per cent reduction in its budget for this year?  To move to the Mid-Western Health Board, what is the future for Nenagh General Hospital, Thurles General Hospital and St. John's Hospital?  What about Barringtons Hospital in Limerick?  What is the future for hospitals in Tullamore, Mcnaghan &mdash; that will be very interesting &mdash; Letterkenny, Roscommon, Kilkenny, Killarney, Dundalk, Ennis and Athlone? What will happen to the staff of the eight health boards who will be affected by the cuts?  We deserve a full and clear statement of the Minister's intentions for all these services.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, in responding to the tidal wave of fear and anxiety generated by the Taoiseach and his Health Minister, wish to reassure the public and especially the old, the lonely, the mentally handicapped, the sick, those terminally ill and staff members in all the health services that our party will not tolerate a situation where the Government continue to be less than open and honest with everybody involved about the serious position which now obtains in our health service.  A ministerial style that generates fear and anxiety among those who have enough serious problems must be looked at with concern.  It strikes fear into the weakest in our society and even the county councillors throughout the country at present fear that the cure as proposed by the Minister will terminate the patient.  These councillors agree with our proposals, that a modest prescription charge which would bring in an equivalent amount of money would be far more desirable socially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People now realise, maybe too late, that our party set out in an honest way the full facts of the health service and told the truth about the problems facing <Col N="376" /> the health service.  From time to time the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, who was in the House earlier, and Deputy Boland were viciously attacked by the present incumbent for their decisions.  I mentioned the common contract earlier which is one of the fundamental problems besetting our health service.  It was the present Taoiseach who presided over the negotiating of that contract and developed the poorly managed, decaying health system that we have in this country. The <i>ad hoc</i> disjointed incremental approach used in the planning and management of our health services was the bequest of the present Taoiseach when he was Health Minister.</P>
    <P>Many Irish people wonder why the health services are now so threatened and so quickly threatened.  We know that there are cash limits on expenditure.  Now we need a planned approach with full consultation with all involved in the health services and on a political level. All the cards must be placed on the table about the problems besetting the health service.  Fine Gael will contribute in a realistic manner to the debate which must commence now.</P>
    <P>The fundamental questions which must be asked now are what are Ireland's health care needs?  How do we decide what these needs are?  What type of health care system is most suitable for the Irish people?  What funding arrangements should be made for our health services, and what type of management system should be put in place?  Do we need large hospitals or should we have smaller units?  How should we involve third party funding agencies such as insurance companies?  Do we need formalised medical audit systems in place or health professionals audit systems in place?  Would quality assurance programmes in all institutions and services facilitate more cost effective utilisation of resources?  All these questions I address to this House and it is an area on which we should have realistic discussions. I ask the Minister to establish a special committee of this House to examine these issues in depth because the <Col N="377" /> health service which is costing approximately £1.3 billion of Exchequer funds is in crisis and needs radical treatment.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to the old, the sick and the mentally handicapped to design a health care system responsive to their needs.  The politics of fear, of generating unnecessary anxiety must cease.  We need to begin a process of consultation, a process of objective option appraisal and analysis leading to a rational decision-making process.  We must not delay any longer.  Our health bill is increasing all the time and we seem to be getting bad value for money.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are a party who wish to be constructive, and to respond to the challenges now facing the country.  I do not propose to indulge in ministerial or Government bashing, but I say to the Minister and to the Deputies with responsibility for health care in the other parties that we should ask the Minister to consider my proposal to set up a special committee to deal with health matters. Let us seek an objective consensus in what we are to do, to save and redirect our health services, and not to do anything that is foolish and will generate unnecessary fear in our people.  Tough policy options must be looked at and faced.</P>
    <P>We can face these options if we have a planned approach with consultations and understanding of what the country must do to redirect our future.  Health care is an emotive and political subject and it strikes at our very being.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister mentioned Denmark. We can learn from the more successful and smaller European economies. We can use the resources of the World Health Organisation to undertake a situation analysis of areas of our health care system and to advise on our options. Once we allay fears we will gain acceptance at local and national levels that decisions must be faced.  If the decision-making process is open and honest, acceptance will be possible.</P>
    <P>On the £10 charges for hospital beds, the Minister is trying to force people into a VHI scheme to absolve him from facing up to the question of the utilisation of <Col N="378" /> our State-funded hospital system by the private sector and in order to avoid making radical changes in the managerial system of our health boards.  Surely there should have been an income limit under which persons would be exempted from those charges, and surely a modest increase in premiums of VHI for the well off is infinitely preferable to impoverishing those already in financial distress, that is, those who do not have medical cards and cannot afford VHI, a fair percentage of the population.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this £10 in-patient charge is uncollectable.  It would create extraordinarily difficult administrative problems for the health boards and voluntary hospitals, and would add another layer of bureaucracy to an already collapsing health system which we cannot afford. Even to administer the exemption process would also create bureaucratic problems. How can we administer this system when we are faced with an embargo on the setting up of new posts?</P>
    <P>I believe our amendment, which introduces a modest prescription charge, is socially desirable.  I believe the whole area of prescribing patterns and visitation patterns for doctors under the GMS scheme need to be exmained in detail.  It is extremely worrying to note that between 1983 and 1985 there has been a hefty increase in the average number of prescriptions for persons who are medical card holders.  &ldquo;Health Statistics, 1986&rdquo;, shows that between 1983 and 1985 there has been a 4 per cent increase in the number of doctors' visits, an alarming 13 per cent increase in the average number of prescriptions per person, as well as a further 13 per cent increase in the average number of items prescribed.  Surely the health of the population is not worsening at that rate?  This is an area where considerable savings could be made.  Those figures underpin an undesirable social practice.  I believe the imposition of a modest prescription charge is socially desirable.</P>
    <P>My party agree with the broad thrust of the economic approach of the present Government but disagree fundamentally with the manner in which some of the <Col N="379" /> cuts are being applied.  On an evening when we are discussing the imposition of health charges, I believe that this <i>ad hoc</i> approach will not allow our national health service to survive.  I also believe the critical question facing the health service at the present time is how to develop and manage our health service in the most cost effective and efficient manner having regard to available resources and the real needs of our people.  Surely we, as a Parliament, must respond to the document &ldquo;Health, the Wider Dimensions&rdquo;? This is for discussion in another debate.  However, the present fire brigade approach of the Minister must be condemned especially as he has not addressed the basic problems of the health services.  His fire brigade approach will cause even more serious damage to our health services.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss now the efficiency and the savings that could be made in our hospital services.  Stricter control of our capital projects must be undertaken and I ask the Minister to look at this area. Moneys have been wasted on certain projects such as Tralee and Beaumont and even at present in my own health area, the Cork Regional Hospital which has been built seven years, is showing signs of serious defects which pose major questions about how money was spent on our health services in the past.  I ask the Minister to reply to some of the questions which have been raised by the different health boards in recent times.  Like everybody else, I have read the papers and have seen reports of job losses, cutbacks in services and so on, but before he does any further damage I ask him to look at the fundamental issues affecting our health services.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support our amendment. I will now hand over to Deputy Flaherty.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring <Col N="380" /> gave me notice of his intention to raise the position of the Outdoor Education Centre, Cappanalea, County Kerry.  He has 20 minutes to make his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to you for allowing me to raise this matter because it is time it was brought to the attention of the Minister with responsibility for sport and his ministerial colleagues.  I will use 15 minutes of the time allotted to me and Deputy Foley and Deputy O'Donoghue may also wish to lend their voices to the case I will be making.  I am glad to share my time with them and I trust that, as they are Government Deputies, they will lean on the Minister and his senior colleagues who hold the purse strings to ensure that funding is provided for this very important centre.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to outline to the House in some detail the history of the Outdoor Education Centre in Cappanalea, situated a number of miles from Killorglin, County Kerry.  A local committee was set up in the seventies and the infrastructure for the facility was built with grant-aid from the Department of Education to Kerry Vocational Education Committee in 1981.  The site was originally developed for outdoor education by the Killorglin community council in 1973 and the association for adventure sports have also been involved in the development from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The centre, which I visited on a number of occasions, provides full catering and residential facilities for incoming groups who wish to follow a programme of outdoor education.  It can accommodate up to 40 students in dormitory style rooms with facilities to cater for mixed groups, separate shower and toilet blocks and a drying room for wet clothes.  It is an excellent facility which, in recent times, has run into a number of difficulties notwithstanding the enormous efforts made by the VEC in County Kerry, the manager and staff.  The education committee in County Kerry are indeed fortunate to have such excellent management and staff in the Outdoor Education Centre. Despite enormous difficulties in security <Col N="381" /> in terms of tenure of employment which have been over their heads for the past two years, the staff under the management of Mr. O'Dowd, have persisted in staying on and working at times on a voluntary basis to ensure that there is continuity and that a basic educational facility is maintained and developed.</P>
    <P>The wide range of programmes which have been developed and piloted are a credit to the centre.  Within the educational sphere, progress has concentrated on a number of programmes such as the development and implementation of an outdoor education awards scheme, the development of an outdoor education module for school based vocational preparation training courses in post-primary schools and the development of an outdoor education module for community youth training programmes under the auspices of AnCO.  In co-operation with the Department of Education, there is also a fully sanctioned in-service teacher-training course in integrated studies, including physical education, biology and geography.</P>
    <P>An external AnCO training course has also been initiated concentrating on the training of sports and leisure officers, the implementation for third level physical education students from Thomond College of an outdoor education module in practical work experience and the writing and compiling of a practical field studies manual, which was a student publication earlier this year and was distributed on a national level to teachers and students. An official meteorological station was established at Cappanalea and there was also a programme of North-South exchange programmes with youth clubs from the Southern Education Library Board and from County Kerry on an exchange basis.</P>
    <P>To mark International Youth Year, Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre, in conjunction with the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, ran a major Ireland end to end project which was very successful. The inclusion of adventure sports and extended physical education programmes in many schools throughout the <Col N="382" /> country, in conjunction with Cappanalea, and the facilitating of schools with outdoor education programmes who are following the alternative leaving certificate syllabus, put Cappanalea on the map as a very important outdoor education centre.  Usage has been very high all through the year and the annual total for student usage is now in the region of 8,375 student days.  A total of 7,234 student days was accumulated during 1985 and, of this figure, 3,945 student days were made up by school usage. Indeed, school usage accounts for the greatest proportion of Cappanalea's work.</P>
    <P>During 1985, on 85 per cent of the days of the year the centre was occupied by various groups.  Those attending courses at the centre comprised different groups and individuals, State, private and voluntary organisations.  As I said at the outset, there is uncertainty over the future of Cappanalea.  The amount of money required is minimal.  The chief executive officer of the vocational education committee in County Kerry who has put an enormous amount of his personal time into the establishment and development of the centre informed me as late as yesterday that a sum in the region of £40,000 is the amount required by the VEC in County Kerry to ensure that the jobs are saved in the centre.  In the absence of that kind of money in 1987, the uncertainty now hanging over the centre will lead to its ultimate closure.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is committed to leisure centres and all active forms of sport, outdoor and indoor.  It would be a very sad day, not just for County Kerry and the people who have given their time voluntarily, but for the country as a whole if the centre closed especially in the context of North-South relations, given that the centre has had good usage by pupils and teaching groups from Northern Ireland.  It would be a disaster if the centre was allowed to close because of the lack of a paltry sum of £40,000 for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 the local committee in Killorglin &mdash; I am sure my colleagues from County Kerry know these people well &mdash;<Col N="383" /> have made great efforts in acquiring the very valuable site backing on to Caragh Lake, an area of outstanding scenic beauty and it is very important that those people are not let down by the Government. I am glad to share my time with colleagues from another party because this issue transcends politics in County Kerry. Given the support, the amount of correspondence and lobbying for this centre which has been forthcoming, not just from voters and those in jobs, but from the many young people throughout the county who have had the opportunity to use these facilities, urging that the centre should be allowed to grow and prosper, it would be a sad day's work if the Government are not in a position to save it.  In the course of Government discussions last year &mdash; I am sure the Minister has this on file and it was confirmed by a senior official in the Department of Education to the chief executive officer of the Kerry Vocational Education Committee &mdash; it was agreed that funds would be provided for 1987.  This was confirmation of a decision which I had made in Government that funds would be provided from the national lottery.  That was at a time when the forecasts of the receipts, revenue and profits from the national lottery suggested they would be quite minimal.  Now, as most of us in this House are aware, the expectations and conservative estimates which were originally forecast for the national lottery have been exceeded.  To date, a sum in the region of £21 million has been expended on the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The Minister with responsibility for Sport in order to maintain his <i>bona fides</i> before this House and the many people on whose behalf I am speaking this evening should give a commitment that the funds will be provided in the course of 1987.  As I said, it will be a tragedy if the meagre sum of £40,000, in the context of the Estimates, is not provided especially in view of the fact that the receipts and profits of the national lottery are now far exceeding the original expectations and forecasts.</P>
    <P>This centre is of enormous importance <Col N="384" /> not just on a local basis but in the context of outdoor education.  It offers facilities for secondary school and university students and for teacher in-training courses in relation to botany and related matters at a time when there is great concern at all levels in regard to leisure time activities and the pursuits which can be made available.  This is a particular activity centre that can be made available to the public at minimal cost, it provides supervised training and a very solid track record has been built up during the past six to seven years in particular.  The resilience of the staff of this outdoor pursuit centre has been tested on many occasions.  I can say for the benefit of the Minister and the House that this issue transcends political affiliations and beliefs.  It is an issue which affects most school children at secondary school level in County Kerry and far beyond the boundaries of County Kerry.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months it is an issue on which there has been unanimity in the Fianna Fáil Party, Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party at local level.  It was under enormous pressure in the course of the past 12 months that I had accepted by my colleagues in Government that funds would be provided from the national lottery.  I am making the case to the Minister with responsibility for Sport that he should give a commitment.  He cannot in any way seek to challenge the <i>bona fides</i> of this centre or those of the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee or of the individuals in the vicinity of Killorglin in County Kerry who have given of their own time and money since 1973 to build what I would regard as probably the premier outdoor education centre in the country.  Strictly speaking, if the public finances were to permit, it should be taken within the ambit of the Department of Education or the Department of Labour and certainly within the ambit of the Minister with responsibility for Sport.</P>
    <P>There is no one in this House at this stage who is not reasonably familiar with certain difficulties and constraints.  That is why I particularly welcome the contributions which will be made by my <Col N="385" /> fellow Members in County Kerry, Deputies Foley and O'Donoghue.  The people of Kerry will be looking to them as members of the Government party.  I was expected to deliver enough by day and by night during the past four years.  This perhaps is a small test for my colleagues. A small sum of money is required.  They know where the office of the Minister is and it would be a sign of their <i>bona fides.</i> During the general election campaign the Progressive Democrat candidate who was totally opposed to public expenditure wondered why the then Tánaiste was not delivering this money at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give us a commitment. It is not an unrealistic sum.  It is a sum which will be seen as a token of gratitude to the many people in both the County Kerry Vocational Education Committee and the local voluntary organisations.  It is a very worthwhile cause, one which has the support of all the political parties in County Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy Spring, for allowing me some of his time on this very important issue.  Deputy Spring has outlined in detail the history of Cappanalea and I do not propose to be repetitive. While speaking recently during the budget debate I made reference to Cappanalea outdoor pursuit centre which is due to close within a few weeks due to the lack of funding.  Ten people are employed in this centre, comprising eight instructors, a manager and a caretaker. They work as a team and each of them puts in many long hours outside of their normal duty.</P>
      <P>A feature of the centre is that income has increased steadily since it was opened in 1985.  In 1985, the first year of operation, it had an income of approximately £20,000.  In 1986, this sum had increased to £30,000 and the target for 1987 is £40,000.  This small band of workers are quite confident of achieving that figure. With the overall cost in the region of £80,000 there is a shortfall of £40,000. Deputy Spring has dealt in detail with 1985 and I would like to give some figures for 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> The centre was used for approximately 8,500 hours broken down as follows: school usage accounted for 52 per cent, youth groups approximately 32 per cent and adult groups 16 per cent.  This involved a total of 4,590 people utilising the centre in 1986.  A feature, as in 1985, is the number of youth clubs from the North who took part in courses at the centre.  I am sure that helped in no small way as regards relationships between the North and the South.</P>
    <P>Prior to Christmas, Cappanalea had received a commitment from Cospóir for approximately £60,000.  This had the approval of the then Coalition Government but that commitment has now been withdrawn by Cospóir.  For this reason, I endorse the plea of my colleague, Deputy Spring, as I have no doubt will Deputy John O'Donoghue.  I should like to see a commitment given that funds from the national lottery would be provided for this worthwhile project.  Cappanalea is going to command much wider recognition and there is no doubt we cannot afford to lose this venture for the paltry sum of £40,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank the Minister for allowing me some of his time.  The Cappanalea outdoor recreation centre is unique.  Mind you, it is not the only thing which is unique to County Kerry but it is unique in this country.  It has made an enormous contribution to the youth of County Kerry, of Munster and of Ireland. The Minister is presented with the opportunity of making a significant and worthwhile contribution to the young people of Ireland.  The closure of this centre which is so close to the hearts and minds of so many young people would be a tragedy because, as its own brochure says, it is a beacon on a hill which has been lit and nurtured for a purpose.  That purpose has not yet been realised.  It would be most unfortunate if that light were to be quenched as it commences to glow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be sufficient. In 1984, an expert on outdoor education, Neville Crowther, said:</P>
      <P>Outdoor education is not a subject but an approach to education.  Experts have stated that there are good indications that access to testing and stretching programmes of outdoor activity, group and individual, in a supportive and well organised milieu does much to influence positively those aspects of personal development of the young person which are generally beyond the reach of the classroom and school environment.  Its initiatives in North-South joint ventures can surely blossom into an acceptance of the children of Ireland playing and discovering together the many worthwhile pursuits which have a common place in all their hearts.</P>
      <P>The centre is fully booked out for virtually 12 months of the year.  It does not distinguish between the classes; it does not distinguish between the creeds; it does not distinguish.  It is a uniting force in a society which is all too often divided and has potential which outweighs even this.  It has the capacity to teach people to learn values, principles and ideals that cannot be taught in the confines of a classroom or a school yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say at this stage that it is more advisable, more praiseworthy and more sensible to spend the small amount of money required to keep this centre open on outdoor pursuits, rather than having some of these young people getting into trouble in cities and larger towns.  The paying out of sums of money <Col N="388" /> required to keep the centre open must be balanced against the cost of their detention in institutions around this country. Outdoor education, because it presents opportunities rather than coerces, is a carrot rather than a stick.</P>
    <P>Cappanalea is where Irish tourism should be travelling to.  It opens up the great outdoors to the young and to travellers to the country.  It inspires and instils the spirit of freedom and appreciation of our country.  It is a gem in the crown of the Kingdom of Kerry, which would be all the poorer without it.  I thank the Minister for saying he will come to visit Cappanalea to see for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Deputies for raising this issue and for the way in which they have presented their case.  I concur almost completely with everything that has been said, in particular with the positive way in which Cappanalea has been portrayed here this evening.  This Outdoor Education Centre was developed by Kerry Vocational Education Committee with assistance from my Department which provided a grant of £56,000 under the national programme for the provision of recreational facilities.  In addition, we have provided over £81,000 in the years since the centre was first developed in 1981.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this is only one of eight Outdoor Education Centres throughout the country which are in a similar situation, having been established with the assistance of capital grant-aid from my Department.  Two further education centres have been developed without direct capital grant-aid from my Department.  In addition, vocational education committees in six other areas have sought sanction to develop such centres. While the case for Cappanalea cannot therefore be taken in isolation, I am very much aware of the problems which have beset the centre over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the embargo on the creation of new posts in the Civil Service, it has not <Col N="389" /> been possible for additional staff resources to be provided for Outdoor Education Centres.  Redeployment of existing VEC resources to provide the necessary staff has not proved possible, either.  My understanding of the present position in relation to staffing in Cappanalea is that there are nine staff at present employed in the centre on a temporary basis.  The manager and caretaker have for some time been paid out of the general VEC fund.  The secretary and instructors were recruited initially under the Department of Labour Teamwork scheme for the provision of temporary employment for young people.  This non-continuous type of employment was not satisfactory to the VEC and their insurers.  Therefore, in March 1986 the VEC decided to retain the existing team workers at Teamwork pay rates and pay them on a temporary basis from VEC funds.  I am aware that the VEC have now intimated that it is no longer possible for them to fund this staff and hence this difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>Arising from the undertaking to which Deputy Spring referred, by the previous Government on 23 December 1986 &mdash; and I must say, they left it quite close to Christmas &mdash; that funding would be provided from the national lottery for Cappanalea Outdoor Education Centre, a submission was made by my predecessor, the former Minister with responsibility for Sport, to the Minister for Finance on 19 January 1987, requesting funding for Outdoor Education Centres including Cappanalea from the national lottery.  The approval of the former Minister for Finance to this proposal had not been given, however on the change of Government on 10 March 1987.  The position, therefore, is that while an undertaking was given by the former Government in favour of Cappanalea, this was subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I could perhaps refer further to a number of other undertakings which were made by the previous Government in those heady days leading up to the election. My total calculation comes to a <Col N="390" /> promise of an expenditure of approximately £8 million from the proceeds of the national lottery, even though the estimated proceeds at that stage were only £5.5 million.  It is not correct for Deputy Spring to say that approval had been given.  The Minister for Finance failed to respond to the request for finance from our Department for the funding of those centres.  Approval in principle had been given for this and many other projects.</P>

If the education centres can perhaps be more effectively marketed, a strong case can be made for using resources generated from the profits of the national lottery to invest in contributing towards staffing and other costs in those centres.  I propose to consider very carefully making the necessary finance available, within the constraints that are upon me, for the continuation of all eight centres including Cappanalea.</P>

Local authorities are responsible for the rents of their dwellings and the details sought by Deputy Quinn are not available in the Department.  However, I understand that the call by NATO for a rent strike has met with only limited support and that most tenants are paying their rents.  The Government's election manifesto promised consultations with NATO who recently submitted their views to me about this and certain other matters. Their submissions are being examined in the Department with a view to arranging a meeting.  Meanwhile, the existing rents schemes continue in operation and rents must be paid.</P>

Each member state was required to draw up four-yearly programmes, beginning in 1987, to reduce the volume and tonnage of such containers discarded into the waste stream and this country's initial programme was notified to the EC Commission in January last.  I understand that in the formulation of this programme there was consultation with industrial interests including the beer, wine and spirits, soft drinks and liquid milk industries, which are the main beverage container users, as regards the targets to be aimed at.  The programme itself provides for on-going consultation <Col N="52" /> on implementation aspects between the public sector and relevant trade interests.

The provision for local authority housing construction being made available from the public capital programme in 1987 is £87 million.

The reduction of £12 million in the programme need not necessarily affect the <Col N="62" /> number of new house starts in 1987 as the timing of such starts is a crucial element in the expenditure to be deployed in 1987.</P>

      <P>In general, there is a right to compensation if, as a result of a refusal of permission to develop land, or the grant of permission subject to conditions, the value of an interest of any person in <Col N="63" /> the land is reduced.  The retention of this general principle, and its proper application, is fundamental to the planning system.  However, compensation is not payable in a wide range of circumstances, for example, if the development would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard, if it is premature because of deficiency in water or sewerage services, if it would destroy any view or prospect of special amenity or value or special interest, and so on.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, very conscious of the need to ensure that the Planning Acts do not provide the opportunity for individuals to make unreasonable gains at the expense of the community.  The legislation is being examined in my Department at present with a view to seeing what amendments are desirable and possible and, in particular, whether the classes of cases in which no compensation is payable could be extended.  The whole area of compensation is, however, a very complex one with major constitutional issues involved and there is a delicate balance to be struck between the rights of the individual, including property rights, and the rights and interests of the community at large.</P>

      <P>A number of measures have been developed at international level in response to recent concern about modification of the ozone layer by man-made emissions, especially those connected with the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  EC Council decisions of 1980 and 1982 require a reduction of at least 30 per cent compared with 1976 in the use of CFCs for aerosol cans, as well as a standstill in CFC productive capacity. Under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was concluded in 1985.  This is the most comprehensive international instrument for addressing the ozone layer problem, and a protocol to it, designed to place further controls on the use of CFCs, is due to be finalised in September 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland does not produce CFCs and makes very limited use of them for manufacturing purposes.  Our consumption of CFCs for aerosol manufacture has decreased by 50 per cent since 1976, i.e. by considerably more than the minimum of 30 per cent required by the EC.  We have already indicated at the EC Environment Council our willingness to play a positive part in developing such further <Col N="65" /> controls of CFCs as may be necessary. The Commission is participating on behalf of the Community in the negotiations on the CFC protocol to the Vienna Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not yet a party to the 1985 Vienna Convention because legal advice is that it would be more appropriate to ratify it after the Air Pollution Bill, 1986, has been enacted.  I intend, subject to Government approval, to bring the necessary ratification motion before the Dáil in due course.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in respect of the 1986 Census. It could only be assembled by a detailed analysis of the background working documents used by enumerators at the Census.  All efforts are being concentrated on the processing of the questionnaires completed by households with a view to publishing the final Census results as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relevant information is available in respect of the 1981 Census obtained from <Col N="68" /> a detailed analysis of the background documents carried out following the main processing of the 1981 Census returns. When delivering the Census forms prior to the Census the enumerators were required to note whether a dwelling was vacant or whether the occupants were likely to be absent on Census night.  In the case of vacant dwellings the enumerator indicated whether in his/her view the dwelling was habitable or not.  The purpose of this task was to ensure as complete an enumeration as possible since the enumerator was required to return to all these dwellings to verify the position when the Census forms were being collected.</P>
    <P>In 1981 there were 78,900 houses, including holiday homes, and 8,100 flats which the enumerators listed as being habitable but vacant on Census night.  In addition there were 13,100 houses which were listed as newly under construction or being renovated but not habitable on Census night.</P>

      <P>A meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference was held in Belfast on 22 April 1987.  The Joint Statement issued after the meeting has been placed in the Dáil Library for the information of Deputies.  It was agreed that the conference at its next meeting would discuss &mdash; in addition to equality of opportunity in employment and cross-Border security co-operation &mdash; economic, social and cultural issues including cross-Border economic co-operation.  It is not the practice, as the Deputy will be aware, to announce the dates of future meetings of the conference.</P>

      <P>I am deeply concerned by the practice of strip-searching of women prisoners in prisons in Northern Ireland and in Britain.</P>
      <P>Strip-searching in Northern Ireland is a distasteful procedure which many find distressing.  While security considerations prevent it from being dispensed with entirely in the continuing absence of an acceptable alternative, the dignity of the human person requires that the most sparing use possible be made of it.  I wish to see the use of strip-searching in Maghaberry kept to an absolute minimum.  I am availing, accordingly, of the framework provided by the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to press the British Government to reduce the practice of strip-searching to the absolute minimum consistent with prison security. I intend to put forward views and proposals regarding ways in which the present level of strip-searching in Northern Ireland could be significantly reduced.</P>
      <P>The same considerations apply to the practice of strip-searching Irish prisoners in British prisons, in relation to which I shall be availing of my other contacts with the British authorities to make known my views.</P>

The operational requirements of the prison system necessitate transfers of prisoners between institutions. It is not the practice to give detailed reasons for such transfers in the case of individual offenders.</P>

      <P>The recent amendment of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, suspends the entitlement of prison staff and their families to the services of the prison medical officer at State expense for a period until 31 December 1989.  The amendment is a direct consequence of an agreement reached between the Minister for Justice, the Prison Officers Association and the Prison Officers Medical Aid Society whereby prison officers forfeited their entitlement to the services of prison medical officers and to medicines at State expense in exchange for the Minister agreeing, <i>inter alia,</i> to subsidise a medical aid scheme operated by the society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if, in view of the fact that Ireland is under the milk quota for the year ending April 1987 and in view of the fact that the industrial dispute of the clerical officers in ACOT prevented dairy farmers from being notified formally of the requirements until the end of March, he will waive the regulation that prevents farmers who have exceeded the quota from being eligible for farm improvement grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm improvement programme implements EC policy on farm investment aids.  Under the programme, the restrictions on dairy investment aid apply at individual applicant level; such restrictions must be adhered to regardless of whether the aggregate milk production is within the national quota.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EC requirements, grant-aid for dairy investment is payable only where an applicant's milk quota is respected.  Each applicant for acceptance into the farm improvement programme undertakes to observe all the programme conditions, one of which is that aid shall not be granted for investments related to milk production which would result in the permanent milk quota being exceeded. Furthermore, in drawing up farm plans which include provision for dairy investment, ACOT ensures that each participant in the programme is made fully aware of the necessity not to exceed the allocated permanent milk quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced recently, grants for non-dairy investment under the programme will no longer be dependent on compliance with the milk quota requirements. Furthermore, milk quotas associated with land leased for a minimum of three years may be taken into account in calculating a dairy farmer's permanent milk quota for programme purposes. These two changes, which apply retrospectively, will result in a substantial number of dairy farmers, who would have <Col N="102" /> been ineligible under the previous rules, being eligible for grants for planned investment.</P>

      <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts means for unemployment assistance purposes are calculated on a yearly basis. The person referred to in the question was self-employed and his income from the self-employment must be taken into account in assessing his means for unemployment assistance purposes.  To comply with the statutory requirement the means are averaged out on an annual basis to determine the rate of assistance to which there is entitlement.</P>
      <P>Given the fluctuations which can occur in the income of the self-employed it is considered that the assessment of means over a 12 month period is an equitable method of determining ongoing entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned he will continue to receive unemployment assistance at the present rate even if he resumes his self-employment as long as his total income over the year remains the same.  If, however, he can show that he will not have any income from self-employment in the coming year, then his means would be reassessed.</P>

      <P>The husband of the couple concerned was awarded invalidity pension from 26 August 1982.  He was paid invalidity pension at the rate of £118.75, that is, £47.10 personal rate, an increase of £30.60 in respect of his wife as adult dependant and an increase of £41.05 in respect of four qualified child dependants until the 19 November 1986.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the EC equality provisions invalidity pension is being paid at the rate of £87.60 to the person concerned, that is, £47.10 personal rate and an increase of £20, which is the temporary payment for men whose adult dependants are receiving a payment from the Department, and an increase of £20.50 in respect of four qualified child dependants.</P>
      <P>The wife in the couple concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 8 April 1980.  She was paid at the rate of £41.10 per week to 16 November 1986.</P>
      <P>From 17 November 1986 she was paid £54.75, that is, £41.10 personal rate and an increase of £18.65 in respect of four qualified child dependants.  She has been awarded an invalidity pension from 29 January 1987 at the rate of £67.60, that is, £47.10 personal rate and an increase of £20.50 in respect of four qualified child dependants.</P>
      <P>In any case where a claimant is entitled to payment of half the child dependants rate, the rate payable is that applicable to the pension or benefit in question. Thus the husband of the couple was paid at the rate appropriate to a person on invalidity pension while his wife was paid at the rate appropriate to a person on disability benefit to 29 January 1987 when she qualified for an invalidity pension. Since that date the rate paid to each person in respect of their children is the same.</P>

      <P>The claimant failed to attend for examination by a medical referee on 16 January 1987.  Accordingly, he was notified that payment of disability benefit was being disallowed for the statutory period of nine weeks from 31 January 1987.  The claimant then notified the Department that he had returned to work on 22 December 1986.  This has resulted in an overpayment of £537.80 for the period 22 December 1986 to 31 January 1987.  If the person concerned has uncashed benefit cheques in his possession, he should return them to the Department.  They can then be cancelled and deducted from the amount of the assessed overpayment. The person concerned has claimed that he did not receive three cheques which have been issued to him since he resumed employment.  The matter has been referred to an inspector of the Department for urgent investigation.  When the investigations are completed, the extent of the overpayment will be reconsidered in the light of the report.  Any overpayment still outstanding will have to be recouped to the Department.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit at the rate of £41.10 per week and pay-related benefit at the rate of £8.99 per week until 22 April 1987 when his entitlement to pay-related benefit was exhausted.</P>
      <P>It was not therefore to his advantage to transfer to the pension before 23 April 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available regardless of nationality to any person permanently resident in the State who is aged 66 years or over.  In addition the scheme covers blind persons aged 18 years or over and recipients of invalidity pension from the Department of Social Welfare or disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health board and also recipients of British invalidity pension where the pension is in payment for an unbroken period of a year.</P>
      <P>The scheme was extended in 1982 to British invalidity pensioners because of the fact that so many people living in Ireland are in receipt of such pensions which are broadly similar to the Irish invalidity pension scheme.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme does not come within the scope of EC social security regulations and the question as to who should be eligible under the scheme is a matter for decision by the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>The administration costs of the Department are not broken down in such a way as to enable the costs associated with a particular programme to be identified.</P>
      <P>The variations referred to in the question relate to the overall administration costs of the Department and not to those relating solely to unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>A reduction in overall administration costs in 1984 over 1983 arose because of a once-off payment in 1983 of arrears of £8 million approximately to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of postal and agency charges for previous years.  But for that payment, 1984 would have shown an increase of £7 million approximately over 1983.  The increases in administration costs in one year over the immediately prior year arise largely because of increases in the Department's pay bill, postal and agency charges and other administration charges such as travelling and incidental expenses, office machinery and consultancy services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the inception of the PRSI system in 1979, any person who is the legitimate holder of a current medical services card has been exempt from payment of the health contribution, youth employment levy and the former income levy, and the liability transfers to the employer.  This is provided for in the various PRSI contribution classes, part 3 of each class being applicable to persons who hold medical cards.  Any &ldquo;rebate&rdquo; of contribution <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employee is therefore the liability of the employer.</P>
      <P>The Department has been in contact with the employer of the person concerned and it is understood that a difficulty has arisen arising out of the fact that the person concerned did not inform the employer of the existence of the medical card until after it had been withdrawn. In the circumstances, the Department is writing to the employer outlining the legal provisions governing the transfer of liability for certain components of the contribution from employees to employers in medical card cases.</P>

From 8 January 1987, the entitlement to benefit of the person concerned depended on his insurance record in the 1985-86 contribution year.  He has 34 contributions recorded on his behalf during this year, which entitles him to payment of benefit at the reduced rate of £38 per week.  He would need a minimum of 48 contributions to qualify for payment of benefit at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>He was also paid pay-related benefit from 28 January 1986, ninteenth day of incapacity, to 9 April 1987, when his 62½ week entitlement to this benefit was exhausted.  All benefit payable has been issued to the person concerned to 2 May 1987.</P>

      <P>The distribution of persons employed by the Exchequer-funded bodies under the aegis of my Department, by age and sex, is set out in Table I.  Information on marital status is no longer available.</P>
      <P>I assume in relation to the breakdown of the places of employment by planning regions of persons employed by the Exchequer-funded bodies under the aegis of my Department that the Deputy requires a figure for the totals working in each of the planning regions.  The relevant figures are set out in Table II.  These figures do not include those employed by the bodies in their overseas offices.  For the purpose of this reply, the planning regions are those used by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to see that natural gas is widely available.  However, I must stress that extensions of the natural gas grid must take account of the economic viability of each project.  The proximity to existing pipelines and the existence of markets sufficient to justify the substantial cost required to extend the transmission system must be major considerations.  The prospects for providing a spur to areas such as Wexford are, of course, dependent on these considerations.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Gais Éireann that they have had discussions with Wexford Gas Company from time to time to examine the viability of a natural gas supply to Wexford town.  I understand, however, that these discussions have not reached a conclusion yet.</P>

      <P>BGE were requested on 18 March 1987 <Col N="132" /> to re-examine the proposed north eastern pipeline project on the basis of an alternate route for the pipeline which would serve population centres north of Dublin and be within reach of the horticulture industry.  The original proposal from Bord Gáis Éireann envisaged a pipeline going directly north from Abbotstown in Dublin to Drogheda with no allowance being made for any offtake of gas along the way.  It seemed appropriate to use the opportunity to tap into the large potential gas market in north County Dublin and the horticulture industry in particular. The route now proposed is the outcome of BGE's consideration of all the market potential cost considerations.</P>
      <P>The route for the pipeline as planned at present will take it north-eastwards from Abbotstown to Ballough in north County Dublin and north-westward from there to Platin and Drogheda and onwards to Dundalk.  Offtakes to Lusk, Donabate, Rush and Skerries are planned from Ballough.  A spur from Abbotstown is to serve the Santry-Swords-Malahide area.</P>
      <P>It is my expectation that the route as described would improve the financial and economic feasibility of the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The internationally accepted method of disposal of asbstos wastes is to suitably landfill disposal sites.  Asbestos waste arising in Ireland was largely exported to the UK for disposal by landfill until the coming into operation there on 1 January 1986 of the Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations, 1985.  The necessity to make suitable arrangements for the landfill disposal of asbestos waste has been emphasised to local authorities by my Department on several occasions.  I am not aware of the existence of any problem regarding the disposal of asbestos waste outside of the Dublin area where, I understand, quantities of asbestos waste had to be stored temporarily because proper facilities have not been provided within the area.  Much of the waste is now being exported to France for disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asbestos waste in dust and fibre form is one of the 27 listed categories of toxic and dangerous waste which are subject to control under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982.  The county councils, county borough corporations and Dún Laoghaire Corporation are responsible under the regulations for the planning, organisation and supervision of toxic and dangerous waste disposal operations in <Col N="145" /> their areas, as well as for the authorisation of storage, treatment and deposit of such wastes.  They are obliged to prepare special waste plans designed to ensure that toxic and dangerous waste is disposed of without endangering human health or harming the environment. My main role in this area lies in the provision of the appropriate framework of legislation and regulations for the local authorities in the discharge of their functions in relation to waste.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Act, 1953, gives a road authority statutory power to declare a road over which there is a public right of way for vehicles, pedestrians and animals to be a public road. Before making such a declaration, the road authority must be satisfied that the road is of general public utility and it must publish in at least two newspapers circulating in their functional area a notice of their intention to consider the making of such a declaration.  The making of a public road declaration order is a reserved function.  Once the road has been declared a public road, the road authority becomes responsible for its maintenance and improvement.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the road authority to decide whether or not to declare a road to be a public road having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. I do not propose to interfere with the discretion enjoyed by road authorities in the exercise of this function.</P>

    <P>However, in the road grants notified to Dublin Corporation on 28 January 1987 two specific grants of £160,000 each were included for works at Watling Street <Col N="178" /> and Herberton Road Bridge.  Under the special amenity grants scheme, 11 grants valued at £285,000 were notified to Dublin Corporation on 9 March 1987 for projects in the Dublin South Central constituency.</P>
    <P>The road and special amenity grants were withdrawn on 23 March pending the Government's overall expenditure review prior to the budget.  The revised road grants notified on 9 April included the two grants referred to above.  I am at present reviewing the applications in the Department for special amenity grants.</P>

To date, no formal proposals in respect of its inner city flat complexes have been received from the corporation.  I am anxious that they should prepare, as soon as possible, a planned and phased programme of refurbishment works for such dwellings. <Col N="179" /> A task force, representative of my Department and the corporation has been established to assist in drawing up proposals.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the special grant allocation for county road strengthening.</P>
      <P>On 28 January 1987 grants totalling £10 million were allocated to local authorities for county road strengthening on the basis of domestic water charges collected in each area.  On 23 March, road grant allocations generally were withdrawn as part of a general review of financial provisions for 1987 made in the context of the budget of 31 March.  On 9 April revised allocations were notified to local authorities which included an increased provision of £15 million for county roads strengthening.  This sum was allocated on the basis of the county road mileage in each county, which I consider to be a more appropriate basis for the allocation than that provided for in the grants allocated on 28 January.  On this basis, the original allocation of £322,000 to Kildare County Council was revised to £315,000.</P>

      <P>On 30 September 1986 my predecessor announced that four major improvement projects (including the Dunleer by-pass) would be carried out on a fixed price design/construct basis. This procedure had not previously been used for road works in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A motorway order for the Dunleer scheme was confirmed in August 1986. In December last, Louth County Council invited submissions from interested parties by 23 January, 1987 for inclusion on a panel from which tenders would be invited.</P>
      <P>Following consultations with interested parties in the building industry, it became clear that they had certain reservations about the new procedure which would necessitate major revisions to the standard conditions of contract currently in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> My Department is at present completing a report on the use of the design/construct system of contract to enable me to decide whether to proceed with its introduction for road works. There will be no avoidable delay in reaching a decision on this issue.</P>
    <P>Subject to that decision, I expect the local authority to be in a position to seek tenders for the scheme by the early part of 1988.  A road grant of £500,000 has been provided in the current year to enable the local authority to proceed with land acquisition and other preparatory work.  In December 1986 the EC approved a special transport infrastructure grant of 4 million ECUs towards the cost of the project, 1.6 million ECUs of which was received in January 1987.</P>

In any event, the 1979 concession was revoked by Article 6 of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1985 (S.I.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 580, 581 and 582 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's primary concern in regard to the low frequency electro-magnetic fields which arise from electricity carrying power lines is as to whether there is any epidemiological evidence of an unusual incidence of ailments which <Col N="242" /> might point to a possible association with these fields.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any epidemiological findings which have established that there is an unusual incidence of ailments among people who live near electricity carrying power lines.  I understand that while, internationally, over a number of years a variety of illnesses have been alleged to have been associated with living under high tension power lines, large properly conducted trials have not to date substantiated any of these claims.  Leukaemia and other malignancies have been the subject of suspicion at times but haematological and enzymatic tests have not shown a causal association between any such conditions and living under high tension power lines.</P>
    <P>A report was published in 1984 under the joint sponsorship of the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organisation, and the International Radiation Protection Association on Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Fields.  The report commented on studies in the United States which reported an increased incidence of leukaemia and adult cancer among people living near high tension power lines.  The report emphasised the preliminary nature and limitation of these studies and concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>The preliminary nature of the epidemiological findings on the increased incidence of cancer among children and adults exposed to ELF fields from electric wiring and the relatively small increment in reported incidence suggest that, although the epidemiological data cannot be dismissed, there must be considerable study before they can serve as useful imputs for risk assessment.</P>
    <P>The report also stated as follows:</P>
    <P>Whilst it would be prudent in the present state of scientific knowledge not to make unqualified statements about the safety of intermittent exposure to electric fields, there is no need to limit access to regions where the field strength is below 10 kV/m. <Col N="243" /> Even at this field strength, some individuals may experience uncomfortable secondary physical phenomena such as spark discharge, shocks, or stimulation of the tactile sense.</P>
    <P>It is not possible from present knowledge to make a definitive statement about the safety or hazard associated with long-term exposure to sinusoidal electric fields in the range of 1-10 kV/m.  In the absence of specific evidence of particular risk or disease syndromes associated with such exposure, and in view of experimental findings on the biological effects of exposure, it is recommended that efforts be made to limit exposure, particularly as low as can be reasonably achieved.</P>
    <P>I understand that international research in this area is continuing.  If I receive any substantiated epidemiological evidence of a health risk associated with electricity carrying power lines I will take up the issue immediately with my colleague the Minister for Energy and with the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>Within the constraints imposed by the overall level of resources available every effort is made to ensure that the Church of Ireland bodies aided by my Department are funded adequately.  This policy is reflected in the level of funding provided for the Church of Ireland College of Education for primary teachers (staff pay costs are met in full and a grant is made towards the running costs of the college and the juniorate, Coláiste Móibhí), in the fact that small national schools are paid a capitation grant at a minimum rate, and in the grant paid to the Education Committee of the Church of Ireland Representative Body towards the cost of transporting eligible children to school by private means where they live outside the range of school transport services.</P>

      <Col N="250" /> In so far as the post primary sector is concerned I am satisfied that the level of grant payable to the Secondary Education Committee for Protestant Schools, on which the Church of Ireland is represented, is generous given current financial constraints.</P>
    <P>The grant is administered by the Secondary Education Committee and the distribution of the grant is left to the committee's discretion.  It is a matter for that body and for the management authorities of the schools concerned to arrange that full services would be continued in future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 596 and 597 together.  In accordance with the regulations governing the operation of the European Social Fund in the years in question, it was necessary for my Department to submit its application for <Col N="251" /> aid by September of the year preceding the commencement of the programme. Accordingly, the estimated unit costs underlying the application were based on historical data, without access to financial data for the year immediately preceding. It will be recalled that the period in question was one of considerable fluctuation in the cost inputs in the education system due to high inflation and escalating pay costs.  The significant variations discovered in the course of the audit of the established costs demonstrate the difficulty in anticipating the likely unit costs two years in advance.</P>
      <P>Returns of expenditure by VECs have to be based on procedures of general application.  In so far as there are variations these may relate to either differing interpretations of the procedures and/or to different levels of fixed costs.  My Department is most concerned about the variations in unit costs and these variations have been, <i>inter alia,</i> the subject of detailed discussion with the staff of the VECs on an annual basis.  A consultative council established by order of the Minister for Education under section 104 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, to examine the procedures for the allocation and control of expenditure of vocational education committees is considering the establishment of a comprehensively analysed financial information system for vocational education committees.</P>

It is expected that <Col N="259" /> it will be possible to commence preliminary planning of the Blanchardstown college late this year.  It is not possible to give a time scale in either case as progress is subject to the constraints on capital resources.</P>

      <P>The principal advantages sought from the use of system building in national schools are: cost efficiency, speed of erection, relative ease of maintenance over a period of at least 15 years and fixed-price contracts.  It is expected that cost savings of at least 35 per cent can be achieved as compared with traditional building methods in situations where it may be appropriate to use system building. As the number of projects in which system building has been used in major national school schemes has been relatively few and as it would not be the intention to use the system building approach in all projects being grant aided by my Department, I am not in a position to quantify expected overall economies by reference to the annual cost of the national schools building programme.</P>

I appreciate that this represents a decrease in NALA's grant-in-aid over last year's provision. Current economic circumstances are such, however, that a reduction in public expenditure is essential if the Government is to restore our public finances to a sound footing.

      <P>Tenders have been received for the building project at St. Patrick's Loreto national school, Bray, County Wicklow.  The tender recommended for acceptance by the school authorities is considered to be excessive for the work involved.  A recent meeting took place in my Department with the school authorities and their consultants with a view to achieving suitable reductions and a submission was subsequently made to my <Col N="278" /> Department on the matter.  Certain proposals are currently under consideration, and a decision will be communicated to the school authorities at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Because of the extent to which my Department's 1987 allocation of capital for the national schools building programme had already been committed prior to my assuming office, I am not in a position at this stage to say when the placing of a contract for the project at St. Patrick's Loreto national school may be authorised and the work begun.  I will, however, be keeping under close review the rate of expenditure on national schools under construction, and if the possibility emerges within the current financial year of releasing the project to contract the required authorisation will be given subject of course to compliance with the usual regulations and procedures covering national schools building grants.</P>

Working drawings and bills of quantities are in the course of preparation and will be completed at the earliest possible date.

To this end my Department will continue to pursue vigorously its policy of rationalisation in the provision of second level facilities, to ensure the maximum utilisation of all existing resources.</P>
      <P>Consultations will take place with the different management bodies to secure the level of agreement necessary for the successful implementation of this policy. Where rationalisation is not practicable my Department will take all possible initiatives to encourage schools to explore, expand and further develop areas of co-operation with a view to providing the best possible educational opportunity for all their pupils.</P>
