      <P>and <b>Mr. Boland</b> asked the Taoiseach if he intends transferring responsibility for horse racing from the Department of Agriculture and Food to the sports section in the Department of Education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that the Taoiseach, when he had a little time in the past, used to share an interest that few of us in this House have in relation to horse racing.  Will he not agree there are many thousands who attend horse race meetings as a sport and that as long as the responsibility for horse racing, as distinct from the horse breeding industry, <Col N="2108" /> remains with the Department of Agriculture and Food, as a sport it will not get its fair share of funds nationally?  The second part of my question related to whether there was any proposal to allocate a small sum from the national lottery to national hunt racing to compensate for the £250,000 allocated last year towards prize money for national hunt racing? That was my main purpose in asking the Taoiseach if he could find a way of regarding horse racing as a sport.  By so doing, we could benefit to some extent from the proceeds of the national lottery to help, in particular, national hunt racing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry to have to say I think the Deputy is totally misleading himself in this matter.  The horse racing industry is undoubtedly a source of relaxation for many and it also contributes to the attractiveness of this country for the tourist.  Basically, I see the racing industry as an essential part of the bloodstock breeding industry and the bloodstock breeding industry, in my view, belongs in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The racing industry as such, because of its very close association with the bloodstock breeding industry, should be looked after by the same Department as the bloodstock breeding industry: therefore, it should remain with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I think there is very little argument about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Taoiseach is referring to the bloodstock industry. I recognise it is a very important industry here.  However, there are very many thousands who attend race meetings, not to support an industry but purely as a sport.  The Taoiseach is, no doubt, aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree we need to do something radical in relation to horse racing as a sport, as distinct from the industry, to encourage that sport, to help to obtain proper facilities and to encourage more people into the sport?  In fact, I should be far happier &mdash; and I am sure the Taoiseach would agree &mdash; if the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has a particular interest in horse racing and horse breeding, had some part to play in promoting that industry.  As long as it remains the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food there is no chance whatsoever of this industry expanding properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That there is a racing board there which has a specific statutory responsibility for the racing industry and that the Department of Agriculture and Food are responsible for the bloodstock breeding industry, with which the racing industry is very closely associated, is the best possible arrangement.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary question.  Is the Taoiseach aware that in <Col N="2111" /> Australia, which has a very successful horse racing industry and a very suchorse racing sport, the Minister for Sport is responsible for racing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that matters such as the tote and proper funding of racing in this country need to be seriously looked at?  To date there is no evidence that the Department of Agriculture and Food with all their responsibilities &mdash; particularly now in Europe &mdash; have the time or the expertise to deal with the proper promotion for horse racing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say by way of a concluding reply is that, as the Deputy knows, we now have the Killanin report from the Commission which I established some years ago and which report is now available to us.  It is on the basis of that report that any decisions that are necessary can be taken. The Deputy will understand it is under examination at the moment.  Any appropriate action that has to be taken will arise out of the examination of that report.  It is not quite right for the Deputy to suggest that nothing is being done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister with responsibility for sport should not be in the Department of Education.  This is very disappointing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="2112" /> for Agriculture and Food (a) when the EC accepted Ireland's application for pig processing plants which allowed the Twenty-six Counties to be eligible for 50 per cent FEOGA grants; (b) in view of the indication given that he expected to have four plants eligible for export licences of United States Department of Agriculture standards at the end of the year the number which have been sanctioned for grant aid by the IDA, and the number which have been submitted for planning permission to county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC regulation providing for 50 per cent grant aid for all pigmeat processing plants in Ireland was approved by the Council of Ministers in early February 1987.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, one of the greatest needs of the pigmeat industry is the provision of modern well equipped slaughtering and processing facilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed at a meeting of the Council on 9 February 1987. The introduction of the increased grants for pigmeat projects coincided with a sharp reduction in the aggregate amount of funds made available by the Commission to finance the FEOGA project scheme.  The Department made strong representations to the Commission for additional funds to finance the higher level of grants and the Commission agreed on 10 March 1987 to make available an additional 20 million ECUs, which is £15 million, over three years by way of an advance of FEOGA moneys under the FEOGA grant project scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="2113" /> Agriculture and Food the number of herds tested and the number of cattle tested expressed in numbers and as percentages of the national herd under the bovine TB eradication scheme for the 1986-87 round of testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 115,300 herd tests and some seven million animal tests, which are equivalent to 62.3 per cent and 100 per cent respectively of the national herd, were carried out during the 1986-87 bovine TB eradication programme just ended.  These figures include some cases where the same herd was tested more than once during the round and this means that the number of individual herds and animals tested, for which precise figures are not readily available, would be somewhat lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the concern expressed by farmers that despite the doubling of the levies there will not be a full round of testing this year, will the Minister take the opportunity to put that concern to rest and assure farmers that there will be a full round of testing in the current year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that 63 per cent of herds were tested last year and I should like to know if it was because of a lack of finance that a full round of testing was not carried out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there was a decrease in the budgetary allocation for the scheme last <Col N="2114" /> year.  The funding for the scheme was £24.5 million and the amount spent was £26.2 million compared with £34 million required for a full test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to confirms the Department's view that classical swine fever virus can survive in uncooked lightly cured pigmeat products. At a recent Council of Ministers meeting the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, urged the EC Commission to act upon the report with a view to affording adequate protection to those member states which are free from swine fever.  My UK and Danish collegues did likewise.  I understand that the Commission will shortly be presenting an appropriate proposal to the Council to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>The main substitutable imports are: meat, £58.5 million, vegetables £45 million, breakfast cereals £28 million, biscuits, pastry and cakes, £39 million and sugar, £19 million.  That relates to the area of processed foods which can be substituted for here at home.  The overall processed food import bill for 1986 was £508 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have already taken steps in this regard by expanding the focus of the Department to that of Agriculture and Food.  The Government have established an office of food and an office of horticulture to give greater impetus to development in those areas and they have increased levels of grant-aid for food processing plants so that we can compete with imports.

      <P>The IDA Natural Resources Division are doing an extremely effective job in this area.  If there has been a lack of response up to now it could be argued that it was from the industry side.

If that is so I suggest that those manufacturing products based on sugar as a raw material are at a distinct disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> imports, due to the cost of sugar here as a raw material ingredient for food processors.  To give manufacturers here a fair crack of the whip we might be able to apply MCAs to imported products with a sugar content which have free market access now and which come from an area where there are far cheaper raw materials due to the MCAs and other considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Investments in the dairy sector have not been eligible for grant-aid from FEOGA since 1983 because of the Commission's concern that such aid towards investments in processing facilities would stimulate an increase in milk production.  However, following representations from Ireland, it was agreed, in the context of the price negotiations for 1986-87, that dairy projects would be eligible under the FEOGA grants scheme provided they did not relate to intervention products or did not lead to increased production capacity.  The Commission decision was taken on 23 March 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 28 and priority Question No. 36 together.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to a parliamentary question on 1 April last, a submission was lodged with the European Commission on 4 February 1987 concerning the reclassification of all the existing less severely handicapped areas as well as areas where mountain sheep headage grants are paid to more severely handicapped status.  While we are pressing to have these proposals approved, the final outcome will largely depend on the attitude adopted by the EC Commission. It is not possible to say at this stage when the final response from the Commission will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>No funding was committed in the Estimates for 1987 by the previous administration to cover the costs of reclassification which must be fully met by the Exchequer in the first year.  In this situation, the necessary provision for the additional headage payments could not be made in this year's budget.  However, I can assure the House that I will continue to press the case for reclassification of areas as I am most anxious to have the matter finalised so that the accruing benefits can be enjoyed by Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>I am reviewing the current arrangements for the management of the bovine TB scheme.  As I have already informed the House, my approach to changes will be influenced by the need to demonstrate clearly that any new arrangements will be more effective in eradicating TB, will safeguard our substantial export interests and will be cost effective.  The support of the farming community and the co-operation of those currently engaged on the schemes are important factors also.  I am examining recent proposals from the farming organisations for changes in the organisational and operational aspects of the schemes. I shall not be in a position to adopt a final position until consultations have taken place with the principal parties concerned and a comprehensive evaluation of all the issues involved has been made.</P>

As we have had only a relatively short time for discussions, we are not yet in a position to say what the final form will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Treacy on his recent appointment and to wish him the best of luck in his term of office.  I am glad to have this opportunity of addressing the House on this Bill.  I have already had an opportunity of addressing the Seanad, I am reasonably familiar with the Bill so I intend to be brief.</P>
      <P>The Bill is most welcome and not before its time.  It is a vast improvement on the existing Acts of 1930 and 1954. However, it is recognised that the Bill has limitations and that it will have to be improved as has been acknowledged by the Minister.  The Bill is more of a stop gap and interim measure than the ultimate solution to the problem.  However, if it succeeds in its main objectives, namely, the curbing of the use of metal detectors, the protection of our historical ruins, the setting up of a strong academically based historical monuments council and the compilation of a register of national monuments it will be very effective legislation and should have every opportunity of success.</P>
      <P>The Bill has a special relevance to my own county.  Kerry has a dense concentration of surviving archaeological field monuments and is rich in marine archaeology.  Over 300,000 people visit the National Park, Killarney, Ross Castle and the Skellig Rock every year.  These places are very popular with tourists and attract these great numbers every summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> Prior to the publication of the Ordnance Survey six inch map in the 1840s, we knew very little about the destruction caused to our national monuments but it would propably have been worse in the eastern part of the country because of the level of agricultural activity.  It would not have been as great in the west because of traditions and superstitions and also because it was believed that if you interfered with a fort, a curse would befall your family.  These traditions have now died out and the religious aspect no longer protects forts.  Over the last 15 years, especially since we joined the EC, the countryside has lost numerous ring forts.  In the Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry, a recent survey revealed that since the six inch maps were produced in 1841, over 55 per cent of the ring forts in the Dingle Peninsula have gone from the countryside.  Various surveys which have been carried out reveal that 70 per cent of the ring forts in the Cork harbour district have been destroyed.  Professor Barry of Trinity College has carried out numerous surveys on marine archaeology. Research undertaken by him has shown that many of the 13th century and 14th century mediaeval moated sites &mdash; these are rectangular earthworks &mdash; have been destroyed.  He carried out surveys in the early seventies in Counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Wexford and found that 52 per cent of all known moated sites had either been completely removed or greatly modified since the 1840s.  Less than 20 moated sites out of a total of 750 have been protected by the current legislation.  According to Professor Barry three of these protected sites have been levelled over the past 20 years and no prosecutions resulted.</P>
    <P>The destruction rate of archaeological monuments evidently has increased in recent times.  Hence the need for this Bill.  The penalties for the destruction of archaeological sites and monuments needed to be updated.  As previous speakers said, the 1930 and 1954 Acts were totally ineffective.  I would like the Minister to inform the House how many <Col N="2249" /> successful prosecutions were made under the 1930 and 1954 Acts.</P>
    <P>One of the main areas of concern in recent times has been the unrestricted use of metal detectors.  Treasure hunting has become very popular since the discovery of the Derrynaflan Hoard.  Evidence from reliable sources shows that bands of treasure hunters are operating throughout the country.  Many of these groups are Irish but we are also attracting treasure hunters from the Continent. These people are very well organised and use modern equipment.  They are fine combing various archaeological sites.  For example, sites at Clonmacnoise and Cashel and other recognised archaeological sites have been centres of destruction by these people.</P>
    <P>At a conference held recently in Dublin, concern was expressed by a number of people about treasure hunting and the lack of control over people using metal detectors.  This supports my fear about the use of metal detectors.  At this conference Michael Foster, secretary of the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants, said that very few treasure hunters reported finds and did so only on the basis of a sale.  Of the known 170 treasure hunters only 11 have ever donated anything to the State.  He said that these gangs are well organised and highly professional robbers who are clinically and systematically robbing this country of its prehistoric gold and silver and its Anglo-Saxon and Viking treasures.</P>
    <P>At the same conference Mr. Edward Kelly of the National Museum echoed similar sentiments.  Mr. Kelly claimed that Ireland is being actively promoted abroad, particularly in Germany, as a venue for illegal treasure hunting. According to Mr. Kelly it is estimated that even small scale operators can make £25,000 a year from the illegal export trade; yet the present maximum fine is only £50.  The increase in fines which can now range up to £50,000 and a possible penalty of 12 months in prison on conviction should serve as a deterrent to would-be treasure hunters.  However, the fact that the Garda have not been given <Col N="2250" /> power of search and seizure is a definite weakness in the legislation.  I would like the Minister to clarify who will have power to prosecute.  Will it be the Garda Síochána or the commissioners and what power will the Garda have in order to ensure convictions?</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the destruction of ring forts throughout the country and, in particular, in County Kerry.  In most cases ring forts have been destroyed in the name of agricultural progress especially since we joined the EC.  In many cases farmers have been advised to go ahead and bulldoze ring forts out of their property to allow ploughing or the movement of agricultural machinery to take place.  It is vitally important that agricultural advisers especially are made aware of the damage being caused by the agricultural community to our national monuments.  If farmers were made aware of the damage that is being done most of them would desist from levelling these forts.</P>
    <P>The Ardagh Challice, one of our greatest treasures, was discovered in a ring fort very close to where I live in County Kerry.  It was found by a young lad who was setting cabbage in the fort and it was a coincidence that he found it.  Many other ring forts which have been destroyed could have contained similar treasure.  However, no opportunity was given to have these sites excavated or surveyed.  It is very important that the register of national monuments is drawn up as soon as possible and includes many ring forts that are of archaeological importance.  The sooner this is done the better.</P>
    <P>This Bill will ensure that a farmer or developer will have to inform the Commissers of Public Works at least two months in advance that he intends to carry out work on an archaeological site or area.  This must be welcomed. However, in order to prevent the further loss of ring forts this legislation must be enacted as soon as possible and the national register must be brought up to date.</P>
    <P>On the subject of underwater heritage, we are very fortunate in County Kerry to <Col N="2251" /> have a wealth of offshore wrecks.  Some of these wrecks go back to the time of the visitors from the Nordic countries, others to the time of the various forces which came to the aid of Ireland during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and others still to the time of the many ships that visited Ireland during their voyages across the Atlantic, many of which foundered off the Kerry coast.  I will refer later to one of the bigger ships in the Spanish Armada, the <i>Santa Maria De la Rosa,</i> which now lies in 110 feet of water in the Blasket Sound.</P>
    <P>Marine archaelogy has been neglected and if it were not for the activities of sports divers many wrecks would never have been discovered.  It is now time for a co-ordinated policy on the excavation of historical wrecks.  Up to now the approach has been totally haphazard. Amateur divers without any knowledge of what they were doing brought up many objects from the sea bed and as a result of exposure to the atmosphere these objects withered away.  There is definite scope for many maritime museums to be established in Ireland.  Going back to the <i>Santa Maria De la Rosa,</i> Henry Wignall who excavated the wreck promised at the time that he would set up a museum in Dingle to display these objects.  However, there is no trace of either Mr. Wignall or the objects at this stage and I would like the Minister to outline where evenutally these important artefacts did end up.</P>
    <P>Section 3 seeks to introduce controls to ensure that a satisfactory recovery and conservation procedure is followed but again, as has been mentioned, the emphasis seems to be on conservation rather than on excavation.  Indeed, conservation alone is not enough.  Many diving clubs are annoyed about this Bill. They must get credit for the work they have done in the past.  They have located many wrecks and pointed out their location to the commission.  However, this Bill will now restrict their work.  As I have mentioned already, it is not good enough just to conserve something if we have not got a policy on excavation. Wrecks are just one aspect of underwater <Col N="2252" /> archaeology.  Crannogs and early habitation sites have been preserved intact over many centuries by reason of being under water.  I hope section 3 will provide adequate protection for this aspect of underwater archaeology also.  Indeed, I do not see any reference in the Bill to crannogs and early habitation sites but no doubt I am sure they are covered in some way.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the subject of marine archaeology I would now like to refer briefly to archaeology in relation to our bogs.  Again, I do not see any reference in the Bill to the preservation of our bogs which are known to have possessed archaeological objects.  Indeed, excavation works in our bogs during the past 100 years or so have unearthed many gold, bronze and stone objects which were lost or buried there by ancient inhabitants of this country.  Indeed, the National Museum have many splendid examples of jewellery, swords and domestic articles made from gold and bronze and discovered by people cutting turf in bogs.  Some examples are the splendid necklace which was found at Derrybrien, County Galway, which I am sure Deputy Treacy is familiar with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and also a gold dress fastener which was found in Killymoon, County Tyrone.  In a bog near Cullen, County Tipperary, many bronze swords and unique gold objects were uncovered during the last century but unfortunately most of these objects were destroyed.  The people who found them took them to the local jeweller following which most were melted down.  Fortunately, some have survived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the change in agricultural practices.  We have progressed from very primitive agricultural practices to the use of heavy machinery. In bogs, we have progressed from the use of the slean to heavy turf cutting machinery.  It is now rare to see people in a bog using the traditional slean.  These big turf cutting machines have no respect <Col N="2253" /> for the objects they come across and usually if the object is not destroyed completely it is mangled to such a degree as to be beyond recognition as was the case when a crozier was discovered in a bog near Tullamore, County Offaly, quite recently.  While I am on the topic, I would like to point out that one of the most treasured pieces of our early Christian art, the Moylough belt-shrine was found by someone cutting turf in County Sligo.</P>
    <P>As I said, the slean has now been replaced by heavy machinery and I am sure we have lost out considerably as a result.  It is very hard to prevent progress and I ask the Minister whether it is his intention under this Bill to declare certain bogs as archaeological areas?  Numerous efforts have been made at preserving bogs for reasons such as preserving the fauna and flora which are to be found on them and so forth.  Would the preservation of our bogs for archaeological purposes not be as good a reason?  Does this Bill give the Minister the power to put preservation orders on bogs?</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the register of historical monuments.  Under the new Bill a register will be established and it gives rise to much concern that out of the 150,000 monuments in this country only 700 are under the care of the commissioners and restoration work is being carried out on 48 of these.  It supports the case for the compilation as soon as possible of a national register of historical monuments.  Various inventories have been made.  For example, last year the then Minister, Deputy Doyle, launched the archaeological inventory of County Louth and also sites and monuments records of counties Meath, Carlow and Wicklow.  Reports on the urban archaeology of surveys of Laois, Offaly and Dublin city were compiled.  At the moment further sites and monuments surveys for Donegal and Wexford are in progress.  It has been stated that by 1990 it is hoped that an inventory or register will be available for all the country, but this is a little ambitious at the rate of present progress.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the Minister is aware of the work being carried out by AnCO at the <Col N="2254" /> moment in the line of numerous surveys throughout the country.  For example, in County Kerry they have completed a survey in the Dingle peninsula, identifying many field monuments of whose existence people had been unaware.  A survey is taking place at present in south Kerry and the Castleisland area and in my own area of north Kerry.  I visited the office of the north Kerry survey quite recently.  The people involved have discovered many promontory forts which traditionally were never associated with that area.  These discoveries have been made mostly by means of aerial photography. Many archaeological sites and monuments not known of previously have been discovered.</P>
    <P>I ask the commissioners to co-operate as much as possible with AnCO.  When drawing up an inventory of County Kerry they should use the scientific material available to them from these surveys. That would, no doubt, save much money. There could be a greater role for AnCO in the preservation of many monuments, especially old ruins of castles, abbeys and churches.  Many of our monuments are being weathered and eroded because of the lack of preservation.  There could be a role for AnCO, under the supervision of the Office of Public Works, in this whole area.  AnCO could, at least, plaster the tops of walls to prevent rain from percolating through, to eliminate freezethaw action which is a major destroyer of buildings.  Ivy should be taken off some of these buildings because it is an agent of erosion and I can see a role for AnCO there.  At the moment preservation is going on and Ross Castle is being renovated.  However it has taken seven years to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>If the commissioners are to get around to restoring all our national monuments, it will take a long time.  There must be room for another agency to help with this type of work.  The Minister could make inquiries.  Recently during the course of a sewerage scheme in Listowel an old cave was discovered which had been in the folklore of the area.  As in most circumstances like this, the cave was closed up.  It links the old castle in Listowel with <Col N="2255" /> a similar type castle about half a mile away.  I have been requested to ask the Minister if it would be possible for the commission to survey the site, trace the cave and make a record for the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on the proposed new historical monuments council, which will replace the existing National Monuments Advisory Council. On the present advisory council I understand there are only two members within a line drawn from Galway to Dublin and certainly a number of people involved in the Kerry Archaeological Society have expressed reservations about the present membership of that council.  They fear that on the future historical monuments council areas like Kerry will not be adequately represented.  I realise that section 14 gives authorisation to local authorities to establish historical monuments advisory committees.  However, from my experience on a local authority, most committees are very ineffective and I have no reason to feel that historical monuments advisory committees will be any different.  If the membership is composed of county councillors with, in most cases, very little interest in our national monuments, the committees are doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>I express reservations about the composition of the proposed membership of the new historical monuments council. Although it is strongly academically based, nevertheless it will suffer from the absence of lay people who in many cases have a lot more experience on the ground than academics who might research certain aspects of archaeology.  These local historical monuments advisory committees should be composed of members of the general public.  If they are to be effective, they should be composed of members of the teaching profession, especially history teachers, of agricultural services such as ACOT and the farm development services, the local archaeological societies, the legal profession and religious orders.  It is important that they should be as widely representative as possible and that the <Col N="2256" /> committees are set up for the right reasons.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will emphasise as much as possible the importance of local authorities taking these local historical monuments advisory committees seriously.  Very few local authorities established such committees and that is a pity.  In my view most of the problems that surfaced in the past were due to ignorance and a lack of awareness of the importance of our historical monuments. The proposed advisory council should ensure that the public are educated about the value of our historical monuments.  We should put an obligation on our younger people to preserve those monuments for future generations.  It is a pity that in our schools whose curricula are exam orientated our children are not been made more aware of the historical importance of the many monuments that are in our country.  There should be a greater emphasis on educating our young people about our historical past.</P>
    <P>I notice that Deputy Doherty is anxious to make a contribution to the debate and I am sure he will deal with this topic in great detail because of his interest in tourism.  It is worth noting that in 1985 more than 750,000 people visited our ancient monuments and heritage sites.  More than 500,000 visited Glendalough. The Killarney National Park has proved very popular with visitors and last year more than 300,000 people visited it. It is important that we produce proper tourist guides so that visitors to our country do not have any difficulty in locating monuments and sites of historical interest.  In most cases those sites are located in out-of-the-way places and it is difficult for strangers to find them.</P>
    <P>Last year while in Crete I visited the Palace of Knossos and while I found it to be a wonderful site I do not think it can compare with some Irish sites.  I had to queue for three hours to visit the place and pay a hefty charge.  I suggest that our monuments and historical sites be supervised at all times to prevent souvenir hunters damaging them.  Coming from an area that is steeped in history I recognise the importance of a piece of <Col N="2257" /> legislation like this and I hope it will get a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I expect that its provisions will curtail the activities of those who use metal detectors in their search for items of historical interest.  The penalties listed in the Bill should prove a deterrent to such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasing to note the unanimity in the House in regard to this legislation.  That reflects the importance Members attach to the preservation of monuments and sites of historical significance. It is encouraging to note that many Members have devoted a lot of time preparing their contributions for this debate.  I accept the view of the Minister of State that he would like to have gone further in the legislation but because he had to comply with judicial decisions he had to confine the provisions in the Bill. However, it represents a major step forward. I hope we will awaken in the minds of the public a greater concern for the protection of our national monuments.  I appreciate the importance of our monuments to the tourist industry and I am aware that the numbers visiting those attractions is rising annually.  Other countries have attractions for visitors but very few of them have historical monuments like Ireland.  We should give our visitors an opportunity to study and appreciate our heritage which is the key to understanding Irish men and women and why we are so great in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort should be made to ensure we do not let down our side by our failure to appreciate in a voluntary and in a statutory way the importance of our monuments and historical sites.  Over 660,000 people visit historic sites.  It is essential that the sites are maintained and developed and that they contain what they are advertised to contain.  That scenario can be achieved through the protection and preservation work undertaken.  A number of speakers have referred to the role of the National Manpower Service but the Office of Public Works have the overall responsibility. One of the difficulties is that many cultural <Col N="2258" /> bodies and organisations have a very legitimate role in relation to our heritage and there is a tendency to pass the buck from one to the other.  Later I will give a specific example of that in relation to a well known monument in my constituency.</P>
    <P>In Europe, as far back as 1980 there was a conference on the theme of Tourism and Conservation.  This was later followed by the European Architectural and Heritage Conference which was held in Brussels in March 1980 and which was organised under the auspices of the Council of Europe.  The Commission arranged a special session entitled Tourism and Conservation and the theme included architectural heritage as a tourist attraction, and as a source of financial support to conserve buildings.  This was of significant interest and importance. Europe has a lot to offer and hopefully after the referendum next week we will become more politically unified with Europe and I expect that we will place a greater emphasis on our buildings and on our ancient monuments and that we will recognise how important it is to protect them.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that tourism by its nature is a threat to many monuments. Visitors coming in large numbers to visit a national monument pose a serious risk for the monuments.  We should ensure a certain degree of protection where large numbers of tourists pose a risk.  Tourist activity can provide new uses for old buildings.  We could take encouragement from Bunratty Castle, Ashford House and such places which are a part of our heritage but which now cater for tourists. We should use our buildings in such a way as to protect and maintain them and to give something special to the tourism industry.  Bord Fáilte should have a special role in this.  The tourism industry should be able to contribute directly towards the protection and maintenance of our heritage and should enhance its quality.  Formal arrangements should be made to establish liaison between official tourist bodies and bodies concerned with conservation of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>National tourism plans and programmes <Col N="2259" /> should include our national heritage as a tourist resource.  It would be worthwhile achieving co-operation between the Office of Public Works and the Regional Tourism Organisation. Where we have national monuments in tourist regions, the Regional Tourism Organisation and the Office of Public Works should be involved in protecting and promoting the national monument. It is important that tourist organisations contribute to the programmes for conservation of our heritage.  There is a financial dimension here.  If the Office of Public Works are aware of a national monument or a piece of architectural heritage in a tourist area they should co-operate with the Regional Tourism Organisation in the promotion of that area.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having something of architectural value and importance and in maintaining it, without giving it prominence so that it can be appreciated and paid for by visitors.  It is important that there should be a clear link between the economic benefit each county receives from tourism and the scale of public expenditure on conservation of archaeological sites and buildings.  We recognise the enormous task imposed on Government at the moment, the scarcity of money and the importance of protecting our national monuments and of ensuring that those which have an economic importance to our tourist industry are developed and given the maximum prominence.  The interpretation of conservation is the cornerstone of the conservation and protection of our historic buildings and sites.  If we do not understand, appreciate and generally have a feel for this work, we will not have the commitment necessary to give the right type of protection and support.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Office of Public Works and their Minister for the quality of the guides who are working at various centres throughout the country.  They appear to have been very carefully selected and to have a specific understanding of what they are about.  They do not display a mechanical <Col N="2260" /> or robot-type of deportment or demeanour in bringing visitors around the various sites.  The OPW are to be commended on the thorough manner in which they selected these people.  I hope this will continue.  This is a wonderful method of ensuring that people who visit these sites will be informed in a special way and thus gain a respect for the sites.  From time to time we have all found ourselves in a queue waiting to visit a monument in a foreign country and because the guides there communicate so effectively the importance of what we are to see we remember our visit and become part of the protectorate of such monuments.</P>
    <P>The importance of theme should not be forgotten.  It is desirable that we should have at these sites some information available on the appropriate theme.  I have in mind the illustration of the life of St. Kevin at Glendalough which is very much appreciated by visitors since it gives them an in-depth understanding of the importance of the place.  Audio-visual aids, booklets and postcards are also important, but when a visitor becomes aware of the historical theme of a place a special intimacy develops.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is on Lough Key the burial place of Úna Bhán, bláth na ndlaoi ómra/do fuair sí bás de bharr droch chomhairle, a most beautiful poem which has been put to music.  It recounts the special romantic conditions prevailing at that time.  Perhaps it has a special relevance in a world which has a more false type of romance than had people of her period.  Certainly it would be important to illustrate that theme in Lough Key.  I will be speaking later on this point in another context.  I hope that the OPW will bear in mind the theme value of these sites in developing public appreciation and awareness.</P>
    <P>There are many islands in Lough Key &mdash; some say there are 32, one for each county.  Castle Island consists of one rood and 29 perches.  It has a number of 13th century buildings built by McDermott of the Rock.  The OPW own the island and the forestry people own the buildings, while the jetty is also the responsibility of the OPW.  This small <Col N="2261" /> island which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, visited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>An area of one rood and 29 perches should not be the responsibility of two Government Departments, both of which are highly respected bodies with individual Ministers of State, separate headquarters and specialised functions and duties.  It is not sensible that they should be engaged in the management, control, protection and development of one rood and 29 perches. Bord Fáilte are probably involved in the marketing context.</P>
      <P>I should like the OPW to have overall responsibility for sites of importance.  If this legislation gives the OPW a very special role, surely that role should not be made more bureaucratically difficult by involving another State Department. We all know what it takes to establish communication between Departments of State.  Those of us in public life know that to pull the strands together can be a mammoth task.  I hope the Minister will consider the realistic prospect of giving the OPW overall responsibility in these areas.  I give Castle Island and Trinity Island on Lough Key as examples.  The ruin of an old abbey and the burial place of Úna Bhán are there.  There is a crypt and, believe it or not, to my regret I have been told that some of the remains are exposed in that crypt.  That can only be as a result of neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the two bodies are involved.  It is not good enough that such a site of special importance, special heritage and cultural and historic value should be unprotected and that we should have <Col N="2262" /> to await the introduction of this Bill for an opportunity to express this idea. I would prefer if I did not have to say this, though what I am saying will be understood not as a criticism of either of the bodies involved or of their personnel, but maybe it will encourage the OPW to establish their position of responsibility thoroughly in these areas and ensure that the necessary steps will be undertaken.  Local authorities, regional tourism organisations, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the OPW, Bord na Móna, AnCO, the list is almost endless; so many organisations are involved that it is difficult to know which has the ultimate responsibility.</P>
    <P>The burial place of O'Carolan is in County Roscommon and I have on more than one occasion asked Roscommon County Council to make a preservation order in respect of the site of the cemetery where he is buried.  O'Carolan is important, certainly in the musical and cultural area and he has been described as the last of the bards.  I find it most frustrating that the local authorities say they cannot do what I ask, that it is the job of the OPW.  In so far as I had communication with an official the OPW did not say that it was the responsibility of the local authority, but nothing happened in this regard.  I hope that the importance of this site will be realised.</P>
    <P>Apart from the O'Carolan burial place, many cemeteries have very special importance.  We should not lose them because of lack of protection, lack of finances or lack of public awareness. In so far as it is possible we should try to stimulate local interest if only by the OPW identifying these historic sites and maybe producing short documents about them perhaps in consultation with local historical or archaeolgoical societies, or through their proposed new committees or in any way possible ensuring that people become involved in certain works under schemes at present in operation. Genealogists do much of their research and investigation in ancient cemeteries reading the inscriptions on headstones. <Col N="2263" /> Many of those headstones because of erosion in the course of years are in such a state of disrepair that it is quite difficult to ascertain what exactly the inscriptions convey.  Lack of public awareness and of civic education in recent years has resulted in many of these places being forgotten and consequently public appreciation of them in local communities is not evident to the extent that it should be.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in many parts of the country a great rush to build community centres or to obtain grants for that purpose. Very few places in my constituency do not have a community hall; unfortunately, we do not have the communities. Many of them have been decimated by emigration.  We could have economic development by doing some of the things that will protect our heritage as places of opportunity for people to visit.  If we promote them in that way we can generate economic life for the community, and then the community hall can be built, paid for and occupied by them, and not be, as many halls are today, just places for the occasional card game during the winter and not important to the extent that they should be to the community.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to develop and protect many things that would contribute to our economic development and recovery and many of the people who will help in this will be found in the local communities. Education of our young people, particularly in this regard, is absolutely essential. Young people have a very special role to play in this area.  We are no better or worse in certain regards than our neighbouring countries in Europe, and we should never loose an opportunity to look at, for instance, Great Britain, our nearest neighbour, or France, another country in Europe with a wonderful wealth of culture and heritage, much of it undamaged during the last war.  We should look at what the youth particularly in these countries are doing.  Britain has the National Trust, and I understand that <Col N="2264" /> a heritage education group was set up about 1976 and funded by the environment department there.  It is administered by the Civic Trust and a number of voluntary, unpaid members are involved. Their aim is to develop the younger generation's understanding of the general importance of heritage and the environment and in that way encourage interest.</P>
    <P>Heritage education is vital for our young people, and in Britain at least teachers and school children are involved in the project I have mentioned.  Here, through the good offices of the OPW, we might seek to involve the Department of Education through the schools in giving some part of the school time and curriculum to real civics.  That will contribute to the correct attitude of mind towards pollution, littering our streets, tidiness and protection of the environment generally. We might also consider the initiation of projects, work camps, as they are called in France, in which young people could be engaged throughout the easter, summer and winter holidays, enhancing their talents, interest and awareness through their normal schooling. All of those essential ingredients could be put to work in developing or improving sites, centres, old buildings, whatever.  It is my belief that there would be an enormous response to any such proposal.  It would also ensure the involvement of students outside this country, those from the continent or the State.  It should be remembered that there has been an enormous growth in the search for culture in the United States.  That is understandable.  Not all visitors from the States come here because of an Irish connection.  There are those who can be described as pure tourists who come here in the belief that they will find a very special product, that being our heritage.  The involvement of foreign students in such schemes would cause an awareness &mdash; beyond this country &mdash; of what we have by way of cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>That type of participation on a wider scale in the carrying out of such works, or projects undertaken in various places <Col N="2265" /> would have a very special, meaningful educational role for young people.  The bodies involved, particularly the Office of Public Works, and perhaps local authorities and Bord Fáilte might have their officials sit round a table to ascertain what type of scheme could be devised that would allow for greater participation and involvement of young people, projects that would ensure we have protected, developed sites that can be visited in the knowledge that they are what they are advertised to be.  We are often told or read about an important site but, when one gets there, one finds it bears no resemblance whatsoever to its advertisement or indeed to comments made about it in some brochures in circulation. I would recommend that to the Office of Public Works as a possible method of securing the greater involvement of young people, and those from abroad with an interest, that would give them a legitimate reason for returning here.  It would also afford them an opportunity to bring home to their respective countries an appreciation of what we have but, above all else, to be part of the global process, of protecting our heritage.</P>
    <P>The protection of our heritage is really an extension of the arts.  It is perhaps unfortunate that we have never had a real arts policy, so that all of the cultural, heritage and historical values that have such meaning could be used to portray us for what we really are, a people of scholarship, of learning, who contributed much to the Continent of Europe and other parts of the world.  All of that evidence can be found in the ruins of our ancient monuments and historical sites. It is absolutely essential that we emerge once again, and demonstrate that past, using it as something which properly represents what we are today.</P>
    <P>Such an endeavour would be a worthwhile departure from some of the horrific violence we must endure at home and often witness in broadcasts in other countries. I have often wished we had the capacity to promote all of the special qualities that are inherent in our historical past, which are to be found in <Col N="2266" /> enormous quantities in ruins, archaeological sites, artefacts and ancient monuments.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important in many respects; the Register of Historic Monuments being a new and important provision which has been mentioned by many speakers.  One of its important features is the fact that, under the provisions of the 1954 Act, a vendor was not obliged to inform a purchaser of the existence of a national monument, an archaeological site or ruin.  That new provision constitutes a positive and worthwhile step in the right direction.  Its introduction does not suggest that people ignored what was there in the past but the fact that such notification was not obligatory meant it was often overlooked.  For that reason, the provisions of section 5 are to be particularly commended.</P>
    <P>One organisation I should like to see involved to a greater extent in this area &mdash; I know they are being encouraged to become involved in agri-tourism &mdash; is the Irish Farmers' Association.  Indeed in some respects we are fortunate to have some of our archaeological sites or ruins remaining at all because of the progress made in agriculture, farm development and so on.  There is a considerable awareness of their value among members of the IFA.  I should like to think that we could encourage greater involvement and participation by them, generating an even greater awareness of the importance of such sites found in rural areas, often on farms.  Their importance to the individual farmer, the community and the country at large must be stressed.  Certainly they are important from the point of view of agri-tourism.</P>
    <P>While ensuring the implementation of the provisions of section 5 we might also emphasise the importance of generating an awareness among our farming community, on a voluntary basis with the co-operation of the IFA which I am sure would be readily forthcoming.  I have no doubt but that there would be a genuine and real interest shown in this regard.  It would be desirable that we invite the participation of the IFA in a positive way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2267" /> Section 4 provides for the establishment by order of a council to be known as the Historic Monuments Council. I note that all monuments pre-1700 are to be described as historic ones.  The proposing of the council is a very positive step.  It will consist of representative from different groups &mdash; the universities, Bord Fáilte, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the marine institute and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. The involvement of all these people must be a real boost to the aim of the Office of Public Works because it brings highly enlightened and eminent people, as well as others, into the cultural area.  The fact that we have widened the scope of involvement to include these bodies is a very realistic step and one that is to be commended.</P>
    <P>There is an emotive side to the Bill in section 3.  We talk about metal detectors and the problems we have witnessed in recent years in regard to their use but we have to take into account that while they are a symptom of modern technology, they are also a symptom of the &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; mentality.  Meandering through an old ruin on a Sunday afternoon with a metal detector may in some instances be well intentioned but in most circumstances it has been found to be an act of vandalism.  The penalties proposed in this Bill are right and proper and I hope the courts will bring to bear the maximum penalties of the law against people who, in any way, damage or do injury to our archaeological sites which make a very special contribution to this country.  We cannot afford to lose that.</P>
    <P>In section 3 it is proposed to ban the use of metal detectors.  The protection afforded under this section is to be welcomed. The public are thankful for this provision.  I hope the Minister, through provision.  I hope the Minister, through his Department, will constantly urge the public to become the protectors and the watchdogs of our archaeological sites.  They should regard themselves as acting as responsible citizens in reporting behaviour that conflicts with the spirit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> Section 6 relates to by-laws, commissioners and local authorities.  Where historic sites are visited by vast numbers of people there should be some charge. If we are to see a growth in visits from people at home and abroad to sites of particular significance or importance it is absolutely essential that we provide, at these sites, facilities for those visitors.  I understand that by-laws can be made by commissioners and local authorities and I hope that this opportunity in law will be availed of.  A failure to maximise the good effects of this Bill in the immediate future would be irresponsible and would leave us lacking in years to come.</P>
    <P>Section 8 proposes that people authorised by the commissioners will be allowed enter lands for the purposes of surveying or carrying out research on sites.  The Minister will probably be the first to agree that there has been a very good relationship between the Office of Public Works and people who have historic sites on their lands.  We should not miss the opportunity to thank the farming community for the facility they afforded to the Office of Public Works down the years.  This section is not intended to be anything other than to deal with the unusual.  Persons so authorised by the commissioners should at all times be allowed to visit these historic sites.</P>
    <P>One of the most important sites in the country is to be found in County Roscommon, at Rathcroghan.  It is fortunate that the farmers in that area contributed so much to this site and also that grazing rather than tillage farming has been undertaken there.  Otherwise quite considerable damage would have been done to the Rathcroghan site which is over 2,000 years old.  It is sad to think that no survey of any significance has been carried out on that site or on the ring barrows.  They are found in particular at Tara and Eamhain Macha and also at Rathcroghan.  I understand there are almost 81 ring forts at Rathcroghan.  It has an importance equivalent to that of Tara.  I accept that the Office of Public Works recognise the importance of this site but I am concerned that they might not make a very special effort to do what <Col N="2269" /> is necessary to develop the site and to ensure its protection.</P>
    <P>In olden times the site was an assembly and burial place.  It was very much involved with the cattle raid at Cooley, an Táin Bó Cuailnge.  It has links from the past with Medb agus Daithí.  It was the last High Kingship of the O'Connor kings of Ireland.  Phelim Ó Conaire was inaugurated as Árd Rí there in 1310.  It has enormous importance and potential. Greater significance should be placed on this site by the Office of Public Works.  It is not enough just to say it will be there in ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  It cannot continue to enjoy the type of protection it had in the past.  As a result of that protection very few people knew of its existence, with the exception, of course, of the local community and in fairness to them they offered it considerable protection.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual now to see school tours and visitors from at home and abroad visiting the site.  It is essential that the Office of Public Works take the necessary steps to ensure that this site is protected. It will be availed of and it would be a pity that a totally uncontrolled approach would be taken to the use of the site and the enjoyment and facilities the site offers, to the extent that we would not set down controls to protect it.  It should have some proper controls and protections. Otherwise it can be damaged. We should move in that direction right away.</P>
    <P>There are many sites and areas of archaeological importance in the country. I was interested to hear Deputy Deenihan refer to our bogs, which are in decline.  Anybody who had the pleasure of reading David Bellamy's book about Irish bogs cannot but have been awakened to the importance of many of our bogs.  I understand that in recent times the Office of Public Works have taken the necessary steps to protect certain bogs, not only because they may contain important archaeological material but also because they may contain the remains of very special flora.  We should equate certain bogs which are very unique &mdash; apart from their archaeological <Col N="2270" /> uniqueness &mdash; with our historic monuments and archaeological sites under this Bill.  We should do something before it is too late.  I would like to think we could provide special protection for certain bogs.  On the Mayo-West Roscommon border we have a bog which contains an extraordinary wealth of plant life which I understand escaped glaciation during the ice age.  I am sure there are bogs in the midlands and in other regions which should be afforded similar protection.</P>
    <P>Some bog land is noted for its importance to wild life.  I do not want to be seen to be in conflict with the Forest and Wildlife Service, but it is worth considering whether the Office of Public Works should be involved or have responsibility in this area, because many of the areas we are talking about are synonymous with wild life activity which is very important from the tourist point of view.  I am reliably informed that there are over 1.5 million people in Great Britain alone who are interested in ornithology and Ireland is a very special place for them because a very high percentage of birds which migrate to Europe come to Ireland, and many of them to the west. This is another area which we might consider covering in this Bill.  I am not informed enough to say how this should be approached, but we should not miss this opportunity to provide wider protection for our bog lands.</P>
    <P>The international fund, which has come into existence through the Anglo-Irish Accord, has a very special place in urban renewal and the development of certain towns in the Border counties.  I believe that fund should be extended to all Twenty-Six Counties thereby allowing an opportunity for certain important buildings to be protected.  If we do not do something about these buildings soon, they will become ruins.  The international fund is significant for counties adjoining the Border, with the exception of Sligo which in the strictest sense is not a Border county, but some of this finance should be made available to the Office of Public Works to develop historic buildings outside the Border counties.</P>
    <P>I know a number of houses which could <Col N="2271" /> benefit from this fund.  I visited one this morning, the old Packenham-Mahon home in Strokestown, County Roscommon, which is 300 years old and in private ownership.  A giant step has been taken by the owners to try to restore it but there is no grant or other money available and this building does not come within the terms of reference of the international fund.  It is a pity buildings like this are likely to fall into ruin because they are outside the scope of the fund.  It is important that this fund should be extended to cover the whole country.</P>
    <P>I am sure many people, including the Office of Public Works, would agree that the admittance fees to many fine houses &mdash; such as the home of Countess Markievitz which is open to the public &mdash; do no more than contribute to the cost of keeping them.  These houses which are open to the public do not bring in enough money to carry out even normal maintenance. Another look will have to be taken at the financing of such houses and we must ensure that enough money will be provided for them.  As regards sites which make a profit, does that money go back to them after the Office of Public Works have deducted their costs?  I do not know.  It should be used for the protection of our archaeological and historical sites.  We should identify the amounts involved so that we can develop and improve the quality of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not state &mdash; this is not a criticism, merely an observation &mdash; the type of help, if any, available to the owners of historic ruins or other monuments, or if they can receive official assistance.  There is no point in placing a preservation order on a ruin or anything else if it is allowed to erode in front of our eyes.  Having given it protection status, there must be financial involvement by the State or some other agency to ensure that protection will be afforded where individual owners of such sites do not have the necessary finance to do it themselves.  Indeed, it would be impossible for many owners, if not all, to foot the bill themselves.  The Bill does not <Col N="2272" /> contain provision for any official assistance to preserve or enhance the part of our heritage which is owned by individuals.</P>
    <P>The majority of our historic sites and monuments do not have State protection. In many instances this is left to planning authorities who have no funds so we must depend on the goodwill of developers and land owners to watch over and protect our heritage.  Something more positive than reliance on goodwill is needed because, even with goodwill, it is not possible to ensure the level of protection required.  The Office of Public Works are involved in carrying out works on sites where the building has virtually fallen.  It is a question of pointing walls and trying to hold together what is left of the ruin. In close proximity to such ruins, there might be a building of special importance and significance which has been overlooked and if steps were taken to safeguard all such buildings many more could be saved.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction. The Office of Public Works must now seek to educate the public and to involve themselves to a greater extent in that role.  They should also seek greater participation by the Department of Education and Bord Fáilte in the development of sites, the identification of their use and maximising their gains. The revenue generated locally should, as far as possible, be returned to individual sites.  It is also important that people in local communities should form themselves into advisory committees.  We are talking about statutory provision for such committees and about the involvement of local authorities and representatives of various organisations.  Even on a parish level it is worth considering setting them up on a voluntary basis.  These people would be an extended limb of the Office of Public Works; they would contribute, support and cultivate a knowledge and awareness and maximise the value and importance of these sites.  It is all very well passing legislation but, unless people are involved, it will not work.  It would pay the Office of Public Works to engage upon a county by county exercise of <Col N="2273" /> encouraging local committees by advertisements, speaking to people and generating the kind of interest which would be most beneficial.</P>
    <P>Our canals are now within the scope of the Office of Public Works.  They are national and historic monuments to a period of commerce, social conditions and politics.  They have a very special link with all three.  Their use in tourism cannot be over-emphasised and I am delighted with the role of the Office of Public Works in this regard.  However, we must ensure greater protection for canals because individuals and organisations have interfered with them to the extent that they have been damaged or altered irreversibly.  I hope we will recognise their importance; I am thinking of the Grand Canal and its route into Ballinasloe which is in promimity to the Minister of State.  In the past we noted with sadness that a portion has been closed for necessary development.  There should have been greater public awareness and discussion at the time when perhaps an alternative method of development might have been found.  I just make that point because I am conscious of the Minister's concern about the development and protection of canals as a major source of potential and enjoyment for so many people.  It is worth considering in the context of national monuments.</P>
    <P>Many people have stated from time to time the importance of having an opportunity to inspect and enjoy visually so many of our artefacts which are locked up in the National Museum and in this House.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has returned because I want to take this opportunity to compliment him &mdash; and this is not a commercial &mdash; on taking a special interest in attempting to ensure that many of these artefacts were restored and returned to the counties from which they came, or to other counties where they could be exhibited on a special occasion or for a particular period of time.  An enormous amount of our heritage and culture is locked away.</P>
    <P>Transporting these artefacts to the capital city and locking them in a basement <Col N="2274" /> is not the proper way to achieve protection for them.  It is a negative approach.  It is not in the spirit of the intention to protect them and does not allow a maximum opportunity for public awareness to be generated.  I understand the difficulties involved in exhibiting these artefacts from the point of view of insurance, vandalism, control and responsibility for certain very special and important artefacts.  However we should be mature enough to face up to the fact that the attitude of this generation and the next generation towards our heritage and culture will depend on how we understand and appreciate them now.  We should seriously consider the relocation of some artefacts while at the same time having regard to the difficulties involved. We should ensure that we provide the maximum opportunity to have them exhibited to the public on important occasions.</P>
    <P>One of the areas we should take into account when we are talking about national monuments and heritage is the development, in a regional sense, of an agricultural museum.  With a departure from traditional farming methods and the enormous urbanisation of our population, 33 per cent of the total population live in Dublin.  This is higher than in any other European capital.  The traditional methods of farming have disappeared. We know what a horse and a donkey look like but many of the implements and tools which were linked to them could not be named by the children of today.  It is desirable that when we speak about our heritage we should take into account the importance of protecting that aspect of it.  Exhibits of these implements and tools &mdash; some of which are still in the country and others in Dublin &mdash; should be available to the public.</P>
    <P>If we want to achieve an improvement in attitudes in any area, whether it is against violence, pollution and littering or whether it is for the arts, crafts, culture and heritage we must look towards our youth.  I compliment our youth in every respect.  From my experience they are young men and women who appreciate the value of our heritage and culture not <Col N="2275" /> alone to us as a people but also to the countries of Europe and to the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be relatively brief because I do not want to regurgitate the many arguments which have been made. Virtually everything which could be said has been said about this measure.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on his elevation to junior ministerial position.  It is very gratifying as a westerner to see somebody in such a sensitive area given the function of piloting this important measure safely through the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Any measure that is designed to protect or preserve our heritage and culture must be welcomed. This Bill sets out to do this.  It establishes definitions and parameters; it outlaws the usage of certain objects and types of equipment; it lays down penalties for breaches of regulations.  Therefore, its purpose is good.  It is a vast improvement on existing legislation and it greatly extends the scope of existing legislation.</P>
      <P>While it goes a considerable way towards redressing many of the defects, deficiencies and loopholes that exist, there are some gaps and defects and a certain amount of tightening up is required.  I congratulate the previous Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, on having had the initiative to bring this long overdue measure before the previous Seanad.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  For years we have wrung our hands collectively in futile anguish and open horror at the despoliation of so many of our historical monuments, sites, artefacts, etc.  In many cases we have presided over the wilful neglect of many of these valuable properties. We are different from other countries in the amount of esteem we have for our heritage.  This is a very sad indictment, first, of our educational system and, secondly, the degree of input the civics course has in relation to teaching people a full and thorough appreciation of our heritage and our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have failed miserably to inculcate a proper sense of values for our heritage. <Col N="2276" /> Various acts of ravage and despoliation of sites have been chronicled time and time again in this House, in the newspapers, on radio and on television.  For example, at Carrowntemple near Gurteen in County Sligo five early Christian grave slabs were discovered to be missing and they turned up in the yard of an antique dealer somewhere.  Objects were taken from Knockmore and Knockirvin in County Sligo.  When they were found the excuse given by the person was that they were taken for their own protection.</P>
    <P>There is the ongoing saga of the Derrynaflan Chalice which I cannot comment on as the proceedings are <i>sub judice</i> and in every townland in the country there are many examples of objects being destroyed or finding their way into the wrong hands.  For example, in my own townland of Ballyhaunis in County Mayo a beautiful Bronze Age sword was found during the drainage of the River Moy and was bartered for two or three packets of cigarettes.  I think that sword is now in an attic somewhere in County Limerick unadmired, out of sight and out of mind. We do not even know if it has been properly preserved or if the necessary curative treatment has been carried out.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Doherty, Deputy Deenihan and other speakers have said, many ring forts have been flattened by hy-macs and JCBs.  Objects are disappearing, if not by the day certainly by the week.  We are very much into the season for such despoliation and damage.  When it comes to the harvesting of crops many farmers, either wittingly or unwittingly, participate in acts of considerable destruction or vandalism.  There are two cures for this.  First, there is public education and awareness and, secondly, there are the legal remedies we are addressing in the House today.  Apart from the underexploited role of education from primary level right through to third level, a massive campaign on both radio and television is long overdue to point out the priceless value of these artefacts and objects and to point out also the legal requirements which will come into force when this Bill <Col N="2277" /> has finally passed through the House and been signed by the President.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty and previous speakers referred to the national monuments committees. These do enormous good at local authority level, when they undertake the work they were established to do. However, as Deputy Doyle said, the vast majority of local authorities do not bother to constitute their national monuments committees.  While those who have such committees do not always put them in operation in terms of having regular meetings to monitor what is going on in the county and in terms of keeping a general eye on the situation.  These committees could do an enormous amount of work within their local authority jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Estimates for the various local authorities we find, and have to acknowledge to our shame, that the allocations to the national monuments committees and to the preservation of monuments are only a pittance, that is, if any such allocation has been made in the first place.  I concur entirely with the tributes which have been paid in this House to the work carried out by AnCO under expert supervision in relation to the restoration of various monasteries and archaeological sites etc. The key to the success of such work is that it must be carried out under expert professional supervision.  I want to pay tribute to local communities and local archaeological groups who have in the past filled a very valuable void and vacuum in relation to the preservation of such monuments.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> of this Bill was brought about by the recent expansion of the seeking of archaeological artefacts and valuable museum pieces for commercial gain.  Treasure hunting has become a very worthwhile and rewarding past-time if some of the decisions which have been handed down in some recent court cases in relation to the value of such artefacts can be taken as a signpost for such activities.  We all know that there are genuine people who go out looking for such objects, from a sense of history and a genuine sense of inquiry.  At least <Col N="2278" /> that was the pattern in the past but there is now a new breed of treasure hunter who has been drawn in by nothing more than pecuniary or mercenary wishes in the first place.</P>
    <P>This Bill is particularly targeted at restricting the use of metal detectors. Section 2 makes it obligatory to have the written consent of the Commissioners of Public Works before using a metal detector in search of archaeological objects.  I am genuinely concerned about the efficacy of this section of the Bill.  How can it be proved that a person in a field and in possession of a metal detector is in pursuit of archaeological objects?  Could he not, for example, be looking for his wedding ring or his wife's engagement ring or could he not be trying out the instrument?  Could he not use such excuse as a bona fide reason for possessing a metal detector?  I do not in any way advocate draconian legislation but I believe that this section is much too loose and I urge that on Committee Stage some amendments be accepted in order to tighten up the section.</P>
    <P>Vast areas of the countryside which have rich unexplored potential are not designated as archaeological sites. According to this measure you can ramble with a metal detector and with impunity on to any unrestricted site or field which has not been designated as a preserved site in pursuit of objects other than archaeological artefacts etc.  I also question whether it is wise that the other section dealing with sites on which there are preservation orders is rigid or stringent enough.  A person, according to this Bill, is not permitted to use a metal detector at a protected site if it is assumed that he is looking for archaeological artefacts but the section continues with the words, &ldquo;unless the contrary is proved.&rdquo;  Why would anyone have a metal detector on a protected site in the first place other than for the naked purpose of seeking treasure trove which he thinks by reason of the designation of the site, may be there?  Laxity or flexibility is going to prove grist to the mill of the legal protession. I can imagine lawyers spending hours in court arguing over the purpose <Col N="2279" /> or intent of the presence of a person on the site and over the usage of the instrument in question.  My own instincts &mdash; I think these would be shared by those in the National Museum &mdash; are that the use of such instruments should be banned entirely as I do not believe they can be properly controlled or policed.  The exception would be that the licence be given only to somebody who is using the particular instrument or object in the course or pursuit of his or her business or profession.</P>
    <P>The Bill referred specifically to a metal detector and I wonder if this is too precise a definition.  Should it not be broadened to include any other technical or scientific apparatus for the purpose of unearthing, undermining, locating, or finding archaeological objects?  Like the other speakers, I welcome section 5 of the Bill in that it provides for the setting up of a register of historic monuments.  That section also provides for the making of further additions to that register.  This is something to be welcomed.  Sligo is supposed to have 5,000 sites, Donegal to have 2,000.  I venture to suggest that in nine or ten years' time, with the acceleration of interest, the sites in Donegal will have doubled in number.  Deputy Enright referred to a survey being carried out at present by the Office of Public Works which, as a result of new techniques such as aerial photography, etc, is unearthing and discovering a spate of archaeological artefacts, finds, sites and monuments hitherto undetected or unappreciated.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but the height of admiration for the work done by the National Museum and the Office of Public Works. I concur entirely with Deputy Doherty that many of the objects now stored in the basements, attics, or additional storage space in the National Museum should be displayed somewhere.  I can think of no better place for them than in the locale in which they were discovered in the first place, first, from the point of view of making them available and, secondly, of generating and stimulating interest at local level among schoolchildren and among the public at large, creating a <Col N="2280" /> public awareness of the historical scenario in which these were discovered.  This would be a very obvious and valuable prop to the Bill in question.  It would counter the negligent attitude of the public at large in relation to a failure to appreciate these artefacts.</P>
    <P>I was a schoolteacher before going into public life.  From time to time I threw out the idea among the schoolchildren of their perhaps having at home any objects or artefacts, axe heads, arrow heads, stone heads, etc.  My school bench has been filled with such objects, along with spears, swords, etc.  These were conveyed carefully to the National Museum and they were treated, labelled and stored away.  One can imagine the dismay of those schoolchildren when they come to the National Museum on school tours and there is no trace or sign of the objects which to them are of particular significance &mdash; a find of their lifetime.  They are not seen in any of the glass cases because of the curtailment of storage space.  There is no better way to stimulate, first, interest and, secondly, respect than in the decentralisation of the National Museum and the setting up of provincial museums.</P>
    <P>The most spectacular stretch of cliff edge in Ireland is at Céide on the north coast of Mayo, five miles from Ballycastle. Virtually all tourists who travel this route stop at the cliff top and view the road from the 360 foot high cliff, take their photographs and then drive on. They leave the area, totally unaware they have stopped in the middle of the most extensive neolithic site in Europe.  This site is also known to be the earliest example of enclosed fields in Europe. Over 1,000 acres of this hill were cleared of forest, divided up into regular fields and farmed by Stone Age farmers over 5,000 years ago.  There are two sites at Céide, which have been remarked on very favourably by people of the calibre of Durham Professor David Bellamy, Cambridge Professor Coles and our own Professor Séamus Caulfield.  The tributes that have been paid to this site seem to have fallen on deaf ears as regards development.  If ever there was a site <Col N="2281" /> crying out for the establishment of an environmental heritage centre it is this site at Céide in the Ballycastle area of north Mayo.</P>
    <P>I should like to see hand-in-hand with the heritage centre the setting up of an interpretative centre also.  Archaeological remains from 5,000 years ago do not speak for themselves and a centre to provide information on site is absolutely essential.  One could set out there in clear detail why the archaeological remains are important, how they came to be buried under the bog in the first place, how the bog was formed and how it was exploited. These are all questions which could be answered in an exciting manner by old and new methods of presentation such as wall charts, photographs, models, videos, guided tours, etc.  This development has been commended and recommended by the three people who have examined the site and taken an interest in it.  In a letter on 28 December 1985 Professor Coles of Cambridge said the idea was very commendable.  I quote:</P>
    <P>By creating some type of public community in the area, the gradual awareness of its unique character can be made possible.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>It would surely qualify for European support in terms of heritage conservation.</P>
    <P>The north Mayo site is but one of many which we have in this country and which need protection.  Every single Member of this House can refer to his or her own neck of the woods and point to the need for development and preservation.</P>
    <P>However, of all the sites &mdash; and this is concurred with by the three experts whom I have mentioned &mdash; the developed site of Céide would have a major educational and tourist potential in an area which requires some focus to draw tourists. What more appropriate location could one have within easy striking distance of the Connacht Regional Airport. This should become the showpiece for tourists &mdash; the presentation of one of the <Col N="2282" /> oldest farms in Europe.</P>
    <P>Some time ago Dr. Lucas, late director of the National Museum, said:</P>
    <P>The heritage of Europe is hanging on the walls of the art galleries of Europe. The heritage of Ireland is buried in the ground.</P>
    <P>How true this is and how greatly it focuses on the need for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the broad thrust of this legislation, but I should like to see a tightening up.  I do not favour draconian measures, but I have a major reservation in relation to the length of time taken to obtain a preservation order.  A member of the Garda Síochána or somebody from the Office of Public Works receives a report that damage is being done to a particular site.  Somebody from the Garda Síochána or the Office of Public Works visits the site, and has to make a report on the matter but it takes from one week to three, at a minimum, to get a preservation order.  It is my belief that the time lag is too great.  Very often when somebody is detected destroying an object of historical importance they unwisely undertake corrective work ultimately doing more damage to the object than if the partially damaged property was left without an attempt to cover up.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we should have another look at preservation orders.  It is my understanding that such orders apply to the person who owns the property and that in the event of a change of ownership it is necessary to have a new order made. In that regard I should like to know if the Office of Public Works liaise with the Land Registry Office in order to be kept informed of the change in ownership of historical property.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that when we monitor its effects in two or three years' time we will be told that it has done the work intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. D. Fitzpatrick Dr. D. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for a number of reasons among which is my hope that it will educate our people about the need to preserve our heritage. I hope it will teach us about our background. <Col N="2283" /> When we contemplate these monuments and see them in their natural setting I hope we will think not just of the monuments but of the people who erected them.  We should give thought to the work and intelligence of the people who built those monuments.  I am thinking in particular of Grianan of Aileach in County Donegal and, nearer home, the Hill of Tara.  The people who constructed such monuments and prepared such sites were, in the words of Yeats, no mean people.  Obviously, they were skilled, highly intelligent and were in tune with their surroundings.  When one sees the damage done to our monuments and places of historic interest one wonders whether this generation is in tune with our surroundings.</P>
      <P>I realise the Bill is an interim measure and that our attitude towards monuments, our heritage and our surroundings is changing all the time as research helps us to understand our background.  When one reads the Minister's statement one realises that we are not dealing with monuments but with buildings constructed by man, no matter how old or how recent.  I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister objects I believe should be preserved.  In my view we should preserve street furniture, items like lamp standards, horse troughs, street name places, statues, carvings on buildings and shop fronts.  They are monuments to skilled artisans, tradesmen and artists who left their imprint on our capital city.  We pass those objects daily and we do not notice them.  For example, I travel to Dáil Éireann daily through a street called the Stoneybatter, Bóthar na gCloch, one of the five royal roads from Tara.  Thousands of years after it was first used it is still trodden on by politicians and others travelling to the country's seat of power.  It is interesting to contemplate that the centre of power has only moved 20 miles from Tara to Leinster House and that the road to Dublin remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many objects that should be preserved in Dublin city and I hope the Office of Public Works will place preservation orders on some of them.  I am <Col N="2284" /> referring to bench marks along the two canals which were used by those engaged in ordnance survey work many years ago. Other items that should be preserved are letter boxes, pumps and bollards.  In the haymarket area one can see that the entrances to yards are protected by granite or cast iron bollards to stop drays or lorries knocking the corners off the walls. It is important that we preserve such items many of which have a use today. What stopped the wheels of drays knocking corners off gates now stop the wheels of lorries.</P>
    <P>Another weakness in our preservation of monuments in Dublin city is that many of the statues and artefacts erected over the years were commissioned by private bodies.  I am thinking of such objects as the drinking fountains that are disappearing at a fast rate.  There is one located outside the Gate Theatre which catered for animals on one side and humans on the other.  Such troughs were erected by a group called the Free Fountain Drinking Water Association. However, they do not belong to anybody and can be removed without breaking any law.  The statues in O'Connell Street come into the same category.  It would be very difficult to prosecute a person for removing the statue of Jim Larkin, Lord Grey or Father Matthew.  Those statues were erected by private individuals, groups or trustees who have since died.</P>
    <P>Last year there was an attack on what was referred to as a moving statue in County Cork.  The statue may not have been of any great artistic significance and it was very difficult to prosecute the person who damaged it.  The same applies to other statues, whether they are religious or not.  The Minister should look at this area, particularly as the Bill progresses through the House.  Those statues, and the street furniture, are the products of bygone craftsmanship.  We will not see the likes of this again.  These are skills and trades that are going out of human reach.  It would be a shame to allow all of them to go.</P>
    <P>Another area that could be looked at by the Minister in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Education, <Col N="2285" /> relates to encouraging schools to study local history.  Particularly in the west, in the last century when there was a high mortality rate for children, children's graveyards were developed.  These are now being overgrown and they are in danger of being obliterated from the map.  These graveyards are a sad monument to the poverty and hardship which people faced in the mid-19th century. There are also what could be called famine graveyards, where bodies were buried willy-nilly.  As we have progressed in prosperity and the generations have died off, they have been forgotten.  But, they are milestones on our march towards the present standard of relative economic prosperity.  We should make a study of these areas.  We should look at our most recent history before going back one or two thousand years.</P>
    <P>Next year, Dublin is celebrating its millennium.  Some years ago, the city of Sofia in Bulgaria celebrated its 7,000 birthday.  We have a long way to go and on our way we should not lose many of our artefacts that have accrued in our society over the years.</P>
    <P>In Dublin North Central, there are areas redolent of history.  In the mid-19th century, Dublin, with a population one-third of what it is now, had five debtors' prisons and only one remains.  It is either in the hands of the Board of Works or Dublin Corporation.  It should be preserved and developed as a community centre or a heritage centre for the betterment of the local population and for the benefit of the people at large.  The Oxmantown area was well known to Brian Boru prior to the battle of Clontarf. It is a corruption of the word &ldquo;Ostmantown&rdquo;, the town of the men from the east, or the town of the Vikings.  It was there they camped, prior to the battle of Clontarf.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would refer is the preservation of original names.  In Dublin, one finds, for instance, housing estates called Ailesbury.  These names supersede Irish names that meant something and should still mean something to the Irish intellect.  Most names whether in English or Irish in Ireland are corruptions <Col N="2286" /> of Irish names and they tell us something about the place.  These names are being wiped off the map at a very fast rate.  The Minister and the Board of Works should get together with Commisiún na Logainmneacha in the Ordnance Survey and try to make some sense of the naming of our newer estates in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that fines for vandalism or abuse of our national monuments are being increased to a point where it will be prohibitive for vandals to go to work on our ancient monuments.  When this Bill is passed and the Minister and the Board of Works are looking forward to a future Bill, I would like them to think not just in terms of ancient monuments, but in terms of our whole heritage, because ancient monuments are just one part of our heritage.  Streetscapes are also part of our heritage.  One should study the streetscapes, standing in the great squares in Dublin, Fitzwilliam Square, Merrion Square and so on.  If one stands at the bottom of Fitzwilliam Street, one can see how it frames a vista of the Dublin mountains.  It can be argued that this vista was created by people trying to make a quick buck housing the rich prior to the closure of the Irish Houses of Parliament. Nonetheless, it is an important streetscape and it is a national monument.  It is not just the stone or the doors, it is the vista it frames.  We must look at this area more closely.  This is where a heritage council working closely with local planning authorities could be an engine for good.  They could ensure a planned tasteful development of our towns, villages and streets even in rural areas.  How often does one come into a town in the country and see beautiful shop fronts desecrated with plastic and neon.  Nearer to home, Grafton Street and O'Connell Street have been desecrated due to piecemeal planning, without an overview of our heritage.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is introducing a new Bill I would like him to consider drawing up a register of licensed dealers in artefacts, curios and antiquities.  These licensed dealers should be asked to keep inventories which can be inspected so <Col N="2287" /> that more control can be exercised over auctioneers and dealers in ancient artefacts. It is too easy for people with an eye to the fast buck to move antiquities from the country or to desecrate national monuments.  The definition should include the words &ldquo;movable and immovable objects&rdquo;.  Collections that form a hoard should not be broken up or if they are to be broken up responsible people from the Office of Public Works and the National Museum, should be allowed to vet them prior to a licence being given.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a Monuments Council, all searches and research should be monitored by the council.  Research can be damaging as well as enlightening.  It is only right that members of this council and people from the Board of Works should have an input before excavations or researches get underway.  Many of these monuments have been here for thousands of years.  Time is on our side. We have time to make sure that we do not do damage.</P>
    <P>In winding up, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I also congratulate him on introducing this Bill, which is one of many that will be required as our knowledge about our background grows.  The only constraint on the Minister is a shortage of money to do all that he and his officials would wish.  The Office of Public Works have an excellent history in the safeguarding of our heritage, but in future we will have to take a broader overview to include not just ancient historic monuments but those of more recent date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased this Bill has been welcomed by the House.  It is clearly of more importance than it might appear at first sight.  A commitment on the part of both Houses of the Oireachtas to preserve our heritage of monuments and sites is an indication that we are all aware of the deeper significance of this heritage.  For heritage has much to do with what we are.  It has to do with our identity as a people and <Col N="2288" /> with our pride and prejudice.  The tangible remains of past events are constant reminders to us.  Even battle fields have lessons for us.  Some people would, of course, say that the past is best forgotten and this is a sad situation but the trouble is we cannot properly understand the present without a knowledge of the past. Our monuments help to crystallise in our minds the events and personalities of the past.  They tell where and how the people lived.  They provide teachers with important points of reference around which they can recreate in the minds of young people the historic developments which shaped our country.</P>
      <P>Our monuments also have a larger dimension because they help to identify the Irish ethos in today's world.  Statistics have been quoted which show that a high proportion of visitors to our shores come in search of a cultural experience.  Many are sons and daughters of emigrants from Ireland coming to touch the roots, so to speak.  Others would have no such hereditary connection but wish to understand and savour what makes this country and its people what they are.  And it is to our monuments and famous sites they go in ever-increasing numbers to satisfy their desire to know and understand our cultural background.</P>
      <P>This has had the useful by-product of providing regular summer work for guides at these monuments.  These guides achieve a high standard of communication with their visitors and succeed in awakening an appreciation of our great historical heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to develop tourism to its full potential, a proper attention to the presentation of our monuments is necessary. I am happy to note that in my own county of Galway excellent work has been done to Portumna Castle and its formal garden.  Lintels were replaced in all the chimneys.  Large oak beams have been placed in the south tower at first, second and third floor levels in conformity with the original design.  Rose beds and shrubs have been provided in the gardens and an altogether pleasing and attractive prospect is being provided for our visitors.  I could also say much <Col N="2289" /> the same in regard to the work done at Knockmoy Abbey where archaeological excavation was carried out to recover all available information before conservation was begun.  Work included the restoration of a cloister wall to arcade level.  Part of the chancel area was reroofed and mediaeval grave slabs and a high cross were moved into a suitable display area.</P>
    <P>Such works are not confined to County Galway but are carried out by the national monuments service in every county and are an invaluable part of tourism development.  At a time of financial retrenchment, it behoves us to count our assets and to maximise their impact and utility and, of course, increase our commitment to their protection.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the comments and questions raised by the various Members.  My predecessor in this office, Deputy Avril Doyle, came up with an interesting proposal for involving the Office of Public Works in the classification of buildings.  I am aware of the wide range of architectural expertise in the Office of Public Works and I would be happy to see my office assisting in any way they can in devising a better classification system.  This is not something we can provide for under this Bill. It is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment, but I am sure that he will be very interested in Deputy Doyle's proposal and I will refer it to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruairí Quinn raised the problem of getting the balance right between the rights of private property and the public good and also questioned whether the designation of a group of buildings as a national monument is not fraught with difficulties in regard to compensation. The Supreme Court in the O'Callaghan case upheld the constitutionality of preservation orders made under the National Monuments Acts.  These orders do place certain limitations on the use of land affected and no compensation is payable. Indeed if it were payable, our powers of action would be very curtailed, but why should compensation be payable when all that is required of a landowner is to leave <Col N="2290" /> intact something which has been there for countless generations?  The accelerating progress with the archaeological survey and the entry of identified monuments in the new register and on title to lands will tend to reduce the number of cases of persons buying lands for development and subsequently finding that a monument on the lands upsets their plans.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Quill is happy with the work done in County Cork by the staff of UCC.  The archaeological survey of County Cork is being done by a team from UCC who have been commissioned by the Office of Public Works and it is part of the national survey being carried out by my office.</P>
    <P>The Deputy feels there is nothing in the Bill to stop the despoliation of monuments, including the theft and export of grave slabs.  I would suggest that the threat of a fine of up to £50,000 is a fairly effective deterrent.  Deputy Ruairí Quinn accepted this.  He acknowledged the provisions are as serious and draconian as could be made and he supports them. Deputy Quill stressed the need for education in order to ensure that the public at large have an appreciation of, and a desire to protect, this important part of our heritage.  This, again, is a major part of the OPW's programme.  We may not realise when admiring posters and calendars which depict our finest monuments that the original photographs of them may have come from the OPW's photographic department.  Guidebooks, postcards and slide-shows are constantly being made available.  The guide service at our major national monuments is second to none.  Sections 6 and 12 of the Bill are in fact intended, <i>inter alia,</i> to allow more to be done in the way of providing interpretative facilities at the more important sites.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill is mistaken in thinking that the maximum fine for which a person found in possession of a metal detector at an historic site is only £1,000.  In fact the maximum fine is £50,000.  I hope that this will allay her fears about the adequacy of section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill thought that it was not right to limit protection to wrecks of more <Col N="2291" /> than 100 years old.  In adopting the 100-year criterion for historic wrecks we have followed the line adopted by the committee of experts appointed by the Council of Europe.  The onus of verifying the age of a wreck will be on the discoverers and, given the level of interest and enthusiasm that wreck finds generate, I am certain that divers will take the trouble required to research and verify the dating evidence in each case.  The Maritime Institute of Ireland has been lending its valuable expertise and assistance in this regard, for which we are very grateful.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the 100-year criterion, which is already enshrined in the draft European Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, has the benefit of affording blanket protection to all wrecks more than 100 years old.  The 100-year criterion does not, however, prevent the Commissioners from protecting any wreck of historical interest which is less than 100 years old. To echo what I said in my opening speech in regard to monuments; a historic wreck can be as old as yesterday.  The only difference is that wrecks less than 100 years old have to be dealt with on an individual basis and are not protected until an order is made.  Wrecks over 100 years old are automatically protected, even in advance of the making of an order.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ruairí Quinn's suggestion that the Minister for Finance, when appointing the five persons provided for under section 4(3)(f) to the Historic Monuments Council, should look at the range of expertise provided by the representatives of the nominated bodies and then select five persons who would fill any gaps that were apparent and correct any lack of balance that he might see.  I would think that this would be normal procedure.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Quill's question on the appropriateness of the appointment of the chairman of the Historic Monuments Council by the Minister for Finance, this is the normal arrangement in such cases and, again, the Minister would, in choosing a chairman, have <Col N="2292" /> regard to the diverse interests represented and try to select a person capable of reconciling these elements and producing a good working relationship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill questioned why the Minister for Communications should be represented on the Historic Monuments Council.  The Minister for Communications' representative was included in the Historic Monuments Council to take account of underwater archaelogy. In view of the shift of responsibility for marine affairs to the new Department of the Marine, I will be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to alter paragraph 3 (c) of section 4 to read &ldquo;a representative of the Minister for the Marine nominated by the Minister for the Marine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill further suggested that there should be a representative of the National Museum.  The National Museum comes under the Department of the Taoiseach and there is provision in the Bill for &ldquo;a representative of the Taoiseach nominated by the Taoiseach&rdquo;.  In fact, the present representative of the Department is an official of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady decried the absence of a city archaeologist in Dublin. I agree with him completely.  I, too, am sorry to see that neither Dublin nor Cork Corporations have yet created such a post either in a temporary capacity or in an advisory capacity.  At the same time, I should pay tribute to the corporations of Waterford, Limerick and Galway who have recently decided to appoint archaeologists to assist them in their preservation or both their and our heritage. I hope that both Dublin and Cork will follow quickly the lead of the smaller corporations as there are many excellent people in different vocations, but involved professionally and otherwise with archaeology who I believe would make a major contribution in this area, if given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputies Brady and Enright suggested bringing archaeology into the schools. The OPW took a step in this direction in the past two years when they printed 50,000 copies of an illustrated booklet <Col N="2293" /> called <i>Irish Field Monuments</i> and distributed copies to every school in the country.  I understand that this booklet fitted well into the curriculum of fifth and sixth classes in the national schools and many schools have ordered additional copies.  Any school children fortunate enough to have teachers with an interest in archaeology will benefit greatly from instruction with the aid of this booklet which has been widely praised.  It is simple enough to be understood by primary school children while at the same time being of such academic standard as to make it useful to students of archaeology at university.  I would like to see the OPW archaeologists following up this initiative by visiting schools and giving talks to school children on the need to preserve our archaeological heritage, but it would be unrealistic to expect that we will have the resources to do this in the years immediately ahead.  The most we can hope to do at this stage is to give teachers whatever assistance we can so that they will be capable of imparting knowledge and appreciation of this heritage to their students.  I propose to suggest to the Minister for Education that provision be made in the teacher training programme for a short session on archaeology and, in this way, we will at least be reaching the new teachers coming out of our colleges.  Later on, it may be possible to meet present teachers at refresher courses.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works provide a valuable aid to education also by their encouragement to school groups to visit our major monuments where an excellent interpretive service is provided.  There must be few children now leaving our school system who have not visited some of these monuments such as Newgrange and Clonmacnoise and learnt something of our history from this contact with the places where our ancestors lived and produced great works of art and learning, and other places like Kilmainham Jail, which are so synonymous with our modern history of this century.  I hope that in the years ahead there will be a renewed interest in all aspects of our heritage and culture, especially our vast <Col N="2294" /> number of national monuments</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady further suggested that a system of watching monuments similar to the community neighbourhood watch scheme, which has been successful in reducing crime levels in certain areas, should be considered. This Bill, in fact, caters for such an idea. Section 8 allows the commissioners to authorise persons other than their own employees to inspect monuments.  This would mean that members of local historic monuments committees or of local archaeological or historical societies who were willing to volunteer their services could be appointed to inspect monuments within designated areas.  This could be especially useful in regard to the isolated sites referred to by the Deputy.  I might add that members of the local societies to whom I have referred act as watchdogs, and intervention by the commissioners frequently arises as a result of reports received from interested persons who notice something amiss.  There is scope, of course, for extending this approach and efforts are all the time being made to bring the message to a wider public.  The commissioners, for instance, had a national parks and monuments stand at the Spring Show this year which brought our heritage before members of both the farming and the wider community attending the show. Deputy Brady made interesting suggestions in regard to the help which boy scouts and girl guides could give in protecting the heritage.  He mentioned other bodies such as the GAA who have set a fine example in taking steps to preserve the home of the late Michael Cusack one of their founding members in Carron, County Clare.  These suggestions are valuable and can be explored.  It is possible that periodicals and magazines circulating among such groups and clubs could carry articles of local heritage interest.  I am glad that this question of local community involvement has been raised as it is clearly desirable to have the tightening up of our laws accompanied by a fostering of community interest and support.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady further referred to the <Col N="2295" /> damage done to many monuments such as Clonmacnoise and Iniscealtra.  The great problem at present is the level of fines.  The present maximum fine is £50. It is proposed to raise this to £50,000. This is a very heavy fine and anyone preparing to do damage to a monument should think twice before doing so when this Bill is enacted.  As well as the fine of £50,000 the courts may also impose a six months' prison sentence.  This is a very effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>The Derrynaflan decision does not mean that one can go into another's property and take teasures from it.  What the High Court decided was that the law of treasure trove does not apply in this country and that, therefore, the State cannot claim ownership.  The court, therefore, decided that the National Museum should return the treasures to the person who had handed them in to the museum. The court did not decide on who owns the treasures, that is whether it is the landowner, the finders or whoever.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady further referred to treasures in the care of the National Museum, and as these treasures are not my responsibility I cannot say whether any facsimiles of the Ardagh Chalice or of any other treasures have been made. We always run the risk that copies in the style of these treasures may be reconstructed from photographs.  The Office of Public Works make copies of some grave slabs and other stone artefacts so that the originals can be moved to greater safety from the elements and from vandals. Copies of relevant items in the National Museum are also made for display at places like the Rock of Cashel and Clonmacnoise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright supports the controls being introduced in regard to the use of metal detectors and the severe penalties introduced for illegal use of metal detectors. He went on to suggest that the archaeologists might themselves use metal detectors in certain circumstances such as road widening.  It is, however, difficult to imagine that any archaeologist would stoop to using a metal detector in any circumstances.  The homing in on <Col N="2296" /> single objects of metal and their extraction is so contrary to the rules of archaeology that it is hard to see any circumstances in which one would be used.  What is required is that the route of the proposed roadway should be surveyed by an archaeologist in order to ensure that archaeological sites are avoided.  An archaeologist should then be employed to watch the work as it proceeds so that any structures or artefacts that are uncovered are properly excavated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to Redwood Castle on the slopes of Lough Derg, Lorrha, in County Tipperary, formerly occupied by the notorious MacEgan family, which has been restored by a Galway solicitor of that name.  It is an example of what private initiative can do. I am happy to say that the Commissioners of Public Works are in a position in such cases to make a &ldquo;determination&rdquo; under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, which entitles the owner to substantial tax reliefs because of the intrinsic scientific, aesthetic, architectural or historic interest of the building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the archaeological survey of County Laois and said that lists were so expensive that only a very few copies were made.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the first stage of an archaeological survey is the compilation of sites and monuments records. These consist of lists of monuments and copies of the six inch Ordnance Survey maps for the counties on which the monuments are marked.  These are produced mainly for planning authorities, the farm development service and the forestry Branch so that these bodies may know of the presence of monuments and make sure that when any planning applications, or applications for farm improvement schemes are made, they will take the monuments into account.  The cost of reproducing these sites and monuments records is very high.  In any event, they are very bulky and unwieldy and not really suitable for circulation to schools.</P>
    <P>The next stage is the preparation of the inventory.  Inventories for two counties have already been issued and a further <Col N="2297" /> one is with the printers.  They sell for about £20 each and are more relevant to the layman.  I would hope that an inventory for Deputy Enright's county of Offaly will be issued in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred specifically to the farm improvement schemes, and I am glad to tell the Deputy that the Office of Public Works have a very good working relationship with the farm development service.  Whenever the farm development service are aware that there may be a monument on land proposed for reclamation they consult with the Office of Public Works.  If the Office of Public Works advise that an area should be excluded from the improvement scheme the farm development service accept that advice.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Brady and Enright referred to the theft of grave slabs from Clonmacnoise.  I am glad to acknowledge Deputy Enright's tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works at Clonmacnoise. I would like to tell him that it was not by luck that a foreigner was caught in the act of stealing grave slabs two years ago.  After the initial theft the Office of Public Works organised a 24-hour watch on the site.  It was as a result of this vigilance that an arrest and a successful prosecution was made.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann wishing to remain within the 1987 Revised Estimates for Health,</P>
      <P>(i)  notes that there is widespread public concern about the provision of health services throughout the country, notwithstanding an increase this year of £13.082 million;</P>
      <P>(ii)  condemns the failure of the Government and the Minister for Health to set guidelines for expenditure on health this year that would ensure an acceptable level of service, which failure has resulted in threats of closure of numerous hospitals, and curtailment of services in others causing inevitable deep public concern;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  calls for a reduction in the size and cost of the bureaucratic machine administering the health services, including the health boards; the abolition of local Health Advisory Committees; greater accountability by consultants, and a retention of such numbers of persons supplying health care direct to the public as are necessary to provide a <Col N="2299" /> reasonable level of service, given the country's financial circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the past couple of weeks the panic and terror engendered in countless homes around the country by the health cuts controversy has been scandalous and disgraceful. People waiting to enter hospital for treatment are fearful that they may not now be able to do so.  People going around perfectly healthy are now terrified at the prospect of they or any member of their family falling ill.  It is wrong that this should happen in Ireland in 1987.  It is even worse when it is realised that there is no need for such panic to be generated in the first place.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the present <i>mêlée</i> of conflicting claim and counter-claim from the Minister for Health, health board executives, doctors, nurses and trade unions in the health sector must rest squarely with the present Government.  It stems directly from the absence of any coherent, thought-out policy on health. It is appalling that, in one of the most fundamental areas of public policy, the new Fianna Fáil Government have no policy.  When they have begun to apply very necessary constraints on the overall health budget all hell breaks loose.  Every vested interest group in the health care industry rush to defend their special interest.  It should be remembered that this is now a major industry employing well over 60,000 people.  Unfortunately, in the ensuing controversy, the real losers are the ordinary Irish people who are bamboozled by claim and counter-claim. Daily the latest headlines scream about more ward closures, more doctors and nurses being let go, vital services &mdash; be they sexual assault units, bone marrow transplant or heart surgery programmes &mdash; being terminated or disrupted.  We have also witnessed claims by some health professionals that people, including children, will die as a direct result of the current cutbacks.</P>
    <P>All of this stems from the absence of a coherent policy on the part of the present Government.  All last week in this House the Government refused to allow a debate, demanded by the Progressive <Col N="2300" /> Democrats and other parties, which could coldly, rationally and unemotionally examine the facts of the situation. That too was a major failure on the part of the Government.  That is why the Progressive Democrats decided to table this motion on the health cuts this week.  We are glad to give Dáil Éireann and the Irish public an opportunity to have the issue debated, to force the Government to stop hiding behind procedures and bland claims, to force them to face up to their responsibility to govern in this essential area &mdash; the delivery of health care for our people.</P>
    <P>Over the past two weeks I and other members of my party have identified and highlighted the core problem of the present controversy.  It has been taken up by other parties since.  It is stated simply in our motion before the House this evening, that is, our call on the Minister for Health to set guidelines for expenditure on health this year that would ensure an acceptable level of service.</P>
    <P>In a statement I issued last week I called on the Government to agree and publish national programmes for different categories of health care, such as open heart surgery, hip replacement, kidney dialysis and transplant, care of the elderly, psychiatric care and so on, and to allocate a budget to them.  That would take such priority health care programmes out of the realm of being a political football and reduce the anxiety of people in those categories.</P>
    <P>These proposals demonstrate the absence of proper control over the health budget, vital to the public, as taxpayers, on the one hand and, on the other, as users of the health services.  We might consider for a moment the crazy way health care is funded.  Practically all of the enormous budget, totalling approximately £1.3 billion this year, is provided by way of central Government grant to the eight health boards, voluntary hospitals and other agencies.  Yet the Government, the guardian of the public purse, retain little or no say on how that money is spent.  In theory the Department of Health are the watchdog.  As I and my colleagues will demonstrate in <Col N="2301" /> the course of this debate, not only does that watchdog not bark but he is hardly ever at his post.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House and the public that the Progressive Democrats are fundamentally committed to getting public spending under control.  How can a Government get such spending under control if they dole it out &mdash; as in the case of the health services in the amount of £1.3 billion &mdash; and retain little or no control over how that money is spent?</P>
    <P>One has only to observe the explosion in the health budget since the inception of the health boards in the early serventies and the advent of an unfortuante era here in which the fellow who pays the piper no longer call the tune.  Since the mid-seventies, health spending here has grown tenfold and has more than doubled in real terms.  Staff totals in the health boards have grown from less than 24,000 in 1971 to 57,000 today.  Are we really that much healthier today as a result of this explosion of health spending?  I do not believe we are.</P>
    <P>Along the way, the massive bureaucracy of the health boards has grown up. Now vested interest groups exist who feel threatended by any change.  We must cry stop to this.  We must restore Government control of the health services in pursuit of the very logical maxim that if the Exchequer &mdash; on behalf of the taxpayer &mdash; pays the health care piper, then he has a right to, and must, call the tune. In this regard, I want the Minister for Health to spell out the Government's position on this matter which is compounding the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Tough decisions have now to be taken, but the Government and the Minister for Health cannot have it both ways.  To avoid being seen to take the tough decisions, they like to point to the autonomy of the health boards' elected membership and executive and maintain that any cutbacks are their fault.  But, when the health board executives do propose various cuts which are endorsed by the elected members, the Minister and the Government chastise them for so doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues cannot have it both ways.  The only logical stance <Col N="2302" /> to take now is to set proper guidelines for the delivery of health care, take direct, central control of the system and responsibility for any cutbacks or programme adjustments that must be made.</P>
    <P>Such a policy would enable clear national programmes to be decided.  It would also facilitate a programme to reduce the bureaucracy spawned by the health boards at both administrative and representative level.  It would also ensure that the various vested interest groups in the health services are prevented from persisting in the scare tactics of the past couple of weeks.  The plain fact of the matter is that the scale of panic and threatened cutbacks now being highlighted is out of all proportion to the adjustment in the health budget.  But the Government are failing to govern.  The vacuum resulting from their cowardice is being filled by the self-interest chorus of every group in this sector.</P>
    <P>I and my party colleagues now intend to go on to demonstrate the shambles the health system has become in this country.  It largely stems from the unplanned and uncontrolled system that grew up over the past 15 years.  If the present Minister and his Government do not know what needs to be done, then let the Progressive Democrats tell them.</P>
    <P>Most people in this House will be familiar with the necessity to develop proper community care and preventive health services that will keep people from becoming ill in the first place, and which will keep them out of the costly acute hospital system.  But that has become a cliché because the <i>status quo</i> represented by the health boards, the massive hospitals network and the attendant workforce of professionals, general workers and administrative staff continue to monopolise the health budget.</P>
    <P>Last year, only £300 million of the £1,300 million health budget went into what could be termed community services, while the general hospital services got £715 million of the budget.  The bulk of that money went to health boards and voluntary hospitals and none of these is seriously accountable to the Exchequer or the Department of Health in any <Col N="2303" /> meaningful way.  In particular the £250 million or so given out to the voluntary hospitals represents an extraordinary lack of public accountability for such a vast sum of taxpayers' money.  It is a situation that must not continue.</P>
    <P>This situation is reflected throughout the entire system.  From the hospital capital programme to the implementation of computerisation in the health service, to the performance of the different working groups, most notably hospital consultants, the record is one of lack of control, mismanaged funds and inadequate accountability.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate further.  The Department of Health have already spent over £10 million on a computerisation programme for the health services that should ultimately embrace the health boards and the hospitals.  One needs little imagination to appreciate the efficiencies and savings a co-ordinated national computer programme could bring to the health service, covering all aspects of administration and doing away with many routine administrative chores at local office level.  Most information would be available at the press of a button on a computer VDU.  It would also be invaluable in keeping records of payments for services and would be a major check on bad debts arising.</P>
    <P>What is the reality?  There has been no cost-benefit analysis by the Department of Health on their computerisation programme. Various hospitals and health boards are at different stages of computerisation; there is no co-ordination and different agencies have adopted different computer systems.  The whole thing is a shambles.</P>
    <P>This is a programme that has been going on now since the beginning of the eighties.  There is no overall strategy.  This is one issue which I want the Minister for Health to explain to the Dáil and to the Irish people.  It is a disgrace what has been happening to date here.  When we see health board and hospital administrators concentrating solely in recent weeks on the necessity for ward closures <Col N="2304" /> and the curtailment of vital medical services, and no reference is made to the cost of the shambles of a computerisation programme, then we are left wondering what games are being played.</P>
    <P>Let us move to a more basic issue, the question of catering and administration in our hospitals, many of them individually large institutions with a thousand or more people to be fed and looked after every day.  You would imagine that one of the benefits that would have flowed from the elaborate administrative structure of the eight health boards and the Department of Health in the role of grand conductor, would be ensuring the best value for money when it comes to hospitals buying provisions, running their various departments and adopting the most cost-efficient in-house systems.</P>
    <P>The reality is sadly different.  Major hospitals would be major purchasers of food and other supplies.  But do they operate the most efficient house-keeping systems, bearing in mind that in 1984, for instance, expenditure in the health services on food, laundry, furniture, bedding, clothing, etc. was over £55 million? Two years ago the then Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure retained the Trident Management Consultants to examine these areas in the management of the health services.  They unveiled a haphazard and uneven policy of tendering for supplies of food, differing criteria for accepting tenders and the evidence is of varying prices for basis supplies as between hospitals.</P>
    <P>Methods of preparing and distributing meals in hospitals &mdash; a major administrative task, as can be imagined &mdash; vary from the most cost-efficient downwards. According to the Trident report, ten hospitals had at the time adopted the most efficient food preparation system, but there was one notable feature.  In the case of those ten hospitals, the consequential staff rota changes and the savings in weekend work and overtime, to justify the investment in the new system, were not made.  Another equally disturbing, if not more disturbing, finding by the consultants was that for one large general hospital they visited, they found <Col N="2305" /> absenteeism among one section of the non-medical staff nearly 25 per cent and to be a major problem, according to the management.</P>
    <P>In this short debate I do not have time &mdash; I intend to give part of my time to my colleague, Deputy Quill &mdash; to detail all the areas where savings can be effected without affecting the level of services.  A further example of waste is the decision by the Department to delist several cheap drugs from the GMS resulting in doctors writing very expensive alternatives.  The classic example here is Zantac and Tagamet costing the GMS over £5 million annually.  Some patients need these drugs, which save very expensive surgery, but in many cases a simple inexpensive antacid would be quite adequate.</P>
    <P>I hope now we are beginning to see a more comprehensive picture of areas needing tackling in the present budget adjustment climate.  What is the Minister's response to these realities, I wonder?  Moreover, I believe that these facts serve to highlight the extent to which the axe is currently being wielded in a selective way by the health board and hospital administrators to pressurise the Government of the day to cave in and give more money.  But I also return to my fundamental point.  If the Minister gives them <i>carte blanche</i> with the taxpayers' millions, can the same Minister really cry foul when they behave in this arbitrary manner?</P>
    <P>The problems with the health system and the need for accountability and proper management do not end there.  If ever one needed a single example of what is wrong with the Irish health service, one need not look beyond the role and position of the thousand or so hospital consultants.  Now everybody realises the vital importance of such key health experts, and their life and death role in the system.  But the question that must be asked is whether this country can go on affording the kind of conditions enjoyed by the consultant in the public health system.</P>
    <P>The so-called common contract for the consultants, now operating since 1981, <Col N="2306" /> affords the specialists working conditions which are surely the envy of any other group in this country.  Their contract with the voluntary hospital or health board is permanent and pensionable; with a working week of 27 or 33 hours, six weeks holidays, sick leave, special leave, sabbatical leave, rest days, travel and subsistence allowance and all telephone costs.</P>
    <P>That is only the half of it.  The contract also specifically allows consultants unrestricted leave to pursue parallel private practice inside and outside the hospital for which they are contracted to provide public medical care on behalf of the State.  Their contract specifically states that there will not be any exact measurement of the time a consultant gives his public patients.  He may do the 33 hours per week or more, or maybe just 13.</P>
    <P>Nor does the contract specify the responsibility of the consultant, or set down his role as a key person in the delivery of health services.  Two years ago, the average consultant's salary under the common contract for public patients was £32,000.  It is a rate of pay that compares very favourably with the pay for consultants in Britain.  The problems that flow from this set-up are unlimited. There is the obvious potential conflict of interest between the consultant's public and private practice.  Are public patients with VHI cover encouraged to &ldquo;go private&rdquo;?  Are public facilities paid for by the taxpayer unfairly used by consultants in their private practice?</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that the Progressive Democrats are fully in favour of private medicine, and as many people as possible providing for their own health care.  But we also are committed to a comprehensive system of health care for those who cannot afford private care and we are concerned in the interests of all taxpayers that the latter service is delivered as efficiently as possible and is not being ripped off by any sector of workers in the service, be they porters, administrators, consultants or indeed politicians as members of health boards and local health committees &mdash; and that is <Col N="2307" /> something my colleague, Deputy Máirín Quill, will take up later.</P>
    <P>In Britain, hospital consultants are restricted to earning no more than 10 per cent of their public salary in private practice.  Here the correlation is more likely that consultants are doubling their public salary, at least.</P>
    <P>It is also worth pointing out that the contract was supposed to be reviewed after five years, but my understanding is that this has not yet taken place.  I want the Minister for Health to tell the Progressive Democrats and the Irish people what is the up-to-date position here.  Is it true, for instance, that the consultants, through the Irish Medical Organisation, are refusing to participate in this review?</P>
    <P>All in all, it adds another dimension to the sorry story of a health service out of control, and being exploited for the benefit of the employees of the system, rather than being organised and guided to provide the best service to the general public.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that making our health services more cost-efficient is going to be a tough job.  It is a job for the Minister for Health, and he cannot hide behind health boards, chief executive officers or local politicians.  There is an urgent need now for the Minister to spell out his party's policy; to set guidelines to ensure the maintenance of satisfactory level of services and to remove the doubt and confusion that has caused such alarm and upset so many people.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have out lined in this debate some areas of our health service where major cost savings could be effected without withdrawing essential services as is now happening. The Minister is abrogating his responsibilities and should resign if he is not prepared to spell out in detail how the finances available to him are to be allocated within the service.</P>
    <P>As of now, he stands condemned of withdrawing essential services from severely handicapped children and extremely ill people and there are many elderly people gravely upset and feeling very insecure because of what is happening. <Col N="2308" /> The Fianna Fáil Party are in a sorry state when they have no health policy.  The false election document has happily been torn up but the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, must get a grip on the situation quickly.  There is plenty of goodwill and willingness to co-operate if the right approach is adopted.</P>
    <P>Take the case of Monkstown Hospital, a private voluntary hospital in Dublin.  Their 1987 allocation is a cut of 22 per cent on the previous year.  Despite numerous requests, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has not been able to tell them if he plans to close it or what future he sees for it.  To the great credit of the staff of the hospital, I understand they have decided to take a cut in salary of 15 per cent from the highest paid to the lowest paid in order to maintain the level of service until the Minister tells them what the future of their hospital is to be.</P>
    <P>Such sacrifices should not have to be made but hopefully such steps, including this debate, will force the Minister to take control in planning the future health services for this country.</P>

      <P>It is a measure of how seriously the Progressive Democrats view the present state of the health services in Ireland that we have sought to have the matter discussed, logically and constructively, in our Private Members' time, here, where decisions ought to be made, on the floor of Dáil Éireann.  We hope that by the end of this debate some degree of common sense and compassion will be brought to bear on the matter and that necessary changes will result.  It certainly is our aim to be as constructive and as positive as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, may I say we fully support the Minister in his bid to hold this year's health bill at £1.3 billion.  That is a generous allocation by the standards of any other developed country and ought to be enough to enable us to provide an excellent comprehensive health service <Col N="2309" /> for all our people.  Why, then, with a budget of that size, has a position arisen where so many people genuinely in need of medical care are now being excluded from the system?  The examples of this are legion, and cover every constituency but I will give a few examples from my constituency.</P>
    <P>I will begin with the North Infirmary, a small economical hospital with excellent medical care, and the only general hospital on the north side of Cork city serving a population of 65,000 people. This hospital is being asked to take cutbacks of 20 per cent in this financial year, a cutback in a budget which is already pared to the bone, and any further cutbacks would inevitably lead to the closure of this hospital leaving 65,000 people without a general hospital of any kind. Moreover, the cost of keeping a patient in this hospital is only 60 per cent of the cost of keeping the equivalent patient in any other hospital in Cork city.  Where is the saving in this transaction?</P>
    <P>A further grotesque example is the closing of the children's psychiatric unit at Sarsfield Court.  This is the only residential psychiatric unit for emotionally disturbed and sexually abused children in the whole region of the Southern Health Board.  If this unit is closed &mdash; and the date of its closure is given as Friday next &mdash; then the long-term implications for the health service could be very costly in financial terms and could be horrendous in human terms.  We had the example last week where sick children were wheeled out of a children's ward in Bantry hospital.  Is that what our health service has come to?  I could go on and on but I will not give further examples.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked: what has gone wrong?  Who determined our health priorities?  Where is scarce taxpayers' money being spent?  If we aim to make cuts, and we must, surely the knife should first fall on the top-heavy bureaucracy? One thing is absolutely certain, and it is this, the administration side of our health costs has gone out of all proportion.  We must now seriously ask and answer the question: for how long more can we afford to sustain eight regional health <Col N="2310" /> boards and a generously endowed Department of Health?</P>
    <P>Certainly, the issue of tackling the number of health boards is very complex, but there is little doubt that if one health board, the Eastern, can cater for one-third of the country's population, then logically it must be argued the remainder of the country could be covered by another two.  In an era of computerisation, it must surely be possible to administer the health services with fewer than eight major administrative structures around the country.  On the figures I have given I believe the ideal figure might be three.  Indeed, we must examine the fundamental question of whether we need any health boards at all, especially when all the money for the health services is provided centrally.</P>
    <P>I believe that at present we have the worst of all worlds &mdash; a massive bureaucratic structure represented by the eight health boards spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money without having to provide any real accountability for their actions.  In my view that is the key to the explosion in health spending over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The wasteful practices within the administration of the health boards has been well documented in recent days, and nowhere better than in some of our Sunday newspapers.  Three weeks ago I asked the Minister if he would issue a directive to health boards to cut down on costly travelling expenses, and pointed out the need to abolish advisory committees as an initial step to reducing wasteful expenditure I gave him the figure for my own health board area, but nothing has happened since.</P>
    <P>After 17 years of health boards, surely it is time to radically overhaul the whole structure, to cut it down to size, or to cut it out altogether.  I will give but one salient figure &mdash; and it is a fact: a health board official gets more per mile in travelling expenses than a home help gets per hour for minding an elderly person and keeping that person out of hospital.  So much for the concept of community care.</P>
    <P>In this respect, while all other countries are developing their services in the direction <Col N="2311" /> of community care, we have made little, if any, progress in that direction. At present, less than 25 per cent of all health board spending in the Southern Health Board goes on community care, whereas half goes on general hospitals and one-fifth on special hospitals.  This is not a ratio one would find in any other developed country.  The Southern Health Board intend to cut £1.5 million from their community care budget this year. That will be a very backward step.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the absence of any real budgeting for preventative medicine indicates that there is no long term strategy which is proved by the meagre service provided to children at school by way of medical or dental care.  If we were serious about preventative medicine, we would be putting additional resources into it. That is how to cut down on our health bill if that is our aim.  However, I see no evidence of that in this year's budget. This leads one to conclude that health policy is not being made in any degree by the elected members of health boards who are essentially close to the people and ought to know their needs.</P>
    <P>Fundamental decisions are made by powerful vested interests within the health service and the challenge for the Minister now is to tackle these interests. There is scope in the Department of Health for a number of economies especially in relation to the engineering and architectural divisions.  Do the Department need such a large &mdash; or indeed any &mdash; architectural and engineering staff, given that when there is work to be done by way of construction of a new hospital or extending an existing one, consultants in these areas are inevitably appointed as well?  In practice, the health boards and a large number of voluntary hospitals have their own engineers on the staff and very often when a project is undertaken, not alone is there wasteful duplication of work, but also there is triplication.  This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money and must be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> There is scope within the administrative section for substantial economies and we are asking the Minister in the short term to take the situation in hand.  The first and major cuts should be in the area of administration and not at the point where sick people need the service.  He should also, as a matter of urgency, undertake a radical overhaul of the administration of the health service.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats wish to show a responsible attitude on behalf of all the people.  The problems in the health services have been brought about by the callous and uncaring attitude of the Minister for Health and his Department. The Minister should put forward a cohesive plan for health as it would be of great help to the medical profession, the hospitals and the people.  We urge the Minister and the Department to clarify the situation so that people's fears may be put to rest once and for all.  There should be a plan which envisages how many acute and surgical beds are needed. How many geriatric and paediatric beds are needed?  Is there any co-ordination in these areas?  The Department are drawing lines across figures but there is no semblance of a plan for what is needed in the area of public health care.</P>
      <P>My two colleagues have already highlighted many of the areas which are being questioned.  No answers have yet been given in regard to the administrative cost of the health services.  Figures have doubled over the past couple of years as staffing has grown from 40,000 to 60,000 people, most of whom are employed in the area of administration.  Are all these people providing the direct and necessary health care needed?  That is not the case. The people are being asked to bear the brunt of the Minister's uncaring and ill thought out cuts.  The Minister is hiding behind the actions which he is allowing the health boards to take.  That cannot continue.  It is wrong that people should be made to suffer because of a lack of commitment and a formulated plan from the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members spoke earlier on about wastage, expecially in relation to the health <Col N="2313" /> services.  Care is not taken to ensure that services are maintained in a cost efficient manner.  The Minister told us last week that he was asking hospitals to put forward plans for health services.  It was an admission that he was incapable of formulating plans and that he realised wrong decisions had been taken.  In the County and City Infirmary, Waterford, the budget has been cut by 24 per cent although it provides most of the hospital services in that area.  I have made these points to the Minister already regarding this hospital and I do not want to reiterate them.  Hospitals are being closed down without any regard as to where the patients are to go.  The medical staff and even those within the health boards are unsure of the outcome.  Is this the way to run a health service?  Is this the caring attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
    <P>We know that proper rationalisation is needed in the health services.  However, the Minister and the Government missed a golden opportunity over the past few weeks to put forward a cohesive and properly thought out plan.  Instead, they have hidden behind ill thought out figures and have cut costs in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner. They have driven people in many areas to the depths of despair in regard to what will happen.  This would have been totally unnecessary if the Minister had told the health boards and the people the facts about the health services and if he had introduced a proper plan which could be adhered to.  We implore the Minister to take due regard of this motion and to clarify all the issues concerned, not just for our sake but for those who look to us to be responsible in the area of health care.  They are waiting for an answer.</P>

      <P>It is right that I remind the House and the country generally of what exactly has happened in regard to the health services.  I am only two months in office and I am the third Minister for Health to hold that office this year.  Up to 20 January last Deputy Barry Desmond was Minister for Health.  He resigned because he could not contemplate staying in office with his Fine Gael partners because of the measures proposed by that party; in particular, he could not tolerate the prescription charges at £1 per item prescribed for those people who are deemed eligible to hold a medical card and who by that definition are the very poorest in our community. The prescription charges proposed by Fine Gael would impose untold hardships on the least well off in our society.  I imagine, too, he found it difficult to accept the proposal to remove the right of doctors to dispense drugs to their patients who lived at a distance from pharmacies and, he could not accept that the allocation for the general medical services scheme could be underprovided to the extent of £25 million could be raised from prescription drugs in the remainder of this year, 1987.  Deputy Desmond knew, and I have no doubt that the Fine Gael Government knew, that the Health Act would have to be amended. That that would take time and that it would not be possible to raise the £16 <Col N="2315" /> million as suggested in the Estimate of 20 January.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Boland, as Minister for Health imposed the ban on dispensing in remote rural areas but significantly, although his one-party Government were pursuing a pathway of financial rectitude, did not issue the letters of allocation to the health agencies.  It is reasonable to ask why health boards were not notified of their allocation by the Fine Gael Government after they produced their book of estimates.  We came to Government in the middle of March and the budget was presented to the House on 31 March.  The earliest opportunity we had to give the allocations to the health boards was the day after the budget.  I met with the health boards on 2 April in order to give them their allocation for the current year but at that stage three months of the year had already passed.</P>
      <P>It is only right we should ask why Fine Gael did not send out those allocations. It was irresponsible not to notify them and thereby lost them valuable time in adjusting to the circumstances of the year.  Deputy Boland, as Minister, knew whichever way it went it had to be a difficult year &mdash; primarily I suspect because he, too, could not accept the under-provision for the general medical services scheme.  That was the reason he did not send out the allocation.  He knew the unreality of the expectation of collecting £16 million from prescription charges in the current year and the inequity of attempting to do so.</P>
      <P>I assumed office on 10 March 1987.  I and my Cabinet colleagues were, to put it at its mildest, shocked to discover the real extent of the financial problems facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to face the inherent threat that if we did not get public expenditure under control the external agencies would step in and do it for us in an unpalatable and clinical way. Despite those underlying financial problems I, with my colleagues in Cabinet, <Col N="2316" /> examined the allocations proposed for the health services, added to them in certain respects, providing for example, an extra £25 million for the general medical services.  I rescinded the decision to impose prescription charges, and provided for out-patient and in-patient charges supported by a Voluntary Health Insurance scheme moderately priced.  In this respect, I made absolutely sure by the list of exemptions which I included that there would not be hardship imposed upon anyone.  I also restored the right of doctors working in the remote areas to dispense medicines for those living at a distance from pharmacies.</P>
      <P>In issuing the 1987 letters of allocation to health boards and voluntary hospitals I laid down very clear and specific guidelines to the agencies on how they should frame their budgets.  My concern was to ensure that the basic fabric of our health care system should remain intact while, at the same time, ensuring that the best possible service should be delivered within the amounts available.  The specific instructions to agencies required that they should seek to make necessary spending reductions to the institutional area, and in particular in the acute hospital sector.  The overall bed provision in our acute general hospitals is widely accepted as more than adequate to meet our needs and is high by reference to international norms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I directed agencies that community care services should be protected as far as possible including key services for the old and housebound, such as community nursing services, services for the mentally handicapped, home help services and meals-on-wheels, child care services, particularly day care and pre-school services for deprived and disadvantaged communities and aftercare programmes for children leaving long term residential care.  Adequate provision should also be made for boarding out payments to reflect the trends towards increased numbers in foster care.  I asked the health boards to ensure that their expenditure on these services should be maintained at least at 1986 approved levels in real terms.  This approach is in keeping with <Col N="2317" /> the modern view about the nature of health care and with expressed Government policy to protect primary care within the community rather than hospital-based treatment.</P>
    <P>The guidelines I have referred to had regard to the overriding need to maintain frontline staff, who provide a service directly to the sick in our community, at an acceptable level.  I did not think it unreasonable that the letter of allocation should require the health boards and the voluntary general hospitals directly funded from the Department to face up to the harsh reality of the need to bring their expenditure into line with what their allocations could realistically support instead of, as in previous years, incurring overruns which essentially went unchecked.  There were overruns of £19 million in 1985 and £36 million in 1986, the responsibility of the Fine Gael-Labour Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who were in office during those years.  These overruns are the root cause of their present difficulties. That is the cause of the problem and the difficulty faced by my Department and by the health agencies at present.  Talking about accountability, I was surprised at the attack Deputy Molloy made on the voluntary hospitals who, first of all, have their accounts audited by private commercial auditors and then checked by the departmental officer to ensure they comply with the specific guidelines laid down.  In my meeting &mdash; the first meeting since November 1983 with the eight chairmen and CEOs of the health boards &mdash; I elaborated on the guidelines which should ordain their approach to living within the allocations while, at the same time, preserving essential services.  I asked them particularly to draw up realistic plans to live within their allocation and I told them that officers of the Department would consult with them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that a team from my Department met the management <Col N="2318" /> teams of each of the health boards and voluntary hospitals in the last fortnight.  My Department are now analysing the agencies' proposals with a view to ensuring that, overall, the service plans are co-ordinated and rational.  This will require new arrangements for co-ordinated action between health agencies locally and my Department and those arrangements are being put in place.</P>
    <P>An examination of public services generally by the Government led immediately to the conclusion that, to a very significant extent, the problem of the numbers employed in the public sector has not in reality been tackled in recent years.  For example, when I took office there were some 62,000 people employed in health boards and other agencies to provide health services.  Ten years ago there were 51,000.  I find it difficult to accept that this increse in numbers has produced a corresponding improvement during that time in the quality of the service delivered to the patient.  Given the financial difficulties facing the economy at present this clearly is a situation which could not be allowed to continue. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance announced that no public service vacancy could be filled without the express approval of the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Department of Finance it was agreed that because of the late stage in the financial year, the random effect on services by closing down all vacancies as they occurred and the particular sensitive nature of the health services a package of (i) non-filling of some vacancies; (ii) reduction in current temporary employees and (iii) reduced scale of locum cover, to achieve an overall reduction of 2,000 posts by 31 December 1987 was agreed.</P>
    <P>The setting of a specific target for each agency gave the managements of health agencies flexibility to ameliorate the harsher effects on services of a total embargo on the filling of vacancies and the provision of locum cover.  At the same time it involved agencies taking a much stricter <Col N="2319" /> approach to the employment of temporary staff and the provision of locum cover than previously: in fact, it seems that these forms of employment have been used by many agencies to circumvent earlier controls on the numbers employed in the health service.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable inaccurate public comment of late suggesting that clerical and administrative staff in the health services have been dealt with more leniently than other categories of staff as a result of the economy measures being taken by health agencies and that these grades have been spared at the expense of nursing medical posts.  I would like at this stage to deal briefly with those allegations.</P>
    <P>The factual position is that health agencies were instructed to reduce overall staff numbers by a number of means and that these reductions were as far as possible to be spread evenly across the grades. Clerical and administrative grades account for about 10 per cent of all staff employed in the health services.  The reality is that less than 2 per cent of the total staff of health boards is engaged in central administration.  The remainder are involved in delivering vital services directly to the public.  These would be community welfare officers, staff involved in determining eligibility for medical cards, and those involved in the making of payments under the drugs refund scheme and the payment of cash allowances to the disabled and the handicapped. Other important functions such as the payment of wages and pensions, ordering of goods and supplies, maintaining proper medical records and scheduling of our-patient clinic appointments must also be carried out by these grades even in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the task of collecting the new out-patient and in-patient charges which are of such vital importance to the financing of the services this year will also fall on these grades.  It is clear therefore that the scope for widespread reductions in the administrative grades employed in the health <Col N="2320" /> service has been considerably exaggerated. I am satisfied on the basis of the most recent information to hand that the numbers in clerical-administrative grades will be reduced proportionately consistent with the many important functions they carry out.</P>
    <P>One feature of reductions in personnel and pay costs, calls for the general payment of a new flat allowance of £50 per week for student nurses during the first year of their training, plus free accommodation, in line with a scheme already in operation in the North Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the health services' difficulties have been hyped by various elements, who should know better.  There has been a great deal of immoderate and insupportable statements which have caused unnecessary anxiety to patients and relatives alike.  I do not for one minute attempt to deny the right of the individual to reasonable protest but I do decry the right of persons or groups to cause public unease or to suggest for one minute that the health services are reduced to the state at which they cannot provide services necessary to meet the essential requirement of our people.</P>
    <P>The task now is to shape a health service which is affordable and sustainable. It seems that there are two critical areas to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We must have an acute hospital system which is geared to our ability to pay, which is effective and caring, and which is efficient.  Alongside it and associated with it at all vital points, we must have a primary health care system which is capable of doing many of the things now done in hospitals.  I want to elaborate on these two key points.</P>
    <P>In adapting the acute hospital system to our present circumstances, we must take a number of important decisions. The House will accept that the consultant is central to effective and economical running of the acute hospital services.  They will have to play a primary role in the management of the funding available to their specialties within the hospital.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the IMO in my <Col N="2321" /> meetings with them that I am anxious to press on with a review of the common contract, a review which is overdue and which should have been held last year and in which among other things I intend to place considerable emphasis on the need for proper monitoring and accountability. We must decide on the level of funding we are prepared to devote to this sector of the service.  In making this decision, we must ensure that there are adequate funds for other services, including primary health care.</P>
    <P>We must organise the system so that each hospital within it is medically viable and gives a quality service in a business like manner.</P>
    <P>We must quickly develop a form of primary health care which provides a real and available alternative to hospital care. This is not now the case.  It can hardly be, as long as the general practitioner services remain divorced from other services.</P>
    <P>My Department have made a preliminary assessment of the acute hospital system which we could sustain at an acceptable level of quality, having regard to our available resources.  There is no need to believe that such a rationalisation would leave us at any disadvantage compared with other countries.  The Danes for example, in the past five years have reduced the number of acute beds in their country by 6,000.  Each remaining bed and hospital in the system will be worked more intensively but will be properly supported.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is no harm to point out that in all European countries and in the United States there is considerable concern at the cost of health services and at the inability to meet that cost, particularly in relation to high technology medicine.  All European countries have had to go through the same traumatic experience which we are going through at present as regards having to bring proper financing into our health services.  Much wealthier countries such as Germany, France, Denmark, to which I have already referred, and the United Kingdom have all had to face the reality that they were unable to provide the necessary finance to provide <Col N="2322" /> the level of service and the high technology medicine people expected.  It is also no harm to point out the escalating costs of our own health services which went from £146 million in 1974 to over £1,300 million this year.  It has been stated that if that type of escalation was to continue to the turn of the century it would take all of the budget to provide finance for the health services alone.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from my own experience, from the many reports which have been completed on this subject, and from the information available to my Department that there is scope for a significant reduction in the number of acute beds. However, we will only get the real benefits from such a reduction if the beds are distributed as part of an integrated system.  The proposals for reductions which have now been put before the Department are being examined to ascertain if they are in keeping with what will be our requirements in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>In my recent address to the association of health boards, I made it clear that I do not believe there is any particular merit now in reducing the number of health boards.  I hold the view that it is important that there should be some form of devolved administration to ensure that the services which are necessary are available at local level and that there is access to those services.  I believe it is only right that on difficult decisions which have to be made there should be an input at local level and that elected representatives and those who represent the people working in the health services, the doctors, the nurses, the dentists and the pharmacists should have an opportunity to decide priorities in their own area.  We have seen that happen over the last three weeks when the health boards met and decided on the priorities in their own specific health board areas.  In a democracy, that is how it should be.</P>
    <P>I refute the criticism that I, as Minister, am hiding behind the health boards, because if I were to decide where the savings should be made in each county, without reference to the local democratic <Col N="2323" /> organisations, I would be accused of being dictatorial and of not giving local people an opportunity to decide on the priorities in their own specific areas.  I believe that in the past three weeks the health boards have faced up to their responsibilities.  They had to make difficult decisions and they decided what the priorities were.  I fail to understand how any Minister for Health can be criticised for allowing local democracy to have an input into decision making, as has been done.  As I pointed out, the Department made the allocation to the health boards and to the voluntary hospitals and they decided how they would effect the savings.</P>
    <P>A team of senior officials from my Department visited every health board and every voluntary hospital to examine how the savings are to be made and they reported back to me.  We are now studying the results of their travels around the country to ensure that we have a rationalised health service in place.  I am satisfied that we will have a rationalised health service not alone for this year but for the years to come.  As Minister, I will accept responsibility for my actions and I certainly make no apology for allowing the health boards to have an input into decision making on fundamental matters such as the priorities in their own areas.</P>
    <P>We can now move quickly to streamline our acute hospital system.  Starting next week, officers of the hospital services division of my Department, with assistance from Comhairle na nOspidéal, will commence consultations in each health board area.  They will meet with the management of health boards and voluntary hospitals and the staff interests involved to devise a plan for each area.  In other words, there will be a consultative process in each health board area.  I believe this is desirable.  Not alone will it give the health boards and voluntary agencies an opportunity to come together and examine the situation and ensure that there is rationalisation in their own area but it will also give those working in the service an opportunity to make their views known on how funds should be <Col N="2324" /> expended in their area.  When that is done, the results will be considered globally in the Department to ensure that they are integrated at regional and national level.  I will then convene a national conference of the various interests affected before finally deciding upon the definitive national plan. Because of the implications, not least in the making of allocations in respect of 1988 and subsequent years, this plan will have to be settled by the end of July.</P>
    <P>We do not start from scratch.  First of all, a number of areas require relatively little attention to bring them into line with current concepts of a good hospital service.  Secondly, we have available from Comhairle na nOspidéal a great many helpful reports and recommendations. Thirdly, my Department have already undertaken a considerable amount of work in analysing the implications of the general course which I am advocating.  The Department will in their work draw on available sources of expertise, influence and advice.</P>
    <P>There are special problems in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  There is, particularly in Dublin and Cork, an urgent need for better co-ordination between the voluntary hospitals and between these hospitals and the health board.  I am asking my Department to initiate consultations immediately with the various authorities in these areas to work out suitable arrangements for co-ordination of existing services and appropriate involvement in the future rationalisation of the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>In settling the future level of expenditure on acute hospitals, I propose to set aside funds for the development and support of primary health care.  I am studying work which has been carried out on the adequacy of the primary health care elements of community care service. I envisage that in one or two areas we will get some pilot schemes under way as soon as possible.  The purpose of the schemes will be to test, in practice, the extent to which alternatives to hospital care can be developed and to work out the best working relationships between <Col N="2325" /> hospitals and community based services. We want to ensure that a fully operational primary health care system, when in place, will conform to the needs of our people, let it be in remote rural areas or in the inner cities.  I will be asking for the wholehearted support of all those concerned in the implementation of these pilot schemes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am preparing a statement on our priority needs in the institutional care of the chronic sick and the terminally ill.  We need this quickly so that we can properly explore all reasonable options in the rationalisation of the acute services.</P>
    <P>I have set up a special containment and efficiency unit within the past two months to provide this support service to the various agencies.  Information will be available to the health boards and to the voluntary hospitals on the purchasing of supplies.  I believe that this co-ordinated approach will be extremely useful.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that we need to give urgent and detailed consideration to the future financing of our health services.  I have, therefore, with the Government's approval, made arrangements to establish a broadly based review group to examine the appropriate level and sources of funding consistent with the maintenance of an equitable, adequate and comprehensive health service.  I will be making a statement on the constitution of the group within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Two months is not a long time in office but I think I can claim to have got a grip on the situation.  The Government have faced up to the reality, which the previous administration ran away from, namely, that there is a limit to the amount of money it is possible to spend on health services in our present serious financial situation.  Since coming to office I have introduced an amendment to the Health Act which was passed in this House and made regulations to impose the out-patient charges.  Other motions and adjournment debates relating to the so-called health cutbacks have been dealt with.  I have had to devote time to preparing very necessary and very delayed children's legislation and I have introduced the AIDS information campaign which I am <Col N="2326" /> glad to say is going extremely well.  I might say in this regard that I was heartened to discover at an EC Council of Health Ministers meeting last Friday how well my campaign measures up to those being undertaken elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I should point out before I conclude that the cut of £22.8 million referred to in the Fine Gael amendment cannot be substantiated.  I would, in conclusion, urge that we in this House should, when we complete this week's debates and discussion, allow for a cooling off period on health matters to enable a rational and sensible approach to the problems in this area to prevail.  I believe that the challenge can be overcome and that we can emerge out of the present phase with a leaner, fitter, better and more effective health service.</P>

What is he talking about?  I shall list a number of serious situations arising even this week.  First, 1,850 junior hospital doctors will strike from 6 June next indefinitely at hospitals where management refuse to discuss job losses with the doctors.  Secondly, and this is not a hype either, in Limerick angry hospital workers from Clare, Tipperary and Limerick this week marched on the Western Health Board offices to protest at job losses and cuts in the services to the public.  In Carlow, a last ditch effort has been made to save Bagenalstown 32-bed District Hospital which has been ear-marked for closure by the South Eastern Health Board.  That is no hype.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community welfare officers were the subject of a discussion today on the Order of Business.  Members of the Confederated Workers Union of Ireland will stop work on 29 May next over a threatened 10 per cent cutback in jobs in the Eastern Health Board.  There will be a demonstration this week in Dublin to protest at the closures and cutbacks.  In my city, in the North Infirmary, to which Deputy Quill referred earlier, the board of management this week met, for the fourth time in only two weeks and decided to reject the cuts being imposed by the Department of Health.  That decision will either force the Department <Col N="2328" /> to change their minds and increase an allocation or to close the hospital which has given the north side of Cork city unbroken service for 132 years.  These are no hypes.  These are just examples of the many crises in the health services at this time.  The last example reflects deeply the effect that the virtual elimination of the health services will have on the entire community on one side of Cork city.</P>
    <P>When this Government were elected, they were asked to do the job of keeping public spending under control.  They have gone ahead in a trigger-happy manner and brought great hardship on those most in need of care.  We all expected savings to be made and rationalistion to take place, but we expected that these actions would take place only after full consultation with those responsible for patient care and for the provision of these vital services.  The consultation seems to be starting only now, when irreparable damage has been done to the health services. Hospital patients, the poor and the deprived are being put in the front line of these savage cuts.  Administrative and other economics have not been thought out or even explored.  The health services are in turmoil and if there is a need for a moratorium or a cooling off period, the time for that is now so that the whole situation can be looked at in a cool and calculated manner.  Before damage is done to the health services I ask the Minister to identify his better way to have it thought out, with consultation with the people who are providing the services.  I support the calls being made for a national think-in on the situation. The Minister must take action, so that reorganisation of the health services is undertaken in a rational and humane way.</P>
    <P>I put it to this House that the cuts made have been made without proper thought in regard to the possible consequences. How can anybody contradict that statement when we have seen what has happened in the last seven days?  We have seen a clinic dealing with child abuse in this city threatened with closure.  Deputy Quill earlier referred to a clinic in Cork city under the control of the Southern <Col N="2329" /> Health Board, which deals with the whole north Lee area, closing next Friday because of cutbacks &mdash; a clinic dealing with the most disadvantaged children in our community.</P>
    <P>These examples of the false economy, woolly thinking and disjointed actions which have taken place throughout the health system and which will leave huge gaps in our health services to the public at the end of the day.  Every health board and every agency are doing their own thing in an adjointed, unco-ordinated way.  They are like headless chickens running around in a disorganised way, leaving serious gaps in our health services.</P>
    <P>Before any further cuts are made, let me mention one inaccurate statement that has been made recently &mdash; and I am being charitable in using the adjective &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo;.  The Minister repeated tonight that the previous administration had left the health services £50 million short.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>£55 million short.  I would remind the Minister that the health boards that overspent against the wishes of the Department of Health were controlled by his party and that he was a party to some of the decisions made.  I would further remind the Minister that two of these health boards which are Fianna Fáil controlled are still refusing to make the cuts his Department are attempting to impose on them that Deputy Leyden would not agree with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The demand for the elimination of the deficits that were accumulated by the health boards over five years will take, at a conservation estimate, about £10 million out of the system this year alone. That, coupled with the reduction in the hospital services allocation in this year's budget to £22.8 million, would take a total of over £30 million out of the health services for this year.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the figure I quoted could not be substantiated and I should like to deal with that suggestion. The 1986 Health Estimate was <Col N="2330" /> £1,168,791 million while the January Estimate was £1,177.6 million.  The March Estimate was £1,168.8 million. The January budget proposal would have given a net increase of £3.5 million while the March budget shows a drop of £5.128 million compared to the 1986 Estimate. The most savage decrease arises in the programme of grants to health boards and other health institutions.  The allocation in 1986 to health boards, excluding the GMS, was £656 million while the January budget proposed an allocation of £667.9 million, an increase of £11.9 million or 2 per cent.  The revised March figure was £660.7 million, an increase of £4.5 million over the 1986 figure but a £7.2 million reduction on the January Estimate.  The allocation for &ldquo;Other Institutions&rdquo; in 1986 was £298.7 million. The January budget proposed £303.4 million, an increase of £4.7 million or 2 per cent over 1986, while the revised allocation in March was £290.8 million, a reduction of £7.9 million or 3 per cent. That represents a reduction of £12.6 million compared to the proposed January budget.  With regard to Capital Services the allocation in 1986 was £58.7 million while the January proposal was to allocate £60.6 million, an increase of £1.9 million or 3 per cent.  The revised allocation in March was £57.6 million, a reduction of £1.1 million or 2 per cent. Compared to the January allocation that represented a reduction of £3 million. The total reduction in the allocation in March, compared to the January allocation was £22.8 million.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, Fianna Fáil will take in £6 million in in-patient charges but that is only a notional figure and it may not be collected in full.  A condition of all allocations this year is the elimination of the accumulated deficit over five years to 1991.  Therefore, each health board will have to eliminate its deficit within this period.  Prior to this there was not a firm agreement on how the deficit could be eliminated.  For example, in the Southern Health Board, who have a deficit of £7.2 million, £2.6 million is being eliminated this year by using European Social Fund moneys.  In 1986 the Department withheld <Col N="2331" /> £855,000 towards the deficit and in 1984-85 they withheld £700,000.  As one can see from those figures in the case of the Southern Health Board £1.75 million is being taken out of their funds this year to reduce the deficit.  If each Member applied those figures to their health board we would get a conservative figure of £10 million being taken out of health board funds for this year, together with the reduction of £22.8 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruitment of staff, up to March a one-in-three embargo operated but now we have a total embargo which is expected to result in a saving of £11 million.  That embargo is causing chaos in all health board areas and in voluntary hospitals.  I have no doubt it will have a catastrophic effect on services to the public.  Another serious problem for the health boards is that their maximum overdraft will be limited.  That would cause cash flow problems for health boards.  The result is that health boards will have to take action in the pay area to redress staff numbers and apply the embargo.  One example is that the North Infirmary in Cork will have to close 40 of the 103 beds.  That is an indication of the problems the cutbacks are causing.</P>
    <P>The drastic reductions in the community care programme, despite the Minister's assurance tonight, are apparent from the figures.  Those reductions, coupled with the proposals of some health boards to close down accommodation for psychiatric patients, will cause chaos in the community.  In the Southern Health Board region the proposal is to have a 30 per cent reduction in beds in acute units in all hospitals, the closure of seven wards in Our Lady's Hospital, the relocation of patients in other wards and the discharge of long term patients into the community.  Some patients who have been institutionalised for 35 years are threatened with discharge from our hospitals into a community that cannot cater for them because of the reduction in the allocation for community care.</P>
    <P>I hope to be positive in my comments and I will put forward suggestions on how <Col N="2332" /> improvements can be made.  I agree with many of the points raised by the Progressive Democrats.  Many of their proposals are a direct lift from the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure, of which I was a member, published in January.  That report dealt at length with the common contract, the inadequacies of it and the need for a review of it.  I was pleased to hear the Minister express the view that the common contract should be reviewed.  He expressed a similar view some weeks ago and I should like to know what progress has been made since.</P>

      <P>The IMO who have been to the fore expressing their dissatisfaction with some of the cuts being made are reluctant to enter into negotiations on the common contract which was scheduled for review since 1986.  To date that organisation has refused to renegotiate that contract which has been in existence since 1979 and gives some of its members very liberal conditions in our hospital service. I accept that the majority of consultants in our hospital service are dedicated people but a minority of them are ripping the system blind.  The common contract for some of the unscrupulous individuals within the service is a licence to print money.  Deputy Molloy, when he doubled their salary to £64,000 because of their access to private practice within the public service, was being very conservative. I know of one consultant in the Cork region who can earn £200 for two hours work using hospital staff and equipment in the Cork Regional Hospital.  That affects the morale of other staff in the hospital service.  It is shattering to those whose salaries are being cut to the bone. In my view that was the cause of a lot of the bitterness that occurred during the radiographers' dispute.  They could see their colleagues on the medical side ripping the system blind.  That small minority of consultants will have to be nailed. <Col N="2333" /> It is up to the Minister to get the IMO to the negotiating table as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There is agreement amongst all with the exception of the Minister, on the crying need to reduce the number of health boards.  The debate tonight is very confined but the evidence from the Minister's replies in the Dáil last week shows that we are top-heavy with administrative and clerical staff.  In 1977 the administrative and clerical staff comprised 10 per cent of all staff according to the Minister's reply on 12 May 1987.  In 1986 administrative and clerical staff comprised 14 per cent of all staff in the health service.  That is a 40 per cent increase in administrative and clerical staff.  That must be looked at.</P>
      <P>We have one health board, the Eastern Health Board, dealing with one-third of our population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for choosing this urgent matter for the Adjournment this evening and I apologise for keeping the House and the Minister. The subject which I raised on the Order of Business this morning warrants consideration now because if the threatened strike takes place there will be very grave hardship for many of the least well off people in the Eastern Health Board area.  This problem is part and parcel of the general health cutbacks.  I will not go into them now because on Thursday, apart from the Private Members' debate which will go on tonight and tomorrow night, we will have an all-day debate on health cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job involved here is a function performed by the EHB on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare and it does not relate to the Department of Health. However, it has been affected by the <Col N="2334" /> general cutbacks.  I support the need to prune public expenditure but cutbacks must be well planned and selective.  In the EHB area we have a total of 150 community welfare officers who are in the front line in relieving poverty on a day-to-day basis.  The poorest sections of our community are those who depend on supplementary welfare as their sole source of income.  Some people depend on that allowance for prolonged periods because for one reason or another they are ineligible for social welfare benefits or allowances.  Many others have the supplementary welfare allowance as their sole source of income while they are awaiting confirmation of their eligibility for some social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance system was designed as an emergency system to deal with isolated cases where there was no source of income.  It was never intended to be a widespread service but it is now so widespread that it allows the Department to take many weeks to decide on eligibility in respect of claims made.  I am not criticising the Department as I know they deal with hundreds of thousands of cases each week but perhaps there is a tendency to over-rely on the supplementary welfare system because things are less urgent as people will at least be receiving supplementary welfare allowance and are not without any income.  All of that has imposed a major burden on the supplementary welfare system and on the community welfare officer and, combined with a growth in unemployment, it has required a major expansion in the supplementary welfare system and a major increase in the number of community welfare officers.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is at an extraordinary level and many unemployed people have cause to go to the community welfare officer each week.  I understand about 7,000 families in the EHB area are dependent on supplementary welfare allowance. Many thousands more depend on supplementary income to supplement low income from another source.  Many thousands more go for help with their ESB bills, their rent arrears or their mortgage <Col N="2335" /> repayments.  A heavy burden has built up on the shoulders of the community welfare officers under the supplementary welfare system.  Not only do they have to deal with vast numbers of people each week but many of the people with whom they deal are deeply frustrated and angry.  The community welfare officers are in the front line dealing with traumatic situations and with tense people.  They must often deal with abuse. Their job has become very tense.</P>
    <P>If anything, the cutbacks imposed in this year's budget will lead to further unemployment.  It is estimated that the health cutbacks alone will lead to 4,000 more people being unemployed.  That is before we consider education cuts or cuts in other aspects of public expenditure. Unemployment will get worse rather than better so the burden on the community welfare officer will increase.  On top of that, we have the Government's Jobsearch programme which is clearly designed to hunt people off the unemployment register.  There may be some people on the register who deserve to be removed from it, who are illegally drawing unemployment payments.  I have no sympathy for them.  I have no doubt that the Jobsearch programme will bring genuine casualties who will have no other source of income.  Where will they go but to the community welfare office?</P>
    <P>Of the 150 community welfare officers employed by the Eastern Health Board, 50 hold temporary appointments &mdash; one third of the entire number.  This is becoming an increasingly convenient way of filling necessary posts in certain areas of the public service and, as we have seen in the wider health service, these people can be dismissed without any rights when the pressure comes on.  That may not necessarily be a good thing.  I understand that the sanctioning of these posts is a matter for the Department of Health, not the Department of Social Welfare.  I also understand that 10 permanent posts have been sanctioned, increasing the number of such posts to 110, but that still leaves 40 temporary appointments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2336" /> A health centre cannot open a supplementary welfare office if there is no community welfare officer on duty.  Community welfare officers are not only entitled to annual leave but need it.  A situation has now arisen whereby 15 community welfare officers are being let go by the end of next week.  As a result many other officers who have already booked and paid for their annual holidays have been told they cannot go because the health centres would have to close.  Of course they have a statutory right to those holidays but if they go, what about the poorest people in our society?  Who will be there to deal with emergencies where people have no other source of income? These are the group for whom we must have the deepest consideration, people who have nothing but income from supplementary welfare allowance.  Then there are those who are on such low incomes that they are entitled to supplementary income from the community welfare officer.  In the third category are people who are threatened with eviction because of rent arrears or whose electricity supply has been disconnected because of failure to pay bills.</P>
    <P>What plans has the Minister to prevent the strike taking place?  The officers gave two weeks' notice which runs out on Friday of next week, the beginning of the bank holiday weekend.  The problem will effectively start on Tuesday week, 2 June.  The Minister has time to take action to try to prevent the strike.  It takes two to tango and I suggest that the Minister might approach the FWUI who represent the community welfare officers and ask them to postpone the strike for a period of weeks, during which time he might meet them to see if there is any way out of the problem.  That would be a useful procedure for the Minister to undertake.  If the Minister is not prepared to do so or if this approach does not work, perhaps he would outline for us his contingency plans to ensure that those sections of the community whom I have described will not be left without assistance. What plans has he to deal with those who have no other income or whose <Col N="2337" /> income is so low that they need supplementary assistance every week?  What are his plans to deal with emergencies like fire or electricity disconnections?  Will he approach the ESB and ask them to cease disconnections while the strike is on and to reconnect people whose supply has been disconnected before the strike begins?  Will he ask local authorities to discontinue evictions or other measures to deal with rent arrears while the strike lasts?  What will he do to make sure that nobody is going hungry for lack of income?  That does not in any way exaggerate what we are talking about.  If no contingency arrangements are made, at least 7,000 families in the EHB area will literally go hungry because they have no other income.  I would ask the Minister to outline his plans to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Among those who have no other income are people drawing interim supplementary welfare payments pending decisions from the Minister's Department on eligibility for various benefits.  I understand that no less than 40 per cent of the work of community welfare officers in Dublin is based on dealing with these interim payments.  The Minister and the Department should be trying to cut down the time lag in deciding these cases.  I know the Department have to check records and contact labour exchanges and community welfare offices.  This often takes time but there must be some way of speeding up the process.  If there were a properly developed computer system in the Department there would be terminals in exchanges and in health centres so that payments made by community welfare officers could be recorded.  Conversely, officers could tap into the computers to find out what payments had recently been made and to check eligibility  that the Minister has only recently taken up office and I am not attempting to blame him for any slowness in the progress of computerisation.  However, the effects of the threatened strike would be a lot less dramatic if the computer system were developed and I would be very keen to see a stepping up of the computerisation programme within the Department, <Col N="2338" /> especially in the frontline offices which service the public.  I would also like the Revenue Commissioners' computers and those in the Department of Social Welfare to be compatible and capable of being interfaced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to express the strong wish that this strike does not take place.  I appeal not only to the Minister to take whatever steps he can to prevent the strike taking place but also to the community welfare officers not to push it to the brink.  I hope that goodwill will prevail and that some way can be found out of this frightening situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the matters the Deputy raised at the conclusion of his address are the subject of parliamentary questions which are down for tomorrow so I take it that these can be answered in that context.  These relate particularly to the speeding up of payments, the computerisation of the Department and the other areas the Deputy mentioned in that connection.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a scheme of last resort for people in financial need.  Obviously, the Government will be extremely concerned at any action which might disrupt in any way the administration of this scheme. I am aware that there is the threat of industrial action by the community welfare officers at the end of this month. Discussions are going on involving the Eastern Health Board, who are responsible for the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Dublin area, and the Department of Health to try to resolve the matters at issue and to prevent the threatened industrial action from taking place.  Naturally, I am not in a position to comment on the nature or programme of these discussions and it would be injudicious of me to do so.  I understand also that every effort is being made by the health board to resolve the matter before it comes to industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured of my concern in this matter.  I share with him the concern which he has expressed here this <Col N="2339" /> evening.  I will be keeping in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Health, and with the health board and I am confident that the matter at issue can be resolved without getting to the stage <Col N="2340" /> where people in need would be made to suffer in any way.</P>

      <P>Inspections are carried out by officers of my Department at all stages of the marketing chain to ensure that the statutory standards are being observed.

      <P>At present under the Community regulations the sale and leasing of milk quotas can only take place if the lands to which the quotas are attached are also sold and leased.</P>
      <P>I have been pressing the EC Commission to bring forward proposals to enable young farmers, developing farmers and other special category producers to purchase permanent quotas available within their co-operative areas as a result of other producers ceasing production.  I am hopeful that legal difficulties which caused the withdrawal of an earlier proposal will shortly be overcome and, if so, I will be seeking the early adoption by the Council of Ministers of the revised proposal.  I am pursuing the matter further at this week's meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>Exports of seed potatoes declined sharply in the early 1980's due to a steep increase in production costs and the lack of suitable new varieties to compete in export markets.  In the meantime the variety, Cara, has been successfully established on those markets but increased production was inhibited by unfavourable weather in the years 1983, 1985 and 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given favourable conditions, and proper attention to efficiency and disease control, there is considerable potential for increasing exports.  Research work <Col N="2154" /> into developing new varieties for commercial sale is being undertaken by An Foras Talúntais.  Irish Potato Marketing Limited, who are the agents for the institute's varieties, have recently adopted measures for improving their marketing arrangements and reducing marketing costs with a view to expansion of exports.  It is also intended that An Bord Glas should pay particular attention to developing the seed potato export trade.</P>

      <P>The Desmond Castle Banqueting Hall was acquired by the Commissioners of Public Works in 1981.  Subsequently some <Col N="2160" /> minor repair and maintenance works were carried out.  A major conservation scheme is proposed involving the re-roofing of the building, extensive masonry works to the tops of the walls, conservation of the tower, repairs and repointing of the walls and repairs to windows and doors.  The project will take a number of years to complete.  The commissioners are at present reviewing their national monuments programme and I cannot say at present whether this work will be commenced this year or whether it will have to be postponed to a future year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 21 April 1987 after <Col N="2169" /> which date payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee as soon as possible.  His entitlement to benefit will then be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 14 March 1987. Payment of benefit was authorised from 18 March 1987 the fourth day of incapacity at £41.10 per week.</P>
      <P>In support of his claim, however, the claimant has only submitted a first medical certificate.  In order that payment can be made it is necessary that a further medical certificate stating the date to which the claimant has been incapacitated should be submitted.  The Department has requested this further medical evidence.  On receipt of this evidence all benefit payable will be issued. Generally, medical evidence on a continuing weekly basis is required in claims of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Contractors or employees of firms outside the State who are engaged in work on contracts within the jurisdiction are, with some exceptions, subject to the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts in the same manner as employers and employees from within the State.  The exceptions relate to employees sent to work in this State from other member states of the EC for a period of not more than 12 months. Under EC Regulations these employees may remain subject to the social security legislation of the member state from which they came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made through the medium of the controls and inspections carried out within the Department to detect and eliminate abuses of the system by any employers or employees.  EC Regulations provide for co-operation between member states in enforcing compliance with the provisions of the social security legislation of individual member states by persons subject to that legislation <Col N="2171" /> but resident in another member state.</P>

      <P>Following investigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned he was assessed with weekly means of £25.85, derived from the value of capital.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of unemployment assistance of £7.15 a week, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £33.00 less means of £25.85.</P>
      <P>On 20 February 1987 he appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and, arising from contentions raised by him in support of his appeal, his papers were referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  These inquiries, which have proven to be protracted, will be completed as soon as possible and his case will then be submitted to an appeals officer for determination at the earliest available opportunity.  The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was last insurably employed in the United Kingdom.  Under the EEC regulations on social security responsibility for a claim to benefit rests with the member state under whose legislation the claimant was last insurably employed.</P>
      <P>His claim therefore, is proper to the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  Accordingly, the claim together with the medical evidence was transferred to the British authorities on 23 April and is still with them. The person concerned should contact the Department of Health and Social Security with any further enquiries relating to his claim.  In the meantime if the means of the person concerned are insufficient to meet his needs he should contact his local community welfare officer with a view to claiming supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must be available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 12 January 1987.  However, he furnished medical evidence to his local office indicating that he was not available for employment due to incapacity and his claim was, accordingly, disallowed from 12 January 1987.  He was advised of his right to appeal the decision but failed to do so.  He has continued to sign the unemployed register to date.</P>
      <P>If the circumstances of the person concerned have changed and he is now capable of work, he should notify his local office immediately and his entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed. However, if he continues to be incapable of work he should lodge a claim for disability benefit for the period of his incapacity.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 39 contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate in the governing contribution year.  The person concerned is not entitled to unemployment benefit as, according to the <Col N="2174" /> Department's records, he had only 26 contributions during the contribution year 6 April 1985 to 5 April 1986 which governed his claim made on 27 April 1987.  These contributions represent the period April 1985 to September 1985 when he was working.  He was attending college for the remainder of the contribution year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts the yearly value of all property owned by an applicant for unemployment assistance or by his spouse, other than property personally used such as the family home, is assessed as means on the basis of the capital value of the property.  The capital value of property to be assessed in any such case is ascertained by reference to the Valuation Office and this has always been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2175" /> The yearly value of property for unemployment assistance purposes is taken to be 5 per cent of the first £400 of the capital value and 10 per cent of the excess over £400.

There were 79,746 disability benefit claims in payment on the latter date.  29,490 beneficiaries were requested to attend for examination by a medical referee in the period to 1 May.

    <P>Of those summoned, 9,252 persons did not attend for examination.  Of these, 767 were certified by their own doctors as <Col N="2176" /> unfit to attend for examination and 1,194 submitted final certificates.  The balance of those who did not attend represents a mixture of cases such as persons who returned to work without sending in final certificates and persons who submitted explanations for failure to attend etc. Those who failed to attend without good cause are subject to a disallowance of benefit for up to nine weeks and are again listed for referral to a medical referee.</P>

      <P>I am aware that it is very difficult for grant applicants to contact housing grants section.  This has been the position for the past 1½ years now and is due to the very exceptional increase in the number of callers trying to contact the section. The position generally, however, has improved since I took up office in that it is now easier to contact those sections of my Department on the main number (793377) while the provision of a separate number (793200) for housing grants has reduced the size of the queues waiting to get through to housing grants section.  I expect further substantial improvements in telephone access to the section over the next few months as the major effort <Col N="2187" /> to clear the backlog of applications begin to have effect.</P>
      <P>I am having the Deputy's suggestion regarding the provision of a special number for TDs examined and I will be in touch with him shortly in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 228 to 230, inclusive, together.  Following discussions between the then Minister for Labour and AnCO, the Council of AnCO decided to provide, on a pilot basis, a creche for the staff of the Department of Labour, AnCO and other associated bodies.  The council took this decision subject to the approval of the then Minister which was given in October 1986, though formal sanction would not normally be required for such a project. Similar facilities are provided by a number of employers in the public sector for the children of members of their staffs.</P>
      <P>The start up costs of the creche were borne by AnCO.  No payments have been made towards these costs by my Department. I understand that parents using the facilities pay charges in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The then Minister took the view that use of the premises as a creche for children of the staff of the Department of Labour, AnCO and its other associated bodies did not require planning permission. In September 1986 he sent details of the proposal to the planning department of Dublin Corporation for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated, this is a pilot project and it will be evaluated by AnCO before the lease expires in September 1987.  I see the future of the creche as a matter primarily for AnCO.  I would expect them to have regard to all relevant considerations <Col N="2221" /> including the views of local residents in reaching a decision.  Management of the creche is a matter for AnCO; the other matters raised in the questions related to day to day aspects of the running of the creche.</P>

      <P>The total annual cost to the Exchequer of the supply of any particular drug through the public health services comprehends the costs incurred in respect of supply through the GMS (&ldquo;Choice of Doctor&rdquo;) scheme, the drugs refund scheme, the long term illness scheme, direct purchases by health board pharmacies and purchases made by the various voluntary hospitals etc.  It will be appreciated that only the annual cost arising in the GMS scheme can be readily quantified.</P>
      <P>In 1986, the total cost of supply of DF118 to medical card holders through the GMS scheme amounted to £70,526.</P>
      <P>DF118 is a proprietary preparation which contains the drug dihydrocodeine. Both the injectable and tablet forms of DF118 are controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  However, different régimes of control apply to DF118 injections and tablets.</P>
      <P>In relation to DF118 injections, these are subject to the same strict regime of control, including the prescription-only requirement, as applies to morphine.</P>
      <P>DF118 tablets, on the other hand, have not been subject to the prescription-only requirement.  Neither are they subject to the same detailed record-keeping requirements as apply to the injection form.</P>
      <P>There has been some evidence of abuse of DF118 tablets and we have already taken steps to deal with this situation.  As from 1 July 1987, DF118 tablets will be subject to the prescription-only requirement by virtue of the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987, which come into effect on that date.</P>

        <i>Limerick West):</i> At present there are two contracts for the supply of vehicle registration plates to Government Departments. Both contracts are held by Irish firms, and are for plates manufactured in this country.  These contracts were placed in accordance with Government contracts procedures, and competitive tenders were invited from all known Irish suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been found recently that registration plates which were not to specification have been supplied under one of the contracts, and my Department has <Col N="2228" /> invited tenders with a view to placing new contracts.  In this case also, tenders have been invited from all known Irish suppliers. New contracts will be placed shortly.</P>
    <P>I should add that contracts are placed by my Department on the basis of competitive tendering, in accordance with Government contracts procedures. Because of this country's membership of the European Economic Community, a Government Department may not insist that all, or any, of the work involved in meeting its supply orders be carried out in the State.</P>

      <P>In recent years the demand for aid under my Department's capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities has greatly exceeded the resources available for the scheme.  It was not possible to accede to an application made by Ballybricken Community Association in 1985 for a grant towards the cost of a project.  When their case for grant was being considered in the context of the 1986 allocation it was found that the project was already almost completed and was not, therefore, eligible for a grant under the scheme.</P>

    <P>* Regarding the number of secondary teachers <Col N="2240" /> not in receipt of incremental salary, who are full time or part time this information is not available to my Department as secondary schools are private institutions and the employment of such teachers is a matter for the managerial authorities. My Department has allotted 18,612 part time hours in 1986-87 to secondary schools, in exceptional circumstances, but how these hours are distributed amongst part time teachers employed in the schools is a matter for school management.</P>
    <P>** This figure represents number of whole time teachers.</P>
    <P>*** An allocation of teaching staff is authorised annually by the Department to the 38 Vocational Education Committees on a scheme-wide basis.</P>
    <P>The allocation is expressed in whole time teacher equivalent units (i.e. may be utilised in permanent, temporary and part time staff as the VEC decides), and as the teachers are in fact both employed and paid by the individual VECs, the Department does not have an accurate record of the breakdown of staff in the format requested.</P>

    <P>The Minister may, in special circumstances, exceptionally approve a class exceeding the number prescribed above.  In that event he may require that a second teacher be provided to assist with the practical instruction.</P>
    <P>My Department does not issue guidelines to post-primary schools as to the upper limit of pupils to be allowed in classes for general subjects.  This would be a matter for determination by the <Col N="2242" /> school authorities having regard to all the relevant circumstances such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>
