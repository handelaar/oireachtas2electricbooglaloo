      <P>In adjourning the debate yesterday I was about to address myself to the question of the suspension or abolition of the home improvement grants and certain housing grants.  In particular, I wish to refer to the £5,000 grant for <Col N="640" /> local authority tenants who surrender their local authority houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time this grant was introduced it was pointed out to us that there could be very considerable social consequences arising from its introduction. Indeed, many community and social workers and other involved in trying to build up new communities in new local authority housing developments in certain areas, particularly in my own constituency of Dublin South West, pointed out again and again the disastrous social consequences which could arise from the introduction of the local authority house surrender grant.  Unfortunately, at that time there was not in position a proper local authority tenant purchase scheme.  It was felt by many of us at that time that, had such a scheme been in position, many people who wished to own their own home and who found themselves renting local authority accommodation would prefer to buy their local authority house.  Of course, in the absence of a tenant purchase scheme this was not possible and it is for that reason we have had the spectacle in certain local authority estates, particularly in and around Dublin, of empty houses being vandalised because of the drain of tenants from local authority housing estates who were moving out under the £5,000 scheme.</P>
      <P>There have been repeated calls during the past number of years for this scheme to be abolished.  Regardless of the rights or wrongs of the abolition of the grant in question at this time it gives an opportunity to local authority tenants to purchase their own local authority homes. We would certainly encourage this as there is now in position a tenant purchase scheme.  I hope the Minister in due course will have another look at the scheme which was introduced by the Coalition Government, to tighten it up in certain respects and to make it more possible for tenants to purchase their own local authority house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> The measures taken in this budget begin the process of rebuilding the economy and we can only do so by reducing significantly the costs of output.  In that way I am convinced we can go to foreign markets and sell our goods and services to the benefit of the economy because they will be competitive.  We must adopt a more aggressive and positive attitude in seeking out new international markets. We must research the potential abroad for our products and services.  Our own management at home must recognise the range of opportunities which exist on the world market which are presently being taken up by our more aggressive competitors in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We are a small country but we have many competitive advantages.  We are located in the EC and therefore have access to markets.  We have a good and sound infrastructure including airports, telecommunications, transport and computer technology and skills.  Above all, we have an educated people capable of acquiring new skills through retraining and realising new potentials.  Too often the workforce alone are called upon to make considerable sacrifices in the creation of employment and too often they draw an unfair amount of criticism because of their attitude to industrial disputes and their resolution.</P>
    <P>We have in recent times noted an increasing willingness on the part of workers to adopt very reasonable conditions in agreeing to changes in work practices so as to secure existing jobs and in many cases create the conditions for increasing investment in their particular industries.  We have seen local communities and community organisations taking an active interest in trying to protect existing jobs.  We had a very clear example of this in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Community Council in my own constituency took the initiative in trying to resolve a very serious dispute in Packard Electric.  By their actions they ensured that most of the workers participated in taking a decision with regard to a package of changes which the management were trying to introduce.  In so doing, the Tallaght Community Council <Col N="642" /> helped in no small way to protect more than 1,100 jobs in that area which are so badly needed at present.  I applaud the council for their action in this regard and would suggest to other community organisations around the country that they might become similarly involved when difficult local situations develop, so that the problems in relation to threats to jobs can be highlighted for their potentially disastrous effect on the community.</P>
    <P>Management, too, have their responsibility in this area.  We need a more enlightened approach from management in seeking new opportunities for industrial development and expansion.  Management must be more aggressive in seeking new markets abroad for their products and services.  They must not reach the point where their energies are confined solely to defending their share of the market at home and abroad.  Too often it seems that management are content merely to hold what they have in foreign markets.  Real efforts will have to be made to expand opportunities abroad for further exports.</P>
    <P>An aggressive and sustained market identification programme must be adopted by our native industries to enhance their penetration of foreign markets where, undoubtedly, opportunities exist.  We have considerable natural resources and this is recognised.  Fianna Fáil's commitment to developing these resources and skills will certainly lead to direct job creation.  The further downstream processing of our natural resources, whether they be from the seas around our country or from our land, increases the number of jobs created. The very important aspect of added value also arises.  This is particularly important where the finished product can be exported or where it is used for import substitution.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of Government Departments as announced by the Taoiseach should lead to greater cohesion in our efforts to achieve essential growth and to create the climate for ever-increasing exports.  It must surely be agreed by all in this House that it would have been necessary for any Government to tackle <Col N="643" /> the problems of our public finances and bring them into order.  The Minister for Finance begins on the road to recovery for the country.  There are few soft options anymore in this matter.  We in Government cannot give in to single interest groups.  We will all have to bear some of the unpopular decisions that must be taken to get this country of ours back to economic stability.  The public finances will have to be managed properly from here on.  The productive areas of our economy must be boosted.  Borrowing and the cost of our national debt must be progressively reduced and these are the targets set out by this Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly decided that our public services are costing too much. To achieve cost cutting, we must look at the wasteful areas of expenditure and curtail some of the schemes which we have traditionally acknowledged as being essential.  It has been stated that public service pay, standing at £2,840 million, is a staggering figure and even with the previous Government's embargo the size of the public service in terms of numbers employed is quite enormous.</P>
    <P>While the PAYE taxpayer does not get any tax band adjustment in this budget, it is reasonable to expect that in getting our public finances into order it will be possible for the Fianna Fáil Government to introduce changes in PAYE rates as early as possible in the future.  This is in line with the various programmes set out by us leading up to and during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>We have a great number of large buyers through their involvement in retail businesses, in the construction industry and other aspects of economic activity here.  The buyers and purchasers in these establishments should consider more carefully where they place their orders. They should consider very carefully as they write their purchase orders to foreign companies and should address themselves more particularly and more specifically to the need to buy at home, to purchase raw materials, goods and services wherever possible in this country. <Col N="644" /> They need to have a certain bias in favour of purchasing Irish-made goods, services available here and raw materials.  The Buy Irish campaign, which seems to move in fits and starts, has all but disappeared from the mind and perception of the public.  A new campaign should be launched by this Government to spell out clearly the need to buy Irish at all times and to ensure that more and more jobs are created.  It is not good enough that we should see such a huge volume of imports coming in, in practically every area, when it is clear to all that much of what is being imported can be purchased locally.  It is, therefore, important for users to make contact with manufacturers and other suppliers here so that between them they can work out how best native Irish industry can supply the needs of our purchasers.</P>
    <P>The people demand that action be taken now.  I believe they are prepared to accept that a difficult situation requires firm and decisive action.  They are prepared to make sacrifices provided they can be assured that their sacrifices on this occasion will not be wasted, as has so often happened in the past.  Let us in this House put aside our political differences in so far as our common objectives are concerned.  Our objectives ought surely to be the creation of worthwhile jobs so that more and more of our people can return to work, or as in the case of young people, can commence their working lives and we can begin to halt the drain of emigration which has returned to curse this country once again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been generally an acceptance for some time that particular action with regard to the curtailment of expenditure is necessary in order to bring about the kind of economic environment that would benefit the country both now and in the future, in order to provide opportunities for our young people and to ensure that we can offer future generations something to look forward to.  It can fairly be said that if all the political parties and all interest groups here over the past 15 or 20 years had taken account of the need to provide for <Col N="645" /> what was then the future, probably we would not have had the kinds of problems about which we have spoken in this House and which the country has experienced over the past number of years. Probably now there is a consensus, or near enough to a consensus, in regard to the problems facing the country.  One must also compare the kind of consensus that existed just before the recent election, what the public were being told then and are being told now.  Some political parties, in fairness to them, attempted to set out as clearly as they could exactly what the circumstances were and what they were likely to be after the election.</P>
      <P>As people drove along the national primary and secondary routes they saw large posters and billboards exhorting them to vote in a certain fashion and thereby have the problems that beset them alleviated.  The public did respond by voting fairly substantially for two political parties who prior to the election were in opposition.  Those two parties achieved a total of 95 seats.  One would assume that the public would not expect to have been let down so quickly after the election in regard to the promises made by those two political parties before the election but there are substantial grounds and increased evidence to show that not only have the public been let down already but that there is a fair chance they will be let down even further in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the differences between the budget we are now debating and the one which was issued and published by the outgoing Government.  It was indicated by the minority Fine Gael Government in January that certain curtailments would have to be made in health, social welfare and various other areas.  The reaction from the party who are now in Government was not one of recognition of a problem or support of any indication other than that they would do things differently and better and that there was a better way.  When they were pressed on this at the time they had very little to say in regard to specifics other than that they would not be drawn and that things would be different.  I refer to <Col N="646" /> the debates which took place in this House during the past 12 months.  I am thinking in terms of various debates during Private Members' Time on cutbacks in the area of health as they were seen at that time, debates on teachers' pay, on agriculture and various other issues which arose, not in the long distant past, but during the time immediately prior to the last election.  If one was to have regard to what was said during those debates by the then Opposition, one could assume safely that things were going to be extremely different, greatly improved and that as a result the people would have a much better lifestyle and a much higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>The realities now seem to contrast fairly dramatically with those proposals. The electorate were promised one thing and they are now getting something else. I mention this because it is a dangerous thing for politicians of one party or another to trifle with the electorate in that fashion.  It gives the impression that by supporting a party with a particular philosophy prior to an election people can expect to have their hopes dashed afterwards.  This does nothing either for democracy or stability.  I hope it is something we will not see in future elections.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the health cuts which were much publicised when the previous Government were in office.  Scarcely a day passed when there was not a major hue and cry in relation to a certain hospital or discipline within the health services that was under threat.  Day after day and night after night in this House we heard about the impending doom and gloom that was about to descend on those services.  Every moment we expected to hear about hospitals closing and day by day we were told they were about to close.</P>
    <P>Naturally one would have assumed that that being the case, there would be no fears in that regard after a change of Government.  However, the reverse is the case.  A typical example of this is the County Hospital in Naas.  Despite all the scares this hospital had adequate funds to run its services for the past four years during the previous administration.  The <Col N="647" /> Minister at the time saw fit to introduce, implement, encourage and support a plan to upgrade and extend services to such an extent that the first stage of that upgrading has been approved and is hopefully ready to be implemented.  It is peculiar that at present one ward in that hospital is closed.  It is a small hospital and the closure of a ward can have a major impact on the input that hospital has to the services.  There are other similar cases throughout the country.  I hope the present trend does not continue.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister opposite is familiar with the health services and I hope he will convey to his colleague, the Minister for Health, the dangers of pursuing policies of curtailment of that nature with regard to small hospitals.  Such policies will result in the closure of hospitals.  A policy of not replacing staff who are on maternity or other leave or of not relocating or develoying staff is strangling the services.  If allowed continue, that kind of policy is the ultimate conclusion will be a complete decentralisation of hospital services.  Only the very large regional hospitals and the very large hospitals in Dublin city will survive because they have the resources to cushion themselves against that type of policy.</P>
    <P>The embargo on staff in relation to hospital services is going to cause serious problems in the same fashion.  This embargo has the same effect as virtually closing half of the services.  If the type of staff embargo that is now being talked about and seriously considered is strictly enforced and allowed to continue I can see no help for the smaller hospitals.  In any event rural areas will suffer to the greatest extent.</P>
    <P>The £10 charge for hospital beds which was discussed last night will hurt the sector of the community who now seem to carry the entire burden of taxation. We hear much talk in the House about the burdens on the PAYE sector.  This charge hits the PAYE sector more than anybody else.  It hits the people who do not have medical cards, who have to pay, not only health and educational services, but for all their services.  The people in <Col N="648" /> the middle income group seem to have to carry the burden of responsibility for everything.  They will have a further burden put on them by the imposition of this charge.  This will not be to the benefit of the services or of the people whom we had hoped were going to receive some recognition from the Government.</P>
    <P>As junior spokesman on Agriculture and the Food Industry I should like to refer to the impact of the budget on this sector.  First, I should like to refer to agriculture in general.  Prior to the recent general election, two political parties campaigned vigorously on the basis of their proposal to abolish farm tax.  The proposal sounded very attractive and it was very attractive in certain quarters.  I suppose it is right to say that as a result those political parties achieved electoral success.  What is the outcome now?  Have the farming community received the kind of injection by way of enthusiasm, financial support or recognition that they expected?  The abolition of the farm tax has aggravated a situation whereby the smaller farmer felt that he or she was paying the bulk of the taxation that was being paid by agriculture.</P>
    <P>Numerous references have been made during the past few years to those highly efficient and hard-working farmers who operate small farming units and who, both under the old system and under the system the Government now propose to revert to, pay the bulk of the taxation which is being paid by the agricultural sector.  They now find that the Government propose to ensure that they do so in the future.  The small farming units were well prepared and had readily agreed to accept farm taxation in the fashion proposed by the outgoing Government.  That has been reversed and it is not to the benefit of those small farming units.  In recent times it has been indicated by certain farming organisations that those farmers were of the opinion that they would much prefer to operate on the basis of the farm tax rather than on an accounts system, a farm profile system or any other system that <Col N="649" /> required a massive amount of bureaucracy and which was highly expensive from the point of view of Government and the Revenue Commissioners and from the point of view of the farmers themselves. The only people likely to benefit from the system which is again proposed by the Government are accountants.  Anything that adds to bureaucracy or administration is not to the benefit of production or higher output.</P>
    <P>There is another element which is serious also and it is this: when the general public see Governments or political parties responding too readily to any interest group they automatically get the impression, and rightly so, that there must be some considerable clout in that area.  It is advisable to change that system for a number of reasons.  First, there is the growing tension between urban and rural communities.  There is a strong suspicion, and not without some justification, that only the urban or the PAYE sector are paying any taxation. There are considerable grounds for furthering that belief by virtue of the recent changes in the taxation system and by virtue of the abolition of the farm tax. Within the farming community there is a dispute as to whether farm tax was a good thing.  The highly productive and efficient small farmers would have operated far better under the land system than under any other system.  That was agreed. However, it has now transpired that the PAYE sector has seen the removal of the taxation system which was opposed by another sector in the farming community and have seen a change in Government policy.  That is dangerous, it is divisive and it is destabilising at a time when this country can do without destabilisation. In future it would be well for Governments of any particular hue to remember that the community is made up of many sectors and one should not readily respond to one or the other without having regard to the overall impact.</P>
    <P>Another area which I should like to refer to briefly is the food sector in which I have a particular interest.  This is the first budget introduced by the present administration but I would hope that in <Col N="650" /> future financial proposals the Government would see fit to give the kind of recognition to the food industry that it deserves.  I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food has alluded to his own proposals to improve the production, labelling, grading and marketing of vegetables and meat to ensure that Irish products not only keep their record in quality in the foreign markets and on the shelves of supermarkets in other countries but also to improve and expand those markets and to encourage new consumers to take an interest.  One way to achieve that is simply by producing quality products.  If there is one thing this country is readily adaptable for it is the production of beef, dairy products and vegetables.  In those areas we have a natural advantage over all competitors both within Europe and outside and it is something on which we do not capitalise nearly enough.</P>
    <P>While I accept and welcome the indications from the new Minister of State as to his intentions regarding the food industry, we still have to hear details of his proposals and of his financial support for them.  I am aware that little has come of late by way of hard evidence to suggest that the food industry and the Department of Agriculture and Food will be run on a sound financial basis or that they will have any finance of their own on which they can rely to do what the Minister of State propose and hopes should be done. I support the suggestion and aspiration of the Minister and of Minister of State that the food industry be developed along the lines they have indicated.  It will be difficult to develop it to any great extent unless a separate budget is made available, separate entirely from the other workings of the Department and which would not only include the administrative problems that exist but should also be capable of funding the marketing, the supervision and the grant-aiding of projects in the food industry.  It is time to consider the possibility of taking all the grant aid and incentives for the food industry into a single department, since it happens to be the area where there is <Col N="651" /> likely to be greatest scope for advancement in the future.  By any standards the agricultural and food industry is crucial to our economy.  This sector alone employs over 40,000 people and generates a major share of the £2 billion annual agricultural export earnings.</P>
    <P>Recognising that and also the Minister of State's aspirations for the industry in the future, I can see no reason why a proper financial structure could not be set up to deal with the entire food industry. Applications for grant assistance, or research and development, or for product development, or whatever the case may be, which are at present being dealt with by the IDA, could now be dealt with by the food industry department and as a result there would be a faster response and a greater understanding of the problems, having regard to the special role the sector could play in follow-up and final marketing.  I mention that because presently there are considerable incentives available to any industrialist or any would-be food processer to get assistance from the Department through FEOGA and the IDA.  To my mind it would be far better if all these arrangements could be brought under one umbrella and that one department could single mindedly follow the problems and deal with the contingencies that arise in the food sector from production right through from preparation, packaging and processing to marketing.  In that way that department would be in a better position to concentrate on the issues and to identify problems as they arose.</P>
    <P>Incidentally I know some time ago that it appeared that the uptake of grant aid in the food processing sector was very poor.  That information came from the IDA itself.  I wonder why that is the case, because we need jobs, we need investment in the food processing sector and we certainly have in the country all the technical qualifications that are required. One must assume that there must be some other reason.  From the number of inquiries that I made it seems that many applicants for grant aid feel that the wave of bureaucracy and red tape they must <Col N="652" /> encounter in the course of their application is such as to dissuade them from proceeding at all.  If that is the case I suggest that there is a serious problem which needs to be dealt with urgently. At a time when the country needs jobs desperately we should look very seriously at the prospects of giving the power to a single department which should operate independently but in co-operation with other relevant departments.  It should have its own budget so that it can do its own research and follow up the inquiries that come to it.  It should also have ready access to all the marketing outlets and all the other data and information that might be necessary.  It could thus short-circuit some of the long drawn out investigations that have to take place under the existing system.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve what is possible in the food industry it is obvious that we must have a quality product that is produced under the best possible circumstances and conditions.  That is the greatest possible marketing boost we can have.  I think the recent disclosures on the television programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; regarding the meat industry were sufficiently serious to warrant an immediate investigation by the Ministers in question, and I mention the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment. They should investigate the slaughter of animals and the offering for sale of meat and the conditions under which that takes place.  Even the suggestion, as we saw on that particular television programme that something untoward might happen could do irreparable damage to the consumer industry within the country.  It could do irreparable damage outside the country also and for that reason I think a special effort should be made now to ensure that the usual inspections by the health board staff will be stepped up and no quarter whatever given to people who flout the regulations in the fashion suggested in that television programme.  If that were allowed to continue or were known to be happening within the country &mdash; I know it could not happen in relation to exports &mdash; it could do irreparable damage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> There are sufficient regulations in force, for example, the Public Health Act, and the Diseases of Animals Act which can be readily brought into force to ensure such occurrences do not happen.  It is essential that those regulations be rigorously enforced to ensure that a repetition is not possible.  Incidentally, I know that the Minister for Agriculture and Food proposes to make certain changes to ensure higher standards in those areas.  I think the quicker this can be done the better.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with some other points encompassed by this budget.  Listening to the Opposition last year one found that public enemy number one was unemployment, and taxation followed very closely behind that.  It is true that they were and are very serious problems and that has not changed.  Public enemy number one now seems to be interest rates.  Interest rates are high and have been unacceptably high for some time.  It is also true that interest rates dropped dramatically last year during a certain period; they dropped in previous years likewise and they will probably drop this year.  It is possible that the present administration wish to give the public the impression that the drop in interest rates, which is likely to come over the next number of weeks and months, is a result of specific action on the part of the Government.  It must be remembered that we had drops in interest rates before. The question to be answered is, what determines how long the interest rates remain down?  As we all know, there are factors other than those which can be controlled by the Government.  I hope the Government will not claim credit for a dramatic decrease in interest rates when, in fact, it will only be a repetition of what happened last year.  The question is whether interest rates can be kept down on an ongoing basis.  That is where the greatest benefit will be derived for the economy.  It will benefit investors, industrialists, agriculture, the PAYE sector and the entire economy.  Interest rates affect everybody.</P>
    <P>High levels of taxation have been mentioned frequently in debates in this <Col N="654" /> House, particularly the burden on the PAYE sector.  It is true that levels have been unacceptably high and remain so. One would have expected some kind of relief in the recent budget and I am sure the public were astounded when this was not the case.  The sting in the tail was that mortgage interest relief was reduced by 10 per cent, affecting in particular young families who have found it very difficult to make ends meet in recent years.  This was an amazing decision in view of the impression given previously by the Opposition. Few people can understand why the Government should have seen fit to increase taxation in that area.  The reduction in the mortgage interest allowance is simply an increase in taxation for people who are working and giving employment to the building industry and other sectors by taking out mortgages to build or buy their own houses.  One cannot understand why this was done.</P>
    <P>Some will attempt to justify this move by saying it was proposed by the Commission on Taxation.  This is true but many other proposals were also made by the Commission and I am sure it was not intended that these proposals should be implemented selectively.  Neither the Government nor the public can select the points they like and implement only those which are of immediate benefit to them. The Commission on Taxation have produced a number of very comprehensive reports which need to be considered seriously but instead the Government appear to have taken the first step towards removing mortgage interest relief.  I hope for an assurance from the Minister that there will not be a recurrence in future years.  This action on behalf of the Government bodes ill for the hard-working sector of society who are being very hard pressed by taxation and have to pay for virtually everything. When their allowances are being eroded in this fashion they may come to the conclusion that it is not worth working hard and taking out a mortgage and may become more disillusioned than they are already.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector may regard the withholding <Col N="655" /> tax as a genuine attempt to ensure that a certain level of taxation is taken from the private sector and the self-employed.  The reality is that in very many cases the people working in companies dealing with State agencies are themselves PAYE workers and may be under protective notice at present.  This proposal will mean that a certain amount of money will be borrowed from the firm for a period of time.  Many State agencies are not regarded as the fastest people to pay.  If this proposal is to be implemented as well as that unofficial policy of delaying payments, the repercussions could be far more serious than anyone has anticipated. In drawing up the Finance Bill the Minister should take account of the fact that State agencies are so slow to make payments.</P>
    <P>Anyone listening to debates in this House during the past year would have imagined that the incoming Government would immediately have abolished the DIRT tax.  When in Opposition they said it was a disincentive to investment, causing a further black hole, an exodus of funds and a deterrent to investors.  The impression was certainly created, not only in this House but at public meetings prior to the election, on posters and in the media generally that this problem would be tackled.  This was not to be the case.  The public, having elected a Government, have to accept that this issue, which appeared to be crucial some time ago, no longer has the same importance in the mind of the Government.  It is an amazing turnabout but no more so than many others.  We used to hear about selective tax cuts and reflationary measures which would ensure that the economy responded to the needs of industry. None of that has happened nor is it likely to happen.</P>
    <P>There was one sector which confidently expected a considerable improvement in their circumstances.  We have heard that Fianna Fáil were the backbone of the construction industry.  When the election was mooted it was expected that a change of Government would be of tremendous <Col N="656" /> benefit to the construction industry.  It was readily admitted by the industry that times were tough and it must have been greatly disappointed by the new Government's decisions.  The system of grants which had been put in place by the previous administration was abolished at the stroke of a pen.</P>
    <P>At least 1,600 people who applied between 24 March and 31 March when the announcement of the abolition of the home improvements grant, the builder's grant and the house surrender grants was made, faced the proposal of refusal of their applications.  It was further proposed to refuse the applications of those who applied for home improvement grants where no inspection had been carried out.  It was the most peculiar way to reward the building industry by a political party who repeatedly over the course of years stated publicly and privately, within this House and without it, that the building industry was a major one and that it needed an input of funds.  In fact, it was proposed to inject £200 million into the industry in order to do the job that allegedly was not being done by the previous administration.  However, the peculiar thing the Government did then was to reduce the amount of funding that was already there to the extent that at least the 1,000 plus people I have mentioned will be disappointed by virtue of the refusal of their grant applications.  Also people who had previously applied for grant assistance where valid applications were made are going to be refused.</P>
    <P>Again I appeal, as I did the other day at Question Time, to the relevant Minister to consider the legal position of those cases.  If a scheme is in operation and within the period of the operation of that scheme &mdash; and until a public announcement is made to the contrary &mdash; a person makes an application which is valid at the time of the making of the application, and particularly if the application is acknowledged, that implies a certain contract on the part of both parties. It is up to the applicant to fulfil his or her part of the contract afterwards because he or she cannot do that until afterwards.  On the compliance by the <Col N="657" /> applicant with regulations the second part of the contract comes into play whereby the agency making the scheme available &mdash; in this case the Government &mdash; must be prepared to accept responsibility for the application.  I accept fully the Government's right at any time to announce the termination of any scheme on a particular day, but the right to make that termination retrospective is dangerous and very difficult to unravel should it be challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>Those grants I have mentioned, namely, the home improvements grant, the house surrender grant and the builder's grant payable on completion of a house are virtually equally involved.  The Minister should reconsider his decision to see whether it will be possible to meet the applications that were valid and acknowledged by his Department prior to the announcement.  That would involve an extension of the closing date from 27 March to 31 March which would ensure that all those people who had made their plans, who probably had financial facilities made available to them and who had themselves contracted with builders in order to carry out the work, would not be disappointed and would be able to have the work concerned carried out.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I am not so sure about the cities, but in rural Ireland there is a great need still for the continuation of the home improvements grant scheme. A great number of houses in the country are tenanted by elderly people, or people on social welfare or low fixed income, who are not in a position to carry out house improvements of the type required without the grant assistance we are talking about.  Many houses still have no basic sanitary facilities or even the basic comforts of draught-proofing or dry-lining or that kind of thing which is now essential in very old houses.  Therefore, perhaps the Minister will reconsider that scheme and so restore some of the confidence the previous administration had generated carefully in the construction industry and the past four years, which confidence has now unfortunately been dashed.</P>
    <P>Another area deserving mention is <Col N="658" /> local authority financing which again is very much an issue at present.  Unfortunately, many people were given the impression that the party now in Government would abolish local charges at the stroke of a pen and provide an alternative system which would not militate against the ordinary householder or taxpayer. Amazingly, nothing like that has happened. We are still in the same situation. We still have to find finance for local government and we still do not have it and no other means has been found.  All we are getting at present is vague references to the fact that perhaps a review of local authority financing will be undertaken and that it is up to each local authority to consider whether they require to introduce local service charges or whatever. That is rather at variance with what was said by that party when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I wonder &mdash; I do not wonder any longer, I know &mdash; why the public become disillusioned with politics and politicians. It is because politicians say one thing and do another and, unfortunately we have only too many examples of that.  This is one of them.  Finance is difficult to come by in the local authorities.  I know that full well as a member of a local authority, and I know full well how difficult selling a means of financing local authority to the public is, but if a political party decide on a line of action at one time and then decide for reasons of expediency to change their minds, that can only be extremely damaging from the point of view of confidence by the public in administrations.  Unfortunately that confidence must have been shaken again and again by the Budget Statement we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily.  I would like to hope that in this House at least a change will have taken place.  In the past four years when we were on that side of the House on many occasions I saw opposition purely and simply for the sake of opposition and of political expediency.  This country does not need that at present and the further we can get away from it the better.  Now that the positions are reversed we hope <Col N="659" /> on this side of the House to be able to produce and provide a constructive Opposition, constructive in what we have to say to the Government, and to the public as well, which is important.  I hope we will be able to provide an Opposition which will not unnecessarily hype up the expectations of the public by one means or another, by suggesting to them that we have various means of doing things other than the Government of the day have that would be less punitive or less of a burden.  The bottom line must be that all politicians tell the public exactly what can be done and how much it will cost.  That honesty has been sadly lacking in the past number of years.  I hope we on this side of the House can do our bit to change that.  We have already shown that we will.  I would be very worried if I thought that people were being asked to make sacrifices so that the Government could make savings over a short period in order to boost the economy coming up to a general election.  I would be worried if all the hardship and the sacrifices were piled up in such a way as to keep a nest-egg warm for the Government party so that they can come before the public with this nest-egg clutched in their hot little hands and expect the people to forget their hardships, thus giving the Government an electoral boost.  I hope that will not happen.</P>
    <P>There have been many suggestions over the past number of years about the failure of the political parties and the system and there have been many criticisms of politics, politicians and the institutions of the State.  Many commentators have suggested that the country is in a bad state and that there is no hope either for the country now or in the future.  I do not accept that.  It has also been suggested that the cause of our problems was the pursuit of Civil War politics.  I reject that too.  Our problems do not result from Civil War politics but from the pursuit of crazy economic policies and attempts by political parties to pander to the needs of powerful groups.  I am no supporter of Civil War politics but when those politics were in vogue the people pursuing them <Col N="660" /> would not have dreamt of becoming involved in the crazy economic theories which have proved so costly to this country. The politicians of 30 and 40 years ago would not have allowed themselves to be pushed into the economic corners that Governments and politicians have been pushed into over the past number of years.  The commentators and the punters will criticise politicians and political parties for allowing this situation to develop yet the same people make these demands repeatedly.  Having made demands many times in such a way that it was virtually impossible for institutions or Governments to withstand them, it is not reasonable to criticise those who accede to the demands.  They say in the US that Reaganomics are the order of the day. Crazyomics have been the order of the day in this country for the past 15 years or so.</P>
    <P>If one salutary lesson can be learned it is simply that the Government of the day or even the Opposition parties of the day should recognise by now the dangers and the pitfalls of responding too readily to sectoral interest groups at any time, regardless of how strongly they make their case.  There are many valid cases being made but our problems have largely arisen from a too ready response by political parties or by the Government. If a new attitude is adopted by political parties and if they have the courage to face up to their real responsibilities and do what is right, a lot of the problems we are facing now and will face for many years to come will become less of a burden because at least we will not be storing them up for the future.  I hope that political parties who before elections proclaim there is a better way which is obvious to them before elections, will find the better way on election to office and will have a better way of showing us that than I have seen yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the very encouraging remarks of Deputy Durkan in calling on all of us to take a very responsible attitude to the development of the nation.  Indeed, this budget is designed to stop the rot in <Col N="661" /> our public finances, to reduce the national debt, to restore confidence in investment, to reduce the high interest rates and to tackle the massive unemployment with which the country is faced at present.  The difficult measures we have taken to contain public expenditure were essential in the national interest, in the interests of the people, of those at work who are over-burdened with taxation, of those who seek employment and a rightful place in the community and of those dependent on social welfare, the widows, old age pensioners, the handicapped and others.  Unless we took the measures contained in the budget the future security and welfare of those groups would be seriously at risk.  Nevertheless, we were able to protect the position of those dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Having done this, having secured our financial and economic base, we are now committed to the task of immediate and urgent development along the lines set out in our Programme for National Recovery.  We published some of those measures on Sunday last.  We will now be pressing on urgently to take further action in other areas of potential development. I assure the Deputy that we will make every effort to restore pride and confidence and a sense of achievement to the nation.  I call on all Members to recognise the need for national recovery and to support the effort of the Government which are directed towards this end. In the interests of our people we have an obligation to put the nation first.  Already there are signs of new hope and confidence. We learned from financial circles that money is flowing into the country. We know that the position in relation to interest rates has improved.  The key, one month inter-bank rate has fallen by approximately three percentage points from its March peak.  The bulk of this fall has taken place since the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise Deputy Durkan and others in the House of an observation of a porter working in a highrise building in Dublin city which he brought to my attention recently.  When I asked him how he judged economic development particularly in the Dublin area he replied: &ldquo;I <Col N="662" /> watch out for the cranes; there are only four of them there now.&rdquo;  He said he would be watching to see how many more would be there within a short time.  He is right because he will see development.  If one watches the skyline over Dublin one will see cranes because there will be development taking place there.  That is the commitment of this Government. That man, in his simple direct way, pointed to a key indicator not confused with changing interest rates or other factors.</P>
    <P>This budget constitutes the first step in the Government's programme of national recovery.  I believe there is now a general realisation of the very difficult situation the country faces and a general acceptance of the need for effective policies and firm leadership to turn this difficult situation around.  That is what the budget is all about.  We have charted a course for the future and, having done so, we have taken the management decisions necessary to ensure that the course we have charted is followed.  In the programme we put before the people during the election campaign we set out very clear proposals for national recovery.</P>
    <P>I must say to Deputy Durkan that we said approximately 90 per cent of the measures proposed by the previous Government would have to be implemented.  I am very clear on that and was very conscious of the fact at that time.  What we have done in this budget is to soften some of the worst effects of some of those harsh measures and their impact on ordinary people, particularly those who are dependent on social welfare. What we have done in this budget is to accept the mandate, or indeed the challenge, given us by the people by putting our programme into effect.  In the short three week period available to us to form a budget, this basically meant considering the options which were available in the light of the previous Government's proposals and the need to put the economy on a firmer footing.  Even more important, we had to ensure that, in adopting measures necessary to get the public finance into better shape, the <Col N="663" /> weaker sectors of the community were protected.  This we have done.</P>
    <P>We have to accept the need to contain the overall level of public expenditure. There is nothing ideological about this. The measures which have been taken were taken because the country and the economy require them.  Like any household we can in the long term spend only to the limit of what we can afford.  Where there has been overspending we had to take corrective action to stop the rot and restore confidence.  The level of expenditure we can afford depends on the performance of the economy.  Clearly our present levels of expenditure and debt are not affordable and corrective action has had to be taken.  A few figures illustrate this point.</P>
    <P>Total current Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP has risen from less than 30 per cent in the early seventies to over 41 per cent in 1980 and to nearly 50 per cent in 1986.  This resulted in an increase in the current budget deficit from less than 1 per cent of GNP in 1970 to 8.5 per cent in 1986. The decisive action taken in the budget will reduce this budget deficit to an estimated 6.9 per cent of GNP this year.</P>
    <P>If we want to understand the underlying strength of this budget and its impact on our financial position, we need only look at the difference between last year's outturn of 8.5 per cent, the target set out in this budget of 6.9 per cent and that of the previous Government of 7.5 per cent.  Therefore, we have set a target for ourselves which will ensure that our financial position is stable and that our economy is one in which investors can be confident.  Even a small drift away from the 6.9 per cent would still leave us well below the target set by the previous Government.  That is a measure of just how seriously we saw the need to tackle our finances at this time.</P>
    <P>Such action was necessary so as to ensure the firm base which is a prerequisite for national recovery.  As the Taoiseach said last weekend, future budgets will continue to impose the discipline needed in the public finances.  The <Col N="664" /> Exchequer borrowing requirement must be reduced.  It is estimated that, on foot of the measures taken the Exchequer borrowing requirement, as a percentage of GNP, will be reduced from 13 per cent in 1986 to 10.7 per cent this year.  Some may argue that this is a tough target but what is the alternative for this economy whose national debt now stands at £25 billion and costs the State nearly £2 billion annually to service?  There is none.</P>
    <P>The budget has given a new sense of direction to the economy.  It was the first step in harnessing our resources more effectively and efficiently.  No longer can we adopt an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to public expenditure programmes, for example, by funding areas every year only on the basis that the programme is there.  We must ask, on an ongoing basis, whether individual programmes in their present form are appropriate any longer.  We must look hard at their objectives and see if these are being met.  Where they are not, we must be prepared to take corrective action.  Given the scarcity of resources, we have a responsibility to ensure that programmes are properly targeted. The current economic climate dictates that it is now more than ever important that we recognise the need for good housekeeping, effectively by the control of public expenditure.  The corollary to this that the Government will be in a better position, especially in the long term, to meet the real emerging needs of the people.</P>
    <P>Of course the budget is about much more than controlling the growth of public expenditure.  The Government's strategy is also directed at achieving growth in the economy.  This two-pronged approach is the essential difference between this budget and what went before.  The fiscal measures taken in the budget to bring Exchequer spending under control are inter-linked with development measures which will lead to faster economic growth.  There are already very definite positive signs in the economy.  Exchequer borrowing is being reduced, capital is flowing back into the economy &mdash; which is a sign of increasing confidence &mdash; inflation has slowed to <Col N="665" /> around 3 per cent and interest rates are coming down.  The fall in interest rates would not have been secured without the restoration of confidence in the economy. If the present trend continues there will be scope for further falls in interest rates leading to further enchanced prospects for investment and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>There is now a general awareness of what needs to be done in the interests of the country and a positive attitude towards constructive action.  In this regard the Report of the National Economic and Social Council entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo;, in my view is a watershed.  The fact that the council, which is representative of the main interest groups in society including the trade unions, employers and the farmers, could reach unanimous agreement on a set of wide-ranging proposals in the areas of macro-economic policy, tax reform, development policies and social policy is a most important development. The Government have accepted the principles adopted by the NESC as the basis for a medium-term programme for the next three to five years.  We are, therefore, in the situation of having a consensus among these different interests.  This means that we are already a long way towards achieving solutions. It is not a consensus of the sort I referred to earlier but a real national consensus among groups with widely differing aspirations and objectives on the measures which are required to be taken in order to put this country back on the road to recovery.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, growth potential areas.  One of the essential elements of the Government's strategy is our development programme. Our objective is to secure greater employment through determined programmes of development in sectors of potential growth.  These sectors have been identified as manufacturing industry &mdash; with special emphasis on science and technology-based industries, international services including financial services, agriculture <Col N="666" /> and the food industry, horticulture, forestry, marine products and marine services, tourism and mining.  Development opportunities and investment packages in these sectors are being vigorously pursued. Although we can not throw money at investors we can provide incentives, effective management support and a climate of action and confidence.</P>
    <P>There is considerable potential for growth in the area of science and technology. Higher priority for this area will have beneficial spin-offs for industry in the creation of a better capacity to adapt to change and will, in itself, create new sources of wealth and jobs and lay the foundation for a more developed high technology economy.</P>
    <P>In the area of trade there is a need to recreate a climate that strongly encourages enterprise, with special emphasis on developing small businesses and on self-employment. Key elements here include the extension of IDA efforts to include indigenous manufacturing industry, the development of export services, export trading houses, the reduction of export costs and the fostering of group marketing schemes.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope for development in horticulture.  This is a largely untapped area and one where better organization and cohesiveness among growers and others involved in the industry would yield significant results.  The immediate setting up of An Bord Glas and the appointment of a chief executive indicate the sense of urgency with which the Government are tackling this area.  The early provision of competitively priced natural gas will give a major boost to this sector.</P>
    <P>Food and forestry are two additional sectors with expansion potential.  Forestry has long been a neglected resource and it offers immediate prospects for increased employment as well as considerable scope for import substitution. This country has the potential to be self-sufficient in timber, to develop valuable export markets and to create a range of timber related industries which will generate employment.</P>
    <P>We have centred all functions relating <Col N="667" /> to the potential of the sea in the new Department of the Marine.  We are unusual in that as an island people we have never exploited our marine resources to the full.  Clearly, we can no longer afford to neglect them.  There is considerable scope in the areas of sea fish farming and mariculture industries.  The overall objective is to exploit the potential of our marine resources to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of the biggest sources of employment in the country.  It is a key industry in the utilisation of native raw materials and a major earner of foreign exchange.  Bord Fáilte estimate that tourism generated in the developed world will grow by between 7 per cent and 8 per cent in real terms by the end of the century. We have the ability to achieve even higher growth by a programme of cheaper access fares to offset our geographical location, by aggressive marketing and by ensuring that the standards of tourist facilities and services are of the highest quality.  There are quite a number of positive developmental areas that we can engage in without delay.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare expenditure I would now like to turn to my own area of responsibility and to outline how the measures taken in that area link in with the Government's overall strategy.  The first thing that strikes one in talking about social welfare is the enormous amount of resources which are involved.  Gross social welfare expenditure amounted to almost £2.5 billion last year, of which the Exchequer contribution was over £1.5 billion.  Over £400 million of this was in respect of the Exchequer's contribution to the social insurance fund.  There has been an enormous growth in the number of social welfare beneficiaries and in expenditures.  Gross social welfare expenditure has increased from around 7 per cent of GNP in 1970 to over 15 per cent in 1986.  The Exchequer expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of Government current expenditure has increased from less than 15 per cent in 1970 to over 19 per cent in 1986.  Thus <Col N="668" /> an increasing amount of our resources is going to finance social welfare.</P>
    <P>Over one-third of the population are social welfare beneficiaries, which indicates a high dependence on State funded services.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing proportion of resources being allocated to finance the social security system, the question of what we can or more appropriately what we cannot afford has to be addressed. The financial stability of social security schemes has been under pressure in many countries from two sides: 1. the increase in expenditure arising as a result of persistent high levels of unemployment and changing demographic structures; and, 2. the flow of income revenue has been slowing down due primarily to the decrease in the number of persons at work.</P>
    <P>Ireland is no exception to these trends and when one takes account also of the particular economic difficulties which this country faces it is obvious that social welfare as well as other areas of public expenditure must come under closer scrutiny to see whether there is scope for redirecting expenditure.  The previous Government proposed to restrict certain social welfare schemes and the savings arising from these proposed restrictions were embodied in their budget figures.  Having examined their proposals we could not accept a number of them, in particular the proposal to reduce from 15 months to 12 months the duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit and the proposal to increase the waiting days for disability benefit from three to six.  We accepted the reduction in pay-related benefit to 12 per cent and also, but only in a modified form, proposals for more restrictive contribution conditions for certain social insurance benefits.  Some restrictions had to be made but in making them the Government have been very careful to protect those who are in greatest need.</P>
    <P>In the present financial situation the scope for increases in expenditure is very limited.  In this context the major provision made in the budget, namely, the 3 per cent cost of living increase in all weekly rates of payments from mid-July, <Col N="669" /> is a major achievement.  It meant that an additional £19 million had to be found over and above what had been provided for by the previous Government for an increase from November as they had proposed. I fully accept that a 3 per cent increase is a modest one in terms of the actual amounts of cash increases which are involved.  The increases must be seen, however, in the context of the economic problems facing the Government and what the country could afford at this time.  The total cost of the 3 per cent increase is £30 million.  The cost of advancing it to July is £19 million.  Most objective commentators would agree that to get the increase in July is far better for widows, pensioners and other beneficiaries than to have to wait until November.</P>
    <P>The increase we have provided will at least maintain the real level of payments of over 700,000 social welfare recipients and are in line with the expected rate of inflation over the year ahead.  This increase also maintains the significant rise in the real level of social welfare payments that have been achieved over the past decade or so.  Over this period there has been a real increase of over 44 per cent in payments to the long term unemployed. Other long term payments have increased by over 50 per cent and short term payments by about 34 per cent.  Our objective is to at least maintain social welfare benefits in real terms and we have previously demonstrated our commitment in this regard.  I might say it was the increases given by previous Fianna Fáil administrations which contributed most significantly to the general level of real increase which has been achieved over the past decade.</P>
    <P>In regard to family income supplement, in view of the limited scope at present for additional social welfare expenditure there is a particular onus on us to ensure that whatever additional resources become available are used in the most effective way possible and directed to those recipients with the greatest needs.  In this regard I was particularly happy that it was possible to introduce significant improvements in the <Col N="670" /> family income supplement scheme.  This scheme was intended to benefit people in low-paid employment and to reduce the disincentive arising from the fact that people in low-paid employment could in certain circumstances be financially worse off than people on unemployment benefit.  The scheme is specifically designed to help families of workers who are only marginally better off in employment. The scheme, however, has never had the impact which was originally intended and the number of people benefiting from it has been far lower than the original estimates.</P>
    <P>People often talk about the group who are just above the lowest paid, workers with families.  Here is a measure which is designed specifically to help this group in society, but very few Deputies are prepared to say that this is a good measure, that they are very glad to see it and that they will tell their constitutents about it.  I would advise Deputies to look carefully at this measure because the rates have been significantly improved.  This can be of considerable value to those people who are so often mentioned in this House, people who are not on unemployment benefit people who are working but who are on low incomes and find it hard financially to manage with three, four or five children.  This measure has been considerably improved in the budget with their interest in mind.</P>
    <P>In our Programme for National Recovery we stated that we would review the workings of this scheme, and while the measures provided in the budget may help to broaden the scope of the scheme I will also be examining the scheme in an overall context to see how it can be directed more effectively to those for whom it was intended.  I will be looking in particular at the other potential gains and losses involved where people take up low-paid employment because it is only by looking at all of the elements involved, including the tax element and the question of access to other services, that it will be possible to identify how best we can help people in this situation.</P>
    <P>In all of this a primary consideration must be the need to direct our efforts <Col N="671" /> towards increasing employment and creating the environment in which this can be achieved.  I would now like to refer to an item in the budget which is in my own area of responsibility, namely the Jobsearch programme.</P>
    <P>A great deal of interest has already been expressed in the programme and as the Minister with direct responsibility for its implementation I welcome this.  I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the programme is intended to be a measure of very positive assistance for the long-term unemployed. It is the first time that the various State agencies involved, namely the Department of Social Welfare, the National Manpower Service and AnCO, have come together in this way in order to co-ordinate their service in the interests of those who need them most.  These agencies have responded in a very enthusiastic manner to the Government's initiative and are taking the necessary measures to bring the programme fully into operation without delay.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt about the need for us to use our resources in support of the Jobsearch programme.  Long-term unemployment is the greatest social problem facing this country and we will not be complacent about it.  Studies are showing that long-term unemployment is not just a problem in terms of the waste of human resources which it involves; it is also a major contributory factor to bad health, violence, family breakdown and so on.  The loss of morale and self-esteem which long-term unemployment brings with it means that those involved are by that very fact in a much worse position when it comes to seeking work or putting themselves forward for job or training opportunities.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Jobsearch programme is to improve the prospects of the long-term unemployed by giving them direct help either in securing a job or a place on one of the employment or training programmes.  The whole process is designed to be of maximum assistance to unemployed people and I am happy that <Col N="672" /> the scheme is being generally accepted on that basis.</P>
    <P>By the end of December next 150,000 of those on the live register, especially those who are unemployed for quite some time, will have been interviewed.  This is a very big undertaking.  This process has already begun and the letter which is being sent to each individual clearly sets out the purpose of the programme and what it is designed to achieve.  At the interview with the National Manpower Service officer each person will be helped to assess his or her strengths and discuss the options which are available.  They will be given priority at that stage for any jobs that are available.  Those who do not get jobs at that stage will be considered for a priority placement on a Manpower programme such as the social employment scheme, the enterprise allowance scheme or an appropriate AnCO training course. Forty thousand places on these programmes have been specially set aside for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Those who have not got a job and are not referred to a manpower programme will then be considered for a place on the Jobsearch course itself.  This course involves a four-week programme of career advice, backed up by training in interview skills and assistance in self-presentation. The course will also include a detailed and professional assessment of aptitude.  Course participants will be given free access to newspapers, telephones, typing, travel allowance and postage to assist them in seeking employment. The whole Jobsearch exercise will be conducted in an atmosphere which is helpful to the participants.  A total of 12,000 places are being made available on Jobsearch courses.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this programme is designed to assist unemployed people and that those critics who see the scheme as a method of &ldquo;getting at&rdquo; unemployed people in some way or other are mistaken in their view.  Some people who are called for interview or subsequently for a course may not turn up for it.  Where this happens their social welfare entitlement will be reviewed as is the normal practice and indeed as is <Col N="673" /> required under the law.  Such persons will, of course, have the normal right of appeal.  I want to emphasise again that the thrust of the scheme is to be of help to the unemployed and the programme must be seen as part of the Government's overall strategy of improving the supports for the long-term unemployed who are genuinely seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Another major provision which was included in the budget was the extension of the treatment benefit scheme to the dependent spouses of insured workers. This is something which I myself raised a number of years ago and I am very glad to have been able to bring the proposal to fruition.  The proposal was among those included in the budget of the previous Government and I welcome their support on its introduction.  I have no doubts about the merits of the proposal and about its importance in terms of providing a much needed benefit particularly to women in the home.  Where family incomes are limited and there are many competing demands on resources, it is often the case that important areas such as dental treatment which can involve considerable cost are neglected.  The fact that treatment can in future, in the case of dependent spouses of insured workers, be provided under the social insurance treatment benefit scheme will mark a major advance for the families of insured workers.  My Department are making the necessary arrangements for bringing this measure into operation in October next as provided in the budget.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by the Irish Dental Association about the extension of the scheme.  I will be meeting the association on Monday next to discuss the implementation of the new arrangements and to explore the implications for their members.  I understand the possible fears of some dentists in the face of the transfer of private patients into the social insurance system.  However, there is very wide support in the Oireachtas and in the community generally for this measure and there have been consistent demands for it from various groups, particularly those representing women who are working in the home.  I am confident that the <Col N="674" /> extension will come into operation in harmoney with the dentists and opticians and their associations.</P>
    <P>Taken together the measures for social welfare included in the budget represent a major achievement in the context of the difficult situation facing the Government. There are a number of other major developments in the social welfare area which I intend to bring to fruition in the coming year and I would like to take the opportunity of referring briefly to some of them at this point.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday I had the pleasure of launching the first report of the National Pensions Board on the regulation of occupational pensions schemes.  The publication of this report represents a very important step in the development of pensions policy in this country.  The board under their Chairman, Mr. Brian McCracken, SC, did a very thorough and professional job in producing this report. The report looks at the whole area of the pensions provided by occupational pension schemes, i.e., schemes outside the social insurance system, and makes recommendations in the areas of transferability of pensions entitlements where people change jobs, financial security of pensions schemes, disclosure of information to scheme members and the overall supervision of monitoring of pension schemes.  The board were widely representative of those involved in the occupational pensions field and the fact that the board were able to reach agreement on such a wide range of issues is of major importance and should mean that the proposals in the report will command a wide level of general acceptance.</P>
    <P>I am now undertaking a process of consultation with interested parties with a view to bringing forward definitive proposals as soon as possible.  I do not anticipate that the consultation process will be difficult or protracted and I envisage having a package of proposals arising from the report available by the autumn.</P>
    <P>The area of transferability of pension rights is one in which I am particularly interested and proposals in this area are specifically included in the Fianna Fáil programme.  That programme also <Col N="675" /> includes a commitment to regulate the operation of occupational pension schemes and I will be pressing ahead as quickly as possible with giving effect to these commitments.</P>
    <P>Apart from the specific issues raised in the report, we must also look at the whole area of pension provision to see where we can make progress towards better pension provision for all and a greater streamlining of the system.  The role of occupational pension schemes in this regard will be very important.  According to a recent national survey, some 520,000 people or 61 per cent of employees are covered by these schemes and, apart from the importance of these schemes as schemes of income maintenance, they also represent an important element of personal saving and investment.  To ensure that these schemes provide adequate and secure protection for those covered, their operation needs to be regulated.</P>
    <P>We must also, however, look at the longer term role of these schemes in the context of a national pension scheme, including, for example, how the benefits of such schemes might be extended to a greater number of people.  The National Pensions Board have now gone on to examine the whole question of a national pension scheme, including the role of occupational pension schemes and I look forward to receiving their proposals in this area in due course.</P>
    <P>Another area in which I hope to make progress quickly is in the reform of the Social Welfare appeals system in line with the commitment given in the Fianna Fáil programme.  It is necessary at this stage to address the problem of perception which exists in relation to the present system and to make more explicit the independence of the system.  The Commission on Social Welfare referred to this perception problem and recommended that, to get over this problem, the appeals office should be set up as a separate executive office of the Department.  I am broadly in agreement with the commission's approach in this area and I am <Col N="676" /> having detailed proposals prepared at present.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to ensure that the appeals system is simplified as far as possible for people who want to avail of it.  It is essential that claimants have available to them as much assistance and information as possible both in regard to the appeals system itself and how it works and also in regard to their own particular claim and the basis for the decisions made in their case.  Only in this way can we ensure that the administration of the system is made more fair and more efficient.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps in the administration of the social welfare system generally that the best prospects exist for making significant progress in the short and medium term.  We emphasised in our programme the need for a better managed and more humane social welfare system and, indeed, the Commission on Social Welfare made a number of important proposals for improving the delivery of the services.  I am satisfied that there is considerable scope for reform in the administration and delivery of social welfare services that will not have significant cost implications but will be of considerable benefit to those who avail of the Department's services.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which bureaucratic barriers can be broken down and the delivery of the service simplified and expedited is the means test.  As Deputies will be aware, my Department operate a range of means tested income maintenance schemes &mdash; 12 in all &mdash; where the means test is carried out by social welfare officers.  In addition, the health boards operate a further three schemes where the means test is carried out by community welfare officers.  What is required is that any duplication of effort in carrying out these means tests is eliminated and that they are integrated in such a way so as to directly benefit the social welfare client.  My Department will be reviewing the area of means tests with those objectives in mind.</P>
    <P>In the context of improving the delivery of services, I am considering the <Col N="677" /> development of the &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; concept for social welfare services.  Let me explain what I mean by &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo;. I am proposing that all the social welfare needs of clients can be met from one centre based in the locality &mdash; the social services resource centre.  In addition to the normal employment exchange services, clients would have access to current information on social welfare claims, general information on the full range of schemes and services provided by the Department, on the spot assessments for qualification certificates, which is means testing, in order to qualify for unemployment assistance as well as current information on job opportunities, placements and courses which are available through the National Manpower Service. All of these should be possible with modernisation and computerisation in different areas.  They should be brought together to facilitate the persons seeking advice, information and support from the social services sector.</P>
    <P>The personnel involved include the employment exchange manager who is responsible for making payments, the social welfare officer who investigates means, the community welfare officer who decides on entitlements to supplementary welfare allowance, and the placement officer who advises on jobs, placements and courses.  The various personnel would operate as a co-ordinated team with the objective of meeting the needs of the client as quickly as possible within the one location.  This approach to the delivery of services is consistent with the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare which came out strongly in favour of a comprehensive local service being available to social welfare clients.  We should think in terms of the needs of the clients and of bringing the services to him or her instead of requiring people to attend different offices seeking information on services.</P>
    <P>A limited &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; arrangement is already in operation in my Department in three locations and is very successful.  Based on this experience I am most anxious to extend the concept to other offices around the country where <Col N="678" /> this is feasible and as accommodation and computer facilities become available.  A number of offices are under consideration at the moment and I will be making an announcement in this regard in due course.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in particular to which I want to refer.  This is the question which I raised in my speech to the House on the Social Welfare Bill and which has evoked a considerable amount of comment subsequently, namely, what can be done about deserting husbands who do not meet their obligations to support their families.  The statements I made in this regard have also been misrepresented by some people who saw it as a campaign to harass deserted wives. This is totally incorrect.  The fact is that the NESC recommended that the State should have power to award deserted wife's benefit and itself pursue outstanding maintenance claims on the husband. The Commission on Social Welfare endorsed this.</P>
    <P>The decision is that I have directed my Department to examine ways of pursuing deserting husbands with a view to requiring those who can to make a contribution to the taxpayers' cost in maintaining their wives and children.  At present in order to become entitled to deserted wife's benefit or allowance the wife must have shown that she has made reasonable efforts to try to locate her husband and to prevail on him to contribute to her support.  Once this can be shown then my Department make the appropriate payment to the deserted wife.</P>
    <P>However, the requirement under the Act that once the deserted wife's benefit or allowance is put into payment the wife must continue to make efforts to seek maintenance is much more difficult for the wife to satisfy.  This requirement can cause considerable difficulties for the wife who already has enough problems in trying to rear a family without the support of her husband.  It can also result in compelling wives to make contact with their husbands at a stage where they may feel that their own and their children's interests would be best served by their <Col N="679" /> not having to enter into new and possibly acrimonious exchanges with them.</P>
    <P>These difficulties result in husbands who are in a position to contribute to the maintenance of their wives being allowed to escape their obligations and the taxpayer has to meet them instead to the tune of £41 million in 1987.  In my view it is now time that the State took on the task of pursuing these husbands.  This could involve my Department applying to become a joint applicant with the maintainance creditor, i.e. the wife, and subsequently pursuing, through the courts, if necessary, maintenance payments from the husband which are outstanding. The State's role in this regard, of course, would be provided for in such a way that it would not in any way impinge on the rights which the wife would have to pursue her husband for maintenance.  Changes in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 and in the Social Welfare Acts would be required to give the State this power.  Detailed consideration will also have to be given to what the most cost effective procedures would be for enforcing the rights the State would be given, for example, through the attachment of earnings.  Discussions will now take place between my officials and officials from the Department of Justice with a view to bringing forward proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like the Deputies to be clear on what is the intention.  It is intended that once the matter of the deserted wife's benefit and allowance has been settled it will be allowed to rest.  The present legislation puts an obligation on the wife to pursue the husband further and on the Department of Social Welfare to pursue her to pursue the husband further subsequently.  Nowadays the Department of Social Welfare do not do that but if you get down to the strict interpretation of the legislation you will find there is an obligation on the Department to do so.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing is that once a person has gone through the process and the deserted wife's benefit or allowance <Col N="680" /> has been granted, particularly in cases where the husband is financially well off, the State will pursue such husbands to recoup from them some of the funds for the taxpayer.  That proposal is consistent with the proposals outlined in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and in the report of the NESC.</P>

      <P>Principally, it is wives who are deserted but that is a question which would have to be considered in the same context.  These are some of the major issues which I will be addressing in the months ahead.  I have had not the time to go into the many other issues and Deputies may ask why I do not speak about other issues which are important. I will on other occasions speak about the many other issues which are important in my Department.  Here we are speaking specifically about the budget and its impact and effect, about the position of the Department of Social Welfare in relation to the budget and the position of the beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are only some of the major issues which I will be addressing in the months ahead.  The measures provided in the budget indicate the Government's commitment to protecting the position of social welfare recipients and directing resources to those in greatest need.  These same principles will guide the future development of the social welfare services. Some might ask why I, as Minister for Social Welfare, should say so much about development and the need for development.  One reason is I carry collective responsibility in the Cabinet and <Col N="681" /> the second reason is that that development is particularly important to the Department of Social Welfare as it is from those developments we will see the opportunities for creating jobs which we want to see particularly for the long-term unemployed.  It is from the efforts which are included in the budget that we hope to see the developments which will make it possible to achieve more of the things which we seek in the Department of Social Welfare.  A great deal can be done in the present circumstances at little cost and in many cases at no cost.  I will tackle these problems and questions as urgently as I can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister for Social Welfare state he believes the budget has been successful.  I intend to show that the budget has been a failure.  I have no doubt the reason why he is of one mind and I am of the other is because our expectations from a budget are different and to a large extent our goals are different and the method and way in which we would wish to reach our goals are also different.  The Minister clearly puts all of his faith in private enterprise creating a buoyant and prosperous economy and thereby providing, he hopes, job opportunities, not jobs but job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued many times in this House that reliance on private enterprise has failed in the past and continues to fail today.  We have seen over generations since this State gained its independence the reliance on private enterprise, both at the beginning of the life of this State in terms of free trade and subsequently, under Fianna Fáil behind high restrictive tariff barriers.  Irish capital by and large has failed to provide for the development of this economy.  The fact that one million Irish-born people are living in Britain is adequate proof, if proof were needed, that private enterprise has failed in this State.  The fact that we are again exporting tens of thousands of young people to England and the United States is proof that private enterprise continues to fail. Despite all of the pious hopes and aspirations of various Ministers for this budget <Col N="682" /> and not just the Minister who has just spoken, I have no doubt that unfortunately I will be proved correct yet again that private enterprise will fail and will continue to fail.</P>
    <P>The policies of this and previous Governments have quite literally been to throw money at private enterprise in the hope that they will create jobs.  One thousand million pounds was given by way of subsidies and grants of one kind and another to private enterprise in the past year, yet our unemployment figure is above 250,000.  That is the official figure and it does not take into account the tens of thousands who have gone to London and Boston.  Recently I spoke to an Irish-American whose parents were Irish who was visiting Ireland for the first time in his life.  He told me that in Boston where he lives there are 50,000 illegal young Irish people.  For anybody to say that private enterprise has a good record or that we can expect, on the basis of the track record, that they will change that situation can be described as nothing but a pious hope.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil budget has the support of both the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats.  Those parties have been taking up various postures in relation to one aspect or another but, by and large, they support the direction in which the budget is going.  We have achieved, in effect, a new national coalition, a coalition urged on us for many years by the Confederation of Irish Industry and by various journalists of one kind or other, both economic journalists and editors of various newspapers who have a specific interest, presumably, in this kind of approach to the economy.</P>
    <P>The budget specifically has failed to tackle tax reform.  It has failed miserably to tackle realistically the creation of jobs &mdash; real, sustainable, productive jobs.  It has effectively also failed to move society in any way closer to what one party in this House, the Fine Gael party, have sought &mdash; a just society.  It certainly has no intention to, nor could it conceivably move society towards a socialist society, the kind of society to which I would aspire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> Let me give an example of the kind of injustice under which PAYE taxpayers suffer at present.  In 1981 the PAYE sector paid 87.7 per cent of the Government's income from income tax.  In 1986 this percentage had increased to 90.3 per cent.  Over the same period the number of PAYE taxpayers fell by 8 per cent, so we have an increasing proportion carried by the PAYE sector which itself fell by 8 per cent.  In 1981 employers and the self-employed paid 11.2 per cent of Government income from income tax.  In 1986 this percentage had fallen to 8.2 per cent and over the same period the number in this category fell by only 1.4 per cent, as against a fall of 8 per cent in the PAYE sector.  Effectively, the PAYE sector suffered a reduction of 8 per cent in numbers and were charged an increase of 2.6 per cent in their total income tax bill.</P>
    <P>The employers and self-employed suffered a reduction of 1.4 per cent in numbers, but their total income tax bill was reduced by 3 per cent.  It is important to note that in terms of the numbers, employers, self-employed and farmers amount to almost one-third of the number of employees.  The actual numbers in 1985 were: PAYE taxpayers, 816,900 paying 90.3 per cent of the total income tax; employers, self-employed and farmers, 288,300 paying 9.7 per cent of total income tax.  Those figures give some idea of the scale of injustice suffered by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The news this morning brings it home even further when we hear that apparently, although it has not been confirmed so far as I know, a circular has been issued by the Revenue Commissioners to tax inspectors that VAT arrears are not to be pursued if they are more than three years old.  This is at a time when the health services, education services and the poor of our society are being attacked left, right and centre under the terms of the current budget.  It is interesting also to get a picture of what we are talking about when we are talking about unpaid taxes.  In May 1985 the figures of unpaid tax given by the Comptroller and Auditor General were as follows: self-employed, <Col N="684" /> £201 million; employees' PAYE and PRSI &mdash; that is deductions made by employers but not returned to the State &mdash; £104 million; health and youth employment levies deducted by employers and not paid, £17 million; corporation tax, £207 million; taxes on capital not paid, £25.9 million; VAT, which is already collected from the consumer by various enterprises around the State and not repaid, £149 million; other taxes of a variety of natures, £3.5 million, totalling £707 million.</P>
    <P>That is not a figure taken out of the blue sky.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the person who, with his staff, is responsible for keeping the accounts of the State in order says the £707 million due and payable by a variety of employers and so forth has not been paid.  When you consider the extent to which we are attacking our health and education services and those who are in need, it is nothing but a disgrace that in this budget the Government propose to set up a task force of 25 specialists to bring in £10 million of that £707 million.  How many years do we think it will take to collect that total amount at a rate of £10 million a year?  It will take 70 years to collect it, that is, assuming that all taxes falling due over that 70 years are also collected, because clearly the way things are going and from the way in which this Government intend to tackle the economy, that figure will increase rather than decrease.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that while the Government in this budget set up a task force for 25 specialists to tackle unpaid taxes, there has been a reduction of 850 in the number of revenue staff in the past five years.  This is a reduction of 11 per cent, at a time when tax avoidance and evasion are growing, as it the black economy. It is hypocritical, simply a nod in the direction of the PAYE worker who is carrying the bulk of the weight and is now clearly being asked to carry the bulk of the cost of the economic crisis which various Governments have presided over in recent years.</P>
    <P>The budget failed to address itself to the question of job creation.  The Jobsearch programme has been introduced <Col N="685" /> with great flurry with a proposal to interview 150,000 long term unemployed people.  Do the Government honestly expect us to believe that is a realistic approach to unemployment at a time when the unemployment figures are climbing and when tens of thousands of people are emigrating?  Do they believe that by interviewing 150,000 people of the 250,000 on the live register this will in some way create productive jobs, give the economy a boost and will in some way improve the morale of those who have been unemployed for up to ten years?  It is an insult to attempt to put that idea across as in some way tackling the job crisis in the State.  It is an insult to the tens of thousands of people who have been thrown on to the dole queue over the last number of years.  It is an insult to the young people who are coming out of schools who have nothing facing them only the boat to London or who have to sneak off to Boston, New York or wherever they can hope to hide and who are exploited in poorly paid jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>There are already very definite positive signs in the economy &mdash; Exchequer borrowing is being reduced,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>we know that.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;capital is flowing back into the economy, which is a sign of increasing confidence, inflation has slowed to around 3 per cent,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I thought the Coalition Government had been claiming an inflation rate of 3 per cent last year but perhaps it depends on who is doing the figures.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and interest rates are coming down.  The fall in interest rates would not have been secured without the restoration of confidence in the economy. If the present trend continues there will be scope for further falls in interest rates leading to further enhanced prospects for investment and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated how I differ fundamentally with the Government in <Col N="686" /> relation to how they see the economy developing, in what direction it should develop and whom they should depend on to develop it.</P>
    <P>The idea that falling interest rates is going to create jobs is one of the fallacies which has been promoted for a number of years by a variety of interests.  The Confederation of Irish Industry have been quite vocal in promoting this idea. The Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael Party have been promoting this idea for some time.  It was only during the last general election that I heard Fianna Fáil specifically promoting the idea.  They seem to think that interest rates are the be all and end all of our economic problems and that if we get interest rates down jobs will flow.  Interest rates must be got down and they say the way to do this is to cut public spending.  We now know what cutting public spending means.  It is what The Workers' Party have been saying for some time &mdash; an attack on essential social services.  Public spending must be got down at all costs even if it means dismantling health services, social services and our schools irrespective of the effects these cuts will have on the poorest and weakest sections of our society.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to show that reducing interest rates alone will lead to more jobs.  I refer the House to a booklet on a study of the economic situation published in 1985 by socialist economists and entitled <i>Jobs &amp; Borrowing &mdash; Where the Right is Wrong,</i> although clearly it will not have the same view of how things should be done as would people on the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat benches.  This booklet examines the actual situation that existed. Under the heading &ldquo;Private Investment Discouraged?&rdquo; they state:</P>
    <P>Public borrowing at home is said to push up interest rates and make borrowing by private industry prohibitively expensive and this leads to job losses.</P>
    <P>After bank interest rates rose in late 1984, this argument received much public attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> The Confederation of Irish Industry blamed &ldquo;excessive government spending&rdquo; for rising interest rates.  &ldquo;The only real solution is to cut government spending.  Failure to do this will squeeze out of the credit market the productive base of the economy which provides real sustainable jobs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation in the booklet from the <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 December 1984. The booklet goes on to say:</P>
    <P>However, it is by no means clear that the rise in interest rates at that time was caused solely or even primarily by government borrowing at home.</P>
    <P>Peter Bacon, formerly with the National Planning Board, analysing the rise in interest rates in <i>Business &amp; Finance</i> magazine (13/12/84) concluded: &ldquo;it is difficult to sustain the view that interest rates are rising simply because the public sector is crowding our private sector expenditure by the manner of its borrowing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>More important than government borrowing at home was a drop in the country's foreign reserves (or holdings of foreign currencies).  According to Bacon, the reserves had fallen partly because the government was borrowing less abroad, and partly because there had been a sharp drop in flows of private capital from overseas into Irish banks.  The private capital had been attracted elsewhere because of rises in US and UK interest rates earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>In explaining the fall in external reserves, Bacon could have added another factor &mdash; repatriation of profits by multinational companies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The December 1984 jump in interest rates provoked an immediate outcry over government borrowing because at that time Irish rates appeared to be going against the international trend, since US and UK rates were falling. However, Bacon's analysis shows that the interplay of international money markets is more complex than that, and it is important to look to international developments to explain <Col N="688" /> movements in Irish interest rates.  The Central Bank always does so.  In its November 1984 commentary, the Central Bank noted &ldquo;the increase and subsequent decline in domestic (money) market rates during the summer months was probably attributable, in the main, to external developments&rdquo;. The Central Bank also noted that the rise in real interest rates in Japan, West Germany and the UK &ldquo;appears to be higher than would be expected on domestic grounds alone.  It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that part of the reason for the real interest increase in these countries is the influence of the prevailing high rates in the US.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, if nothing else, is a counter argument to the idea that interest rates can be influenced to any significant degree by what the Government have done in the budget.  It is an argument for not putting our faith in cutting back on public spending simply to reduce our borrowing from the domestic market thereby hoping that interest rates will fall and that, as a result, our well meaning altruistic private capitalists will invest their money in job creation ventures in Ireland.  There is no evidence to show that any part of that equation is correct.</P>
    <P>Let us take the experience of the past ten years.  If you take the three month inter bank rate as the gauge for interest rates the rate in 1979 was 18.5 per cent when unemployment was below 100,000.  In 1980 the rate went down to 13.56 per cent but unemployment went over 100,000. The interest rate in 1981 was 18.75 per cent but unemployment climbed to more than 140,000.  Interest rates in 1982 dropped to 12.5 per cent but unemployment continued to march towards 200,000. Interest rates generally remained at about 10 per cent until the end of last year but this did nothing to halt the increase in unemployment which continued to zoom towards more than 250,000.  The notion that the fall in interest rates is going to create some kind of boom in job creation is utter nonsense.  There is no evidence <Col N="689" /> for it on the basis of what has occurred during the past ten years.  There is no reason for believing it will happen on the basis of our experience with Irish capital in the past 60 years.  I should like to quote again from the booklet, &ldquo;Jobs &amp; Borrowings&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The government's demand for money to fund borrowing certainly does put some upward pressure on interest rates but it is by no means the only reason why Irish interest rates are high.  And even if interest rates were lower, there is no evidence to suggest that this would lead to an upsurge in investment in the productive base of the economy or the provision of real sustainable jobs.  It should be added that the government subsidises lending by banks to industry through tax-avoidance lending, so that industry actually borrows at a lower rate than it appears.</P>
    <P>That means at a rate lower than the rate declared by the banks.  Not only is the nonsense pursued that interest rates will create some huge development in job creation but the Government, strangely enough, have attacked one of their more strident supporters, the building industry, in this budget.  Perhaps it is a demonstration of Fianna Fáil's confidence that Fine Gael and the PDs will support them in the budget that they felt able to do that.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a building worker in the country but who up to now believed that Fianna Fáil were good for the building industry that whenever Fianna Fáil were in power the building industry took off.  That was never the case and that myth can no longer be peddled by Fianna Fáil.  They have abolished, by and large, the house improvement grants and have slashed the capital available for the building of local authority houses.  There are 26,000 people on local authority housing lists.  There are all kinds of developments required in our cities, not only in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, who are all crying out for development.  The previous Government established a commission to improve the image of Dublin city centre. I argued strongly against that commission <Col N="690" /> on the basis that Dublin Corporation, if given the powers and money the commission were being given, could do the job, at least as well if not better, given their experience and the staff they employed.  This Government did not abolish the commission, they simply took the money from them.  If they have any respect for Dublin city or any regard to the fact that it will commemorate its millennium next year, the money and the powers which were made available to the commission should be given to Dublin Corporation to ensure that next year we will have a city of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil fought the last election on the slogan that there is a better way. That implied criticism of the Coalition Government and it also implied that things would be better for everyone if Fianna Fáil got into power.  There were posters everywhere saying that health cuts hit the old and the sick, that the only growth we have had in the past four years is a growth in the dole queues and all sorts of similar slogans which simply stated the facts.  They indicated nothing about what Fianna Fáil would do about the atrocious record of the Coalition Government. Neither did they specify who would benefit from the better way that Fianna Fail were telling us about.  The general message was that everybody would benefit from the better way but the budget sorted out that foolish notion fairly quickly. Fianna Fáil certainly make for a quicker way of grinding the working class into the ground and of ensuring that those who are better off get away scot free, are left untouched.</P>
    <P>The right wing ideologues are delighted with the budget.  It has created the national consensus or, as I call it, the national coalition, they have been looking for for many years.  The Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael Party are still sitting on the Opposition benches but we have seen them often enough trooping into the &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; lobby with Fianna Fáil during the past few months to know what exactly is going on, that we have a national coalition in everything but name and that when important <Col N="691" /> decisions are made they will troop in and make sure that Fianna Fáil remain in power.  It has been interesting to watch Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats trying desperately to find some points of disagreement with Fianna Fáil on the budget.  Their only complaint mainly has been that Fianna Fáil have stolen too many of their clothes.  Meanwhile the working class are learning a very harsh lesson in political cynicism.  They must feel that the election was a sham because having decisively rejected the Fine Gael budget, or draft budget as they now call it, they find that not only is that being implemented but that it is being implemented in a much more harsh way by Fianna Fáil who conned them into believing they were offering a better way.</P>
    <P>Who exactly has benefited from the Fianna Fáil's better way of impoverishing the working class and of leaving the wealthy to their own devices?  Farmers, for instance, were asked to pay a derisory £9 million in land tax and they will not be bothered with that little bill anymore. The large property owners and speculators still will not be asked for any significant contribution to the State's finances.  The tax evaders still will not be chased seriously for the sum of over £7 million that they owe.  The super-rich still will not be asked to pay wealth or capital taxes and will continue to pay the same rate of income tax as the average industrial worker &mdash; with of course the added advantage that they can pay their accountants to doctor the books, so that even then they pay little or nothing.  Companies which earn profits still will pay only a fraction of all income tax paid within the State.</P>
    <P>Who has lost out?  People who become sick or unemployed have lost out.  They will get lower benefit payments and they will have to wait longer to get them. People who need outpatient services or hospitalisation will have to pay £10 per visit and £10 per day respectively, and many will be forced to join the VHI to cover these costs.  PAYE workers will pay more income tax, an extra £300 million this year, because of the failure to <Col N="692" /> increase the tax bands.  They will pay extra PRSI and health contributions and the new health charges and the new VHI contributions.  People dependent on social welfare will get a miserable 3 per cent increase in July, which will not match the increase in inflation and will certainly do nothing to improve their living standards.  We have no pleasure in saying that we were right to predict that Fianna Fáil would do exactly the same, but worse than the Coalition have done. It will continue to get worse until such time as the working class of this country decide to build and support a party which is an alternative to the right wing politics being pursued by the three major parties in this House.</P>
    <P>We are utterly opposed to the national coalition which exists in this House now and which seeks to make ordinary working class people worse off, and makes them pay for a crisis they did not create. It was not the working class people of this country who borrowed £25 billion, or who made all sorts of rash promises in 1973, 1977, 1981, 1982 or 1986.  We are specifically opposed to the new hospital charges, which effectively mark the end of any move towards a free health service. In fact it moves closer to the privatisation of medicine in Ireland.  The effects of the new charges will force thousands of workers into the VHI and will pave the way for new and higher health charges.  It is a move away from the provision of our health services on a tax-based method to an insured-based method.  It will harden the creation of two levels of health care in our society: a private health care service which will be first class for those who can afford to pay for it, and a continuing deterioration in public health services for those who cannot afford to pay for the Blackrock Clinic.  Also we are strongly critical of the failure of this Government to improve the real living standards of people on the lowest grades of social welfare.  The Commission on Social Welfare showed that in 1985 terms a person needed between £50 and £60 per week for the basic necessities of life in Ireland; in today's terms that would be between £54 <Col N="693" /> and £65.  By July 1987 a person on long term urban unemployment or assistance benefit will receive £37.80 per week.  That is about 60 per cent of what the Commission on Social Welfare believed was adequate to survive and have not a luxurious life by any means, but simply the basic necessities of life.  There has been no increase in child benefit.  The Commission on Social Welfare pointed out that there was an urgent need to improve the level of child support</P>
    <P>I have dealt already with the whole question of the nonsense of Jobsearch, and interviewing 150,000 unemployed people to try to create the notion that the Government are doing something about joblessness.  The Minister for Social Welfare seemed quite annoyed that anybody should suggest that the Jobsearch idea was anything other than a method to help the unemployed.  As far as I am concerned it is a scheme to try to reduce the live register, by disallowing persons who do not turn up for interviews or who for whatever reason are unable to participate in the training schemes which the Government say they will provide.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the family income supplement and he was critical of some Deputies in this House &mdash; he was not specific as to who &mdash; did not promote the family income supplement scheme among their own constituents.  Since the introduction of the family income supplement scheme I have urged this Government and the previous Government to use the tax offices to distribute forms to those who need them for the family income supplement.  It is fairly obvious to me at any rate, and it must be obvious to the Minister, that the tax office has a record of everybody who is working within the tax net.  People who are on low income come within a certain category in the tax office and if they are below a certain level of income they do not pay tax.  I am told the income tax office is computerised and I cannot see the problem in issuing forms for the family income supplement to those men and women in the tax net who are assessed for PAYE and whose income would qualify them for the family income supplement.  The <Col N="694" /> Minister in the previous administration gave undertakings that he would examine this problem.  I would ask the current Minister for Social Welfare to look again at this problem.  The expected take-up of this scheme was fairly large.  If I can recall correctly the figure provided for the first year was something in excess of £20 million; I am not sure of the exact figures but the actual take-up was a very small fraction of this.  Clearly the Department of Social Welfare believe there are tens of thousands of people who come within the terms of the family income supplement scheme.  Obviously they are not getting it either because they do not know about it or the amount of money they would get is too small to bother with.  But at least they should have the opportunity to apply for it.  In my view the simplest way that can be done is for the Revenue Commissioners to issue family income supplement forms when they are issuing tax-free allowance certificates.  It should be a fairly simple procedure to pinpoint those who will get a tax-free allowance certificate which shows nil tax due or a tax-free allowance which is such that they will not be liable for tax.  Obviously these people would come within the family income supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this budget has been a failure for me but obviously it has been a success for the Government and also for the Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael parties.  It has been a success for them because the line, the attitude and the ideology that they have been promoting for the last four or five years has become the dominant ideology, that our State services, the public sector and the State companies should be run down; that the State must no longer take responsibility, in so far as they can avoid it, for the least well off in our society; and that the State has no responsibility or no direct responsibility for job creation. To my mind that is a recipe for disaster in this society.  I have no doubt that the national coalition parties who are now co-operating so effectively with each other will experience the anger of the working class in the next general election.</P>
    <Col N="695" />
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make my first speech in this House in support of the recent budget. When the Minister for Finance introduced this budget to the House, he was but firing the opening shot in the difficult battle yet to be fought in order to get this country back on its feet economically.  It must not and cannot be a series of internal skirmishes where sectional interests selfishly seek to subjugate the national aim and frustrate the national will.  It must not be a war of words or a flexing of political muscle in this House.  It has to be a coherent national effort where the slogan &ldquo;Ni neart go chur le chéile&rdquo; binds us all in resolute opposition to every economic force and every economic factor on the national or international front that militates against the economic progress we all so ardently desire and so desperately need.</P>
      <P>There are countless examples in history where seemingly insurmountable odds have been overcome by resolute and singleminded national striving.  This budget has been generally acknowledged as a tough budget and only those who blindly pursue political opportunism have questioned its correctness as a series of measures to pull this country out of the mire of international indebtedness, literally by the seat of its economic breeches.</P>
      <P>There is no victory without sacrifice. There is no sacrifice without pain.  But victory is sweet and the fruits of victory are worth all the striving and all the effort.  Ultimately if we follow this path of restraint rather than the highway of self-centred greed, we shall see the dole queues diminish, the tax burden dissipate, the emigrant ship go into dry dock and the grip of foreign financiers loosen perceptibly to the national and personal advantage of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get on the right road to national prosperity we must not spurn wealth creation nor allow our drive forward to be trammeled by ideological shibboleths. We must create wealth through a greater emphasis on value-added manufacturers, internationally traded financial and other <Col N="696" /> services and the exploitation of indigenous advantages such as are expounded in Fianna Fáil policy and given form, shape and purpose in the package of major development projects announced by the Government this very week.</P>
    <P>As a representative of Dublin North, I welcome the announcement of the extension of the national grid through Dublin north county to Dundalk.  Public representatives in Dublin North have for many years been anxious that the horticultural belt should have the chance to use well priced natural gas.  Many farmers in the north county have converted from oil to solid fuel and I hope the Government will provide some sort of package to enable these farmers to make the best use of this important national asset.</P>
    <P>Job creation and wealth creation are the Siamese twins of a sound national economy.  They are the essential tasks and essence of the private sector.  They cannot exist in a vacuum.  However, they must be backed by the brave and decisive policies of the Government whose special role, indeed central role, is to create the climate of confidence and stability in which the seeds of enterprise grow and flourish.  This is the way to raise living standards and improve the lot of every individual, every citizen old and young, every family rural or urban.</P>
    <P>As a basis we must accept and believe that the budget recognises that the priorities for the Government are to reduce borrowing, reduce the public debt and reduce the burden of public service expenditure.  Without success in these areas the Government will have but a limited capacity to support and assist the productive sectors of the economy or to reduce the burden of taxation.  These productive sectors are the wealth producers and therefore the key element &mdash; indeed the sole element &mdash; in getting this country moving again, in increasing employment and providing the basis for improved living standards.</P>
    <P>During the Taoiseach's speech he asked Deputies like myself to express our views on possible areas of job creation and the development of the economy.  I would like to draw the attention of the <Col N="697" /> House to areas which have considerable potential for economic expansion and job creation.  They are tourism, community enterprise and fishing, but not necessarily in that order as different areas are more conducive to one than the other and we must get the whole country moving.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is a major industry in every respect.  It is, in effect, an export industry attracting additional money into the country.  In size of earnings the tourism industry is equal to the dairying industry.  It is an important job creator, having 40,000 employed.  The benefits of tourism do not end here but percolate throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>The concept of a tourist as a person who comes to us merely to gaze, a transplanted spectator from another land who wishes to feast his or her eyes on our ledendary greenness, is outmoded, outdated and a commercial heresy.  Such a concept is blind to the potential of tourism and so limited that it truncates the opportunity value of the tourist trade.  A tourist is a spectator and also a special, indeed a unique, consumer.</P>
    <P>We must provide attractive opportunities to our tourists to spend their money on services that give full satisfaction, maximum enjoyment and the incentive to return.  We must encourage the purchase of quality Irish goods, both wearables and souvenir durables.  A country which has such gems in its national collection as the Tara Brooch, the Derrynaflan chalice and other priceless treasures made by Irish craftsmen using ancient technology, must surely in the closing years of the 20th century be capable of providing souvenirs of such irrestistible crafted quality that the demand for them would create jobs of high quality in abundance.  Yes, let us see the consumer potential in the tourist trade and exploit it through the full value of quality products, avoiding the shoddy vampirism of the quick buck.</P>
    <P>The industry has a small import content. It is a very substantial user of home-produced items such as farm products, craft goods, food and drink.  If the tourism trade grows, it stimulates and helps other important sectors.  In particular it <Col N="698" /> provides outlets for self-employed craft workers, which is something we should encourage and build on.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem facing the expansion of the tourism industry is seasonality. In many parts of Ireland, particularly rural areas, this will remain a fact of life, but it does not mean that tourism jobs in these areas could not be successfully combined to the benefit of both agriculture and the craft industry.  On the other hand, in population centres the seasonality aspect must be tackled through the provision of wet weather facilities and special interest facilities.  In this regard I welcome the measures in the budget to extend the business expansion scheme to the tourist industry.  This scheme is ideally suited to tourism which requires and has now been provided with a more attractive basis for investment than it has previously enjoyed.  It is my hope that the Minister will allow this concession to be applied as freely and widely as possible, so as to reflect the needs of the industry and to encourage a substantial inflow of investment which is needed.  If loopholes develop they can be closed off.</P>
    <P>Another important and welcome aspect of the budget is that it provides a better climate for tourism and helps our competitive position by holding VAT and tax levels and by keeping inflation low.  I hope these measures will be an additional spur to the marketing efforts of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>It seems hardly necessary for me to reiterate that money is tight and will continue to be very tight and in that regard it is essential that the very best use is made of existing funds and resources.  I point out to the Minister for Finance that very substantial resources with considerable tourism potential are in the hands of Departments of State and local authorities.  These include forests, the canal system, historic buildings and monuments and many others.  Most of these facilities are operated at present at almost a total drain on the public purse. The Minister might look at these resources and let it be known that they should be examined for commercial development potential.  Many of these <Col N="699" /> areas could be opened up to commercial development in partnership with the private sector by way of joint venture or licence arrangement.</P>
    <P>The OPW, who are within the Minister's Department, are investing heavily in centres such as Glendalough and Glenveagh. These centres are admirable, but an innovative commercial approach is now necessary so that centres like these can include restaurants, craft shops and other commercial facilities which will both cut the cost of the operation to the State and provide opportunities for the private sector to create jobs and increase earnings.  Where this is not done then, as in Glendalough, illegal trading by unregistered and casual dealers takes place on an extensive basis to the detriment of the project and the State.  Only minor policy and management changes would be necessary to open up what I believe is an area of substantial opportunity. On a recent visit to Glendalough I saw up to 20 of these illegal traders. With some small investment in the area itself, with space being provided and so forth, the State could benefit and the area could be enhanced.  It is not in keeping with areas like Glendalough or other such projects to have the entrances to the castles and so on taken up by illegal traders, and that happens throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to see local authorities, as in England, take a wider view of their development role.  A very limited amount has been done in too few instances by too few authorities.  I would like to mention a couple of authorities who have made plans.  In Kilkenny a plan was set out three or four years ago to upgrade the city of Kilkenny and win the tidy towns competition.  With the help of the private sector and the local authority this plan was put together and Kilkenny won the tidy towns competition two years ago. The value to that city of the winning of that competition is recognised to be £1 million in the first year after winning it. Because of the enlightened approach taken by the Kilkenny authority anyone who visits that city can see, for instance, <Col N="700" /> the upgrading of the shop fronts there.  I hope some similar project will arise for Dublin city centre.</P>
    <P>I commend Dublin County Council for what they have done in the past couple of years in the purchase and development of estate properties.  I have in mind my town of Malahide and the castle there. The purchase of the area of ground and the castle has meant that up to 34 people are working there and 80,000 people visited the castle last year.  In the recent past the council bought Newbridge House in Donabate.  Having given a licence to the Dublin Eastern Regional and Tourism Organisations to run both these houses, they set up the criteria for Newbridge to be as successful as Malahide in attracting visitors.  I have no doubt that the knock-on effect Malahide Castle has for Malahide will be repeated for the Donabate-Portrane area of north county Dublin by Newbridge House.  I look forward to being involved in helping the council to develop these projects even more.  I see an opportunity for all the commercial owners in Malahide from hotels to shops to capitalise on the fact that last year 60,000 to 70,000 foreign visitors came to Malahide Castle.  By their action the council have preserved and made available tourist amenities of incomparable quality right on the nation's doorstep.  This is an example of how existing resources may be harnessed in the interests of native and tourists alike.</P>
    <P>New resources must also be created in appropriate circumstances.  Local authorities can play a decisive role for example in Dublin city.  The local authority might provide a suitable serviced site for hotel development that would attract overseas and local investment.  I am aware that the site was selected but I suggest that the selection hardly shows an understanding of what a new, modern hotel requires in order to have a better than even chance of commercial success. By contrast, in Birmingham a local authority site has attracted three applicants and a modern hotel is now to be built. That will create 350 new jobs with the spin-off effects for local suppliers and <Col N="701" /> shops and, more important, the new hotel will make a major contribution to the urban renewal of the city.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the fact that our Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, suggested recently that the Custom House Docks side would be ideal for the possibility of hotel development. As a northsider, I think it will have a tremendous effect on the city of Dublin. I encourage that and I hope it will be part of his plan.</P>
    <P>There are many areas open to local authorities for exploiting opportunities in conjunction with and in support of the tourist industry, an industry which can work for us in many ways.  European countries believe that tourism will provide up to 10 per cent of new job targets in the years ahead.  Even industrial economies like Britain have now recognised and are exploiting tourism as both a job and revenue creator.  Our targets for jobs from this sector should be no less ambitious.</P>
    <P>I have a few headings here of other areas which I believe with the right direction can lead to the right type of development for our country and a real chance of job creation.  The application of the Jobsearch scheme and the social employment scheme to tourism should be encouraged.  The rationalisation of marketing by semi-State bodies such as Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, inland transport and SFADCo, particularly in the USA, should be aspired to and the companies I have named should be brought together in some way.  The Government will have a major report on this in about the next month.</P>
    <P>I see a real opportunity for us to develop our ideas for the countryside in the agri-tourist area.  We should maximise our efforts in the EC to encourage the EC to come up with positive schemes to assist argiculture, to develop tourism enterprises and to lessen dependence on milk production which is adding to our food surplus problems.  I would like to see development of agri-based self-catering accommodation by encouraging the renovation of abandoned cottages for the accommodation of visitors.  I say this in <Col N="702" /> the knowledge that in France the idea of using old farmyards and old stables has been maximised.  These have been renovated for self-catering holidays with great success.  I know of a Welsh project which is so successful that the people behind it are now in Ireland looking for land with half a dozen to ten cottages together at the foot of a mountain in the wilds of the west where the idea of rough shooting could be supported as a tourist attraction. There is a great opportunity for us to maximise our efforts in the EC to bring about some of these developments that I have mentioned.  I hope the Minister will look at the suggestions I have made.  Certain benefits will flow from his budget proposals and further benefits can be obtained from policy and management changes along the lines I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I will now move on to the fishing industry which is one of our great unexploited resources.  As an island nation surrounded by productive and clean oceans, particularly on our west coast, we have unrivalled opportunities not only for sea fishing but for fish farming and for the production of shellfish for the lucrative European market.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has been performing well in recent times.  There has been an improvement in the repayments on loan accounts to BIM and there is a renewed interest in the building of new vessels.  The decrease in oil prices and the hardening of fish prices has contributed to this.  All of this has contributed to confidence.  Exports are now worth over £100 million a year and the home market has shown a 16 per cent rise between 1982 and 1985.  Irish fish are sold now in about 30 countries worldwide.</P>
    <P>In future strategy, the life line for development is more fish.  This strategy must be followed within the confines of the Common Fisheries Policy.  There is need for research to negotiate for higher quotas because of the developmental status of the Irish fishing industry.  There is need for research to improve TACs. The exploratory fishing programme operated by BIM has shown great results and this should be supported.  Fisheries must develop non-quota species such as <Col N="703" /> scad, horse mackerel and indeed many other fish.  There has to be more fish west of Ireland than we know about.  Exploratory fishing is the answer.  Because we are not taking up all available quotas, it will be very difficult for our Minister to make any progress in seeking extra quotas. There is an absolute need for us to take up all available quotas.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we get the maximum amount of money from Brussels to achieve these aims.  In regulation 4028/86, which is the structures document, there is a total of IR£649 million available over the next five years for all member states.  Ireland has done well in the past from EC schemes.  It must continue to do so in the future.  Ireland can benefit further to construct fishing vessels and to modify existing vessels.  It can also benefit from exploratory fishing and marketing especially.  There is money also available from Brussels to engage in scientific research.  Competition between member states for this money will be very keen.  Therefore, it is imperative for the Minister to ensure that the required state funds are made available to benefit fully from EC programmes.  For example, under the new regulation for every £1 million spent by us to build or modify a vessel £3.5 million can be claimed from Brussels.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that already our Minister, Deputy Daly, and our Minister of State, Deputy Pat Gallagher, have been to Brussels and have secured the promise that the EC Commissioner for Fisheries will come to Ireland in the next week or two.  I hope that when the Commissioner has an opportunity to assess our potential in the fishing industry, he will help to make our Minister's job easier, when we go back looking for support for our development programmes. There are many unexploited fish species off the west coast of Ireland.  Also there are huge quantities of fish being taken by other member states and indeed by third countries.  We must get our fair share of this and we must have the boats to do so.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a lot of talk about the marketing of fish.  As a member <Col N="704" /> of a family involved in the fishing industry for four generations, I have a knowledge of this area.  I served on BIM for a number of years.  I suggest that the selling of fish is a specialist area.  There is a problem in the fishing industry in relation to selling the product so that it arrives in the best condition possible.  I hope the Ministers will take note of those points when they finally make up their minds as to the role of BIM in the marketing of fish.</P>
    <P>When I was on the board of BIM a couple of schemes were initiated which have been a great success.  The board opened a new market for mackerel in Egypt and it worked very well.  Embassy and the board co-operated very closely in gaining a substantial contract which was very beneficial to Irish exporters at a time when other markets were very difficult.  Indeed, the Minister will recall that he led the delegation on its first visit, with officials of BIM.</P>
    <P>There should be incentives available for fish producers who wish to go to Europe or elsewhere to sell our produce. Another idea that should be pursued is that of having a permanent food hall in our country.  I know that up to £0.5 million is spent by the agencies in setting up our stalls in London and the USA in various food fairs.  A food producing country such as ours should give serious thought to having a permanent food hall in Ireland where people could show off their wares to the buyers of the world.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that fishermen in Skerries fishing port who during my time on the board of BIM, like those in many other ports, were going through a very difficult time in relation to repayments on boat loans due to very bad oil prices and fish prices, are now up to date in their repayments and they stand out as a beacon at the moment in relation to the repayment of loans.  The catch there is receiving its fair price now and I hope that will continue for many years.</P>
    <P>In relation to the notion of community enterprise, there is no difference in intent between the Industrial Development Authority and the Youth Employment Agency when they speak about job creation. However, it must be said that the <Col N="705" /> emphasis in funding by the State would tend to favour companies from overseas. This is of itself important and necessary. It does, however, impart a certain exclusiveness to external investment and we must ensure that this philosophy does not detract from or minimise in any way the necessity to foster, encourage and financially support on at least equal terms the development of enterprise, rooted in native talent either in the technological or business domain.</P>
    <P>I am a strong adherent of the view that such talent abounds in our land.  Irish nationals do very well when they go abroad.  Is this because other countries have better support structures and an attitudinal climate to enterprise which we somehow lack?  This must be at least part of the answer and, I would contend, a significant part.  The way out of this bind is through community endeavour.</P>
    <P>Enterprise units should be responsive to the industrial and commercial climate of the new age.  They should be forward looking, forward planning, forward thinking and to the greatest possible degree they should be research-oriented. The popular concept of technology is usually centred on the wonders of now but the experts tell us that the frontiers of science and technology are advancing rapidly at an alarming rate.  We are told that they will advance by a factor of 100 within the next five years.  Such developments are self-accelerating and looking beyond five years we can only guess what will be the achievements and effects of technology.</P>
    <P>Information systems, medical science, transport, manufacturing technology are all set to leap forward.  We do not want to be left at the starting gate as our competitors crash through the finishing tape. Enterprise and education for enterprise are absolutely essential and side-by-side we must enhance our marketing capacity. It is an exciting prospect but if we only get excited while others get involved we will be doomed to international dependency.</P>
    <P>There are, or course, some useful financial supports in place.  Their effectiveness is lessened by virtue of the need <Col N="706" /> which community groups have to spend a high proportion of support on infrastructural provision.  A major item is the provision of workshop space.  Of necessity a major portion of community funding must go to the provision of work space where Irish entrepreneurial skill and enterprise may evolve from the seed of an idea to the prototype stage and, finally, to the consumer market.  Community enterprise groups in the EC, particularly in Italy and Spain, have created large numbers of businesses with a high productivity record.  But it must be remembered that the route to job creation is very cost-effective.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the community enterprise concept is new and remains on the fringe of job creation.  One of its inherent problems is the relatively high capital cost of providing workshop space for the incubation of business ideas.  There are at present approximately 300 such community groups in Ireland, with between 70 and 80 sited in the city of Dublin.  It is estimated that by the year 1990 there will be 500 groups working within the community at large.  Some of the present schemes are excellent.  I have had five years experience with the Malahide youth training and employment group. We are in communication with many other such groups throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the acquisition of a high street property is essential to the success of such groups and, even if a community raises say, £30,000 to £50,000, there remains a sizeable balance to be met.  On many of our trips abroad it was said that the idea of a factory sited in a green field did not add up to a general perception of a communioty enterprise. Therefore, most such groups are endeavouring to find some building within the town commercial centre where they can develop their ideas.  Some modest transference of suitable agency funds would be sufficient to provide that additional impetus for the development of community enterprise, particularly in areas of high and low technology in the communications and engineering areas, bringing it nearer the core of job creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I might propose that a State agency funding loan over a period of say, ten years with a low rate of interest be made available to building or renting work space.  Alternatively, I would suggest a grant of £5,000 per 1,000 square footage up to a maximum of, say, 5,000 square feet to be made available.  In both cases a State agency could take up a share in the property, if purchased, or in its rights, if leased.  Such a proposal would relieve communities of the burden of paying for work space, in turn releasing all community funds for the development of community projects to take place within a particular workshop.  It is my belief that this could be a key element in converting community enterprise from a fringe, space-filling exercise to a genuine creative force which, in its future development, could become a central and cost-effective factor in the creation of indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>Throughout the constitutency of Dublin North there are towns stretching from Skerries to Rush, Portmarnock, Malahide where communities have been working for the past two to three years collecting moneys but who invariably discover that the purchase of a suitable property would cost between £150,000 and £200,000.  The proposal I have just advanced should be examined so that such communities would not have a £200,000 loan hanging around their necks over the lifetime of their workshop.  It is essential that the capital cost be reduced. All workers seconded from the Youth Employment Agency will verify that there is no shortage of people with good ideas who, if given the chance within sheltered accommodation to get their business enterprise off the ground, would yield dividends by way of job creation.  I have submitted this proposal to the relevant Departments.  I hope somebody will examine it and ensure that available resources are transferred to that purpose.</P>
    <P>As this is the first time I have spoken in this House I could not allow the occasion to pass without making reference to the purveyors of doom, gloom and pessimism who think it is the smart <Col N="708" /> and in-thing to speak derogatively and negatively about all things Irish, from culture to commerce, education to employment, from the economy to ecology, in short about every facet and fact pertaining to the welfare and wellbeing of the nation.  We got a bad press worldwide during the last election.  We must not look to foreign sources for the root of this ill-founded negative thinking.  Its seeds are sown in this House, in our media and in every pub and club where people assemble.  We insult ourselves, our ancestors and posterity by being self-derogatory as though it was incumbent on us as Irish nationals, to minimise national achievement and criticise national endeavour.</P>
    <P>This is a great country.  Its potential as a manufacturing and service centre is mildly reflected in recent balance of trade returns.  However, our penetration of European markets is weak.  It is time to examine our strategies and agencies which have been tardy and lethargic in achieving a sales volume that would take up the slackness in our economy and generate employment, thus bringing into the workforce at home those highly and expensively educated young people who might otherwise have to deploy their talents in other lands.  This country is all our competitors would wish for in its highly educated and richly talented youth population.</P>
    <P>We have rivers, seas and pastures whose cleanliness and greenness are unique in Europe.  We have tremendous potential for production in agricultural, horticultural and fisheries sectors.  We have uncrowded friendly openness especially attractive to tourists.  We have an infrastructure that lends itself to improvement and expansion.  With so many advantages to overshadow our current difficulties any failure on our part to rectify our economic ills, whether by way of failure to act or our propensity to seek soft options, would amount to treasonable negligence.</P>
    <P>I might conclude with a suggestion.  In recent times it has been customary to have international years to mark signal groups or worthy endeavours such as The <Col N="709" /> Year of the Disabled, International Youth Year and so on.  I suggest that 1988 be heralded as Irish year of national confidence and pride.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would like to compliment the Deputy on his maiden speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Chair in congratulating Deputy Wright on his first contribution to the House which was remarkable in its lack of derogatory reference to past performances.  I was encouraged by the way in which Deputy Wright looked to the future.  At the end of his speech he identified a variety of prominent features which would lead one to believe that the future of Ireland is safe, that we have just one endeavour, that is to get our finances in order.  He is perfectly right there.  What is required of any Irish Government is to instil confidence in our economy.</P>
      <P>However, I believe one must look back and ascertain what it was that brought about our present huge national debt and whether any efforts were made to resolve those difficulties.  It is safe to say that during 1986 there was a serious attempt made to reduce Government expenditure. But, in the autumn, there was a destabilisation of our financial markets, resulting mainly from inaccurate and totally unfounded statements on the part of Members of this House.  Here I am not excusing my own party.  Much of the hysteria generated resulted in a totally unwarranted increase in interest rates. I should add that Fine Gael Deputies contributed to that as well.  Indeed, there were individuals on the other side of the House also, even one Minister of State, who were totally irresponsible in talking about rising deficits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to predict that the Government target of 6.9 per cent of borrowing for current public expenditure will not be reached.  I hope it will be reached.  The present team have taken on a difficult task.  Having listened to the Minister's speech one is doubtful about whether it is possible in Ireland at present <Col N="710" /> to have accepted the policy decisions that will be necessary to bring about this reduction in current expenditure.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, said in 1979 that we were living beyond our means but there are people who still believe that this country is not in financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wright is correct in saying that we should all work together.  Deputy Desmond has been wont to point out in recent times that 90 per cent of the people in this House believe in free enterprise and in proper interest rates and that there should be a free market and a combination of private and public enterprise to create jobs and sustain employment. We all have that aspiration but we find it very difficult to reach a consensus on how it should be done.  In present circumstances the attitude of Fine Gael to the budget is possibly the nearest you can get to national government.</P>
    <P>Last night a motion on health charges was taken in this House.  Fine Gael proposed an alternative system of raising revenue in the area of health but it was rejected by the Government.  However, in the interests of the taxpayer and of the people who fund most of these operations, Fine Gael abstained on the vote. That was a very responsible attitude to take towards resolving the present serious financial problems.  The media do not seem to take this matter seriously. They do not properly accept that we are living beyond our means.  For current expenditure we will borrow in excess of £1,400 million.  In the UK where the population is almost 20 times greater the figure in this respect will be £2.4 billion. In other words we have to borrow £680 per person to keep the State going whereas the British have to borrow less than £50 per person.  Therefore, is there not a great task facing the Minister for Finance and the Government, whoever may be in power, if they hope to put some money aside to improve the climate for new industry and new enterprise?</P>
    <P>I hope we do not have a repetition of the previous Fianna Fáil Government. When they were last in power they were smitten by the GUBU factor.  The present Government, and I regret this <Col N="711" /> very much, have already introduced explanatory techniques.  I am being generous when I say that the outgoing Government also had some mysterious references in the budget as to how they would produce savings.  They had a heading in the budget entitled &ldquo;Efficiency&rdquo;. In the figures published by the Minister for Finance, efficiency has been well catalogued in the Department of Health.  In the Department of Education there are different references to greater economies, greater efficiency and revised packages when stating how the Department will be run.  There is no explanation as to what policy decisions will be made. People in this House have the experience of the outgoing Government in dealing with problems in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There was a certain hysteria during 1986 about the payment of outstanding moneys to teachers.  They are still claiming that money.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Education has stated already that the teachers are entitled to the £75 million.  She is putting unnecesary pressure on the Minister for Finance to provide this money.  The Minister for Health, by outlining to the management of the health boards and to the leaders of the health organisations where the cuts will be made, is being totally honest.  The time has come for the Minister for Education to state clearly what her intentions are.  There is a greater chance of success if she indicates quite clearly what her policy decisions are.  This would have a roll-up effect.  It would increase the confidence of the financial sector on which this budget strategy is placed.  There are two or three areas which are very doubtful and these techniques are not helping.</P>
    <P>In regard to the £25 million withholding tax, from all the calculations that have been made it is very doubtful if the economy will be a net beneficiary of any of this money.  When explanations are given as to how the £25 million withholding tax will be dealt with, most of these firms will have their affairs in order by the end of September or October and will be able to point out that not alone <Col N="712" /> have they not been able to make a profit but that they have incurred losses during the last number of years.  They will also point out &mdash; I am sure most of the Deputies in this House have received correspondence in this regard &mdash; that they intend to lay off a number of people. Unemployment is a terrible thing.  Forcing employment through taxation techniques that will not yield anything further by way of revenue for the Exchequer cannot be upheld.  I ask the Minister for Finance, before he introduces the Finance Bill, to have another look at the withholding tax and to see if some other system can be introduced to bring in revenue because I do not think this scheme will work.</P>
    <P>There was also the announcement of the intention to develop a site belonging to the Ports and Docks Board with a new scheme of financial incentives being offered to foreign banks to set up business in Dublin.  I regret Shannon Airport was not given the opportunity to expand their offshore banking scheme which is already in existence.  These new announcements will undermine ten years work undertaken by the development company.  The Central Bank put all sorts of problems in their way and I understand the Department of Finance were not enamoured by the advance of these offshore banking companies, but the arrival of such companies in our area would herald a great opportunity for the large numbers of young people who have been trained in new technology in the NIHE and in our secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Shannon has a growing young population which is proportionately higher than in Ennis, Limerick or anywhere else. This new town was established in the sixties and has a population of about 12,000 with a disproportionate number of young people.  Hopes had been high that the financial services, which would be attracted to Shannon under the new regime published in 1986, would prove very attractive because the amenities were already there &mdash; the industrial estate, the airport, third level education institutions and new technology in Shannon and Limerick.  I was very disappointed that the Taoiseach did not <Col N="713" /> ensure that our area would get at least a breathing space of two or three years to develop.  Pandering to people in the centre city area, as far as the Port and Docks site is concerned, is not going to help.  The Central Bank held up progress in Shannon for ten years but other countries took advantage of these financial services, especially offshore banking, ten years ago, and they are firmly established now.  The Taoiseach is aware of this because he implied he understood it in speeches he made from time to time.  As a Clare Deputy I ask him to impress upon the financial institutions that there are real opportunities in Shannon which could be exploited.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on every budget since 1982 and you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were in the Chair when I made my maiden speech.  At that time I appealed to the then Minister for Finance to take another look at VAT on hurleys and rates on community buildings, such as GAA and other sporting clubs.  I was disappointed that relief was not given in any budget since 1982 and I appeal once more to the Minister to have another look at these areas.  This is an opportune time to make such a gesture especially when there are so many unemployed.  It is gratifying to see unemployed people in Dublin and in the provinces jogging.  They have a healthy regard for themselves and sport is one outlet which is very necessary in these depressing times.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not put more onerous conditions on the sale of mature forests to the value of £3 million.  In his reply he should give the House a clear undertaking that this money will not go directly into the Exchequer and the Department of Finance.  The selling of semi-mature forests should create more employment and lead to more planting.  I believe the real purpose of the proposal was to improve this neglected area of forestry.  The Minister might consider giving tax incentives to people who are prepared to invest private funds in forestry.  The current sale will attract insurance companies, and some others who are interested in the private side of forestry development, who will be <Col N="714" /> pleased to avail of this softer option.  As I said, the Minister should consider giving a tax incentive if there is to be a claw back on these funds.</P>
    <P>The budget has dealt a mortal blow to the construction industry.  One of the real problems facing that industry is their belief that the State will get them out of all their difficulties.  More than two-thirds of the income of the construction industry comes directly from the State.  I believe the construction industry were beginning to realise that they needed an opportunity to invest and I wonder if the Minister would encourage consortia of the construction industry to borrow on the European markets at more favourable interest rates, or if a scheme could be brought in, similar to that which is applied to agriculture, to provide funds for builders so that they might get involved in the speculative market.</P>
    <P>I hope the withdrawal of the house improvement grant scheme will not have a detrimental effect on the small businesses and the small builders, who had begun to see a little light.  Perhaps when the Minister for the Environment is drawing up a new scheme he might consider these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I wish to join with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in congratulating my colleague, Deputy Wright, on his fine maiden speech.</P>
      <P>Budgets are seldom greeted with loud acclaim.  Instead, there is the inevitable wave of post-budget criticism.  In difficult times, when the correct decisions are hard, the fundamentally correct strategy of the Government may be lost sight of in the breaking swell of adverse comment.</P>
      <P>The current budget, prepared by the Government in the extremely short period of time available, is but the first step of a strategy which will take us out of the economic whirlpool in which we have been for far too long.  It will bring about a badly needed change of mood and emphasis.  It is a source of great encouragement that a majority of the people understand and accept the provisions of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> The degree of consensus about the seriousness of our continuing economic situation in the recent past was almost frightening and certainly most depressing. The prevailing mood did nothing to inspire our young population who are now a dominant force.  They need to have hope and confidence in the future and they are looking to our political leaders to provide it.  In the past, the dominant note was negative and there was no promise or prize held out to spur on a people full of the impatience of youth.</P>
    <P>With monotonous regularity the previous Government and the media reminded the country of the economic and social ills &mdash; the level of the national debt, the high interest rates, the disproportionately high level of public expenditure, the high unemployment and poor employment prospects and the various symptoms of social unrest.  Many marginal issues dominated Government time.  Root causes were referred to but not tackled.  Particularly absent was a thrust towards what is positive and vital to halt the decline, restore self-esteem and set the country again on a path of economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Government do not underestimate the difficulties.  They have been totally realistic in their assessment of the situation but their focus will be on creating the right environment for growth and restoring national confidence.  Their ideology will rest on hope, not on doom and gloom; on vital controls, not on unfettered bureaucratic restrictions.  It will also rest on priority areas for action, not on a morass of countless tasks beyond the range and proper scope of any Government.  There are already encouraging signs that the thrust of this Government's policies is producing the promised results.  Interest rates are falling and financial experts agree that they will continue to fall based on the confidence of the financial sector in the Government's strategy and unshakeable determination.</P>
    <P>The economy is back under control and those who count know this.  A good example of positive Government action producing results is the effect that the <Col N="716" /> budget has had on the outflow of punts on shopping trips to the North.  This unpatriotic practice, which cost the State dearly and which devastated the natural level of trade in the Border counties, has been virtually wiped out.  The money involved is now in circulation in this part of the country, to the advantage of everybody.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet meeting last weekend produced another set of examples which showed that the Government are geared to positive and effective action.  Among the measures agreed were the extension of the natural gas pipeline to Drogheda and Dundalk, a major marketing drive for native industry, new directions for the forestry industry and a financial services centre for the Custom House docks site in Dublin.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We will support it positively in the years ahead. We did so in the past and it is part and parcel of our policy of decentralisation. Many more measures were agreed at the meeting which will be announced in the very near future.  This is an action Government.  We are doing what needs to be done, not talking about it.  We are laying the base from which long term results will be achieved.  Above all, we are producing the leadership and the task requires the same level of effort from everybody.  It must be a team effort and we need the support of all sectors if we are to reach the targets we have set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in a spirit of practical patriotism that I appeal to employers, trade unions and farm leaders to set aside their sectional interests for the good of the nation. Let us together rebuild the economy because that is the only way forward.  I am glad to note that there is a steadily increasing understanding of this among the social partners.  It is important to <Col N="717" /> remind ourselves of the need for change and the vital importance of adjusting to it.  The 20th century has brought a rate of change which was never previously experienced.  The effects are felt in the physical environment, the economic climate, the traditional regional structures and indeed the whole social fabric of society.  The world has become a much smaller place.  We are no longer an island nation free to shut out world wide changes and survive in glorious isolation.  We have long been affected by what happens in our neighbouring island and we are also affected by what happens in the council chambers of Europe and the seats of Government across the Atlantic, the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</P>
    <P>Our ability to rely solely on traditional values and products no longer exists.  We dare not ignore what happens in the Pacific, no more than we can ignore what happens across the Irish Sea.  Of special concern to us in the context of change is the openness of our own economy and in traditional products and markets, the surpluses of primary agricultural products, the influence of multinational corporations and the continuing impact of new technology which, of course, add to the current internationally high level of unemployment.</P>

Part of this consideration is the necessary structures within which that organisation can best be provided including the structuring of the health boards.

      <P>As I said, I am studying the structures within the health boards and I do not see any particular reason why we should reduce the number of health boards.  Having regard to the fact that it is part of our policy, as it has been of previous Governments, to transfer resources from the hospital side to community care, we will in considering the restructuring of the health boards, be laying a lot of emphasis on that part of our policy.</P>

As regards the latter part of Deputy De Rossa's question, I am satisfied that the health boards will be able to provide an adequate and proper level of service out of their allocations which are an increase on what they received last year.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister said that he saw no good reason for reducing the number of health boards.  Does the review he referred to deal with the question of whether the health boards are <i>per se</i> the right structure and is he closed to the possibility, for example, of abolishing the health boards as an outdated vehicle for delivering services or changing their membership which is loaded with vested interests as he well knows?  Therefore, are we going to see nothing more than a very cosmetic change arising from whatever review the Minister refers to at some unspecified date in the future or are we going to see some fundamental reform?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, I do not see any good reason to reduce the number of health boards.  A number of proposals have been made to me as Minister and to my predecessor and I am studying those proposals with a view to reorganising the structure within the health boards.</P>

      <P>The House will be very disappointed to hear that the study of the health system has already been pre-empted by a commitment to maintain <Col N="720" /> the present number of health boards. Would the Minister not agree that one of the problems in health expenditure is the escalation of administration costs over the past then years?  If there were cutbacks in administration costs perhaps some of the pernicious things the Minister is now doing in the hospitals could be avoided.</P>

      <P>I am monitoring very carefully the cost of administration in the health services and certainly we will be looking for efficiency in administration but, as I said in my reply, I am not convinced that reducing the number of health boards would improve the delivery of services to the people.  What is important is to ensure that we do deliver an adequate and proper service.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that to date all health board cutbacks seem to have been made at the point where the patient meets the service and very few, if any cutbacks appear to have been made in the area of administration or in the travelling expenses of officials or members of health boards, would the Minister consider issuing a directive to the CEOs of the health boards asking them to make corresponding cutbacks in the expenses which are now paid to officials and members of the health boards, especially in the outrageously high fees which are coming in for travelling expenses?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain why the health boards seem to have made cutbacks on the lower paid and unskilled workers within the health system?  Has <Col N="721" /> the Minister examined the reasons why there appear to have been no cutbacks made in the senior management or administrative sides of the health services and why there have been no efforts to cutback on the abuses at the higher level in the medical profession, in private practice? The Minister made a token effort in asking for £1.5 million back from the consultants when they are getting ten times that out of the system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if an opening date has yet been set for the new Beaumont Hospital in Dublin 9; if a full range of medical services will be available at the hospital; the financial provision which has been allocated for the hospital for the current year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise date on which Beaumont Hospital will open is determined by the supply and installation of essential equipment.  The Beaumont Hospital board have been asked to proceed with all speed in commissioning the hospital and with the co-operation of all the interests concerned, including the staff of the transferring hospitals, it is intended to have the hospital open by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that the range of services currently provided at St. Laurence's and <Col N="725" /> Jervis Street Hospitals will be available at Beaumont from the opening date.  The opening of the psychiatric unit to be run in association with the Eastern Health Board is still under discussion with that board.  A full casualty and accident emergency service will be provided from the opening date.</P>
    <P>The precise sum of money available to Beaumont in 1987 will depend on the date on which the hospital opens as services at the two transferring hospitals will be maintained up to that date.  The budget available for Beaumont will be made up from the proportion of the budgets of the transferring hospitals remaining unspent at the opening date plus an allocation of £2.6 million to Beaumont itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister advise whether he has sought, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, clearance for the recruitment of sufficient personnel to staff fully the new hospital when it opens before the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I met with the chairman of the boards of the three hospitals involved.  We have asked the boards to prepare a submission on what extra staff, if any, will be necessary.  The Minister for Finance and I will then consider that.  It is appreciated that the staff of Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals will be the main staff in the hospital at Beaumont.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the major hold-up is the installation of equipment.  Can he assure us that he has, in turn, been assured by the three hospital boards to which he has referred that they are in a position to secure the easy transfer of their services, staff and outstanding equipment to Beaumont Hospital before the end of this year and that the hospital will definitely open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the chairman of the three hospitals concerned.  We are quite satisfied that it will be possible to open Beaumont Hospital.  It certainly will not be a matter of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister <Col N="726" /> propose to open the hospital when about 140 fewer staff will currently be employed in both the Richmond and Jervis Street hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital will be replacing Jervis Street and St. Laurence's hospitals.  The combined staff of those two hospitals will be moving to Beaumont.  I am satisfied that Beaumont Hospital will open and will provide the range of services that is being provided at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A final question, if I may.  Clearly, as against what we have been constantly led to believe up to this &mdash; and I must say I am pleased to hear it is now only a problem of equipment&mdash; will the Minister advise us that he has resolved whatever outstanding difficulties there were with private consultants with regard to the opening of Beaumont Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties with the consultants were resolved when I took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to be able to give my predecessor a little credit now and again.  There is no problem with consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take that as a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please clarify in a little more detail the position arising out of this meeting with the chairman of the board of each of the hospitals involved?  Can he say categorically there is no remaining staffing problem to be dealt with and that the only remaining problem is one of equipment?  Can he repeat his welcome assurance that this facility will be made available by the end of the year to the people in North Dublin, who are in a totally unsatisfactory condition with regard to the two other hospitals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the long delays for children in need of speech therapy in County Kerry; and the action, if any, he intends taking in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of speech therapy services in County Kerry is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The board state that there are two speech therapists operating in County Kerry. Due to difficulties with their caseload the board recently passed a resolution recommending to me that additional speech therapists be appointed in County Kerry.  However, the board have not yet submitted proposals to me as to how this might be achieved in the context of their overall financial and staffing resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister accepting from the report that has been furnished to him and his officials by the Southern Health Board that there is a need for an <Col N="728" /> additional speech therapist to be appointed in County Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the high caseload the speech therapists say they have in County Kerry.  As I said, primarily it is a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I assume, is aware he will have to make the allocation of funds because he is probably aware of the fact that the Southern Health Board are short £7 million for 1987.  If the request is for additional funds, given that he himself does not accept the high caseload will he be in a position to furnish the modest sum of money for one additional speech therapist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the proposals, if any, he has to introduce a scheme to assist asthma sufferers; in particular if he will consider assisting children under 16 with asthma by designating their condition as a long term illness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>At present some 40 per cent of asthma patients are covered by medical cards and therefore, receive all their prescribed drugs and general practitioner services entirely free of charge. Significant on-going medical expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.</P>
      <P>Persons whose income precludes such eligibility can avail of the benefits of the drug refund scheme.  This scheme ensures that their net expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines for an individual or a family does not exceed £28 per month. Persons insured with the VHI can avail of the benefits applicable to their particular policy.  Income tax relief is also available in regard to medical expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> It is not possible in the present extremely difficult financial situation to contemplate any extensions of the long term illness scheme, as this could be achieved only through the diversion of resources from other essential services.  I am, however, reviewing the scheme with particular reference to the heavy outlay incurred in respect of some conditions including asthma to see how I can alleviate the hardship within the context of the existing drug refund scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In one respect I am disappointed with the Minister's reply in view of the very extensive problem which this causes for very young children in particular.  On the other hand, I am pleased that at least the Minister is departing from the previous excuses of exorbitant costs and inability to identify chronic bronchitis from asthma.  Nonetheless I would, press him as to whether he would consider the introduction of a special scheme for inhaled drugs as the easiest and most cost-effective method of extending some relief, particularly to under 14 year old sufferers of this illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it is impossible in the current year to extend the range of illnesses covered by the long term illness scheme.  I am considering whether it is possible to alleviate the hardship caused to long term illness sufferers who avail of the drug refund scheme.  They have to make a high outlay of money before they receive any refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme people must first pay out money and then wait for a refund.  Surely the Minister must accept that the best procedure is to introduce a special scheme so that inhaled drugs, for example, would be covered under medical card supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that as part of the effort to provide assistance to such families the £28 threshold was not increased in each of the past three years, contrary to the repeated cheap comment by Deputy McCartan? <Col N="730" /> Will he agree that the retention of the £28 limit has been of benefit to families? What is the cost of extending the scheme generally and of extending it to cover those up to the age of 16 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond is correct in saying that £28 has been the threshold for each of the past three years. It is estimated that the additional annual cost of including asthma in the long term illness scheme would be at least £10 million, possibly nearer to £20 million.  The cost of the long term illness scheme in 1985 was £8.5 million.  I am looking at some way of alleviating the hardship caused to asthma sufferers who have to make a considerable outlay of money for drugs and then wait for repayment.  We are looking for a scheme where it would be possible to reduce the amount they would have to spend before applying for a refund.  There would not be any extra cost to the Exchequer since the money is refunded any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister possibly assure Deputy McCartan of sympathy under a review when the current provision as published this morning is £6.8 million for this scheme, as against an outturn for 1986 of £8.8 million?  There has been a substantial reduction for the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that those who suffer from the severe forms of asthma are regularly hospitalised and will be liable from 18 May for the new hospital charges, probably at least once but possibly twice or three times a year, will the Minister consider excluding this illness, since it is not included in the lists of exclusions already published?  This would be of major assistance to sufferers and would constitute the removal of a severe financial burden on those who are regularly chronically ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible in the <Col N="731" /> current year to include asthma in the list of long term illnesses for the purpose of this scheme.  As all Members appreciate, it is an illness with which we would all have sympathy and about which we would like to do something.  In that context we are looking for some measure to alleviate hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been aware before assuming office that there is widespread dissatisfaction with regard to the level of dental services being provided.  As Members are no doubt aware, it is a matter for the health boards to allocate available funds between the different services they provide as they see fit. However, in the letter of 2 April 1987 which informed health boards of their allocations for 1987 I urged that community care services should be protected and I expect that the health boards will do that.</P>

It is my intention in preparing the Estimates <Col N="732" /> for next year to look at the dental services to see what can be done to improve them.

      <P>When our Government left office in 1982 there was an excellent dental service in operation, including the <i>ad hoc</i> service which allowed medical card holders to attend a private dentist. During the past four years that service has been removed completely from each of the health boards.  We are concerned about the dental service and are looking at it in the context of what we can do next year.  We asked the health boards to protect the community care services and I hope the dental service will be maintained and improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, was being examined by a special committee of the Dáil when the general election intervened.  While the committee had met on only two occasions, it had become clear that the Bill required substantial changes, involving as many as 150 amendments.  These were necessary in order to meet points raised by various groups and individuals involved in child care and, more particularly, to take account of a Supreme Court judgment in 1985 which cast doubt over the constitutionality of some of the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming to office, I have been considering what action is appropriate in relation to the Bill.  In view of the constitutional difficulties and the many changes that are required, I have come <Col N="736" /> to the conclusion that it would be more expenditious to allow the 1985 Bill to lapse and to introduce a new children Bill, drafted in the light of the Supreme Court judgment and the many helpful comments made in relation to the 1985 Bill.  A large amount of work in this regard has already been done by my Department and I hope to bring forward a new children Bill by the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that every effort should be made to bring forward the restructured Bill? Is he aware that the virtually complete absence of staff in the parliamentary draughtsman's office has inhibited enormously the bringing forward of this legislation and that the previous Bill took four years to draft?  If it is now to be redrafted could he ensure that we will see the revised Bill in 1987?  I have grave doubts about the prospects of seeing this Bill because, as the Minister knows well, in 1982 absolutely nothing had been done in relation to it and if that position develops again we shall have no child care legislation enacted in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>

As the Deputy knows, a great deal of good work was done on this Bill during the term of the last Dáil.  The Second Stage passed through this House and a committee of this House were set up to examine the Bill in greater detail.  In order to expedite the passage of the necessary legislation I believe the appropriate way is to bring forward a new Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the extraordinary delay in having this Bill before the House, is the Minister absolutely certain that his decision not to proceed with the Bill and seek to amend it will see fundamental amendments made to very major legislation in this House and in the Seanad? Given the importance of having a children Bill which will, update legislation which is essentially old, can the Minister really stand over this further delaying mechanism?  I will not say tactic because I accept the sincerity of the Minister's words.  Is he satisfied that it would not have been better to advance and continue the work on the Bill which was far advanced in this House in Committee?</P>

      <P>As I explained, the Second Stage of this Bill passed through this House; a committee of the House were set up to examine the Bill in detail; there were up to 150 amendments necessary and account had to be taken of the Supreme Court judgement in 1985.  I have no doubt that the correct way to proceed in those circumstances, rather than bringing 150 amendments before the House and having to remove a whole section of the Bill, is to prepare a new Bill.  I believe <Col N="738" /> that is the most expeditious way of dealing with this legislation.</P>

      <P>There are two elements to my question, neither of which has been answered.  The Minister has not told us of his estimate of the importance of this programme nor has he said whether he considers he has a constitutional responsibility to set down some guidelines for the work which will go on in private hospitals, even if it does not go on in public hospitals?  Would the Minister not agree that he has responsibility, regardless of what happens to St. James's hospital to act to supervise and to establish guidelines for this area?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14, 25, 26, 31 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I will be launching the Government's AIDS public information programme tomorrow.  The programme has been designed to meet the identified information needs of the population.</P>
      <P>To meet these needs a two-tiered public information programme has been designed.  At one level the programme will reinforce public knowledge about AIDS through a mass media programme and on an individual level, the personal worries of individuals will be addressed through a detailed booklet and a confidential freefone service.  Sufficient funds are available in the Health Education Bureau's budget to meet the cost of the information campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is the first step in an intensive campaign to educate the public about AIDS.  Fundamental to its success <Col N="744" /> is the development and the implementation on a continuing basis, of local AIDS information and education programmes. These programmes have been put in place.  A central strategy committee has been established by me to develop and implement further strategies for dealing with AIDS.  This committee will continue to monitor the needs of the health services, including the hospital services in relation to AIDS and will make appropriate recommendations to me.</P>
    <P>There have been 19 cases of AIDS to date, 11 of which have occured since 1 January, 1986.  Because of the wide scope for error, an estimate of the future number of cases would only be speculative and of little value.</P>
    <P>With regard to the registering of AIDS deaths the doctor attending the patient at death is required by law to certify the cause of death and a copy of the certificate must be presented to the Registrar of Births and Deaths.  I would expect this requirement to be adhered to in the case of AIDS patients and I have no reason to believe that it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House, first, how many of those were drug-abuse-related and, second, how many were sexually-transmitted-related deaths?  Will the Minister confirm to the House that the accurate recording of such deaths is essential if the extent of the problem is to be identified and combated? Furthermore, is he happy that all such deaths are being properly recorded and reported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy's question, of the 11 deaths three were drug abusers, five were homosexuals/bisexuals, with haemophiliacs accounting for three deaths. As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, it is a matter for the doctor <Col N="745" /> attending the patient who is required, by law, to certify the cause of death, a copy of which certificate must be presented to the Registrar of Births and Deaths.  I would expect that this requirement is being adhered to.  I have no reason to believe otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that recording of such deaths would be vitally important to the combating of the disease would the Minister assure the House that his Department will take all possible steps to ensure that statistics are properly collated?  Second, arising from the three deaths among haemophiliacs, will the Minister state what steps have been taken, particularly on the lines of vetting blood transfusions, to prevent such deaths in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of haemophiliacs, I should say there is a triple screening of blood products to ensure they are absolutely safe for use in this country.  On the first part of the Deputy's question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is important that all such deaths be properly recorded.  But I have no reason to believe that that is not happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the sad information given by the Minister that three of the 11 deaths were among haemophiliacs and his reference to blood donations, I gather that organ donations have caused problems in other countries. Is he satisfied that procedures are in place to ensure &mdash; again within an Irish context &mdash; that all blood and organ products are fully screened?  Furthermore, the Minister indicated in his first reply that he had his own committee working in the area.  People working in the field have indicated that drug abuse constitutes one of the highest risks in the Irish context. Would the Minister say whether, apart <Col N="746" /> from an education programme, he has any other programmes of action, such as counselling in mind, or whether he is hoping to initiate such programmes in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be pre-empting the launch of the campaign tomorrow were I to go into too much detail.  We are very conscious of the problem associated with drug abusers.  We shall be very anxious to ensure that they are made aware of the risks and dangers associated with AIDS.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>How explicit the programme will be is a relative thing depending on one's interpretation of &ldquo;explicit&rdquo;. I think it might be better to await the launching of the programme when the Deputy will be in a position to judge how explicit it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a very explicit answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to pursue the matter of the deaths of the three haemophiliacs.  The Minister said that those three deaths occurred despite the existence of a triple clearance procedure in regard to blood transfusions. Presumably that triple clearance procedure has operated since 1 January <Col N="747" /> 1986.  Can the Minister tell the House whether there has been a tightening up of the vetting procedure for blood transfusions and organ transplants in respect of haemophiliacs?  Furthermore, would he say whether his Department have taken steps to ensure that there is a better vetting procedure in operation since the deaths of the three persons concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the situation is being monitored very closely by officials of my Department to ensure that any necessary action to improve the quality of blood transfusions or the situation generally is broken.  Of course one of the difficulties encountered is that the virus can be <i>in situ</i> for a long time before its clinical effects are identified.  Obviously that fact increases the number of people who will present with AIDS, even though the AIDS virus may have been there for some years before presenting itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already evaded a question from my colleague by asking him to wait until tomorrow.  I have a specific question down to the Minister asking how the content and orientation of the campaign to be launched tomorrow will differ from that advised by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health.  Perhaps the Minister would answer that specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be a public information campaign, part of the Government's strategy to deal with the very serious problem of AIDS, probably the most serious health problem facing this country since that of tuberculosis 40 years ago.  The campaign will provide essential information to people so that they will be in a position, or will know how, to avoid contacting AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I asked the Minister how his campaign differs from the one supplied to the former Minister by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health.  Would the Minister indicate to the House how the campaign has changed and whether it will <Col N="748" /> have specific reference to the preventive qualities of condoms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The campaign broadly will be the same as that of the former Minister in that it will provide factual information to people as to how they can avoid contacting AIDS.  The campaign will be launched tomorrow and we will be dealing with all aspects of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has responded in some respects in relation to the public education programme to be launched tomorrow.  Would the Minister agree that the other side of the fight is the level of services available, of which the sexually-transmitted diseases unit in St. James's Hospital is in the front line for screening and treatment in the Dublin area?  Is the Minister aware that there is concern that this unit is under-staffed, that they experience difficulty in getting necessary facilities, even something as simple as a microscope?  Would the Minister not consider that to be entirely unsatisfactory in view of the fact that we are facing what he described as perhaps the greatest health threat since TB presented itself here in previous decades? Although I know his relationship with St. James's Hospital might not be as good as was the former Minister's, will he undertake to ensure that funds will be made available to the management of St. James's Hospital for this vital service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are three hospitals with clinics for sexually transmitted diseases, St. James's Hospital being one of them in this city. The Mater and Dr. Steevens are the other two.  I assure the Deputy we will have proper treatment facilities available to every AIDS patient who needs them not <Col N="749" /> alone in the Dublin area but also throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the report of the Nuclear Energy Board published last week shows that Ireland is ill prepared to deal with a nuclear accident closer than Chernobyl &mdash; for example, Sellafield?  That report indicated that the response of the health boards was inadequate and that the whole body monitors are not available in Ireland unlike most other European countries.  I am asking the Minister what steps have been taken by his Department since Chernobyl, to improve the response to such an accident?</P>

      <P>As I have already stated in reply to this question, I stated publicly that there well be reductions in the number of people working in the health services.  Those reductions will be of the order of 3 per cent as a result of the embargo.</P>

      <P>I recently had a meeting with the IMO to discuss a variety of matters including the review of the common contract.  At this meeting I stressed that I was anxious that a review of the contract be undertaken in the near future.  I am now waiting for a response from the organisation in this regard.</P>

      <P>It seems obvious from the Minister's reply that the IMO are still refusing to renegotiate the common contract that was finalised by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in 1979.  As the Minister has dealt ruthlessly with the lower paid workers in the health services in recent weeks, as figures have shown, I think he will agree he must force the IMO, if they still refuse, to renegotiate a contract that has beld the health services. I ask the Minister what views he has on the IMO's refusal to date to negotiate with him and with his Department on a contract that has given them a blank cheque to earn what they want out of the health services, that has resulted in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not accept I have dealt ruthlessly with the lower paid workers in the health service.  The main problem in regard to the financing of the health services this year arises because of the overrun of over £55 million by the previous Government in the past two years.  In regard to the common contract, as I pointed out to the Deputy, I met the Irish Medical Organisation to discuss a variety of matters including the review of the common contract.  I stressed I was anxious that a review of the contract be undertaken in the near future and I am now awaiting a response from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, as a member of the North-Eastern Health Board, the Minister will be aware of the very long waiting list for dental treatment &mdash; in fact, the total lack of dental treatment &mdash; and the fact that the Irish Dental Association have clearly indicated they would be unable to cope with the increasing demand for treatment for spouses? Would he like to make a comment on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in reply to an earlier question, I am well aware of the serious position in the dental service. When we left office in 1982 there was an excellent dental service for public patients in place but the <i>ad hoc</i> service which allowed medical card holders to attend private dentists has gone completely over the past years.  I am examining the position of the dental service with a view to seeing what we can do next year to improve that service.  In the meantime, I have asked the health boards to protect community care services, including the dental services, in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to co-ordinate the activities of this new service, which we welcome, with the health boards or will it be done as a separate arrangement with the Irish Dental Association?  In other words, what role will the health boards play in the new service due to commence from October?</P>

      <P>Since the reply is in the main by way of a tabular statement the Chair has always taken the view that it is better for the Deputy to await the tabular statement when he will then be in a position to ask relevant questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but the point I am making is that because two Departments are involved there will be a lot of <Col N="781" /> confusion about the operation of the new service.  That is why I am asking if this service will be provided in co-operation with the Irish Dental Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the present service for those who pay social welfare contributions is a direct contract between the Department of Social Welfare and the dentists, and starting in October there will be an extension of that scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the plans, if any, he has for the stricter enforcement of the food hygiene regulations with particular reference to those regulations concerning the slaughter of animals and the sale of meat for human consumption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement of the food hygiene regulations is the responsibility of the health boards.  I am satisfied that health boards fully discharge their responsibility for enforcing the regulations and in so doing pay particular attention to preventing unfit meat from reaching the consumer.</P>
      <P>However, slaughterhouses require to be subject to stricter statutory control than those provided under these regulations. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has at present draft legislation under consideration which is intended to provide a comprehensive control on slaughterhouses supplying the domestic market and to ensure that adequate standards of veterinary control and hygiene are provided.</P>

      <P>I have had Private Notice Questions in the names of a number of Deputies &mdash; Deputy Ruairí Quinn, Deputy George Birmingham and Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Pat O'Malley.  We will take the questions in the order in which they were submitted to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the efforts, if any, he has made to secure a settlement of the ESB dispute through the various industrial relations channels which are still available and which have not been used; if he will ensure that all industrial relations channels are used, including continuing direct negotiations to try to see whether any basis of settlement is possible; if he is prepared to involve himself in such negotiations if necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter, in view of the potentially catastrophic effects of this dispute for economic recovery and for the whole community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton  Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. R. Bruton</b> asked the Minister for Labour the steps if any, he and his Minister are taking in response to the threatened industrial dispute within the ESB, as an interruption of supply would have catastrophic consequences for the consumer, for agriculture and for industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour as no settlement has yet been agreed between the parties to the ESB dispute and in view of the statement by the Chief Executive, Mr. Moriarty, to the effect that if the strike goes ahead as scheduled at midnight on Monday next there will be a collapse of the electricity system perhaps as early as midday on Tuesday the plans, if any, the Government have to avert this strike which would obviously have very serious consequences for essential services, for agriculture and for industry generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute results from the rejection of a recommendation on the 26th round made by the ESB's Joint Industrial Council. I would point out that the ESB are unique in that they have their own internal machinery for the resolution of disputes, that is, their own Joint Industrial Council which on this occasion is chaired by a former chairman of the Labour Court.  I should like to emphasise that this internal machinery has been very successful in resolving disputes in the ESB and, as a consequence, there has been little need for any reference to outside industrial relations agencies.</P>
      <P>The Joint Industrial Council's recommendation in respect of the 26th round was for a yearlong agreement comprising a three months pay pause with a tiered arrangement in respect of percentage increases in pay as follows: first, 4 per cent on the first £100 per week; second, 3 per cent on the next £200 per week and third, 2 per cent on amounts over that to be reviewed in September 1987.  This recommendation was rejected by the union side.  As a consequence, strike notice has been served to take effect early next week.</P>
      <P>In view of the widespread disruption and the hardship which may arise, I would take this opportunity to appeal to all the staff unions concerned in the ESB to reconsider their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting to <Col N="784" /> negotiate or to intrude in these negotiations, but I ask the Minister to recognise that there are still available to him and to the Government industrial relations channels which so far have not been used.  Will he tell the House if it is the Government's intention to ensure that all these channels will be exhausted before such a dispute enters into an active phase, or can we interpret the Government's decision not to get involved as one of being prepared to have some kind of confrontation with the public sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Labour, the Deputy knows that we do not debate pending disputes, particularly major ones, in the House.  It is a practice which has always been followed.  In the ESB there is a very strong Joint Industrial Council which is used to settle disputes. It is chaired by a former chairman of the Labour Court and, as I said in my reply, it is a matter for the Joint Industrial Council to discuss a dispute in the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the country is now facing a situation of unprecedented gravity?  For the first time, the unions throughout the ESB have co-ordinated their position, which has very serious implications for the community.  Does he agree that, in those circumstances, it is not reasonable that he and his colleagues in the Cabinet should stand aside?  Does he see a role for himself by way of direct intervention, a role for the Labour Court, or for the entire Labour conference at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if a dispute of this nature takes place it would be extremely disruptive and could cause considerable hardship.  For that reason, I take this opportunity to appeal to the staff unions concerned to reconsider their position.  In relation to intervention, the Joint Industrial Council have considerable power and are unique in industrial relations.  That body has sufficient power and strength to examine this dispute. The staff unions should reconsider their position as they have, within the company, the machinery necessary to <Col N="785" /> resolve the dispute and I hope they will use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Any action which the Minister can take to resolve the dispute will, obviously, be very welcome.  If his appeal to the unions is not taken up and if the position that pertains at present continues &mdash; the chief executive, Mr. Moriarty, said that there is no more money available to meet the pay claim &mdash; have the Government any contingency plans in the event of the dispute being unresolved through negotiations with the unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have appealed to the Joint Industrial Council to resolve this dispute.  I have also appealed to the staff unions to reconsider their position.  The other matter to which the Deputy referred does not arise at this stage as I hope the Joint Industrial Council will resolve what is potentially a very serious dispute within the machinery available in the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>While I appreciate the very important role which the Joint Industrial Council play in the ESB, it appears that their role has been played out.  They have not been able to reach agreement and it does not look likely that they will.  At what stage do the Minister and the Government feel they could intervene and take action, particularly in view of the fact that it is a monopolistic public utility affecting the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not wish to debate a pending ESB or any other dispute in the House.  I kept in touch with all sides last week because, as Minister <Col N="786" /> for Labour, it is my job to do so.  It is a matter for the Joint Industrial Council and I do not wish to say any more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that beyond the Joint Industrial Council, channels remain available to both sides to try to solve the dispute?  Does he also accept that his refusal to ensure that that machinery is not available can only be construed by the public as meaning that the Government want to provoke some kind of confrontation between the Government and the public service unions?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> When I spoke in this debate earlier, I referred to the leadership of the Government and the action taken by them to date.  I also referred to the fact that change is inevitable. I put this special emphasis on the inevitability of change with the concluding paragraph of a recently published OECD Report on Innovation Policy in Ireland very much in mind.  It records that the OECD examiners asked the very basic question whether Irish society really wants to change.  I stress that whether we want to or not we cannot stop the onward march of time or ignore the changing face of the world.  We can only hope by positive active involvement to influence, as we see fit, the course of events.</P>
      <P>Accepting the inevitability of change, we must also see ourselves for what we are.  Our strategy for growth and development can only succeed if it is based on a thorough analysis of our weaknesses, strengths and potentialities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards our weaknesses, I do not intend to labour the point.  I have already <Col N="814" /> referred to some and, generally, I will not elaborate about our ailments whether they stem from the physical constraints, economic impediments or curable social infirmities.  However, there is one factor which I would like to stress because it may well be the prime obstacle to greater economic progress and a more buoyant Irish society.  That is the negative element of the Irish physche which exhibits itself all too frequently and too commonly in each sector of Irish society.  Its hallmarks are many and varied.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government should...&rdquo; is one of the many.  One could perhaps question whether this is an entirely native characteristic but, certainly, in the minds of many there is almost no limit to what the Government or some Government agency should do on their behalf at public expense.  Their expectations and their concepts of their entitlements are almost limitless.  State aid is the solution to everything.  What a pity its supply is not also limitless.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What can I do about it?&rdquo;, typifies another prevailing attitude.  It is a close relation to &ldquo;the Government should...&rdquo; mentality.  It is somebody else's business to solve our problems and to lead us to a better state of things.  There is a cutting edge to the recently quoted assessment of John B. Keane, the famous Kerry playwrite, who said that &ldquo;the current despair is attributable to a gutless people, once proud and great, who are now a nation of beggars&rdquo; but without doubt we greatly need to cut through this attitude which tolerates many of our current problems and suggests that remedy is beyond our control.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is bound to fail&rdquo; to be followed occasionally by &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; is often heard.  This attitude is just ridiculous.  We have had so many success stories since the foundation of the State both within and outside the public sector.  Life is not going to be a continuing success story in any event.  Our failure is often our attitude to failure itself.  Many of our current failures and difficulties stem from a changed global environment.  Some, admittedly, have been compounded by <Col N="815" /> internal structural difficulties.  What matters is that we turn our backs on any failures which may have occurred, make the necessary adjustments and start afresh with confidence and realism going hand in hand.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other attitude: &ldquo;It will do&rdquo; or &ldquo;Take it or leave it&rdquo;.  Realism certainly must come in here.  That attitude just will not do.  There are many others in the international marketplace willing to provide a high quality of product and service at competitive prices and as a small nation it is more important than ever that we should aim for the highest standards.</P>
    <P>Let me finish this series of comments on negative elements in our midst with one other example.  &ldquo;Who does he think he is?&rdquo; is one representation of the tendency to criticise success and any aspirations towards a better state of affairs.  I am reminded of a story told by the late Matt Doolan.  He referred to a time when conditions were by no means as good as now and when tomatoes were supplied to his home town mainly to meet the needs of a very small and favoured section of the local community.  His memorable phrase was that if any woman of the ordinary working class was seen to buy tomatoes then she was likely to attract the comment &ldquo;That one must have notions about herself&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not a bad thing for a nation to have notions about itself, not a bad thing at all to focus on its strengths, on its record of successes at home and abroad and to develop and maintain a positive attitude at all times.  The more critical the situation the more we need that positive type of approach.  There is no need for me to give a list of Irish success stories from within this country and overseas. The evidence is there in many walks of life: indigenous industrial and commercial firms like Waterford Glass or Ballygowan Water from my own constituency in West Limerick who have successfully penetrated highly competitive foreign markets; pioneers within the agricultural sector like Mastock and Kerry Co-op who have participated in the great <Col N="816" /> advances within that area; personnel in the service industries who rank with the best world-wide: Irish entertainers like U2, the Dubliners and many others who have made their mark through Europe and beyond; public sector personnel whose achievements are well worthy of praise within that sector.</P>
    <P>I might give our world-ranking sportsmen, like Seán Kelly and Frank O'Mara, special mention when one considers the numerical odds against which they operate. I have no doubt whatsoever that none of these success stories would have occurred had the people concerned not possessed that positive attitude which ought to become a hallmark for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt at some length on the negative elements within our society because, I believe, they more than anything else are preventing us from making the headway which is possible.  What we should do instead is concentrate on the essential ingredients for successful enterprise. They include above all a positive attitude, a high level of commitment, perseverance in the face of temporary failure, development of the necessary practical skills, a keen awareness of market possibilities and an equally keen effort towards working to the standards demanded in the international markets which must be our goal.  The objective must be the right product, of the right quality, at the right price.  The right product will have regard to both the market factors and those factors which facilitate production such as our natural resources. The right quality will take into account function, design and finish.  The right price will not have an overriding pull towards cheapness, but will rather be directed towards giving value for money in the most competitive markets.</P>
    <P>To be specific as to where I see home production taking place to serve those markets and revitalise our economy, I would mark out for special attention the basic resource areas of this country. Within living memory, school children were told that Ireland possessed few natural resources.  This is now, thankfully, recognised to be quite untrue. This <Col N="817" /> is a country with abundant natural resources and proper use of them can make a major contribution to national economic recovery.  This Government recognise very clearly and very positively the natural resources of the country.</P>
    <P>Our foremost natural resource is our agricultural land.  Agriculture here is still developing.  Nevertheless, with growing food surpluses within the EEC we cannot count on increasing the volume of our farm output to sustain national prosperity. If, however, scope for output increases is small, there is still scope for improving the economic return derived from each unit of output produced.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in government recognise that future growth and profitability in agriculture will depend on the development of retailed consumer products, fully processed in Ireland and of sufficient quality to compete in a market which has a surplus supply.  We have the ability to become market leaders, producers for the quality end of the European food market.  In many continental countries, Ireland is seen as having a clean, unpolluted environment.  The growing demand for naturally produced food in the international market must surely be an advantage for us.  Greater use of dairy by-products, such as Kerry Co-op have pioneered with ease in the United States, is another potential growth area.</P>
    <P>Success in any business is dependent on a number of different things.  Being in possession of natural advantages while important is not sufficient to guarantee the success of the agricultural industry. We must make a positive effort to achieve defined objectives.  In particular, we must market our goods in a creative way to ensure that we are seen as a supplier of premium quality produce.  We must be vigilant in our quality control.  We must be see every ton of raw agricultural produce exported or sold into intervention as a missed opportunity for extra employment in downstream processing.</P>
    <P>In addition to the natural advantage conferred by good agricultural land, it now appears that so-called bad land can also be a cause for optimism.  I refer, of course, to the scope for developing our <Col N="818" /> forest industry.  It is universally acknowledged that some of our poorest quality farmland is among the best land for afforestation. Furthermore timber, unlike other produce from the land, is likely to be in short supply throughout the continent for the foreseeable future.  We have both the soil and climate for profitable production and virtually a guaranteed market.  It is indeed a national scandal that we possess the best timber-growing environment in Europe yet we have the lowest acreage under trees and we import millions of pounds of timber every year.</P>
    <P>Rather than harp on this as a national failing, we should view the situation now as a great opportunity.  There is enormous scope for development, development which can greatly benefit areas where incomes have traditionally lagged behind the national average.  It is obvious that a proper development programme for forestry can also contribute greatly to economic recovery.  The Government have this very much in mind and have given priority to the development of the forest industry.  Afforestation will be one of the key growth areas in the programme for economic expansion of this Government. I have embarked in a positive way on the developing of the forest industry because the Government recognise its full potential. Action is being taken rather than talk about taking action.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the great potential of the resources in the seas around our coasts, a new Department of the Marine has been established.  For every square mile of land within the jurisdiction of the State, there are more than five square miles of sea within our 200 mile economic exclusion zone.  It is important that all of the resources of this vast area are developed.  In setting up the Department of the Marine, the Government have taken the first necessary step forward.</P>
    <P>The scope for job-creating developments based on the wealth of our sea is most obvious.  I am constantly amazed to find Irish supermarket shelves stocked with highly processed fish products from other European countries.  Beyond doubt, most of these products could be <Col N="819" /> processed in Ireland.  It is important to remember that fishing, like forestry, is an industry which frequently benefits the more remote and disadvantaged regions of the country.  Meeting the challenge in developing downstream industries is likely to create more employment in areas where a primary profitable industry is sometimes difficult to foster.  I would add that I see development not just in terms of import substitution.  There is an export market, already exploited to some extent, with much unfulfilled potential. Indeed, because of the relatively small size of the home market, in most of our endeavours our aim must be an internationally marketable end product.</P>
    <P>Another area of offshore resources which is capable of contributing to economic development is the energy field&mdash; oil and natural gas.  Again, this Government are, of course, ensuring that the benefits of the existing proven gasfields are shared as widely as possible by the extension of the national grid.  However, it is quite possible that further fields of either oil or gas may be discovered.  A Government cannot arrange such a discovery by decree, but they can create an environment which encourages exploitation. This task will be an objective of the Government and we can be certain that, in the event of a discovery, we will ensure that the tapping of this resource will proceed in a manner designed to give maximum benefit to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The land and the sea most of us take completely for granted.  They are, however, fundamental national assets and the Government recognised the importance of these assets to the economy. They provide an abundant base for creating sustainable profitable employment. While the enormous contribution made by foreign investors attracted to this country through grants and other incentives cannot be denied &mdash; and I would be the first to welcome these investors into the country but that in itself is not sufficient &mdash; it is obvious that a policy depending on such investors solely would be insufficient to meet the needs of the <Col N="820" /> present unemployment crisis.  Many of the factories which have located here have become integrated with the local economy.  However, others by their nature being small units of large international firms, are more firmly linked to affiliated firms overseas.  Such firms in response to changing circumstances can, and do, decide to close in Ireland and relocate elsewhere.  While the Government are continuing to encourage foreign investment, it must be recognised that heavy dependence on such investment can be unwise.</P>
    <P>Native industry, based on natural resources, whether agri-business, forestry, fish processing etc. is by its nature more likely to succeed in Ireland.  We all know that an industry based on a local resource or natural advantage is most likely in the long run to provide profitable sustainable employment and this type of industry is a focal element of the present Government's industrial policy.</P>
    <P>In this contribution relating to the budget it is natural that I should have concentrated on economic issues. However, as Minister for Defence it is quite appropriate that I should make some reference to the defence area in the broader context of the matters to which I have referred.  They are by no means without connection to the military sphere of operation.  Indeed, in our attempt to give a new sense of direction and purpose to our economic endeavours there are lessons to be learned from the military way of life and the actively cultivated environment on which successful military operations are based.  Let me mention a few of these military characteristics which might be applied to any programme for national recovery.</P>
    <P>First, we must have a sense of patriotism and national pride &mdash; no place here for an attitude of defeatism or any attitude or action injurious to the State.  We all could take this one on board.  Second, we must have a sense of mission and the will to attain that mission, even against superior odds.  The aims are clear.  The objectives are specific and clearly defined.  Plans are persistently pursued. Performance is assessed and any failure <Col N="821" /> is analysed not to blame but to learn and do better on the next occasion.  The rest of society should have more of this approach.  Third, we must firmly apply discipline, not out of any superfluous emphasis on authority, but as a necessary prerequisite for achieving the objectives set.  The budget calls for firm discipline. Fourth, we must see and cultivate people as a vital resource.  This involves continuous training and development, nurturing initiative and flexibility and positive motivation at all stages.  It is another characteristic which is fundamental to success in any sphere.  Fifth, we must develop good leadership, and team spirit.  The good leader inspires, fosters co-operation and commitment and has his philosophy firmly rooted on good example.  Resources are effectively harnessed to achieve the common objectives. Casualties merit priority attention but no passengers are carried.  Here too there is a message for all of us.  Sixth, we must aspire to excellence.  The attitude, &ldquo;it will do&rdquo; goes against the military ethic. It goes against it on all occasions; whether it is a ceremonial parade or a serious form of emergency the aspiration is nothing less than an excellent performance.  As with each of the other qualities we must also incorporate this aspiration in our framework for economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Our own Defence Forces contribute more to the economy and the State than the lessons I have just mentioned.  Acting in aid of the civil power, they carry out a wide range of duties as their contribution towards creating the secure stable environment necessary for economic growth. They enhance the international status of the State as contingents of United Nations peacekeeping forces.  They provide a valuable input to the regular emergency services, most frequently on search and rescue and air ambulance missions. They give most useful service in relation to the country's marine and coastal resources, particularly so as regards fishery protection but also in the event of threat of oil pollution at sea.  Subject to Government direction, they provide many other <i>ad hoc</i> services which help to provide us with a better quality of life.  I am happy on this occasion to compliment <Col N="822" /> and thank them on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is neither the time nor the place for complacency or despondency.  We have had our ups and downs before.  The country is now on a much higher standard of living than it was in the pre-boom period.  The will to do what is right and press forward again is what we need. For its part the Government intend to exercise direction and control and do what is necessary to create an environment conductive to further economic development.</P>
    <P>Armies tend to focus on a mission.  In the context of the budget I should like to put before you a vision.  A vision of sacrifices for what we seek being worthwhile; an acceptable level of national borrowing; an appropriate level of public expenditure; increased national output; a healthy balance of trade; employment widely and adequately distributed; no compulsory emigration; sectoral conflict subdued and the return to our land of that co-operation which, to some extent, technological changes have pushed aside and self-esteem restored in a caring, sharing, vibrant society.</P>
    <P>That vision cannot come to fruition within the time span often dictated by the environment of a stock exchange.  Any worthwhile vision needs a reasonable time span for achievement.  What matters is that together we have the vision and the commitment to attain it.  We should not allow ourselves to be diverted from our course by the protests and pressures exerted by the faint-hearted, the self-interested and the miguided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty on the budget debate is to formally congratulate everybody who was appointed to their respective positions and to wish them well in their onerous tasks.  I wish my colleagues in the other parties the best of luck for the future in their respective positions. The more things change the more they are the same.  It is interesting to attend various meetings around the country, to listen to various contributions in this House, to read speeches made by members of the Government and their <Col N="823" /> supporters and to see the complete turning on its head of the statements therein in view of the contrasting positions prior to the recent election.  The old saying, &ldquo;The more things change the more they are the same&rdquo; is true in this instance.  At various locations around the Twenty-six Counties the Fianna Fáil Party have become uniquely timid, mild, diplomatic and very astute in their attempts to rectify the difficult economic situation now being experienced.</P>
      <P>It is unusual for the main Opposition party to give support to a Government on difficult economic issues but this party have done so on a variety of stances and have stated their limits so far as our support is concerned.  In the national interest and in view of the fact that the budget was in the main drafted on the Estimates prior to Christmas by the Coalition Government, and in latter days by the Fine Gael Government, that is consistent with a good political stance.  The perception among the public on the street is one of total confusion.  It is fair to say after four and a half years of difficult Government and difficult decisions if the Coalition Government, prior to the last election, were to attempt to introduce some of the measures that are now being discussed freely there would be riots on the streets and there would be chaos across the country.  The confusion which has resulted from the statement of the Minister for Finance has not yet been clarified in the minds of the public.  They are thinking only of the difficulties which they will experience in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see great difficulties for this Government in the months after the summer recess when they attempt to draft the figures for the 1988 budget.  Many of the figures contained in the programme put forward by the Minister for Finance leave much to be desired.  They are unclear. When one reads references to greater efficiencies, greater savings and greater cost-effectiveness, one does not understand the specifics except when the effect is translated on the ground to job losses in the various sectors and services provided, <Col N="824" /> whether these jobs are temporary, part time or full time.</P>
    <P>I had a short experience as Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Labour.  I pay tribute to the officials with whom I dealt, officially and formally, in those capacities.  As a politician I learned what is is to sit on the other side of the table and hear and see the other side of the arguments.  While Fianna Fáil were in Opposition the baying of the hounds for the Government's blood never ceased.  This suddenly stopped because they are now beginning to accept the economic realities, the constraints and the constrictions under which they have to work.  I recognise their difficulties in that regard.  Often due credit is not given to those civil servants who work endless hours for their various Ministers from whatever side.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education in recent contributions to assemblies around the country has made some play of the fact that no moneys have been left for primary school buildings, in particular as they have all been committed earlier in the year.  I make no apology for having been involved.  As a former teacher the dire state of many of our buildings was brought to my attention in a most vigorous way in 1986 and it was with great determination and after a great deal of effort that the allocation was made available. There were some outstandingly bad buildings which the children of the nation attended in which it was expected they would be educated.  In the context of the Constitution, of cherishing all the children of the nation equally, it did not stand up.  One would not want to leave that allocation unspent when contractors were ready, willing and waiting to move in to provide these necessary facilities for children attending school in deplorable conditions.  The Minister now has responsibility for that Department. There are other schools which are equally bad for which tenders have been invited and in respect of which contracts can now be placed.  There is little point in the Minister's claiming in sweet, melodious tones that the money had already been committed before she took up office.  The <Col N="825" /> problem rests with her and I am sure she will attempt to cope with it in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to learn that it is proposed to abolish the local youth service boards, 15 of which had been set up last year and for which funding had been made available.  You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, held with extreme distinction the office of Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for youth affairs.  In that capacity the youth organisations came to your door with a view to forming and implementing a national youth policy.  It was only after the Costello report and the Government's decision to implement a national youth policy that the youth organisations really felt that the balance between voluntary and statutory service was achieving a proper blend and that we could attempt in the years ahead to cater properly for our young population.</P>
    <P>The termination of this scheme has put back youth work by 15 or 20 years.  Many youth organisations who have operated on shoe-string budgets with a great deal of commitment and voluntary effort will now find themselves without the necessary resources to carry on.  It will mean in many cases the disintegration of peripheral but very valuable youth organisation. I regret that the Government have taken this decision and I ask them to review it.  The balance between voluntary and statutory services was unique.  This was something that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, worked to achieve in your ministerial capacity.  The initial results of this policy were very heartening and were welcomed by the umbrella youth organisation and the various young people involved.</P>
    <P>The various local authorities are now involved in consultations about the determination of estimates for 1987 in the light of the allocations made in the budget.  My constituency colleague is now the Minister for the Environment and I wish him well in that broad and important ministry. Local authority members, many of whom serve in this House, are now beginning to realise the consequences of what is happening within that Department.  In <Col N="826" /> regard to the local authorities, the health boards and the schools, unemployment and so on, the same stories are beginning to emerge as were being trotted out over the past four years.  The diplomatic onslaught on Capitol Hill in Washington to get our illegal immigrants valid visas or employment in their own country has not yet yielded any concrete results as yet.  If the consequences of the legislation initiated by President Reagan are followed through, deportation of many of these illegal emigrants to the USA may take place.  The problem was not really created by the Irish, whose numbers pale into insignificance compared with those from Mexico and South America.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has experienced a difficult period.  The former Minister for Agriculture spent many weeks in Brussels negotiating on behalf of the Irish farmer. The smaller man was looked after to the best extent possible.  The current Minister will face increasing difficulties in regard to the status of the CAP.  A unique form of co-operation between the farming organisation will be required to back up the case for Ireland and get the best deal for our farmers.</P>
    <P>The decision to terminate the land tax was a retrograde step.  One important aspect of that work was the collection of information for the first time since the 1860s and 1870s in relation to who actually owns the land of Ireland.  There is a great deal of confusion about land registered in the name of persons who are deceased.  Those who would never have been liable for land tax will now have to pay as a result of the reduction in the VAT compensatory amount from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent.  As that begins to take effect there will be further disharmony.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to set up An Bord Glais and the Department of the Marine.  I am not sure what level of funding is being allocated to these Departments but the marketing of our agricultural produce is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The change in Fianna Fáil's attitude and mentality is striking, to put it mildly. The stock answer from 1982 onwards to any Coalition Minister was: &ldquo;You are in <Col N="827" /> Government; you have the responsibility to sort out this problem &mdash; get down to it&rdquo;.  Irrespective of how great the problem was or whether it was relevant to Government agencies, the blame was laid at the door of a Minister and a Department.  In Fianna Fáil terms that was good politics. They now find themselves managing the affairs of the country and faced with the same problems, some of them of increasingly seriousness.</P>
    <P>The Government's nerve will be stretched to the limit in the months ahead. The Fine Gael Party have given support to Government policies within stated limits with a view to rectifying the economy. The party will not turn back from that decision.  We faced reality by choice and the Fianna Fáil Government are now compelled to do so.  They should take account of the fact that our support for the Government within certain limits is in the national interest and not for short term political advantage.  It would be all too easy to tell Fianna Fáil that this is their problem, that we have nothing to do with it and that they should sort it out.  In terms of consistency and in the national interest it is important that the view put forward by Fine Gael in supporting the Government, within stated limits, is followed through.</P>
    <P>The outflow of people to foreign countries, the hungry hordes at the outposts as they were called in times gone by, are still continuing.  The numbers outside the various embassies looking for visas to Australia and the US have not declined to any great extent.  The results in terms of taxation of what they receive in their pay packets are depressing and the national mentality of &ldquo;Let the Government sort out our problems&rdquo; is prevalent as ever.  We face great difficulties.  The last Government were called monetarists, Thatcherite, uncaring and a whole series of other names from across the water. That was the branding of what was perceived by the Fianna Fáil mentality to be the Fine Gael Government's attitude. Fianna Fáil now are compelled by reality to operate within the same constraining <Col N="828" /> limits and difficulties and we will see how they will fare out.</P>
    <P>Cost efficiencies which have been mentioned throughout the speech of the Minister for Finance are dealt with in a very fair and understanding way.  It is difficult at present for those who are members of health boards to find out where the money that is being allocated by Central Government is being spent in the administrative structures that have been in place for a number of years.  The first thing that happens when a reduction, a cutback or greater efficiency has to be implemented is that some incentive or some service that is important is put up for the chop.  Those who serve on health boards and who made very strong statements last year, the year before and the year prior to that about the inability of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, to deal with the health problems will now review their statements in the context of what is happending in the allocations given to the health boards under the present Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>We will have to examine right across the board our production, quality of the goods that we have and efficiency in that general area.  Ireland as an industrial country is not rated very highly in ability to produce, delivery on time and quality of its goods.  In that area we rank down the list in comparison with countries of similar size throughout the world.  There is no reason why this cannot be improved. History has taught us that people who have left this country for whatever reason at whatever time have made their way in business, politics, commerce and in general life in any country they have taken up position in.  It may be unfair to say it but probably our insularity has had a disadvantageous effect on us in the course of the years in that we have never really been exposed to the competitive instinct of the Europeans the Americans or the Japanese in later years to the extent that we should have been and when those who left were faced with that challenge they more than met it in ability to complete.  We can do that here because the firms, the factories and the production areas that are competing well are <Col N="829" /> doing so to a world class standard and there is no reason why that cannot filter right down through the various aspects of the economy and put this country on the map, so to speak, as a country that is able to produce quality goods, that has a keen sense of output, that has dedication to its duty and can deliver its goods on time. For the first time we will have the advent of the Koreans to our island later this year.  If the rumours are true of their national attitude to work in countries like this, be it for very low wages or whatever else, then we as a nation and as a people must lift our sights and rededicate ourselves to meeting a new challenge which is coming here to us instead of us having to go and meet it.  If the level of output, zeal and dedication to duty in productivity from the Far Eastern countries continues at their present level and if they continue to compete and to undercut our productive capacity, then we here and in Western Europe face difficulties in the next decade.</P>
    <P>A great deal of comment has been made here during the last few weeks about the various taxation measures, the cutbacks, the efficiencies and the reductions.  As has been pointed out, the election was fought on several major planks, the reduction in the Governments level of borrowing, the necessity not to increase taxation beyond its present level, the necessity to increase output, to streamline our marketing ability and so on.  It is not possible to maintain an increased level of services right across the board that have been on offer in Ireland for a number of years and at the same time reduce and diminish the national debt and hold taxation at its present level. Those two principles are contradictory and no Government can implement that kind of programme without standing on their heads.  In that context many of the statements made prior to the last elections by Fianna Fáil speakers are now thrown out the window.  As the campaign wore on and prior to the introduction of this budget a drop came in the number of commitments and promises because the economic reality of what this country <Col N="830" /> faces began slowly to dawn on the minds of those who aspired to take up office.</P>
    <P>As a small country we have during a number of years and under several Governments done a good deal to increase the basic level of infrastructure, communications and so on to put us in a position to complete genuinely with our European neighbours and other countries. We must not continue to build on that and to work harder on the marketing of what we have on offer here because we must work to our relative strength.  It is all right to use the old, clichéd language of a better environment, understandings, aspirations and so on, but we have problems and we must tackle them head on. There is not point in beating about the bush any longer.  Other countries with similar problems throughout the years have dealt with these things successfully to a great extent in many cases.</P>
    <P>For four years the people of this country were told about the economic realities of life and they refused to believe them. They rejected a much milder budget in January this year that was put forward by the then Government and are now beginning to feel the consequences and the economic bite of what is being introduced by the Minister for Finance.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies who came to this House first in 1981 have had a very short period in Government and now they find themselves unaccustomed to having to deal with large protest meetings and the constant barracking they get in relation to national issues and the provision of services.  They will say to one privately that this is not what they came into Government for, that they understood that the position of being in Government would be much more genuine and they would have the ability to get things done for their regions, constituencies, counties or wherever else.  Now they find themselves high on the Government backbenches unable to deliver, unable really to influence any of the Government decisions and generally being used to go through the lobbies, either Tá or Níl, whenever the votes take place.  It is disillusioning for many of the younger and newer Fianna Fáil Deputies to have to <Col N="831" /> endure that because their vision of what was going to happen in this House when they came in the early eighties was that the world would change for the better by virtue of the fact that they had stepped inside this Chamber.  That has not happened and now they are faced with an increased series of very complex issues over which they have no control except to make up the number of the 81 that they have.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is not so much the issue of the failure of the Minister to meet with the National Association of Tenants Organisations but the failure of the Government to resolve the dispute involving NATO and to resolve the current rent withholding campaign.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate that perhaps the reasons were beyond those stated, but normally one is confined to the subject matter of the request.  The question referred to the failure of the Government to meet with NATO.  I take it the Deputy will not stray too far away from the consequence of that failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this question it is important to outline the history and the significance of the National Association of Tenants Organisations.  They were founded in 1967, an organisation promoting in their constitution the desire to develop the economic and cultural interest of all members of the tenants organisation.  This organisation have a general secretary named Mr. Matt Larkin.  They are a nationwide organisation and since their inception and particularly since 1983, after a protracted <Col N="832" /> rents strike, they have enjoyed the position of negotiator on behalf of local authority tenants throughout the country with the Government in relation to the issue of rent fixing, conditions in local authority housing of a general nature, and so on.</P>
      <P>To their dismay, in 1985 they were notified by the Minister, Deputy Fergus O'Brien that he saw no further purpose in meeting with NATO to discuss the issues concerning NATO, especially the review of the 1983 rents scheme.  This decision was resisted by NATO and it was roundly condemned by all parties in Opposition in the House, including the party in Government now.  I draw the attention of the Minister to a motion in the name of the spokesperson in Opposition, Deputy Ray Burke, on 4 November 1986:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and the Government to rescind their directive giving city and county managers the power to fix local authority rents and to restore to local authority tenants representatives, the National Association of Tenants Organisations their right to negotiate a national uniform rents scheme on behalf of tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite repeated representations and efforts to intercede with the Government NATO were compelled to fall back on the only really effective method available to them which was to exert political pressure by organising a nationwide withholding of rents.  I refer to it as withholding because it was not a strike in the usual sense.  It is to the credit of NATO that while they are advising tenants to withhold rents, they are organising a scheme of bank accounts throughout the country where these rents are being deposited to be available immediately to the corporation and the local authorities as soon as the dispute is resolved.  It is an appalling state of affairs that such a reputable long standing organisation have been literally cast aside so readily by the previous Government and have not, as yet, had the opportunity to <Col N="833" /> meet the current Minister to discuss the situation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party in their manifesto leading up to the general election said that Fianna Fáil totally opposed the decision of the Fine Gael/Labour Government to renege on the undertaking of successive administrations in regard to the method of determining local authority rents, that they believed there should be a nationally devised scheme of rents and that, on election to Government, there would be consultation with the representative of the local authority tenants, prior to determining local authority rents on a national basis, as was the situation before.  During the campaign the Fianna Fáil head office people met with NATO to clarify what they meant by consultation and to emphasise that the representatives to which the manifesto referred were NATO.  Those clarifications were delivered and consequently it was believed by NATO and me and other members of The Workers' Party that immediately on the return to office of this Government they would meet with NATO and that without any great difficulty, beyond meeting a commitment given during the election campaign, the NATO action could be terminated and the badly needed funds would be released to local authorities without delay.</P>
    <P>It was as a result of representations from all sides of the house that the Minister had the opportunity to advise me today that a letter has now gone to NATO inviting them to a meeting.  That invitation will be taken up.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of the issues NATO will want to discuss with the Minister.  It is essential that the Minister appreciates these points because resting in his hands almost exclusively, is the opportunity to end the agitation currently being pursued by NATO on a national basis.  It is crucial that NATO should be restored to their pre 1986 position as national negotiators on behalf of their members throughout the country.  Negotiation is not simply consultation.  Negotiation means sitting down and arriving at a fair and democratic decision involving both parties. <Col N="834" /> That decision will then have to be conveyed from the Minister's office as a directive to the local authorities concerned. The Minister should not be afraid of that process.  It has worked effectively over the past 12 years.  It is curious that the previous Government wanted to abandon it.</P>
    <P>In fairness to NATO, they are not opposed to rent increases.  They simply want the opportunity to have the voice of tenants heard at a negotiating table.  If the need for this must be emphasised, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, acting in another function, attending at our city council meetings will appreciate the importance of such negotiating procedures. The methods of local authorities are so unfair and undemocratic that they have led to widespread reaction both at elected council level and at local level among members of tenants associations throughout the city, to widespread reaction at elected council level and at local level among residents and tenants' associations throughout the city.  No doubt, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will have had the experience of many people having come to you, in desperation, explaining that overnight their rents had been increased three, four and five fold. It is an unfair system &mdash; and I think you will be aware of this also, which involves not even consultation with elected representatives. In Dublin City Council we were presented with a scheme, perhaps the first we learned of it was when tenants began arriving at our advice offices complaining of major rent hikes.  On numerous occasions elected representatives of Dublin City Council attempted to raise the issue, using the democratic process of motion and counter motion.  The City Manager was able to meet us on every such occasion and, despite the fact that we had put a motion down in Dublin City Council, he indicated that legally he was obliged to proceed, and did so intend to proceed, with a scheme which he had unilaterally devised for Dublin for ensuing years.</P>
    <P>The present system denies all forms of consultation and representation.  Local <Col N="835" /> tenants, through their constitutionally-founded organisation, NATO, have no right at present to be consulted or to negotiate.  Local authorities, comprising local elected representatives, have no right to insist on any input or to any say in the rents and relevant schemes fixed. The power rests entirely in the hands of city managers and county chairmen.  We cannot allow this system to continue.  It is in the interests of democracy itself that the pre-1986 system be restored.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister unduly.  I am obliged to the House for having given me the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to assure the Deputy of my intention of honouring the Government's commitment to consult with the National Association of Tenants Organisations in relation to local authority rents.  I am really surprised at the timing of the motion in the light of my written contacts with NATO since assuming office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 March last I received from NATO a submission in relation to local authority rents and a number of other issues.  I wrote to them on 14 April to inform them that I was having their submission examined and would be in touch with them again to arrange a meeting.  I have now asked them to contact my private secretary to make arrangements for that meeting which I hope will take place, when they are available, in the very near future.  This meeting will allow NATO to put forward their views to me on the present scheme and to submit any amendments they would wish to have considered on the introduction of the national scheme.  While I would not wish <Col N="836" /> to prejudice the outcome of the forthcoming discussions with NATO, or give rise to anxieties on the part of local tenants, the reality of the position is that the cost of local authority housing imposes a very serious burden on the Exchequer and on the taxpayers of this country.  In fact that has been acknowledged by the Deputy.  The present average cost of providing and maintaining a new local authority house is some £76 per week whereas the average rental income is approximately £7 only per week.  In 1985, the latest date for which comprehensive figures are available, the ongoing State subsidy on loan charges amounted to £176 million in respect of existing local authority dwellings.  Management and maintenance costs incurred by local authorities amount to £64 million which had to be met by the taxpayer.  When added to the £176 million of subsidy expenditure this gives a frightening total public housing bill in respect of existing local authorities rented houses of £199 million for 1985.  I should say the position is worsening.  In 1987 it is estimated that the total cost is likely to exceed £230 million, comprised of £207 million in subsidies and a rental income shortfall of some £25 million.  This upward trend cannot continue as the balance of the expenditure must ultimately be provided by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Nobody objects to the subsidisation of the housing costs of those on low incomes and who genuinely cannot afford to house themselves.  Indeed it has been the policy of successive Governments to bear as lightly as possible on such persons when drawing up their rent schemes.  However, there are those whose rent contributions are unrealistically low in relation to their incomes and the standard of local authority dwellings now being provided.  The critical state of the Exchequer and local authority finances makes it imperative that we take a fresh look at the basis on which rents are determined and that we modify it to ensure that those who can afford to do so pay their fair share.  It is crucial, from the local authority point of view, that the level of rental income be maintained.  Any reduction in this area <Col N="837" /> will lead not only to neglect of their housing stock but to redundancies and short-time working.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am having the rent scheme examined with a view to introducing a scheme which, in addition to being seen by the tenants as fair and just, will take account also of local authorities' financial positions <i>vis-à-vis</i> their responsibilities for managing and maintaining their housing stocks.  Until these new arrangements have been finalised the existing schemes must continue and, of course, rents must be paid.  The operation of the hardship clause, which forms part of the existing scheme, should ensure that no tenant is required to pay a rent he or she cannot genuinely afford.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, I hope to meet NATO in the very near future for the discussions promised in the Programme for National Recovery.  However, I would remind Deputies that this Government, on assuming office, emphasised the necessity of taking a critical look at all aspects of Government spending.</P>
    <P>We have taken steps already to rationalise the private housing grants scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> This move was necessary.  Our examination of the existing rents scheme will now be approached in a constructive and helpful manner.  We have not given, nor can we in the future, give to any sectoral interest or any such body the right to determine Government policy in any given area.  I do not think the Deputy would wish that.  The Fianna Fáil Government will do as they have always done, that is listen to and consider the views of all interested parties and have regard to those views when taking decisions.  Our decision in relation to local authority rents will be no different.  However, decisions will have to be taken bearing in mind the recognised and agreed financial constraints within which Exchequer spending must be controlled.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy McCartan for having raised the matter.  I expect that the meeting he wants to take place will take place next week or in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 May 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 80 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site and premises at 20 Merrion Road, Ballsbridge, are owned by the Hospitals' Trust Board and were leased <Col N="792" /> to a private company, Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited to use as its headquarters for operating sweepstakes.  It had been obvious for a number of years past that sweepstakes were ceasing to be viable, largely because of the growth of State lotteries in the North American continent. It had also become evident that the Ballsbridge premises were too large for the reducing level of sweepstakes activity.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances and after negotiations extending over a number of years, the Hospitals' Trust Board agreed in December 1986 to compensate Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited for the surrender of the unexpired portion of its leasehold interest.  As the premises were no longer required for sweepstakes purposes the board decided to sell them.  The proceeds of the sale will be distributed eventually to support hospital and other health services.  It is not open to the Hospitals' Trust Board to divert any of the net proceeds of the sale to benefit the redundant sweepstakes workers.  Neither is it open to me as Minister for Health to divert any such funds for this purpose or to instruct the board to do so.</P>
    <P>While I have every sympathy with the employees of Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited and indeed with any workers who experienced redundancy, I am afraid that in the light of these circumstances it is not open to me to use the proceeds of this sale to increase redundancy payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> The appointment of a replacement paeditrician for Roscommon County Hospital was considered by the comhairle at a meeting on 22 November, 1985. Having considered all the factors involved the comhairle decided that the application should be refused on the grounds that:&mdash; (i) as a matter of policy, the comhairle does not support the concept of single-handed consultant appointments in situations where the potential for a second appointment does not exist, and (ii) the policy of the comhairle, as set out in its 1979 publication on the &ldquo;Development of Hospital Paediatric Services&rdquo; is to develop general paediatric services in parallel with maternity-neo-natal units.</P>
    <P>In respect of the consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist post I do not have available to me the additional funds which would be necessary to provide a full obstetric service at the hospital.  In any event I am not satisfied that such a development could now be justified having regard to the fact that full consultant staffed obstetric services, which are capable of catering for Roscommon mothers, are already available in the Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board has made a valuable and significant contribution to the development of health services in Ireland.  However, I am satisfied that there are areas where the VHI could and should be making a greater contribution.  There is a clear need of a comprehensive scheme covering general medical practitioner and outpatient expenses.  Again, there is an obvious need for insurance cover for dental, ophthalmic and aural services, particularly for population groupings not covered by Department of Social Welfare and other State schemes.  I also think that geriatric care is an area which should be addressed more positively by the board.</P>
      <P>The VHI has an obligation to provide adequate insurance cover for services and population groupings not covered by State schemes, such as in the areas I have mentioned.  To facilitate and encourage this process I intend to sponsor a Bill amending the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, and will seek Government approval for my proposals in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid for <Col N="801" /> young farmers was terminated in the context of the budget of 31 March 1987. Applications received by ACOT up to and including that date will be processed. Where the eligibility conditions of the scheme are complied with including the requirement that the farm transfer was secured not later than 31 March 1987 and where all the other eligibility criteria are met, payment will be made in due course.</P>
    <P>Given limited financial resources it is neither feasible to extend the closing date for receipt of applications beyond 31 March, 1987 nor at this stage to contemplate the re-introduction of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As regards 1986 he will be paid his calf premium grant shortly but his application for cattle headage grants under the 1986 disadvantaged areas schemes cannot be considered further until he produces documentary evidence of the lands owned and farmed by him as he has been requested to do.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if the EC regulation which prevents farmers producing milk in excess of the quota for 1986-87 from qualifying for farm development grants will be modified, as most of the work had commenced in advance of the introduction of the regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EEC Regulation 797/85, on which the farm improvement programme is based, grant aid for dairy investment is payable only where an applicant's milk quota is respected.  I see no prospect of obtaining EC Commission agreement to an amendment of the regulation nor of securing the approval of the Council of Ministers to such an amendment.</P>
      <P>I can, however, confirm that grants for non-dairy investment under the programme will no longer be dependent on compliance with the milk quota requirements. Furthermore, milk quotas associated with land leased for a minimum of three years may be taken into account in calculating a dairy farmer's permanent milk quota for programme purposes. These two changes, which apply retrospectively, will, I am satisfied, result in a substantial number of dairy farmers, who would have been ineligible under the previous rules, being eligible now for grants for planned investment.</P>

      <P>As a result of the existence of an illegal traffic &mdash; some of it cross border traffic &mdash; in &ldquo;casualty animals&rdquo; my Department was in touch with the health boards and asked them to exercise special vigilance so that this traffic, where it exists, could be detected and prevented.  I am satisfied that the health boards adequately discharge their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that on the application <Col N="810" /> of the North-Eastern Health Board, I have already made a &ldquo;closure order&rdquo; under the Food Hygiene Regualtions in respect of one of the premises featured prominently in the &ldquo;Today-Tonight&rdquo; programme and I understand that the health board is considering making application to me for a closure order in respect of a second premises which also featured prominently in the programme.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals for a special investigation by my Department as a result of the &ldquo;Today-Tonight&rdquo; programme.</P>
