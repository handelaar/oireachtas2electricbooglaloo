      <P>I was considering having a discussion between the Whips about affording time for debate in the form of statements but I received notice this morning that the Progressive Democrats Party &mdash; I stumbled a bit over that word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The PDs have availed of their right and put down a Private Members' motion dealing with the health services.  In view of that perhaps the Whips could get together and see what arrangements might best be made for the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach if he would make Government time available. Of course the parties on this side of the House have the right to make other arrangements in Private Members' time but will the Taoiseach make Government time available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be discussed between the Whips.  I am not ruling it out but on the other hand I do not want all of next week given over to the health services.  As the Deputy knows most of these matters have been fully debated, discussed and decided on by the House already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of making time available I know the Taoiseach is prepared to consider that.  I urge him to make Government time available notwithstanding anything that might happen in Private Members' time.  The importance of the matter is such that we could well usefully spend all next week <Col N="1937" /> discussing it because it covers a great range of items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>To reiterate what Deputy Dukes said in relation to providing time for debate on the health services or the lack of them, would the Taosieach not consider it time to terminate discussion on item No. 7 on the Order Paper and find time for more urgent matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 7 is ordered for today.  In view of the fact that there is a Private Members' motion and so that there might be some order in our proceedings I suggest that the Whips discuss whether additional Government time can be made available next week in addition to the debate in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach willing to provide extra time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting everyone on notice that a discussion on the health services so far as the Government are concerned will take place within the parameters of the expenditure allocations of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason this motion was put down for next week was because of the refusal by the Government in the past week to agree to any debate on the health services.  I recognise that Private Members' time is not the ideal way in which to discuss this matter because it only lasts for three hours and only about six Deputies are able to contribute. The seriousness of the matter warrants a full scale debate rather than the limited debate provided for in the Private Members' time.  If the Government are prepared to agree to a full scale debate in which a reasonable number of <Col N="1938" /> Deputies can contribute we will not proceed with this motion but will put in some alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Progressive Democrats to do that.  That would not be fair.  One of the privileges that parties in Opposition have is Private Members' time.  I am quite happy that this motion should be taken in Private Members' time but I am also prepared to have the Whips discuss in addition whether Government time should be given by way of a debate in the form of statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have until 11 o'clock to nominate another motion if we so wish.  I would prefer if there was a proper debate in the House rather than a confined three hour debate.</P>

      <P>The subject I want to raise relates to the discontinuing of the literacy programme in Coolock.  I make my point about the earlier debate because <Col N="1941" /> the amount of money required is such that it could be found within or outside the Estimates without difficulty.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach if the Government will be bringing forward legislation to deal with item No. 2 on the Order Paper today, to which Deputy Kavanagh has referred to, I believe the Taoiseach promised that legislation would be brought forward.  Is that still his intention?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh's concern is with the Coolattin situation. Perhaps for the moment it will suffice if I give him an assurance that this matter is under very active consideration by all the Government and local authority agencies concerned.  I do not want to say anything more at this stage because there are a number of legal aspects to it.  I ask the Deputy to accept my assurance that everything the Government can do to ensure that the remaining woods in Coolattin are preserved will be done.</P>

      <P>For the fifth time, Sir, I am requesting you this morning to allow me to raise on the Adjournment the serious situation that has arisen in Clare.  Let me add that the people in Clare find it impossible to understand how a matter so serious cannot be discussed here in Dáil Éireann.  The lives of people in Clare are at risk as a result of a proposal by the Mid Western Health <Col N="1944" /> Board to close three district hospitals, to reduce the number of beds in a maternity hospital by 50 or to close the general hospital in Ennis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke I had been dealing with the budget-related comments of Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> and Deputy Deasy.  Deputy Noonan deliberately pointed out the three factors setting the parameters for the whole budget debate, that is, the £25 billion national debt, the 250,000 people unemployed and the one million dependent on social welfare.  I pointed out that these were mainly legacies of four and a half years of Coalition mismanagement.  I wanted to point out also that Deputy Deasy's contribution was entirely misleading and dishonest. He accused Fianna Fáil of having made pre-election promises of an easy budget. I might pose the question: why would Fianna Fáil project or talk of an easy budget especially when we knew the <Col N="1946" /> Government of which Deputy Deasy was a member had brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy with a national debt of £25 billion?  There had been a projected budget deficit of £13 million to £14 million.  Any promises in that regard were related entirely to dealing with the financial bankruptcy we faced.</P>
      <P>However, there was a guarantee given that we would be more caring towards the poorer and weaker sections of our people.  I believe we have honoured these promises.  We have provided an extra £17 million so that we could implement increases in social welfare benefits in July rather than October.  In addition the Fianna Fáil Government rescinded the decision of Deputy Deasy's Government to impose a special prescription charge on all medical card holders, a section who, by definition, are known to be incapable of making such payments.</P>
      <P>There was no honesty whatsoever in what appeared to the general public to be a stage-managed last minute run for cover by one portion of that Government. I contend that they were four and a half years too late in adopting that Pontius Pilate attitude.  The public deserve better from politicians and, in particular, from Governments.  Practically all of the decisions relating to the budget were made with the objective of reducing the deficit built up particularly over the past four and a half years and reducing the massive numbers of unemployed. I sincerely hope the target set by the Government will be achieved, that interest rates will be forced down, that new areas being investigated for job creation will prove fruitful and that the general provisions of the budget will help to alleviate some of our problems.  I do not believe all of those problems will be solved in the lifetime of any one Government, even if they run a full term. However, we can certainly set the nation on a correct course which is what we must encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community care programme is the area of health care which has failed to get proper funding.  Perhaps that is because this programme is less glamorous and therefore less attractive to the media than <Col N="1947" /> are other areas of health care or it may be because there are fewer consultants involved.  Whatever the cause it has a lower profile and, more importantly, is allocated only a mere fraction of the overall budget for health care.  I know that the Minister and his predecessor &mdash; in fairness to him &mdash; have asked for special treatment for the community care programme but changes will not just happen. They must be made to happen.  I recognise that changes made by the Minister in the budget have meant that an extra £25 million is available to the general medical services.  I ask him to consider having the care of the elderly programme, including institutional geriatric care, taken from under the umbrella of general hospitals and put under the heading of community care.  It is a natural progression of the community care programme. At present these institutions get swallowed up in the push for funds by the acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister also to try to finalise discussions as speedily as possible on a common contract for the consultants. The impact of private practice on the public health care area is of critical importance.  It will have a vital bearing on attitudes to change.  There are a series of questions relating to these discussions which could affect public finances, such as charging for the use of equipment and personnel.</P>
    <P>Almost every provision of the budget can be viewed in a positive or negative fashion.  I ask for a positive reaction both from Members of this House and the general public.  Take the example of the Jobsearch programme which will give 150,000 people an opportunity to become involved, to be interviewed and, in many cases, placed.  The 40,000 places and 12,000 courses under the Jobsearch programme will be made available.  That is the positive side of the proposal.  The negative side being flaunted by some Opposition Deputies is that this is a witch hunt, which is totally incorrect.  It is important to point out that the service will be available, that these people will <Col N="1948" /> be helped, which will be done by the reallocation of resources within the Department of Labour and their Manpower agencies.  There will also be the provision of 120 suitable people from the remainder of the Civil Service to the Department of Social Welfare.  It is good to hear favourable reports already from the various depots set up to help in the implementation of this programme.  The public response is good and positive.  It is important that the public should judge for themselves what is being done.  One can get a biased slant from a newspaper report on any issue.  This tends to happen, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that we do not desert the 250,000 people unemployed.  It should be remembered that they are citizens of this State and are entitled to be seen as genuinely seeking work.  They are not drones and are not unemployed by choice.  They must be assisted in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I might point out also that 1,500 extra places will be made available under the social employment scheme, a scheme which had been allowed to run down at the end of the previous Government's term.  Many people, particularly those in Cork, had complained that the programme had almost ceased to exist.  Confidence has been restored in that scheme which is now being supported by trade unionists and others who had doubts about it at the outset.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme is geared to alleviate some of Dublin's problems as well as those of the provinces. This programme has been revived also.  The fact that that programme had been dropped must surely be one of the crimes of the recent past.  Recently in Cork an Opposition Deputy complained that Cork had not been one of the first location choices in this decentralisation programme.  It should be remembered that that same Deputy's party callously rejected the very concept of decentralisation just four and a half years ago. Such public turnabout is totally dishonest, is bad for politicians generally and for the leadership of the country which must consist of Opposition as well as Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> It is very bad that there should be this publicity seeking reaction to a positive solution to one of our major problems, that solution being the implementation of decentralisation.  When such short term publicity seeking takes place the Leaders of the Opposition parties might very well discipline such people, pointing out that they cannot take that type of stand, that they must be more honest.  God knows we need some honesty in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I might emphasise that I shall be joining my colleagues in the coming months in pushing Cork's case for the location of a Government Department under the decentralisation programme proposed.  I shall be highlighting the very severe unemployment problem obtaining there. I shall also be pointing to the many advantages of such location in Cork, and there are many.  I will do so in the knowledge that the Government have a commitment to decentralisation.  That is the positive side of that proposal and I ask people not to look at it in a negative fashion because, for once, Cork did not take precedence over the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister for the Environment, in the area of local government to consider making funds available and giving greater discretion to local councils. I ask him in particular to refer to the possibility of giving a block grant to cover the total cost.  This would allow in the case of Cork for greater discretion where the council may, for example, wish to concentrate on refurbishing older local authority dwellings rather than building new ones or where they may wish to drop some proposed new road programme temporarily to allow them to spend extra money on the maintenance of the existing road network.  I have said in the past number of years that decisions such as those should be within the scope of the local authority.  If the money is made available to them they should have a right to decide their own priorities.  I accept that central Government must decide on the total allocation but once that is done it should be within the remit of the local council to decide how to spend the <Col N="1950" /> money.  Massive sums of money are spent on new road works but yet the existing road network is falling asunder when it could be improved for a very small amount of money.  I would like the Minister to take action on the question of the block grant.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's assurance that he will use the time from now until the next budget to study and review the whole area of local authority funding. I accept he faced an impossible task in the short space of three weeks prior to the budget in attempting to do this.  I believe he is in the process of reviewing this matter.  There are areas of conflict such as local service charges and so on which need to be looked at and the Minister for the Environment is quite capable of tackling these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general area of finance there are many ways we can, as legislators, help to bring money into the country and, at the same time, hold on to the money that is in the State.  We need to be far more innovative in this respect.  The Minister for Finance is to be congratulated for introducing some new ideas.  These include the decision on expatriate remittances which are now exempt from tax.  This matter has not got enough publicity to date.  This rule will apply to many people including those working in States which may pay well but where it is highly unlikely that Irish people would settle permanently &mdash; for example, Saudi Arabia and similar states. Up to now these people have been treated almost like criminals in this country. They were dodging in and out of the country and dodging customs inspectors to try to grab a few weeks or even a few days holidays in Ireland.  This had to be done to avoid having their incomes taxed at home.  This was a ludicrous situation. It was against the principle of bringing extra money into the country.  We should have been encouraging people, as we are now doing and as other nations do, to earn money abroad and to bring it back to Ireland.  Following the Minister's decision, these people can now come back home, put their money in the bank and give the benefit of its use to the State. <Col N="1951" /> This is a very positive measure and I would like to see it getting more publicity. There are many people who wish to send money home, have it invested here and have their financial affairs handled in the State.</P>
    <P>There are many similar impediments which could and must be tackled by simple legislation.  We should not be afraid to move quickly.  In my short experience in the House, it worries me how long it can take to pass legislation. We should be able to move quickly where damage is being done to State finances. I refer to the kind of legislation similar to that introduced for the restriction of travel allowances.  This has surely been the greatest scandal of all.  People not alone refused to buy Irish within the State but went outside it, bought non-Irish goods and brought them back in order to save on VAT.  These are the people who complain about the 250,000 people who are unemployed and yet they are not willing to pay their way in the State.  They are willing to take the benefits and to accept the items which help them but they go outside the State immediately they see an opportunity to save a few pounds by so doing.  This crazy situation was costing between £200 million and £300 million in purchasing power every year and was crucifying the Border areas in particular.</P>
    <P>It had to be stopped and I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his decision, in particular because we seem to have an inferiority complex whenever we deal with an EC regulation.  I have been told over and over again when complaining about problems in industry, including restrictions and so on, that we cannot tamper with something because it is an EC regulation.  We seem to be the least capable group in the EC when it comes to helping ourselves.  We must learn to cope with the big boys in the EC, to bend the rules as far as we can without breaking them if it helps our State and we must learn not to be afraid to take the action necessary to protect our people.  Other countries where restrictions have been <Col N="1952" /> placed are quite happy to have the Commission test their case because at the end of the two years or whenever a decision is reached they will have achieved their target.  I hope we will also have achieved ours by the time a decision is reached on our issue.  We needed to break the stream of outgoing shopping expeditions.  This has been achieved and again, I congratulate the Minister on doing so.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the EC in general, there seems to be an almost split mentality with the Irish.  Many people when it suits them for publicity purposes accuse us of going with the begging bowl to Europe.  We are reluctant to use the system and to exploit it &mdash; I use that term deliberately &mdash; in the way that other States do.  I have sought refunds of money for training unemployed people and so on and I was told funds were not available. When I was Lord Mayor of Cork city, I sought funds from EC sources as well as from national sources and I was told I was going with the begging bowl.</P>
    <P>I will cite the example of Corby in Northamptonshire in the UK.  Obviously, the UK is much larger than ourselves but yet they were not afraid, when they lost up to 9,000 jobs in the steel industry, to seek assistance from the EC.  They received over £100 million in benefit for one town &mdash; the town of Corby.  People from other countries are now looking at this as a textbook example of how rebuilding can take place having been devastated by EC regulations.  The people in the UK did not see it as going cap-in-hand or as having the begging bowl mentality; they saw it as their right and went after it and good luck to them. We should not be afraid to do the same. When it suits people they trot out the begging bowl phrase but it is damaging our country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify in the House, and to take action if necessary, the suggestion that VAT offenders should not be pursued after the duration of three years.  There has been some clarification of figures in the past couple of days but there is a suggestion that such a directive was issued in December 1985. If so, it is amazing it has not come to <Col N="1953" /> public knowledge until now and I question the reason for this.  It would be too much of a coincidence that a directive such as this should suddenly appear publicly when Fianna Fáil have taken up office.  If such a directive was given and was being acted upon it should now be withdrawn immediately.  I can appreciate the logic of pursuing the debts most likely to be collected but, at the same time, if such a directive was given it would destroy the morale of the general public. Unlike income tax or other direct payments, VAT is money which is collected by companies and other sources for the State and if those people are allowed to keep that money it would be condoning fraud.  Such a directive would also encourage others in the knowledge that if they could survive three years it is quite likely their debts would be written-off.  I ask the Minister to review this immediately to ascertain if the directive has been there since December 1985 and, if so, to have it rescinded.  It must be a ministerial function, and not that of a senior inspector, to give such a directive.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to farm taxation because this has worried me for a long time. Ireland is much too small to have any deliberately created divisions between the urban and rural sections of the community. I believe in equity of taxation. Everybody should pay their fair share. It is a scandal that any section of the community can withhold massive sums of money in health charges and this should not be allowed to continue.  At the same time, however, I do not believe that we can have a witch hunt against the farming community.  The steps now being taken in the budget in relation to farm taxation are the correct ones.  Taxation should be based on a person's income.</P>
    <P>There is a rejection in the budget of the land tax which was introduced by the previous Government.  I agree fully with the decision to remove this tax because it did not work in practice.  It was unfair to both the farming and the PAYE sectors. The real proof of the failure of this land tax &mdash; and it has to be spelt out &mdash; was that last year it raised a laughable £400,000 when it had been estimated that <Col N="1954" /> it would yield an income of £5 million. The collection of the land tax would have cost £6 million this year.  Surely this fact alone discredited the suggestion that we should have a land tax.</P>
    <P>The farm profile system is the correct way to do the job.  There will be no running away from this issue.  I heard one Opposition Deputy from Cork say that farm tax is being done away with.  He was using this in an emotive way to suggest that farm taxation was being done away with.  He did not point out that the land tax brought in £400,000 last year and that it would have cost £6 million to collect the tax this year.  The reality is that £9 million will be collected this year from VAT refunds to farmers.  That is a guaranteed income to the State.  The income tax which will accrue from the farming community from the profile system of taxation can be added to this figure.</P>
    <P>I welcome many other items in the budget, for example, the emphasis on tourism.  Many of us in local government have argued all along that this is the area where real growth will take place from an employment viewpoint.  There was a negative response from many people to the budget when it was first announced but I hope these people now agree with the measures proposed.  Both the Minister, Deputy Wilson, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, have taken steps to get a package moving.  It is important that we encourage and support these moves no matter which side of the House we may sit on.  Credit must go to those who are running the tourism package.  It is a new package.  It is being implemented and I believe there will be very positive results from tourism this year as a result of this package.</P>
    <P>We have seen a dramatic change in the health care area.  Earlier today many Opposition Deputies wanted to discuss the closure of various hospitals.  I want to make the point, in their absence, that the greatest change we have seen adopted has been the approach by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State in their acceptance of the real situation facing us.  I congratulate the Minister for <Col N="1955" /> Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, on their promotions.  They are in a very tough position because of the lack of finance available to them but I believe they are capable of coming through in a positive fashion.  I congratulate them on adopting an honest and open approach to the problems facing health boards and the general public in the health care area.</P>
    <P>I have to compare their approach to that of the previous Government during the past four years when there was constant conflict and aggression between the central administration and just about everybody else involved.  Much of that conflict was caused by the continued denial by the Government that there were any health cuts and by the attempts to shift responsibility for such health cuts from the Government, the Minister and the Department onto the shoulders of the members and administrators of the eight regional health boards.  Claims were made in this Chamber that these cuts were a figment of the imagination of politically motivated persons throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Health denied on at least two occasions that there were any cuts in the health budget.  That deceitful approach reached an all-time high on 22 October last when the then Taoiseach, using the privilege of this Chamber, claimed that the Southern Health Board budget was knowingly fictitious. An attempt was made to justify this character assassination by a rather simplistic comparison of projected and actual deficits for the previous year's accounts.  It was deliberately ignored that the difference was accounted for by cuts, non-progression of projected improvements and the juggling of some accounts at national level.  These included the refund of hospital charges from road traffic accidents which in the case of the Southern Health Board alone made a difference of two-thirds of a million pounds and changes in the forecast for inflation by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>The cuts in financing for health were denied right to the bitter end when the <Col N="1956" /> accumulated deficit for the eight health boards at the end of last year was over £50 million and the deficit for the Southern Health Board was over £7 million.  Surely that was no figment of the imagination and no way to run any public service. When the long term former Minister for Health dived for cover we had the spectacle of him lambasting the short term Minister for Health for under-funding health care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would now be canonised as a saint if the public could bring him back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a classic example of the pot calling the kettle black.  That is an expression which is used in west Cork quite freely.  The Minister allowed a deficit of over £50 million to build up over a number of years and then he dived out of office.  I think this dive was stage managed.  I cannot prove it but the public can judge for themselves.  The junior partners dived for cover.  The long term Minister for Health turned around a few weeks later and accused the short term Minister for Health of under-funding health care.  The deficit is now being picked up in an honest fashion by this Government.  Nobody runs up a budget deficit deliberately.  The former Minister for Health stood up publicly in this Chamber and tried to insist that there were no cuts in the budget for health care. Everybody knows that this was incorrect. Deputy Sheehan may say that the former Minister would be brought back, but I do not believe he would be.  He started a downward trend that could have broken the health services completely in the years to come.  The present Minister is honest and he is willing to take any flak directed at him.  If he makes an allocation he will stand over it and he will not blame the locals because he cannot give them the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time I repeatedly asked the Minister of the day to accept that there were financial cutbacks and to accept responsibility for these as a Minister should.  I ask the Minister and his officials also to consult and co-operate with the <Col N="1957" /> health boards in solving the problems and not to threaten to disband them every time a genuine complaint is made.  There will always be some degree of conflict and difference.  There will always be need for examination of the system to see if it is efficient but these issues can be dealt with if there is a proper degree of mutual respect and understanding.  There will be conflict at local level between staff trade unions, and administrators and at a higher level between boards and Departments and there will probably be conflict between the Minister and the Department, but there must be honesty, respect and understanding.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, for adopting this approach.  He has not alone met with the representatives of the eight health boards but has clearly identified the shortfall in the allocations.  There are no smokescreens or confusion about the issue, just straight facts for which the Minister accepts responsibility.  The first requirement in tackling the problem is to identify it clearly and to have no buck passing.  Included in the health care budget is the £10 in-patient day charge. Whether one agrees with the charge, the most incredible aspect of it must be the claim by the Fine Gael spokesman that it would affect the least well off.  This charge which is expected to raise £6 million nationally is substituted for the prescription charges that had been proposed and which would have taken £16.5 million from the public and would have affected medical card holders &mdash; those who had been assessed and found to be in special need before they were issued with these cards.  I could not accept any suggestion that the lesser of two evils was not chosen and I sincerely hope that the 198,000 people in Cork and Kerry who are covered by medical cards are fully aware that Fine Gael had targeted them, rather than those with incomes over the medical card eligibility level as the major payers of that levy.  Again they are hiding behind that issue.</P>
    <P>I might remark, in passing, that the previous Minister said in this House that he would tackle the consultants and not allow the big money people to walk away <Col N="1958" /> with all the public funds, that he would take them on and make them pay, that he would charge them £1.5 million for the use of public equipment.  I am not sure whether the Minister said this in 1984 or 1985.  He certainly said it in 1986, but never delivered on it.  The former Minister walked away from the problem. The new Minister is left with that problem and I hope he can cope with it.  The percentage of beds being used for private practice and the general level of diagnostic procedures, to mention just a few, are affected by the common contract. They will have to be addressed in these discussions.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the Minister's proposal to review the VHI as such a review is long overdue.  In any area of monopoly the situation has to be kept under constant scrutiny.  I believe the existence of reasonably priced insurance cover for various different risks is a vital element of any proposals which are likely to be put forward in the changing world of health care.  The VHI must be very well policed as they have a monopoly.  Any restrictions which are an impediment to the public in getting cover must be removed. I ask the Minister to deal with this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to reports and to the comments of a former Minister of State that funds for school buildings were sanctioned in the days prior to the handing over of Government.  It appears also from the first Official Report I received that grants to voluntary associations were sanctioned in large numbers.  I should like to emphasise that this would have taken place long after the general election, after the people had made their choice as to who they wanted to run the affairs of State.</P>
    <P>If these reports are true &mdash; I refer specifically to school building programmes and assistance to voluntary associations &mdash; what happened is next door to criminal.  Legislative action will have to be taken to ensure that when a general election is held and a decision has been reached by the public that such carry on for political reasons cannot be allowed to happen.  When the appropriate Dáil <Col N="1959" /> committees are reconstituted I ask that they examine this situation immediately. It must be bordering on the criminal that this kind of action in the school building programme could affect the legitimate claims of many schools for improvements, that developments could be shanghaied and utilised in constituencies which might be earmarked by a particular Minister of the day despite the fact that his party would have been rejected by the public.  This is important where it will hit cities and counties outside Dublin.  I was shocked to read that there were 38 different grants or schemes allocated in Dublin after the general election.  This practice must cease.  In the days óf promises of honesty and open government we were told that none of this carry on would be allowed.  We must call a halt in this regard in the interest of future generations.</P>
    <P>As a new Deputy I was shocked to learn that such things could happen. When I inquired about school building schemes in Cork city &mdash; there are four or five schools there which require extensions or rebuilding or the replacement of obsolete sections &mdash; I was shocked to get the answer that the previous Minister had used up the year's allocation of funds for this programme.  This kind of thing cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, stopped the grants which had been shanghaied one day prior to his taking up office.  I congratulate him on that.  These people will have to be disciplined.  This kind of political cowboyism cannot go on.</P>
    <P>On 31 March Deputy Desmond, in this House, forecast that most people would not support this budget.  A poll taken immediately afterwards showed a public response of a 59 per cent acceptance level.  The people can see now that the Government intend to adhere to the targets set and to work at righting the wrongs which were inherited after four-and-a-half years of Coalition Government.  I believe that the acceptance level is even higher now.  There is a desire on the part of the public to see our problems sorted <Col N="1960" /> out.  I am happy with that and I am prepared to work to justify that level of public support.</P>
    <P>There are some additional points I should like to refer to in passing while the Minister for the Environment is present. One concerns the question of finance for road-maintenance.  In making a case for Cork I suggest that the present system of allocating per mileage of road is not a good one and should be combined with the actual use of the roads.  In the urban areas a driver will make great use of the roads, unlike the rural areas, and yet the funding will be given on a mileage basis. This might be looked at.  I hope the problem of decentralisation will also be looked at.  The problems facing the provinces are the reverse of those facing Dublin, where 38 per cent of the population have 10 per cent of the land.  We will have to change that.</P>
    <P>One of the major local government issues in Cork is a down river crossing.  I ask the Minister not to refuse this project on the grounds of lack of funding at present.  If necessary an indication could be given that the project will go ahead with the rider that when finance is available, or even mention a period, say, of four years to start.  This would allow the local people to make a presentation to the EC and would be a sign of support for the £100 million investment in Ringaskiddy. This issue is with the Minister, I ask him to look at it sympathetically and not to give a flat refusal on the grounds of shortage of finance.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the promised support by Members of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats in the interests of the country.  Now is the time to live up to that promise.  They went on television and radio and said they would be good democrats and they would support the Government's budgetary objectives and targets.  I am asking them to fulfil that promise because they can see that we are controlling finances and that there is recognition of our natural resources &mdash; tourism, fisheries and the land.  Action is being taken on each front.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the reduction of VAT on labour intensive industries &mdash;<Col N="1961" /> particularly on photography, driving lessons and waste disposal &mdash; from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.  This was a very good move and cost approximately £500,000 and it will protect legitimate business people.  We might look at other areas and see where we could reduce VAT to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>I support the positive approach in the budget.  I would not be afraid to be critical if it was necessary, but I recognise that criticism must be tempered by the three factors I mentioned at the beginning, factors to which Deputy Noonan refused to refer on the opening night of the budget debate when he accused Fianna Fáil of picking up their programmes, issues and ideas.  The three factors to which I referred are the £25 billion debt, the 250,000 plus unemployed and one million dependent on social welfare. These are the issues we must face.</P>

      <P>Listening to the previous speaker one would think there was no blame attached to the massive cuts which have been introduced by the present Minister for Finance.  I was a little carried away by the Deputy's Chinese word &ldquo;shanghaied&rdquo;.  This is a new one but it is probably a very adaptable word.  I believe the Minister for Finance has shanghaied the finances of the country by this budget. Where is the growth we were told about? Where is the national growth we were told would be in evidence if Fianna Fáil were returned to office?  It is amazing that in the short space of three to four months there can be a complete U-turn by this party in Government.  They now realise the difficult task the Coalition Government faced over the past four years.  If Fianna Fáil in Opposition had given the Coalition the same co-operation as we are giving them, we would not have the doleful news which has been spelled out here for the past two months.  No matter how Government speakers try to camouflage the position, no matter how they try <Col N="1962" /> to whitewash the issues, it is evident that they are not able to deliver on the promises they made during the general election.</P>
      <P>Every Private Members' motion handed in over the past four and a half years was critical of the Coalition Government.  There was no cover up; there was an open debate every Tuesday and on Wednesday nights but when we, as a responsible Opposition, are trying to get Private Members' motions accepted, we are told by the Chair that the Minister is not yet in a position to take a Private Members' motion on serious matters, such as hospital cuts and so on.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  I was a young inexperienced Member of this House in 1981 and had to share responsibility as a backbencher in Government.  I remember the Opposition party bringing in a Private Members' motion dealing with Bantry County Hospital, which is in my constituency. Fianna Fáil were objecting to the cutting of a service which was not being utilised.  The Ceann Comhairle, the Minister and the Taoiseach of the day condescended to have this matter aired in this chamber, and rightly so.  I cannot see any reason for the change in policy now.  The then Opposition, who were so vehement in exposing minor cuts, were given ample opportunity to express their opinions but the Opposition today are muzzled.  They are told it is not practical for the Minister for Health to take on such a discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to register my protest on behalf of my constituents in Cork South-West who are very angry with the steps the Government are taking, and rightly so. Listening to Government speakers one would think this had been a budget of growth.  Far from it.  Everybody knows this has been a dismal budget as far as the economy is concerned.  I remember driving back from Dublin a few months ago and seeing along the main road from Dublin to Cork huge billboards proclaiming that health cuts hurt the poor and that there must be another way.  We have not seen that other way.  Fianna Fáil said that they would implement policies <Col N="1963" /> which would attract many American tourists but that has not been the case.</P>
    <P>Most services have been annihilated and I protest against the serious cuts in agriculture, health, tourism, fisheries and the building industry.  It is well known that agriculture is the backbone of our economy and without a vibrant agricultural industry we will not have a sound economy.  If our country is to have a future it must come from the development of our natural resources.  We do not have a climate to grow citrus fruits or for an all-year-round tourist industry, but our climate is suitable for producing the best agricultural and fisheries products and the best whiskey and other spirits in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What did your party do for the last 45 years?  Agriculture has been starved of funds.  The farm installation grant, which was most important in so far as the development of agriculture is concerned, was introduced by our Government to make sure that the young farmer would receive help in starting off in this very important industry.  We paid out grants amounting to £5,600 to farmers who qualified for them.  At the stroke of a pen, the Minister for Finance has erased that scheme.  As 60 per cent of the population are under 25 years of age young farmers who have the courage and determination to go into that industry should be helped.  Instead, they are dismayed by the lack of foresight of the Minister in terminating the installation grant.  What confidence can young farmers have in a Government who took such action?  They are the farmers of tomorrow but they will not have any future if they are not helped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We made sure that farmers received a double cattle headage <Col N="1964" /> grant this year which Fianna Fáil never did.  Farm bodies have been curtailed in their budgets.  I have been a member of a county committee of agriculture since 1960 and I have seen the impact which those committees made on the agricultural industry.  Those were the days when there was no red tape or departmental bureaucracy with regard to appointments in agriculture.  In those days an expanding agricultural industry could make an application for an extra agricultural or horticultural instructor to the county committee in the knowledge that a temporary person would be appointed.  Indeed, very often the temporary person was appointed in a permanent capacity in his native county.</P>
      <P>We were told that the transformation in relation to agriculture would benefit farmers and the industry as a whole.  The county committees have been replaced by ACOT but I am a firm believer in the small farmer and the small outfit.  It was far easier to run a small concern like a county committee than it is to run a divisional body like ACOT.  Indeed my fears were justified in no uncertain manner this year when it became evident at our ACOT meeting two months ago in Cork that not alone was there a major reduction in agricultural grants and moneys which were supposed to be given to ACOT offices throughout the country but that ACOT are unable to pay the travelling and subsistence allowances of their members.  Did we ever think we would see that day?  Did we ever think this would be the future of ACOT?  Is this progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that cuts must be made in public expenditure but they should not be made in an industry which is the backbone of the economy.  Our county shows throughout the country were a monument to agriculture.  The best quality cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, poultry and horticultural items were exhibited.  The county committees of agriculture have never failed to give a grant each year for the past 27 years to these county shows but this year those grants have been completely axed as there is not one penny in the kitty.  ACOT are now foundering for <Col N="1965" /> the want of finance and agricultural instructors, horticultural instructors and domestic economy instructors are not in a position to give to those who need it due to the shortage of funds. By no means is this progress.  I ask the Minister for Finance to seriously consider making available a special allocation to ACOT so as to ensure that the agricultural instructor, the horticultural instructor and the farm management instructor are in a position to impart their knowledge to those who desire it.  That would be progress in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that farm improvement grants have been reduced by £2.25 million. What faith can any young farmer have in an administration which reduces farm improvement grants by £2.25 million? The Taoiseach, probably with a good idea behind it, has constituted a new ministry for food and has appointed Deputy Walsh to be at its head.  I have nothing against Deputy Walsh as he is a gentleman to his finger tips, a good representative and a capable man but how capable can a Minister be when his Department does not get one brown penny?  The Taoiseach also appointed Deputy Kirk another very competent man, to be Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with special responsibility for horticulture but he restricted both those gentlemen in their efforts to get their ministries off the ground by not giving them one extra penny to expand their Departments. Surely, you could describe this situation by using the phrase &ldquo;the pub with no beer&rdquo;?  What future can there be for a Department which does not have a pound to spend?</P>
    <P>Hundreds of millions of pounds of horticultural produce is imported into this country.  At present tomatoes are making almost £1 a pound.  Surely, the consumer should not have to pay that exorbitant price for tomatoes?  We should have a horticultural industry which is self-sufficient. At present we are importing Italian lettuce, Dutch cabbage, German beetroot and onions from Israel and all are being sold in our supermarkets and <Col N="1966" /> greengrocer shops throughout the country. Previous administrations allowed the grass to grow around the doors of the Erin Foods factory in Skibbereen.  It is shocking to think that a huge vegetable processing factory such as the Erin Foods factory in Skibbereen was left to lie dormant during the past 12 years due to the lack of proper guidance on finance from the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The powers that be and the people who were in charge at that time could see no further ahead than their noses and they allowed this country to drift back into the position where millions of pounds are being spent on the purchase of vegetables from foreign sources.  Agriculture will not develop until such time as it receives its rightful share of the cake and there is a future for agriculture provided it receives its rightful share of the cake and provided we do not embark on making ridiculous cuts such as we have seen during the past two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to deal with the cutbacks in health expenditure as this is probably the only opportunity I will get in this session of voicing my disapproval at the savage cuts which have been made by the Minister for Health.  The County Hospital in Bantry in south west Cork which is in my own constituency caters for an area which extends from Courtmacsherry to Dursey Island, from Ballinascarty to Mizen Head and from Kilcrohane to Kenmare in south Kerry. In that hospital 35 beds have been closed this week and 12 permanent staff have been laid off.  When one considers the area which this hospital covers and the <Col N="1967" /> services it has provided to the people of south west Cork and to a portion of south Kerry it is shocking to think that any Minister would authorise the closure of 35 beds and the loss of 12 jobs.  Less than 12 months ago the Minister for Health who was then Opposition spokesman for health gave a commitment to the Fianna Fáil organisation in south-west Cork that in Government he would not alone maintain the <i>status quo</i> of the county hospital in Bantry but would upgrade it.  Now, within eight weeks of taking office and at the stroke of a pen he has closed 35 beds and put 12 people out of work. The Minister should come clean on this matter.  We will not put an end to over-expenditure by closing essential hospital wards.  In my constituency there is the district hospital in Clonakilty which is also used as a county home where at night two nurses are in charge of over 250 patients.  Existing vacancies were not authorised for filling.  This is the only geriatric hospital of any consequence in south-west Cork, serving the same extensive area as Bantry County Hospital.  Last Friday we saw the staff and the public, amounting to almost 2,000 people, parading from Clonakilty Hospital down to the square in the town.  They handed a petition duly signed by almost 5,000 people to our junior Minister in West Cork.  When this happens, it is about time that the Minister responsible woke from his slumbers and took the necessary steps to alleviate the fear of the general public about the closure of wards in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is a little hospital nearer home to me, the Schull District Hospital, in which the position of cook has been vacant for the past three months.  The Southern Health Board, in their wisdom, advertised for a qualified cook and held an interview five weeks ago.  Some of the applicants had to travel 85 to 90 miles to attend that interview in Cork city at their own expense.  After interviewing over 30 applicants, each applicant last week got a nice letter from the programme manager of the board stating that owing to the lack of funds the job could not be <Col N="1968" /> filled.  Have this administration sunk to such low depths that they cannot fill a temporary job of cook in a local district hospital?  Must they axe that job?</P>
    <P>The whole approach to the health problem is a farce.  I cannot see any sense in holding interviews and then telling candidates that the post cannot be filled for lack of finance, and by order of the Minister. Surely there must be some other way out of this disastrous position.  The formula proposed by the Fine Gael Party that a charge be made on prescriptions was very acceptable to the general public. It is well known that in Great Britain, a country which has made a vast recovery in its economy owing to the discovery of North Sea oil, every prescription is charged at the rate of £3.  There was nothing wrong with the Fine Gael plan in the budget which they did not get the opportunity to bring forward.  The prescription charge would have been far more acceptable that the charges now being imposed.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking state of affairs that a person who is paying his or her share of PRSI contributions, the farmer and the businessman or woman, along with the health charges, must now pay £10 per day for the first ten days' stay in hospital. That is a double imposition on people who can ill afford to pay.  Many of these are on the borderline of qualifying for a medical card, being only from £1 to £10 over the qualifying rate, yet they are compelled to pay this new charge.  It is outrageous that any Government should have the audacity to do this.  A little bit of commonsense should prevail.  The Minister should not be so obstinate.  He should come clean in the matter.  It is never too late to learn.  If the Minister was serious about the situation he would allow a debate in the Dáil, a friendly debate during which we could all make our submissions.</P>

      <P>We are not going to eat the Minister or attack him.  We are men and women of character in this Chamber. <Col N="1969" /> I have no doubt that we would talk out our grievances.  There is an old saying that two heads are better than one, even if they are only two heads of cabbage. The Minister should grasp the nettle and give Deputies the opportunity to put forward their submissions on what they would like to see happening to rectify the present very serious imbalance <i>vis-á-vis</i> the imposition of the health charges and the curtailment of the health services.</P>
      <P>In the election campaign there were great promises from the present Government about what they would do for the building industry.  Fianna Fáil promised £200 million during the first week of the election campaign and this figure increased to £500 million in the last week of the election campaign.  What has been the result?  We have seen no escalation in the building industry.  By contrast, there has been a complete decline in the past two months.  With the abolition of the housing grants, many small builders who had registered for VAT and income tax with the idea of making a viable living are now felled down for lack of business. These small builders were employing from two to half a dozen people and were contributing by taking those people off the unemployment register.  All their hopes for the future have been dashed due to the abolition of the home improvement grants.  That remarkable scheme was lauded by everybody and it made a significant contribution to the building industry.  Many buildings that were falling into decay were made habitable through that scheme.  However, in spite of its great success the Government axed it with one stroke of the pen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government decided to do away with the £5,000 grant paid to local authority tenants who surrendered their houses in preference for a private house.  As a result of that scheme a lot of employment was created in the building industry and the Department of the Environment were spared the need to provide new local authority houses because more secondhand houses were available for new tenants.  Young people starting off in life were given an <Col N="1970" /> opportunity to procure a home for themselves through that scheme.  The Government were short-sighted in doing away with it.  The Minister should introduce a new house improvement grant scheme.  I am not asking that it be as elaborate as the one that was in operation up to this year.  He should also reconsider reintroducing the £5,000 grant scheme.  Both schemes would have a big impact on the building industry and would relieve the pressure on the finances of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of the effect of the 35 per cent withholding tax on professionals such as civil engineers and quantity surveyors.  Those professions give a lot of employment and pay their share of income tax and VAT.  It is wrong to saddle them with a further 35 per cent tax.  It is an unjust tax.  The Minister should have another look at it particularly in relation to those whose tax returns are in order.  They should be exempt from that tax.</P>
    <P>I abhor the decision to cut the allocation to adult education in view of the fact that many adults avail of the different education programmes financed under that scheme.  Adult education courses have proved very attractive and I view a cut in the allocation to that programme as a step in the wrong direction.  The decision to reduce the amount under the Teamwork scheme from £70 to £60 per week is a retrograde step.  I am sure the Minister can understand how hard it is on young people who are told they will receive £10 less per week under that scheme.  We should be trying to encourage our young people instead of cutting their income.  Why hit the underprivileged and our young people?  If reductions have to be made why not start at the top?  Why not start at those who earn between £30,000 and £100,000 per year?  My warning to the Minister is, hands off the weaker sections of the community; give our young people a chance to make their way in society.  He should not deter the ambitions of our young people who, after all, will be the future parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>It is clear that not alone have cuts been <Col N="1971" /> made in the allocation to Education but that major surgery has been performed. Many of our national schools, to the shame of many administrations, are in a deplorable state.  Some of them are little more than hovels that are unfit for children. One example is the national school at Ballinalee, County Cork, where rats run in and out the doors.  Temporary classrooms have had to be erected in the adjoining cemetery because of overcrowding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a shocking state of affairs that in this day and age children have to attend class in temporary buildings erected in a graveyard.  This week I met a deputation who were crying out for assistance from the Minister for Education. They were told they would have to wait at least another year before they could get it.  The money should be found to build the national schools that are badly needed in all counties from Donegal to Galway, Kerry and Cork.  I am amazed that national schools have been allowed to deteriorate over the years. The Minister should find the money to relieve the plight of the unfortunate children who are compelled to attend classes in buildings that are in a shocking state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the cost of school bus tickets will be increased substantially from September.  This will be very trying for poor people.  Many of the children who use the school bus services live in remote areas and if their parents have to pay the increased charges they will be unable to afford shoes for their children. There should be some flexibility in the system.  I know of children in remote areas who have to walk a mile or a mile and a half to meet the school bus.  How can we expect such children to settle down to school work?  It would not cost that much more for the bus to travel the extra mile to pick them up.  The school bus system is a good system but it should <Col N="1972" /> be re-examined and extended where necessary.</P>
    <P>In the budget there were huge reductions in the allocations to local authorities. Over £1 million less than last year has been allocated to Cork West County Council for water and sewerage schemes and minor schemes cannot be carried out at all this year.  It is shocking that small villages throughout the area which were listed for water and sewerage schemes this year will now be told there is not enough money to carry out the schemes which will be shelved for at least another 12 months.  If there is to be growth in the building industry there must be an expansion rather than a curtailment of such schemes and I ask the Minister to have another look at that aspect.</P>
    <P>In the budget the tourism allocation has also been reduced by £250,000 this year, yet the Minister for Tourism anticipates a huge improvement in the numbers of tourists visiting this country this year. Let us hope he is right but I doubt that he will be if the allocation is reduced by £250,000.</P>

      <P>If tourism is to survive we must provide appropriate facilities for tourists.  Because of lack of money we cannot provide even public conveniences in most of our major resorts.  This country is known as the Emerald Isle and let us hope we can keep it as an emerald isle. Tourism will play a very important role in our economy if it is assisted from the Exchequer.  Until such time as this is done, it will not thrive or survive.  Our prices for drink are higher than in other European countries and in comparison with some European countries our food prices are very high.  We will have to make it attractive for tourists to come. We can only do that by getting the industry off the ground.  We should make sure it is advertised throughout Europe, throughout America and throughout the world and we must make sure the tourists get good value for their money.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that the fishing industry has been treated as the cinderella industry since the foundation of the State.  The allocation for harbours has been reduced by £1.670 million and the allocation to BIM has been reduced by £350,000. According to my calculations the total Vote for fisheries has been reduced by over £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my home port of Schull a beautiful pier was constructed during the term of the last Coalition Government.  The pier cost almost £1 million but the Government of the day knew it was necessary if the fishermen of south west Cork were to have a future.  Thanks to agitation by <Col N="1974" /> myself, we made sure that this pier was completed and ready for opening.  For the past four years industry in that region has made repeated requests to the Minister and BIM for an up-to-date ice plant to be erected on the pier.  The industry will not survive unless such a facility is provided.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that money is provided for this plant which would benefit the fishermen in the area.</P>
    <P>I am completely dismayed at the lack of interest shown by successive Ministers in this industry.  Men with courage and ability applied to BIM for grants to build boats but were told that in no circumstances could any grants be given. Our fishermen can place boat-building orders in Norway and they get a 30 per cent rebate from the Norwegian Government, yet they cannot be given £1 in grant aid by our Government.</P>
    <P>If the industry is to survive it is essential that a proper policy be framed by the Government.  It is a very valuable industry. There are many part-time fishermen along the western seaboard.  More money should be channelled into this industry and the mariculture area should be expanded.  There is vast potential for job creation in areas such as fisheries, agriculture and tourism.  We have not been blessed with any goldmines or oil wells but this industry is a natural resource and the Minister should ensure it gets its rightful share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>We have the best fishing grounds and fish in the world.  However, we have seen those grounds ravaged and raped by continental trawlers while we sat idly by.  I hope the Minister will listen to the contributions made by various speakers and ensure that our industries are adequately catered for.</P>
    <P>As long as Ministers play their part in bringing the country back on the right road &mdash; as we tried to do for the past four years with very little co-operation&mdash;they will be assured of our co-operation but if they stray one yard off the right path then we will oppose them vehemently.</P>

      <P>Aontaíonn formhór na tráchtairí <Col N="1975" /> gur cáináisnéis dian í seo os ár gcomhair. Bhí ar an Rialtas na bearta crua seo a thógáil chun eacnamaíocht na tíre a réiteach i ndiaidh ceithre bhliain de dhrochriarachán an Rialtais roimhe.

Ach rinneamar beart de réir ár mbriathar agus shoc-raíomar ar na gníomhartha atá ag teas-táil chun muinín a chothú sa tír seo arís.

      <P>We are acting now to restore confidence, vitality and growth to the economy. Confidence will be restored by the constructive and decisive action of the Government in tackling the major economic problems.  The measures in the budget, although tough for some sectors, are a significant step towards putting the economic and financial affairs of the State in order and thereby creating the conditions in which economic and social development can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As confidence is restored, there will be an upsurge in economic activity which will lead to a reduction in unemployment. It is not necessary for me to dwell on the great improvement this will be in terms of the self-respect and social well-being of many individuals and families in all parts of our country.  Everybody in this House understands that.  Dealing with this problem in an effective way, as we are now doing will, at the same time, be an enormous step to easing our economic problems.  For every 1,000 people gaining employment there will be a saving of several million pounds on social welfare with the added benefits of increasing income tax and PRSI receipts.  Once confidence is restored &mdash; a process which has now begun &mdash; and the shackles of high interest rates begin to be removed, there <Col N="1976" /> will be a favourable impact on the level of demand in the economy.  This is particularly important for the building industry which I will come back to later.</P>
    <P>There is enormous potential in this country waiting to be tapped and the Government are providing the leadership needed to do just that over the next few years.  The start has been made.  It will not be easy but there is no alternative.  I am pleased the last speaker who spoke offered his support in this regard.</P>

      <P>We must have growth in the economy to enable us to afford the services which all sides of the House wish to provide for the people.  The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> sets out the key objectives for restoring growth.  The budget, through its impact on the public finances, is the first step in making a sound foundation for the implementation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  I am glad to see that the financial markets are reacting positively to the direction set by the Government in the budget.  A first step has been taken with a small reduction in interest rates and I am sure further reductions will follow shortly.</P>
      <P>The budget is framed on three fundamental principles, namely, the restoration of the economy by better management, a greater emphasis on productive economic activity and the progressive reduction of borrowing and the cost of servicing the national debt.  The Government used the short time available to them to formulate this budget to advance these three principles, and in a way which shows our concern for and our strong commitment to those people depending on the State for support &mdash; the most vulnerable section of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have brought forward the 3 per cent increase in social welfare and health payments from November to July.  That must be welcomed.  We have overturned the former Government's decision to shorten the duration of entitlement to <Col N="1977" /> unemployment benefit from 15 to 12 months.  The saving involved in such a shortening would have been achieved at the expense of some of the most dependent people in our community; we are convinced it would have been wrong to do this.  In addition we have discarded the proposal to extend the waiting days for disability benefit from three to six days and the imposition of waiting days on transfer to disability benefit from maternity allowance.  We have also reduced the former Government's proposed requirement of paid contributions for entended entitlement to disability benefit from 260 days to 208 days.  On the health side, the Government have reversed the uncaring decision of the previous Government to impose prescription charges on medical card holders and to abolish the dispensing doctors' scheme. Even if difficult economic circumstances we have shown an understanding and caring attitude to the weak in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the greatest problem facing the country today, agreed by all parties in the House, is unemployment.  It is incumbent on the Government and all sectors of the economy to take whatever measures are necessary to reverse the present very high levels of unemployment.  In this regard, the budget makes a start.  There are many positive and worthwhile features in the budget in this respect, to which commentators have not given sufficient attention. For instance, recruitment to the social employment scheme is to be increased by 1,500 in the current year to bring total participation in the scheme to over 10,000; extra funds are being provided for a new decentralisation programme, an extra 1,000 hectares will be planted in the State forestry programme; a committee have been established to advise on and to undertake the necessary arrangements for the establishment of <Col N="1978" /> a major international financial services centre on the Custom House Docks Site in Dublin and VAT is being reduced from 25 to 10 per cent on photographic services, waste disposal services and driving instruction.  There are other positive measures outlined in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> such as the increase in the rate of payment under the family income supplement scheme from 33? per cent to 50 per cent from July.</P>
      <P>One would not expect everybody to agree with everything in the budget but the general public reaction has been that the tough measures are necessary in the present circumstances.  The budget has demonstrated a sense of realism and will be seen as such.  I will now go on to deal in more detail with the budget in so far as its affects my areas of responsibility as Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Against the background of the present serious state of the public finances and the severe measures it has been necessary to take, the funds for which I have responsibility as Minister for the Environment, while less that I would have wished, indicate the clear appreciation of the Government of the importance of local government and of the importance in the national as well as the local scene of the services entrusted to local authorities. The amount allocated to me for current expenditure is nearly £596 million &mdash; an increase of £15 million on the 1986 outturn. On the capital side, although some reductions were unavoidable, the 1987 allocation is £616 million.  These are vast sums when money is so scarce, interest rates are so high and when so much of the funds has to be borrowed.  These provisions will allow the Department and local authorities to continue to provide essential services such as housing, roads, sanitary services, fire and emergency services etc. during 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the aims of this budget is to reduce interest rates.  The Government have already given a lead by taking 1.5 per cent off the interest rate they charge to local authorities on capital borrowings from the local loans fund for local authority housing, sanitary services, fire services, libraries, swimming pools and <Col N="1979" /> other environmental projects.  As a result local authorities will have less by way of loan charges to pay this year.  The reduction is in line with the Government's budgetary strategy and will give a lead for further reductions in the commercial banks' and building societies' lending rates.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that local authority current expenditure is financed to a significant extent by the Exchequer, through a series of grants for specific services and through the rate support grants.  This subvention represents a significant item of public expenditure and in present circumstances, when all areas of Government spending are subject to serve restraints, it must be accepted that local government have to bear their share of the measures necessary to restore the public finances.  Notwithstanding the small reduction in this year's rate support grants, the total of all the Exchequer grants and subsidies to local authorities this year will amount to about £800 million compared with £765 million in 1986 &mdash;an increase of £35 million or nearly 5 per cent.  In addition local authorities will benefit from the recent fall in bank and Exchequer interest rates both in regard to their revenue and capital programmes. In fact, further savings can be anticipated as interest rates fall further.</P>
    <P>In considering the level of the rate support grant, account must be taken of a number of measures which influence the real level of resources available to local authorities.  First, the farm tax will be abolished with effect from 1987.  I am pleased to say that the Government have provided £13 million extra in place of the amount originally deducted from the grant provision in lieu of anticipated farm tax receipts.  Secondly, I am continuing the practice of allowing authorities to deploy more effectively certain internal resources for revenue purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of urban houses and such things.  The Deputy would not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> Thirdly, local authorities will no longer be liable to contribute to the cost of maintenance of arterial drainage schemes, thereby relieving many of them of a particularly onerous annual expenditure demand, a demand over which they had no control whatever and which could and did cause serious distortion particularly to county councils in the west.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the farm tax means a significant improvement in local authority finances.  The £13 million extra we have provided in the budget will be fully paid by the Exchequer within the year in place of the estimated potential income from the farm tax in respect of 1987. Local authorities will not have the collection difficulties, delays, uncertainty about yield and the costs associated with the farm tax; they will get the £13 million as part of the normal monthly instalments of the rate support grants.  I would emphasise that the farm tax liability incurred in relation to 1986 still applies and that local authorities will continue to pursue the full collection of tax for that year.  The local authorities have adequate powers to enforce collection and I have little doubt, now that they can concentrate their efforts on clearing up these arrears, that they will be able to increase their cash flow in 1987 by the full amount of money outstanding, over £4.5 million. They lost out on it in 1986 through the non-collection of the tax before the end of the year.  I could never see the sense of the farm tax.  Now that I have had the opportunity as Minister for the Environment of looking more closely at it, I am satisfied that it was totally unsuitable as a source of local finance apart from any question of its suitability as a form of tax in its own right.  I am glad that we have been able to terminate it now before it had been allowed to develop to a stage where it would have seriously distorted both our taxation and the local authorities' financial system.  I hope very shortly to bring in legislation which will end it apart, of course, from preserving what is needed for collection of the arrears.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the cost of maintaining completed arterial drainage works fell <Col N="1981" /> on county councils.  This was an onerous demand which fell disproportionately heavily on some local authorities, notably in the west.  With effect from 1987, the financing of arterial drainage is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  As a result, local authorities will save about £5 million this year in respect of this one item alone.</P>
    <P>Finally, before I leave the general question of local authority finance, I would like to refer briefly to recent media reports about charges for services.  The position is this: of the 87 local authorities which strike rates, all but nine of them levied charges for domestic services within their areas last year.  Up to yesterday, a total of 56 local authorities had adopted their estimates for 1987 and the others have meetings scheduled for the next couple of weeks.  In the case of each local authority it is entirely a matter for themselves to decide whether or not to have these charges.  This decision is one for the elected councils to make having regard to their financial circumstances.  There is no question of me, or the city or county manager for that matter, forcing the issue.  Each council will have to decide, in the best democratic traditions, whether to cut back their services, effect savings on their existing services, or make use of all sources of revenue available to them.</P>
    <P>In so far as the future financing of local authorities is concerned, we have said that we wish to install a system which will give much greater predictability to local authority financing.  The present position is unsatisfactory where local authorities were only recently notified of their allocations for 1987.  However, this was unavoidable this year as, in the short space of time available, it was not possible to devise an alternative system.  I intend therefore, to look at the whole question later this year.  In that context of course, the question of charges for services in the future can then be considered.</P>
    <P>On 7 April, I made a substantive statement to the House on the position I faced in the housing grants area when I took up office as Minister for the Environment <Col N="1982" /> and on the necessary decisions taken by the Government in the context of the 1987 budget.  If we are to tackle our serious economic problems, housing as one of the largest public expenditure programmes could not be exempted from the disciplines which had to be imposed on public expenditure.  In line with tough measures taken in other expenditure areas and because of the large build-up of liabilities on these schemes the Government were forced to terminate three out of the four main housing grant schemes operated by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Shame on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government simply had to bring the situation under control which had been allowed to get out of control by the previous administration. As I said on 7 April, when the position is brought under control, when those entitled and waiting to be paid grants have been paid, I will be able to look at the nature, extent and type of assistance that is necessary, appropriate, and affordable in the area of improvements to the existing private housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

      <P>Even after allowing for the decision announced in the budget the total capital provision for housing, at £388 million, is 1 per cent up on the 1986 outturn.  Total Government current and capital expenditure on housing will amount to £629 million this year.</P>
      <P>I would also like to assure Deputies that the detailed manner in which arrangements for the termination of the grants schemes as being applied by my Department ensures that persons who had entered into binding commitments are not, as was alleged, being left without the grant assistance on which they based their decisions to build or buy their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <P>In the case of house improvements, applicants could, of course, under the terms of the scheme enter into commitments only after the house had been inspected by my Department. All work carried out subsequent to inspection will qualify for grant assistance in accordance with the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am particularly glad to have the opportunity of contributing to the budget debate at this time when the overall strategy behind the tough decisions taken by the Government is beginning to show positive results.  Since budget day, as I have already said, there has been a steady downward trend in interest rates and, as Deputies are aware, all the indications are that this trend will continue.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the building societies for their part are anxious to make their contribution to the reduction in interest rates generally.  I am hoping, therefore, that in the near future the societies will be in a position to start reducing their mortgage interest rates.  A reduction in mortgage rates would be a great boost to the economy in general and of particular benefit to hard-pressed mortgage holders, to house purchasers and to the building industry.  I look forward to an early commitment by the building societies to effect what everybody expects will be a really decent reduction in interest rates in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the local authority housing programme, Deputies are aware that there has been a large reduction in the numbers of applicants on local authority waiting lists in recent years due to a number of different factors.  However, the reduction in the numbers on waiting lists does not fully reflect the progress that has been made in meeting social housing needs.  Small households and single persons who previously had little prospect of local authority housing and little incentive to apply for housing are <Col N="1984" /> now being housed on a routine basis, particularly by the larger urban authorities. Over 50 per cent of Dublin Corporation's waiting list now consists of two person households, largely comprising an unmarried mother and one child.  In many areas, accommodation is available virtually on demand and the majority of those on waiting lists for any length of time are there solely because they are seeking accommodation in specific areas.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to local authority housing will continue but must be discharged within the budgetary limitations which the present economic difficulties dictate.  The resources of the taxpayer are finite and capital allocations for local authority housing will only be allocated after a careful consideration of the level of need in each area.  On the basis of the capital provision made in the budget, I expect that 3,500 dwellings will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>The considerable public investment in local authority housing is often not fully appreciated.  In addition to the capital provided each year for new house building the repayments by local authorities on their borrowings for the provision of houses for letting are also fully subsidised by the State.  For this purpose a sum of £206.7 million has been provided in this year's Estimate, representing an increase of 18 per cent on last year's outturn of £175.6 million.  In addition to this subsidy local authorities will, this year, subsidise the maintenance and management of local authority housing to the sum of £20 million.</P>
    <P>The remedial works scheme was introduced in recognition of the need to assist local authorities to carry out major repair works to certain categories of their rented houses, thereby preventing the premature loss of dwellings from the housing stock.  The aim of the scheme is to enable authorities to bring these run-down estates up to modern standards as far as possible.  It is only in this context that subsidised capital may be made available. I must emphasise that the scheme is not a substitute for the necessary ongoing <Col N="1985" /> house maintenance programme which is the responsibility of housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Government review of the capital requirements of the local authority housing programme, remedial works to a number of schemes where the work has not in fact yet commenced will be rescheduled.  The schemes already in progress will continue and will be financed.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can reduce the need for expensive remedial works schemes by the proper and enlightened maintenance and management of their housing estates. I would encourage local authorities to consider ways of better housing management, including tenant consultation and participation, so that problems of anti-social behaviour and vandalism can be tackled before an estate gets to the stage of requiring expensive remedial work.</P>
    <P>The problem of travelling families on the roadside throughout the country gives great cause for concern.  The provision of adequate and suitable accommodation for these families is a matter which local authorities have been asked to deal with as part of their housing programme.  The main thrust of the provision of accommodation has been housing in local authority housing estates.  In some cases, however, travellers desire to be housed among their own and their needs are met by providing group housing schemes.  For those travellers who do not wish to settle down serviced caravan parks are provided.</P>
    <P>Last year ten caravan parks were completed and a further 18 are at either construction or planning stage.  An increase in the rate of the provision of serviced caravan parks will help travellers to improve their lifestyle, provide them with reasonable security and thus let them take the first steps to settle down and integrate into the community, resulting in improved environmental conditions for travellers and the settled community as a whole.  The overall provision for local authority housing in 1987 will allow a continuing high level of progress on this priority element of the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> The availability of an adequate supply of mortgage finance at reasonable rates of interest is of great importance to individuals wishing to purchase a house and to the success of the housing programme as a whole.  Building societies will continue to be a major source of such finance.  The financial sector is experiencing a period of rapid change.  Building societies must face the challenge that this change brings.  It is my intention to introduce major new legislation governing societies to enable them to operate within a framework suited to the modern financial services environment, while guarding their traditional and paramount role as providers of housing finance.  This legislation will be far more wide-ranging than that enacted by the previous Government and it will be drawn up as quickly as possible and in consultation with the societies.  This process of consultation has already begun through the special working party on building society legislation which I set up following my initial meetings with the Irish Building Societies' Association and representatives of the other societies.  The more immediate task of the working party is to resolve the genuine problems that have arisen in the interpretation and implementation of the Building Society Regulations, 1987.  Following detailed examination of these problems the working party will be advising me as to any amendments of the regulations that may be necessary.  I understand the working party have been making good progress in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>I am glad a normal and beneficial working relationship has now been re-established between my Department and the societies.  Constructive dialogue is, of course, vital in devising and implementing the new legislative and administrative arrangements now necessary for the development of the building society movement.</P>
    <P>In so far as the construction industry as a whole is concerned, there is now a broad consensus on the realities of the current marketplace and a realisation that the Government &mdash; that is the tax-payer <Col N="1987" />&mdash; cannot continue indefinitely to finance 70 per cent of any industry's output.  In the medium to long term the industry can only prosper in line with an improvement in overall economic performance. The measures taken by the Government in this budget are the only alternatives to a continuing economic decline.</P>
    <P>In framing this year's budget, the Government have, as I have indicated, faced a very serious situation regarding commitments arising under the various grants schemes operating in the private residential sector.  The measures which the Government have taken are a necessary step towards restoring economic confidence, lowering interest rates and ultimately reducing taxation.  The results to date in terms of lowering interest rates and the prospect of lower rates to come show clearly that the direction chosen by the Government in the budget is the correct one.  It is only by reducing public expenditure, and the consequential upward pressure on interest rates and on taxation, that we can provide conditions under which the decline in private investment &mdash; investment which is crucial to the future prosperity of the construction industry &mdash; can be reversed.</P>
    <P>This is a suitable time to say that in the immediate future it is my intention to set up the construction industry board which was promised by the Fianna Fáil Party before the election.  The membership will be drawn from the industry itself and from representatives of employers, trade unions, the professions and the manufacturing sector, together with a small number from the Department and departmental nominees.</P>

It will be action-orientated and will provide an assessment of the state of the industry.  It is being sought by the industry itself.</P>

      <P>It will provide adequate information, which has not been available, on the performance of the construction industry during the past decade. This board is being sought, and eagerly awaited, by the industry and by representatives of the industry who came to see me by way of deputation on a number of occasions in the past month.  Considering <Col N="1989" /> the State's involvement in the financing of the industry, we must be in a position to formulate clear guidelines which will give the maximum return for the taxpayers' money that is being expended.  I intend to announce further details of this matter in the next few weeks and I expect it will be warmly welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to the roads area and to the prospects for 1987.  We are all aware of the importance of a good road network to the Irish economy.  In particular, the international haulier must have a trouble-free access route from the point of production to the ports and other major distribution points.  At the same time, we must not lose sight of the day-to-day domestic transport needs of the agricultural community.  We need to provide a network capable of meeting our growing traffic demands while, at the same time, ensuring that the capital investment of previous years is protected by an adequate maintenance programme. Many major improvements have been brought about in the roads area in recent years, most notably since the publication in 1979 of the first centrally co-ordinated road plan.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that despite the financial difficulties facing the economy the Government have been able to provide £169.95 million for road grants and local improvements scheme allocations this year.  This provision will enable local authorities to undertake a programme of improvement works on national, regional and county roads as well as a programme of maintenance works on national and non-national main roads.  The provision will also permit the acceleration of the programme of works on non-public roads in the less favoured areas of the west of Ireland, through the local improvements scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the need to review the various financial provisions in the context of my Department's overall Estimates for 1987 and the budgetary situation generally, I had no option but to withdraw the notification of the grant allocations <Col N="1990" /> issued by the previous Government at the end of January.  Details of the revised allocations issued to all local authorities on 9 April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to issuing the new allocations, my Department examined how the 1987 provision could best be utilised, how we could allocate funds to the areas of greatest need while, at the same time, having due regard to value for money and employment considerations.  I am particularly concerned with the deterioration which has taken place in the county road network in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Most particularly in the past five years.  These roads represent 80 per cent of the total mileage of public roads and carry a little over a quarter of total traffic.  Many of those roads were constructed to meet the needs of a more leisurely era and are now crumbling under the weight of the bulk milk tankers, lorries and school buses which they now have to carry.  I am also concerned about the condition of our regional roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, decided to increase the amount provided by the previous Government for strengthening work on the county roads from £10 million to £15 million &mdash; this will be £10 million higher than that spent in 1986.  This grant may also be applied, at the discretion of the local authorities, to the strengthening of regional roads.  In apportioning this grant <Col N="1991" /> my predecessor used a formula based on local authorities income from domestic water charges.  This formula was clearly inequitable, bearing no relationship whatsoever to actual road needs.  Accordingly, I decided that the grants would be allocated <i>pro rata</i> with the mileages of county roads in each county.  The condition of county and regional roads has deteriorated to an alarming degree over the past four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

An improvement in the condition of our rural roads will help in the drive to promote Ireland as an attractive place to visit and this will assist in the drive to promote tourism.  The problem has to be addressed and what is proposed is a quick response over a short time scale to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note from the coverage in local newspapers that county councils have appreciated the extra money I have given them to deal with their county roads.  There was a need for this money. Deputy Sheehan should be the first to acknowledge that because of the increased allocation his county has got for roads that are crumbling in his district and which can now be addressed by this quick response I have made.  This has been received gratefully by all county councils and I am pleased that they have seen it in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided also to increase the provision for the local improvements scheme from £2.15 million to £4 million. This scheme has brought enormous benefits over the years to landowners in isolated areas whose holdings had no proper access to a public road.  I am pleased that this move was warmly welcomed by all sides on local authorities.</P>
      <P>Increased State investment in roads, particularly on the national and major urban roads, has made an important contribution to improvements in road safety in recent years.  The annual number of road deaths fell from a peak of 628 in 1978 to 410 in 1985 and to 386 in 1986. This represents a drop of 39 per cent within eight years.  The 1986 level was the lowest rate for 20 years, despite the fact that the number of vehicles doubled in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Ireland's road death rate per 10,000 population, which stood at 1.96 in 1978, fell to an estimated 1.1 in 1986.  The 1986 rate was low relative to other EC member states.  These reductions mean that Irish road accident rates generally now compare favourably with those in other European countries.</P>
      <P>While our accident rates are falling, we can all agree that even one death or serious injury on the roads is one too many, particularly where the serious consequences could have been avoided by a more responsible attitude on behalf of the road user.  I refer in particular to the use of seat belts and the often-repeated advice relating to drinking and driving.  I was particulary pleased to note the impact made by the National Road Safety Association's seat belt and drink-driving campaigns during European Road Safety Year, 1986.  Let us all make a special effort in this regard in 1987.  We should aim to lead by example particularly in our example to young people whose tragic deaths make very poignant reading in our morning newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of essential infrastructural <Col N="1993" /> development is the capital programme for sanitary services which plays a vital role in housing, industrial, tourism and agricultural development.</P>
    <P>Since 1980, nearly £600 million has been expended on this programme.  This has enabled great strides to be made in providing new and improved piped water and sewerage facilities throughout the country.  Of this £600 million about £350 million was spent on water supplies and £250 million on sewerage programmes. A significant part of this latter expenditure has been used to improve the arrangements for the discharge of effluent including, where appropriate, the provision of new or better treatment facilities.  This aspect of the programme is of particular value in improving our general environment on which so much of our quality of life depends &mdash; a factor which is so important to each of us in our daily lives and which is also important to the success of our efforts to attract not alone tourists but also those interested in coming here to set up industry or other enterprises.  It is accepted that there is a need to examine all aspects of public expenditure critically and in this context the time is opportune for a review of the sanitary services programme focussing on the methods of assessing the need for particular schemes.  It is most important that scarce financial resources should be channelled within all programmes to the areas where they will achieve most for the benefit of the whole community.  An Foras Forbartha have commenced a study of the sanitary services needs of each local authority and, in conjunction with that study, the board will seek to develop a cost-benefit methodology which will be of use to my Department as one of the factors to be taken into account in the assessment of individual schemes.  It will be some years before the final results of that whole exercise by An Foras Forbartha will be available but as the work progresses, I expect to get interim reports which of themselves will help me in determining the level of investment which is appropriate and the priority as between different schemes.  At this stage I have asked my Department <Col N="1994" /> to pay more attention to the justification for each scheme and to ensure that local authorities, in formulating proposals and before commitments are entered into, provide sufficient quantified data as to the nature and the urgency of the need.</P>
    <P>The provision of £66 million in 1987 is intended mainly to meet commitments maturing during the year on schemes under construction.  Requests for supplementary funding on these schemes will be rigorously examined and will have to be fully justified by the local authorities concerned.  In common with other areas of capital spending in my Department, the utmost effort will be made to attract maximum financial assistance from European sources so that the programme can continue to be sustained at its highest appropriate level on the basis of established need.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to securing early redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site and to maximising the impact of this project in terms of job creation and return on investment. I have impressed on all concerned the importance which the Government attach to the project and have asked the authority to expedite the preparation of the planning scheme and to have it ready for submission to me by June for approval.  The whole project has exciting potential for the redevelopment of the centre of our capital city.</P>
    <P>I announced recently that a Bill will shortly be introduced to allow for future extensions of the Custom House Docks area.  The Government believe that extensions of the area are necessary in order to secure the early and satisfactory redevelopment of the existing 27 acre site.  As a first step the area will be extended to the middle of the River Liffey to include the adjoining riverside facilities.  The potential of the river and quayside for the purpose of communication, recreation, amenity and as a unifying link in the appearance and structural organisation of Dublin city centre will be maximised in the redevelopment plans of the site.  Later, the Government will address the lands to the <Col N="1995" /> east of the existing area by extending, on a phased basis, the remit of the Custom House Docks Development Authority once development of the existing site is under way.</P>
    <P>The former Government allocated £387,000 to meet the current expenditure of the authority.  I am satisfied that this amount of money would not be adequate and consequently I have increased it to £600,000 &mdash; an increase of £213,000.  I am confident that this amount will enable the authority to proceed rapidly with the development of the site.  The Government have also allocated a sum of £2 million from non-Exchequer sources for capital expenditure.  This will be sufficient to meet the authority's requirements in 1987.</P>
    <P>This project presents a unique and exciting opportunity for a really significant development which could reverse the whole pattern of decay in the north inner city area.  Considerable interest has been expressed at home and abroad by development consortia and I look forward to work commencing on the site as soon as possible.  In this regard the committee established to advise on and to undertake the necessary arrangements for a major International Financial Services Centre in Dublin will identify, in conjunction with the relevant public bodies, an area in the Custom House Docks site suitable for the centre.  The establishment of such an influential centre will be an enormous boost to the development of the site and will assist in the task of promoting growth and employment.  No effort will be spared to meet the deadlines I have set for this project.</P>
    <P>The funding of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission is being suspended and the provision of grants to the commission in 1987 is therefore being limited to £50,000, primarily to meet liabilities already incurred.  As the House knows, the Government were obliged to look carefully at the provision for the commission in the light of the severe budgetary constraints facing us.  The <Col N="1996" /> Government decided that the country could not afford a sum of £3.4 million in 1987 for the activities of the commission.</P>
    <P>I am already on record in this House as recognising the importance of Dublin city in a national context and indicating that this Government will do everything possible to enhance the appearance of all parts of the city.  In this context, I would remind Deputies that under section 2 of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission Act, 1986, Dublin Corporation are obliged, in the discharge of their functions, to have regard to the special importance in the national interest of the metropolitan central area and to have regard to the need to ensure a high environmental standard and a high standard of civic amenity and civic design in the area.  I will be asking the corporation to ensure that these obligations in relation to the metropolitan central area are fully discharged and to bring forward and implement quickly the plans and projects on which they are working and which would enhance the area.</P>
    <P>In the Adjournment debate on Tuesday, 24 March 1987, I have already commented on the action of the previous administration in allocating a total of £6 million in amenity grants the day before going out of office.  Any responsible administration would have postponed the making of specific grant allocations until such time as the new Government had an opportunity to assess the budgetary situation.  In addition, it is now clear that in making the allocations the previous Minister did not take due account of the merits of individual projects, or of the needs of different areas, and that there was an unfair geographical imbalance in the distribution of the funds available. Besides, it has also emerged that unofficial allocations were made by Ministers before the general election and these have been causing great confusion in the areas affected.  The Government have decided, in view of the budgetary situation, to terminate this scheme and to provide a reduced allocation in 1987 to enable it to be wound up.  I hope to notify local authorities of their grants for this <Col N="1997" /> year at an early stage, hopefully in the next few weeks.</P>

While national pride should be sufficient to end this problem, we should also remember that a situation would also have £10 million annually on street cleaning alone.  Local authorities and voluntary bodies gave the lead last week through their efforts in Clean-Up Ireland Week and it is now a matter for each of us as citizens to avoid littering in public places and to use our influence to prevent others from doing so.</P>

      <P>I welcome in general the Principal Features of the Budget <Col N="1999" /> introduced by the Government.  I agree with the general targets set down for the public finances and with the provision on public sector pay and with most of the spending cuts.  I find they are a welcome conversion for this new Government.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Government have done a major U-turn on economic policy and have thrown out their Fianna Fáil election slogan, &ldquo;There is a better way&rdquo;. Even though the Government have done a 90º U-turn on every position they held during the election campaign and in their four years in Opposition, I welcome that fact because it is in the interests of the country.  While I agree with the general parameters set by the Government in the budget, I deplore the way they are implementing some of their decisions, not the targets themselves.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Government have allowed the budget debate to continue to this late stage without allowing a full debate on health until the Progressive Democrats put down a Private Members' motion last night.  This has meant that the health services have been thrown into chaos.  All the vested interests, including hospitals, health boards and consultants, have been allowed to dictate health policy instead of the Minister for Health, the person statutorily responsible for providing the service.  I welcome the fact that through the Progressive Democrats' motion we are to have a debate on this subject next week.  One would never think from all the chaos, including threats of suicide, hospital closures and deaths, being heard outside this House, that the main function of health policy is to look after patients, and not to prop up health authorities and other parts of the bureaucratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am very disappointed the Government have allowed things to come to this pitch without intervening and explaining their priorities for the health services.  I feel the Government are implementing some of their decisions very badly.  This year, for example, there is an increase of £13 million in the allocation <Col N="2000" /> to the various health boards and the voluntary hospitals, but I condemn the Minister for Health for not coming to this House and setting down the priorities for which he is statutorily responsible.  As a member of this Government he should provide a health service in the public interest.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the budget in general, there are a few aspects I would like to raise as a member of the Progressive Democrats.  One is the deployment of resources in the health budget without leading to any increase in the Estimate. This week I tried to raise a question on the future of Monkstown Hospital, which is in my constituency.  The request was turned down by the Ceann Comhairle's Office on the grounds that the Minister was not going to make any detailed statement on individual hospitals at the present time.  Given that the Dáil was not allowed to have a debate on the general health cutbacks and that demands for a debate on specific health cuts are not allowed, I am left with no alternative but to draw this matter to the Minister's attention in this debate.</P>
    <P>Monkstown Hospital is an acute general hospital and it has reached crisis point largely because the Department of Health will not tell the board the plans they have for the hospital.  The board deferred a decision on the closure of the hospital on Wednesday of last week hoping to get more information from the Department about their plans for the hospital.  That meeting took place late last week with the Department's officials who effectively told the hospital board they could interpret the Minister's cut in their allocation as they wished.  The board came away with the general impression that Monkstown Hospital was not very high on the Department's list of priorities. That is disgraceful behaviour. Monkstown Hospital lives largely within its budget.  Its allocation has been cut by 22 per cent this year, but this is not the point I am complaining about.  The hospital board say they could and would be prepared to live on a 10 per cent reduction in their budget this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> The point I am making is that this hospital which has served the community very well for over 150 years, sought meetings with the Department to obtain information and direction from the Department of Health and the Department of Labour about their future but they have been left floundering without getting a proper idea of where they will fit into the health services in my constituency in the future.  I appeal to the Minister to come clean and to tell the board of this hospital, and the boards of many other hospitals, where they stand. He should come into this House and set down his policy priorities.</P>
    <P>There is no other way we can find out the future of various hospitals without raising it on this budget debate.  I want to stress I am not necessarily calling for an increase in the allocation but I am asking the Minister to come before the House and make a public statement reassuring the general public and patients what service he will provide this year.  I hope he will be able to do that next week when we are discussing the Progressive Democrats' motion.</P>
    <P>Another issue I would like to raise is the Benincasa Special School, Blackrock, County Dublin, where a child care worker is on maternity leave, and there will be no replacement for three or four months.  This school, which deals with emotionally and behaviourally disturbed children, some of whom are autistic, have personality disorders, are sexually abused, aggressive or mute, should have a medical worker but they have been told this worker will not be available for a three month period.  In my view it should be within the bounds of the Department, acting in a responsible way, to deploy workers from another area into a school like that without increasing the overall level of expenditure this year.  When there are restraints and cutbacks it is more important than ever that resources are deployed in the way the Minister, as the member of the Government setting down health policy, should dictate.  He is the person who is answerable for the public health policy we have this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> While I have welcomed the budget's financial provisions in a general way, I would like to come to the most disappointing aspect from my point of view. No attempt was made to reform the tax system.  In fact, new taxes have been added in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  The land tax is being abolished, and I note in the budget provisions that it will cost £9 million to do so.  I very much doubt if the tax brought in much more than that in all the time it has been in existence.</P>
    <P>The tax I want to discuss here is the withholding tax.  The Progressive Democrats are opposed to the withholding tax on professional fees in its current form and I want to put that on the record.  We are not opposed to the idea that the self-employed, like the PAYE workers should be put on a current year basis.  If everyone paid tax on a current year basis this would be a significant contribution to tax equity.  Our objection to this retention tax derives from the fact that it makes no distinction between legitimate taxpayers, of which there are many, and tax dodgers.  It is also a tax on turnover, as the Leader of the Progressive Democrats pointed out on budget night, and not a tax on income or profit.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this tax is not particularly objectionable in the case of, say, a sole trader without many overheads.  In the case of a barrister, his turnover can be almost equated with income, if one ignores for the moment allowable items such as books, telephones and so on, but it is very different for the large accountant's, architect's or engineer's office, or even smaller ones, with huge overheads, because the net margin of profit in such a case might often be as low as 5 per cent. The withholding tax in that type of case would be a tax on turnover.  That is why the tax is particularly objectionable and has caused major concern to many smaller companies.  There have been threats of layoffs in some companies. Protective notice has been issued and I fear that this tax, if implemented in the way in which the Minister has proposed, will lead to a number of layoffs and produce the opposite effect to that which the Minister intends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> The withholding tax is defective in many ways.  We have yet to see how it will apply to partnerships, for example. If 35 per cent is paid at source on professional fees for State work, how will this affect the individual tax liability of each partner?  The Minister may say this will be sorted out in time by the Revenue Commissioners but part of the reasons for the tax system being so unfair is that the Revenue Commissioners have too much power and discretion.  It is well known that they operate concessions or discretionary codes of practice for certain types of taxpayers, as witnessed by the recent VAT write off.  This is often not only illegal but unfair because similarly placed taxpayers are not treated equally. We also feel that, if a body such as the Revenue Commissioners are given a blank cheque by this House, the tendency to overdraw and to abuse this power will often be irresistible.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from anything else, the hardship clauses which provide for interim rebates are extremely restrictive. They do not, for example, apply to firms not receiving more than 50 per cent of their income from the State sector or to those which have a current dispute with the Revenue Commissioners.  I call on the Minister for Finance to propose amendments to the withholding tax in the Finance Bill to cover a widening of the ground for the interim rebate, the introduction of a tax clearance system placed on a proper statutory footing instead of the informal administrative practice which it now is and to exempt firms currently up to date with their payments from the retention tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also introduce amendments looking for strict time limits for repayments of tax withheld, the payment of interest to the taxpayer where these limits are exceeded and clarification of the operation of this tax as far as it affects the individual members in a partnership. I warn the Minister that the tax may have some unwelcome effects as many firms will refuse to do business with the State on these terms unless they are <Col N="2004" /> paid in advance, or perhaps they will charge extra because of the cost of this tax.  One must be doubtful as to whether the tax will raise the revenue which the Minister says it will.  We will be on our guard in case any slippage from the strict budgetary targets which the Minister correctly set in his budget speech occurs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the budget and I hope the Government will stick to their main financial targets, otherwise the country, politically and economically, will be in very serious trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Opposition speakers over the past number of weeks, it has become increasingly apparent that they are attempting to judge the Government after only a few short months in office.  They have ignored the fact that over a period of more than four years the Coalition failed the people and left the country in its present state.</P>
      <P>It is not the first crisis which a Fianna Fáil Government have had to face or the first one which they have had to solve. The Government are trying to restore confidence to the people and to put public finances in order.  I come from a part of the country where the recession began long before it happened nationally. Migration and emigration escalated in south Kerry at an alarming rate over the past four years and, as sure as night follows day, south Kerry and the west said goodbye to their youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the situation is any better in other parts of the country but my area had already suffered enough. South west Kerry declined in population by over 3,000 people since 1951 and although the population in most other parts of the county and country increased throughout the seventies, south west Kerry continued to lose its population. The seventies was a period of resurgence in rural population numbers generally but only four of the south west Kerry district electoral divisions managed to show an increase in this time.  By 1980 the population of south west Kerry had fallen to 7,317 persons.  Births in the region for 1970-80 were 1,204 but deaths totalled <Col N="2005" /> 1,269.  This alarming drop in population has not stabilised.</P>
    <P>I clearly recall that the people of south west Kerry did not look hopelessly at their predicament.  They formed organisations and met Deputy Spring and Deputy Dukes but they might as well have gone to see Genghis Khan for all the notice that was taken of them.  When political decisions are made, very often the weaker sections of the community suffer.  In the past four years I can safely say that even if it was not a cake which was being divided, the crumbs fell very unevenly.  The budget is an attempt to correct public finances and, while times are extremely difficult, it is a foundation stone on which we can build a sound economy, give hope to our people and work to our youth.</P>
    <P>There are opportunities and possibilities all around us as was evidenced by the Minister Deputy Wilson's recent announcement on tourism.  I greatly welcome his initiatives and I heartily congratulate him.  I know a man living in Killarney who, in co-operation with CIE, attracted hundreds of visitors to south Kerry by offering a weekend with free travel, entertainment and bed and breakfast for £39.  Everybody said it could not be done but it was done.  In the context of tourism, other possibilities have either been ignored or forgotten.  There is a need for a new approach, a new vision, more innovation and a discarding or modification of old moulds and practices and tired policies which have failed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown that he is willing to take a fresh look at the problem and to adopt a new approach.  In this context, I welcome the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill which is a clear indication of the Government's intention to take our national heritage more seriously.  It is obvious, throughout the length and breadth of the country, that this aspect of tourism has been ignored. I should like to give a few examples in this regard.</P>
    <P>Daniel O'Connell is perhaps the most famous Irishman of all.  He is a prominent figure in the pages of all the important works on European history.  The ruins of <Col N="2006" /> his birthplace stand conspicuously to the east of Caherciveen, County Kerry.  A small plaque tells one that this is where he was born but the site is on a dangerous bend so that even if one did happen to see the little sign one could not stop. There is no place to park nearby.  In the townland of Castlecove on the Ring of Kerry there stands one of Europe's oldest ring forts, Staigue Fort.  The road into it, until recently, was inaccessible.  The fort of Leaca na Buaille stands on the north side of the town of Caherciveen.  There is no place to park there and there is only a mud path leading into it.  There is no sign which tells one that it is even there; yet it is ancient and is of tremendous archaeological and historical importance. There is a ring fort of equal importance to the west of the village of Waterville and there is not even a signpost to tell one where it is.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this is the position all over the country.  It would not happen in Cyprus, in Greece or in any developed country.  These are national treasures of immense importance, these are natural resources which have been thrown to the wind like confetti.  The National Monuments Bill has created an awareness and has begun a process whereby I hope Ireland will become one of Europe's most important archaeological countries.</P>
    <P>We are forever striving to march to the forefront of the tourism industry but it cannot be done unless we commence to take our assets seriously and promote them in a new, imaginative and vibrant way.  Have Bord Fáilte ever seriously attempted to exploit the resources such as those I have mentioned?  Are they advertising on the sidewalks of New York sites of immense historical and archaeological importance, such as O'Connell's birthplace, are they marketing sites of major archaeological importance, such as the Staigue Fort, on the streets of London?  If they are, have they ever even once made an approach to the Government in relation to these important places?  Is their marketing system all that it might be?  I do not believe that it is.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a growth industry with the potential to create thousands of jobs. <Col N="2007" /> Stagnancy and a lack of aggression in the marketplace will be a moral blow to the tourism industry.  I know that the Minister who has shown such tremendous imagination will seek a new aggressive and progressive approach at this crucial time in the history of our little country. He has started the process and those involved in the industry have shown they are willing to back him.  Bord Fáilte must follow his lead.  At present, about 40,000 people are directly employed in tourism while a further 40,000 are indirectly employed.  It is predicted that tourism will grow by 93 per cent between 1985 and 1995.  The intensive growth plan, details of which were announced by the Minister, should help to increase our share of the market and halt the slide of recent years.  We are beginning to shift away from administration towards promotion even if it does and will mean that certain people will have to be brought, dragging and howling, into the marketplace and out of their swivel chairs where phone calls are made but no tickets are sold.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry must rank as the Cinderella of all our industries.  In other countries there are six jobs onshore for every one at sea.  Primary processing in this country creates only about 1.25 jobs on land for every one at sea.  It is clear there must be further processing in consumer products.  I do not think you can purchase an Irish processed fishfinger or cod cake for your tea.  Therefore, we have to import products such as Captain Birds Eye and John West and all the rest. I would lay any money that the Arabs, for example, would not buy any sand from us.  Let us be honest about it.  We export our fish for a quick buck to create foreign jobs in foreign lands to benefit foreign economies while our own is falling down around our ears.  It would make the barnacles on the rocks in Valentia harbour cry.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure of the industry is in a shambles.  The most important harbours between Castletownbere and Galway are Valentia and Dingle harbours.  The pier in Valentia harbour is falling into the sea <Col N="2008" /> and the harbour at Dingle is silted up. I do not think that that would happen anywhere else.  The Irish fleet was built and designed for the most part ten years ago for a type of fishing which is becoming obsolete.  Six years ago there were 15 boatyards in this country employing between 600 and 700 highly skilled operatives. Today, there are three and only one of these is building boats.  That is in Kerry and building on spec.  Meanwhile in the British yards business is booming.</P>
    <P>In fairness, attempts have been made to improve the position here but there appears to be no overall plan to modernise. Meanwhile, the Spaniards, the French and the Danes are raping our waters to benefit their own economies. There are complaints that some boats are interfering with the equipment of Irish fishermen at sea, stifling their attempts to diversify.  It reminds me of a man who comes into a restaurant uninvited, who puts on a meal for himself, eats it and goes away without washing up.  In Valentia harbour there were more people working in the fishing industry in the forties than there are today.  Why is that? What has happened and who is to blame?</P>
    <P>There must be a new look at the situation. We must develop and diversify in order to meet changing demands and circumstances.  We have 25 per cent of EC fisheries but our quota is only 4.6 per cent.  Every possible effort must be made to increase this quota.  Catch patterns in the non-quota species must be built up now to ensure that a pattern of fishing activity is established in advance of any new quota restrictions which may be imposed at a later date, if the EC introduce quotas for these species.</P>
    <P>The need to accelerate the development of the aquaculture sector is now a matter of some urgency.  There are hundreds of applications and these must be advanced so that that development can get underway.  Above all, there must be fresh initiatives, new ideas, less bureaucracy and more imagination.  The industry has been ignored for years &mdash; perhaps, a better word would be blackguarded &mdash; and that is a great tragedy when one considers the huge employment potential <Col N="2009" /> in the catching of fish, in aquaculture and processing sectors of the industry and in its allied, associated, related and ancillary industries.  Unless industries such as the fishing industry are treated seriously, we cannot hope to provide employment for our young people and they will continue to go away in the boats which should be fishing in order to provide employment on land and at sea.</P>
    <P>Another resource with tremendous potential is forestry.  There is a ready market available for our trees.  This country has ideal climatic conditions for the growth of trees.  Again, we must adopt a new aggressive approach to utilise this industry for the benefit of our people and economy instead of others.  However, what is happening in the forestry industry is the same as that which is happening in the fishing industry; the primary product is exported creating jobs in foreign lands to benefit foreign economies and foreign peoples.  In the contest of the recession that approach is no longer good enough. That approach has to change.  The Minister for Tourism, Deputy Wilson, has led the way.  He has shown he is prepared to take new initiatives in relation to the tourism industry.  I am completely confident that other Ministers will follow that lead in relation to our other natural resources in order to create jobs for our people in these hard times.</P>
    <P>I believe, and have always believed, that there are civil servants, not all but some, in responsible positions in our public sector who lack imagination and have about as much aggression and vision as Winnie the Pooh.  Some of these people do not want change and that is no longer good enough &mdash; not now.  Some of these people must carry a major share of the blame for the chaotic state of the resources which God gave us in order to survive.  A major initiative must be undertaken in the horticultural industry. It is nothing short of laughable to see so many foreign vegetables being sold in our shops and supermarkets.  Why is this?  No economy or people can hope to be vibrant <Col N="2010" /> when they do not even sow their own land.</P>
    <P>There is a new kind of famine sweeping the land &mdash; it is the lack of native grown vegetables and potatoes.  The Dutch, the Cypriots and the rest are only too willing to help us out at a price.  One of the saddest statements made last year was when a manager of a leading hotel here said he could not get a constant supply of native vegetables and was therefore left with no alternative but to buy them from abroad.  At the same time, land was and is lying idle all over the country.  We should not be importing vegetables; we should be exporting them.  We should be supplying.  Leadership is required in this area also.  I have no doubt that this leadership will be forthcoming.  If the House will excuse the pun, what is needed for the horticulture industry is a carrot, not a stick.</P>
    <P>I read with a certain amount of amusement in the newspapers some weeks ago that Deputy Spring went to Lisbon to some conference or other and said there that we were dismantling some of our social services.  Of course, it could have been a lot worse.  Deputy Mac Giolla could have gone, but instead it was Deputy Spring.  That kind of advertising abroad is of no assistance to this country. It serves to show the country in a very poor light.  Public representatives and people in important positions should be very loth to criticise this country when they go on foreign trips.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention today the position in relation to handicapped people. When the public finances are sorted out &mdash; and sorted out they will be &mdash; it is crucially important that the Government will ensure sheltered employment for our handicapped people.  They do not have a voice of their own.  The Rehabilitation Institute of Ireland have done wonderful work for them over the years.  They have shown what can be done.  Indeed, that organisation are to be greatly congratulated on their outstanding contribution to these people over the years. Developed countries should always provide sheltered employment for their handicapped people because in a civilised <Col N="2011" /> and developed society it is right that they should have equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is fair to congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, on his statement here this afternoon that he hoped for a decent reduction in building society rates.  This will be a tremendous boost to our construction industry and it is proof, if proof were needed, that advances are being made by the Government in recessionary and difficult times. It is extremely important that mortgage rates and interest rates generally should come down.  This is beginning to happen after a few short months.  The last Government could not make any decisions because they were like the cart pulling away from the horse.  Neither seemed to know which way the other was going.  Because Fianna Fáil have given back stability and hope to our people and because they are seen to be making a genuine effort, they are appreciated by the people.</P>
    <P>No Government should be judged by the major Opposition party or any other Opposition party or after a few months in office.  Moreover, when one considers the situation brought about in four years by the exact same critics, that kind of hypocrisy is no longer tolerated by the people. It is no longer accepted because everybody knows this Government are the only Government who can succeed.  If they should fail, no other Government coming after them will succeed.  At this crucial time I ask certain Opposition Members to cut out the fooling, and carping criticisms and the nonsense when they know what they did to our people during four terrible years.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that pivotal to Government policy at this time and in the future must be the welfare of our young people.  The young are aware that tired policies and tired practices which have failed and have been seen to fail will not suffice any longer.  It is crucially important that young people should not be forced on to emigration boats or to walk up and down the streets of Camden Town or Kilburn High Road looking for work at a time when this country exports <Col N="2012" /> its own God given resources.  If we can stop that and achieve that much, more will have been achieved in a short time than was achieved in four years of Coalition Government.  I can safely say that there is hope among our young people now.  We must do everything possible to find them work at home.  Young people are no longer willing to accept statements from pious Opposition politicians who in recent months were acting the donkey in the House, who thought they were race horses, and were not willing to accept that the people suffered enough in the past four years.  The Government's policies will bring growth back into the economy and will help our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the budget debate. The budget was the most unique one we have had in that no budget before started out with such a degree of consensus.  The strange thing about that consensus in relation to the overriding need for tough policies is that unanimity quickly dissipates as soon as the measures proposed impinge on any interest group or area of activity.  It is very much a question of, not me Lord and, certainly, not now.  It is accepted that it is very hard to get unanimity or consensus on economic issues and as one listens to experts, pundits and commentators projecting and prognosticating in the media one can well sympathise with the longing of the American President who said, &ldquo;Oh for a one-handed economist&rdquo;.  In fairness to the Government one must admit that the timespan for variation or change or the room for amendment between the coming to power of the Government and the formulation and presentation of the budget afforded them very little opportunity to do things imaginatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supposed to have had a tough budget, the first major step towards a foundation for economic recovery but if one looks at the figures can one say that it will solve our problems, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that there is a plan, proposal or projection that will begin a scheme of operation that will in five or ten years time mean that we have <Col N="2013" /> met definite targets?  Is there anything to indicate that within a number of years we will have got ourselves out of the economic morass we are in?  In other words, will we have eliminated our dependence on foreign borrowing?  Will we have done something substantial about our unemployment problem?  Will we have eliminated budget deficiting?</P>
    <P>Deputy Power some weeks ago ridiculed Deputy Kenny for the serious way he treated this debate.  Deputy Power said that the position we now find ourselves in was nothing other than a storm in a teacup.  How can any Member make such an analysis of our current economic position?  We have a current deficit and borrowing requirement of £1,200 million and £2,028 million respectively.  These are frightening figures and we must face realistically the problem created by them rather than dismissing it in a derisory fashion.  One must add to those figures our accumulated national debt.  One wonders what the founders of the State would say about the sorry mess their country is in.  Our nation is wallowing in the gloom of our own inability to extricate ourselves from our self-created problems. We are not able to extricate ourselves from the grasp of the foreign concerns to whom we owe £24 million. The number unemployed is 250,000 and yet there is a feebleness to resolve to work out a national consensus that will enable self-sacrificing and self-conditioning to take place to lift us out of this mess and bring about our own salvation.</P>
    <P>The significant achievements of the previous Government have been played down and ridiucled by Government speakers and the media.  I should like to point to a number of significant successes of that administration.  We had the historic achievement of the New Ireland Forum, the bringing together of the constitutional Nationalist parties in the North and the South.  From that emerged the Anglo-Irish Agreement which gave the first tangible hope to the Nationalist community in the North.  Thankfully, that agreement is being built on by the present Government.  We also had a <Col N="2014" /> reasonably successful six months presidency of the EC.  During that time the Leader of our party, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, played a major role in the admission of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  There were considerable achievements on the economic front.  In our four years in Government &mdash; Deputy O'Donoghue did not acknowledge this &mdash; we succeeded in reducing inflation from 22 per cent to 3 per cent and getting interest rates on local authority house loans down from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent.  We succeeded in getting mortgage rates down to an all time low.  I have no doubt, as the Minister has stated, that the present rate is temporary and will be reduced within a short time.  We succeeded for four years in succession, and for the first time since the end of the Second World War, in having a surplus in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Those achievements were momentous, historic and significant.  In my view history will show that the principal achievement of the last Government was that they were the first administration that sobered the nation up, that brought people to a sense of reality, made them face up to their responsibilities and brought about national conditioning that tough action needed to be taken and that the days of the gravy train were over, That conditioning process has only begun and, judging by the hostile reaction from the various sectors that have been hit by the budget, we have a long way to go.  I do not think we can go back to the profligacy of the past and the ridiculous method of managing.  We cannot return to the level of borrowing, to the level of economic luxury we could not afford.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the budget which is to curb public spending, scale down our dependence on foreign borrowing and reduce interest rates, but one must ask if the budget has created even one spark to ignite the engine that will get the necessary propulsion for growth.  Our worst fears in regard to that are borne out by today's three daily newspapers which carry the prediction in banner headlines, of the Central Bank that the growth rate this year will be a <Col N="2015" /> mere one half of 1 per cent.  That will not be sufficient to achieve the targets set by the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
    <P>All one has to do is look at the building sector, the sector which traditionally has been a high density job area.  It has been ravaged by unemployment.  It is an area crying out for resuscitation, an area fuelled by the most expensive one liner at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis in which it was promised that £200 million would be pumped into the industry to revive it.</P>
    <P>What has happened?  A retrospective guillotine has been applied to the most imaginative scheme introduced in this House for a long period, the house improvement grant scheme.  People who yearned to carry out minor and major fabric works on their houses or to erect much needed extensions because of overcrowding were, without prior notice, prevented from doing so by the removal of the grant scheme.  This was a very imaginative scheme which was managing to generate wealth in the economy.  This scheme gave the lower and middle income groups the chance to carry out much needed repairs.  It also coaxed tradesmen out of the black economy in the legitimate expectation that they could expect the scheme to be in operation for a period of time.  Those people who were coaxed out of the black economy now find themselves high and dry and are emigrating to Britain.  They are disappointed and dismayed.</P>
    <P>People in the building and construction industry who traditionally have been the friends of Fianna Fáil both in Government and in Opposition are looking askance at the proposals being put forward. The scheme was costing money but surely between VAT on materials, additional income tax on wages, PRSI, added spending power and so on, this money was being laundered and recycled at an increasing rate so that within a matter of weeks the money spent on the scheme was finding its way back into the economy. I am disappointed that this grant has been terminated and I, too, strongly recommend that the Minister should re-examine this and look at the economic <Col N="2016" /> merits of what was in hand.  If it is within his financial capability he should have the scheme reintroduced.  I appeal especially on behalf of the people whose files were thrown in the backs of inspector's cars for weeks and months and were never inspected because people genuinely believed that this scheme would go on for two or three years.</P>
    <P>Our history of deprivation is perhaps one of the main reasons Irish people see as their greatest expression of independence the ownership of their homes. If ever a scheme brought this dream to tangible reality, it was surely the special tenant grant scheme which enabled local authority tenants of two years duration to avail of a £5,000 grant to purchase their own houses.  This scheme enabled people in the low income groups to own their own homes as it was coupled with the £2,000 new house grant, the £3,000 mortgage subisdy and a lucrative SDA loan of £21,000 over 30 years at 10 per cent.  This scheme was terminated without notice.  It was an imaginative scheme that was fuelling the construction industry which was about to take off before it received the sudden crude pinprick which has deflated it to its present state of demoralisation.  The Minister would be well advised to have another look at it. If he has another look, the scale of logic will tilt dramatically down on the side of the re-introduction of ths scheme.</P>
    <P>I never cease to marvel at the barrenness of imagination of the people who set down guidelines for schemes, guidelines which become sacred cows and which become so rigid and inflexible that no amount of pressure will bring about the necessary flexibility to improve the situation. The current maximum floor area to qualify for a new house grant is 1,346 square feet.  If one has a house with that floor area it qualifies for a £2,000 new house grant and, before the Minister rudely intervened, it qualified for a £3,000 mortgage subsidy but if the floor area is even one square inch bigger, one gets nothing. Apart from the principle of introducing grants for larger houses in order to generate more activity, in that that more materials will be bought and more VAT <Col N="2017" /> will be paid and it will take longer to build a house, it is ridiculous to set down rigid criteria for all houses whether they are to accommodate one person, two persons or a family of 12 persons.  It is time to re-examine the rigidity imposed on the scheme with a view to having some measure of relationship between the size of the family and the statutory minimum floor area.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in dealing with a budget is that when a budget is presented it is presented in multi-digit millions and billions of pound figures.  Everything is seen globally.  Those millions are made up of minute figures from within various segments of Departments either at national or local level.  If the finances of any of the Departments were examined and analysed closely I have no doubt that they could be trimmed effectively without imposing the undue hardship about which people are objecting at present.  The time for rationalisation is long overdue and no area cries out for rationalisation more than the area of housing.  I am thrilled that the Taoiseach saw fit to appoint from my county for the first time ever, a Minister for the Environment.  I have heard the Minister, Deputy Flynn, wax lyrically as a member of Mayo County Council on the various measures he would implement when and if he were ever Minister for the Environment. A man who claims to have a monopoly on all things from the moral propriety of the nation to the leaks in the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> surely should have the necessary vision to introduce measures which would rationalise the housing industry once and for all.  If somebody wants to build a house in the Minister's constituency he must apply to Mayo County Council for planning permission and an engineer will come from the planning department at a cost of X number of pence per mile to visit the site.  The applicant then applies for an SDA loan and another engineer arrives to see the site and the proposal.  When the house is at wall-plate level another engineer arrives and inspects it.  When the work is completed a third engineer arrives to examine it so there will already have been <Col N="2018" /> four visits made by three different engineers all of whom have been paid to do the same job.  At this stage the applicant applies for a new house grant.  His application goes to the Department of the Environment and an engineer is dispatched from the Dublin office to examine the proposal and ensure that the work is up to standard and meets the necessary criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 May last, I announced &ldquo;Ireland in '87&rdquo;&mdash; a new comprehensive programme to boost tourism into the country in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major part of the programme includes measures aimed at providing more extensive and competitive access transport to Ireland.  Lower fares than 1986 are now available on all the major sea and air routes into the country.  These reductions, many of which are of the order of 15 to 20 per cent should stimulate substantial tourism growth from all markets to Ireland this year.  For example, air fares from London to Dublin are available from UK£57 and to Cork and Shannon from UK£67.  In the case of UK provincial cities, air fares are available from UK£58 to Dublin and from UK£78 to Shannon and Cork.  In the case of air fares from the US, Aer Lingus Greensaver Summer return fares of $449 New York/Shannon are being made available for travel on Wednesdays as well as Tuesdays, thus doubling their availability. These fares, which will be available until <Col N="2019" /> 30 September next, are $200 lower than the normal peak levels.  In addition, Aer Lingus are offering a special $399 fare available on the same days for US visitors spending a minimum of three weeks in Ireland.  Fares from the continent offer similarly attractive rates.  In the case of sea routes competitive fares are also on offer.  For example, a coach/ship journey for a foot passenger is available at UK£29 return in the shoulder period from London to Dublin.</P>

      <P>We all welcome the reduced air fares which I am sure will prove a tremendous stimulus to the industry.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 23 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the legislative base for the licensing of passenger road services operated by private bus operators.</P>
      <P>Until recently the Garda were the sole enforcement authority for the purposes of the 1932 Act.  However, in September, 1986, nine transport officers were appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act, 1986 for the purpose of enforcing, <i>inter alia,</i> the legislation relating to bus passenger licensing.  The transport officers supplement enforcement by the Garda of the relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>A review of the Road Transport Act, 1932 is now nearing completion.  The outcome of that study will be the basis for policy decisions for the future and I expect to reach conclusions in the matter in the near future.  Obviously, I cannot say at this stage what those conclusions will be.  However, I can say that the study covers such questions as the scope for greater involvement of private operators in the provision of licensed services, the role of CIE and the level of penalties prescribed in the 1932 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about unlicensed operators.  Can the Minister say he is satisfied with the level of penalties for unlicensed private bus operators? Are the transport officers in his Department the body who impose the penalties?  In a reply some time ago the previous Minister spoke about interdepartmental difficulties and said that an interdepartmental working party was engaged on this matter.  Is the Minister now responsible for the enforcement of penalties on unlicensed operators?  Is he satisfied with the level of penalties that can be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, one of the areas of study at present is the level of penalties prescribed in the 1932 <Col N="2022" /> Act.  As the House realises, penalties laid down as long ago as 1932 must be unrealistic in 1987.  The Garda are the enforcement authority but not the sole one because transport officers now supplement the actions of the Garda in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply to the original question that he was hoping for greater involvement between the private bus companies and CIE.  Is he indicating that perhaps we will see deregulation in the area of the bus services and the advent of the private bus companies working on the various routes in conjunction with CIE?  Is that what he means by scope for greater involvement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy heard, I mean that the review is taking place and that that is one of the areas which is being covered by the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very poor working conditions of the people employed by the bus operators in many cases?  Does he intend to bring in regulations to ensure there are proper working conditions for them and safety for passengers?  I am referring particularly to what could loosely be described as cowboy operators in the private sector who are ripping off CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

Can he reply to that question?  Has he a reply regarding the action or non-action in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>In January 1987 and again twice in February 1987 my Department requested Southern Air Transport by telex to comment on reports in the Irish media that they had been involved in the shipment of arms from the United States to Iran through Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of any response or acknowledgement, other than the &ldquo;answer back&rdquo; of the company, and in view of Press reports that the company <Col N="2025" /> had denied receipt of any communication, the Irish Embassy in Washington at our request made direct contact with Southern Air Transport, who denied on 1 May 1987 that any of their flights through Shannon Airport had ever carried any armaments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that on 5 March 1987 a Department of Communications spokesperson described as a lie the denial by Southern Air Transport that inquiries had been made?  Will the Minister inform the US through their embassy that he considers it an unacceptable abuse by a nation with whom we have friendly relations to use our sovereign territory for such activity, if it occurred?  Would he regard such action as an insult to the Irish people in view of our neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Deputy for the date he gave?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, contact was made from my Department by telex but the company denied having had any communication from my Department. That caused my Department to get in touch with the Irish Embassy in Washington and the denial came from there.  With regard to the rest of the Deputy's question, my Department and, of course, the Government regard it as very important that the laws of this country be observed by people using our airports. Article 6 of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, S.I. No. 224 of 1973, prohibits the conveyance of munitions of war on aircraft. Article 5 of the same Order provides for the Minister by direction to grant exemptions to the provisions of Article 6.  Such exemptions are normally sought and granted in respect of the importation or exportation of arms for the Defence Forces or the Garda or where a bodyguard accompanying a visiting dignitary would carry a hand gun.  However, I want <Col N="2026" /> to re-emphasise what I have said, that the Department and the Government would regard it as a very serious matter if munitions of any kind contrary to all our laws were landed even in transit at any of our airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware from very widespread reports that this was a covert action.  What action are the Government taking now to ensure that transport of arms in such covert action, so covert that the President of the US seemingly was not aware of it, does not take place, that the law is not broken and that, particularly in view of their record, this company, Southern Air Transport, who were wholly owned by the CIA up to 1970 and used primarily by the US Government for the shipment of arms to fight régimes and legitimate Governments including the Nicaraguan Government should be prohibited from the use of Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the basis on <Col N="2028" /> which the CIE subsidy for 1987 was determined; the increase in unit costs assumed; the rate of increase in fares assumed in deciding the estimate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1984 the general Exchequer subvention payable to CIE has been based on a formula which determines the subvention as 50 per cent of CIE revenue or 33? per cent of expenditure, whichever is the lesser.  At the same time there was imposed on CIE a requirement to reduce the board's expenditure by 2½ per cent in real terms annually between 1984 and 1988.  In late 1984 it was decided to extend the 2½ per cent reduction in expenditure for a further year to 1989 but, in the case of mainline rail expenditure, the reduction was increased to 3.7 per cent annually between 1985 and 1989.  The purpose of these arrangements was to reduce CIE dependence on the Exchequer while, at the same time, providing a firm basis for CIE financial planning.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the formula the CIE subvention has been based on 33? per cent of expenditure, a figure calculated on the basis of the board's 1983 expenditure, adjusted for inflation over the relevant years, and after allowing for the deductions required in respect of expenditure.  To date the formula has worked successfully.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the formula, the subvention for 1987 would amount to £98.421 million.  Because of the general financial stringency, the previous Government fixed the allocation at £96.421 million, a reduction of £2 million.  The Government, on coming into office, saw no alternative to adopting the figure of £96.421 million.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of that figure between the three subsidiary companies is as follows:</P>
      <P>Íarnrod Éireann, £74.671 million; Bus Átha Cliath, £17.250 million; Bus Éireann, £4.500 million.</P>
      <P>Unit costs and levels of fares are matters for consideration by CIE in preparing their budgets.</P>

      <P>Exchequer funds totalling £9,858,004 have been made available to Connaught Airport Development Co. Ltd. in respect of Connaught Airport, County Mayo or Horan International Airport as it is called in the question. The investment criteria outlined in the Department of Finance Circular 1/83 were not applied in this case as preliminary infrastructural works, including the acquisition of the site, began early in 1981.  By March 1983 the date the circular was issued, almost £7 million in Exchequer grants had been paid to the airport company.</P>

      <P>I understand that Deputy <Col N="2030" /> Noonan was not quite happy with the form of this question on the Order Paper, that he feels it differs somewhat from the question submitted.  What I want to know is: have the Government made any additional funds available for the airport in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the funding I have already mentioned being the total State commitment. The late Monsignor Horan himself added £3 million to that funding.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused here.  I asked a similar question with regard to B &amp; I and Sealink and the cartel arrangement between them, and the Minister said he had not any responsibility in that matter, that it was a matter for the companies themselves.  I cannot reconcile that comment with some of those he has just made.  Could we establish exactly what are his responsibilities in relation to the B &amp; I?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibilities are simple; it is a State-owned company.  The Deputy will realise that Sealink is a privately-owned company and, consequently, one in which I have no say with regard to whatever arrangements they may make, even those with a company wholly-owned by the State.  I cannot talk about Sealink.  It is a private company that takes its own business decisions and makes it own arrangements.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's comments in regard to Sealink but not in <Col N="2032" /> regard to the B &amp; I, a major partner in this deal.  Surely the Minister can comment on the B &amp; I end of this cartel agreement in regard to capacity sharing and price fixing?</P>

After the Zeebrugge disaster I got in touch immediately with all the ferry companies operating into and out of Ireland and asked for assurances with regard to safety.

      <P>I recently announced that I had granted approval in principle to Ryanair to commence scheduled services on the Cork and Shannon to Luton routes and on the Dublin to Manchester route with low unrestricted fares.  My decision was taken in the light of the need to stimulate inbound tourism.  The approval is, of course, subject to the agreement, which has been sought, of the UK authorities and to Ryanair satisfying the technical requirements of my Department. Ryanair hope to start service on these new routes next month.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering an application from Ryanair to operate services between Dublin and Beauvais-Tille, which is about 40 miles from Paris, and will make a decision in the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to Dublin-Amsterdam, the position is that in the light of Ryanair's association with London European Airways, which is expected to commence scheduled operations on the Luton-Amsterdam and Luton-Brussels routes later this month and which will link up with Ryanair services to Luton ex Ireland, the company have not renewed their application to operate services between Dublin and Amsterdam.  With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate, for incorporation in the Official Report, a table showing a comparison of the Ryanair proposed fares and the current unrestricted fares on the routes Cork-Luton, Shannon-Luton, Dublin-Manchester and Dublin-Paris, Beauvais-Tille.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's encouragement and the new air fares that will now operate.  They have been warranted for some time.  In the light of what happened on these air routes, will the Minister be prepared to examine, for instance, the Scandinavian, French and other continental air routes for the same reason?  It is obvious that we will be able to increase air traffic, particularly into this country, if we reduce air fares to realistic levels, as has happened on all the other air routes?

      <P>I will certainly study any proposals that are made.  The people in this business are fully aware of the potential in the various areas.  The only connection we have with Scandinavian Airways at present is that they run the restaurant or cafe facilities at Dublin Airport.

      <P>The question that arises in all our minds is why did it take so long for Aer Lingus to adopt this cheap air fare policy.  Why did we have to wait for Ryanair to create a climate of lower air fares which made it imperative for Aer Lingus to follow suit?  The air traveller to and from this country may feel with justification, that he has been unfairly mulcted over the years.  Would the Minister care to comment on that?</P>

They spend much money abroad and my objective is, as of now, to get as many of them as possible into the country and it is because of that I have concentrated on the access transport aspect.</P>

      <P>The previous Minister considered these routes and there was a bilateral agreement with the British authorities.

      <P>Yes, we have contacted the UK authorities and we do not expect any difficulties there.  The Dan-Air licence is still in operation.  They have a very attractive advertisement in today's paper and I asked an official of my Department to write to them and to ask them to advertise to the east of us so that we can get the benefit of travel east-west just as much as west-east.  They are offering inducements for travel west-east.</P>

      <P>The integration of tourism and transport policy functions with the formation of the Department of Tourism and Transport marked the first major step in this rationalisation process.  This is of major significance given the pivotal role of an efficient and competitive transport system in tourism development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Denis Lyons, has been appointed to chair the Inter-Departmental Tourism Policy Co-Ordination Committee in order to bring <Col N="2038" /> about an improved co-ordination of all public sector activities in the tourism field.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined that maximum cohesiveness is attained in implementing public sector programmes relating to tourism and to ensure that promotional and marketing resources are not wasted through duplication of functions or administrative overlapping.  It is my intention that clarification of the role of all State institutions, with an involvement in the development of tourism, will be an integral part of the five year plan for the industry which I am working on at present.</P>

      <P>Because of the cut in the Bord Fáilte allocation for 1987 made by the previous Government and reluctantly accepted by the current one, I regret that I am not in a position to introduce further incentives for domestic tourism at present.  However the domestic sector should benefit from elements in the crash programme for 1987 which I announced on 3 May and also from further initiatives which my Department have agreed with operators in the industry.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy and the House of details of measures agreed with these operators.</P>
      <P>The Town &amp; Country Homes Association and also Irish Farmhouse Holidays (Fáilte Tuaithe) are introducing a special offer of three nights' stay, bed and breakfast, for £27 and a 50 per cent reduction for children under 12 sharing.</P>
      <P>The Irish Caravan Council have recommended that all their members offer a 10 per cent reduction on direct overseas bookings for mobile homes/caravans and that pre-booked pitches and tents be given for four nights for the price of three.</P>
      <P>The Irish Boat Rental Association will give a 5 per cent discount on all direct overseas bookings and a 10 per cent discount to walk-in overseas visitors, that is, overseas visitors who come into any boat hire base in Ireland.  All these have been worked on by me during a brief period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restaurants Association of <Col N="2041" /> Ireland are launching a new initiative on the tourist menu scheme with a view to making it more widely available throughout the whole of the country.  This has been a feature of continental tourism for some time.  They are also launching a third tier at £12 and asking all their members to participate in this for the present tourist season.</P>
    <P>SFADCo are offering 15 per cent off any booking for banquets in two of their castles.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn will be delighted to hear that.</P>
    <P>The Car Rental Council of Ireland have recommended that with effect from 1 June 1987 all their members offer 10 per cent off their national tariff rate for hirings of seven days' duration or more.</P>
    <P>The Self-Catering Association will offer a 10 per cent discount off all overseas consumer bookings.</P>
    <P>CIE have decided that rail/road unlimited rambler tickets sold in the United States will be reduced by 25 per cent and their validity will be extended to 30 days. The new cost is $100.  They are also undertaking a special printing and distribution of 250,000 brochures for the United States, Britain and the continent, giving up-dated promotional offers.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my sincere thanks to these organisations &mdash; and this is not <i>pro forma</i> because I have found them very co-operative &mdash; for the initiatives they have taken to support the Government's drive for tourism growth in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said, people are not being encouraged to take their holidays at home.  Most of the answer dealt with visitors from abroad.  The Minister has admitted that he has made no change in policy since the previous Government were in power <Col N="2042" /> with regard to encouraging people to holiday in Ireland.  In a recent statement the Director General of Bord Fáilte indicated that at least 160,000 people are at this time making up their minds about where they are going on holidays.  What I have heard the Minister say today is very attractive for visitors from outside but there is very little on offer to encourage people to holiday at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Included in what I have read out are some benefits for the domestic as distinct from the overseas holidaymaker. I should also like to point out that in the package I announced already there are widespread inducements.  My Department and I are fully conscious of the importance of domestic tourism and, within the limits I mentioned at the beginning of my reply, we will promote it to the maximum possible in 1987 and in future years.  I strongly feel that we are exporting holidaymakers to the sun, which we cannot always guarantee here &mdash; to make an understatement &mdash; and now is the time to make a counter-attack to get people to holiday here.  This applies to the domestic market and also to countries who earn a lot of money from us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, purely in the interests of tourism, speak to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, in regard to the licensing of restaurants?  I am sure the Minister is aware that many areas have nothing to offer tourists apart from very good eating houses which are very important to the local economy. They are providing a necessary service to tourism and, therefore, the Minister for Justice should speed up the process as it has taken years to bring to fruition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that over 250,000 leaflets would be distributed abroad to advertise the incentives.  Does he agree that Bord Fáilte are promoting over heavily abroad while practically ignoring the home <Col N="2043" /> market in which there is much greater scope for them to mount promotional efforts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that domestic tourism is very important but I do not accept it is not being promoted.  I mentioned we had carried out research in regard to access fares and there was a far wider knowledge of the lowering of fares in Ireland than there was in foreign markets. As far as the Minister for Tourism is concerned, that was not a very pleasing thing to find out.  Therefore, I will not complain about any agency, CIE, Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte or any of the advertising agencies, if they try to make it known that there are reasonable access transport costs available and the pleasures we can offer to holidaymakers, not least in the Deputy's constituency.</P>

      <P>However, I am currently looking at all aspects of income and expenditure in the Tourism and Transport Vote to see how best to re-allocate funds to assist Bord Fáilte further in promoting the Government's crash tourism programme for 1987.  I expect to be able to give full details to the House during the Estimates Debates on the Tourism and Transport Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only see what the Minister has allocated to Bord Fáilte from the Book of Estimates.  However, we know their promotional budget has been slashed and much of the talk we have heard over the past few weeks about the great efforts being made in tourism have to be taken in conjunction with the fact that Bord Fáilte's promotional budget has been reduced by so much. How can the Minister justify the figure of 400,000 visitors to this country when he has reduced the promotional budget by £441,000 or 13 per cent, the budget for the home market by £264,000, a reduction of 38 per cent and that for North America which includes the United States and Canada by 28 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about these figures because when one thinks of what has been said about tourism over the past few weeks it is difficult to understand how the Minister can justify these figures. How can we expect 400,000 extra tourists to this country and yet see the promotional budget slashed in this way?  The development of holiday accommodation <Col N="2046" /> has been cut by 77 per cent in the Estimates and I cannot understand how the Minister can stand over that kind of reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh is the last person who should be puzzled about statistics in the Book of Estimates.  He knows quite well that from January to 19 February tourism was under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce. It was transferred on 19 February and the abridged version of the Book of Estimates, which was published in January, only gave the figures expended from 19 February to 31 December.  The amount allocated to Bord Fáilte when Deputy Bruton was the Minister in charge was not included in the outturn given in the Book.  A cut was also made in the 1987 Estimate.  From 19 February to 31 December tourism was under the aegis of the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  A sum of £2.395 million was allocated to Bord Fáilte under subhead D1 in the period 1 January to 18 February before the transfer which was not shown in the outturn.  That was the legacy which Deputy Kavanagh left to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The presentation of these figures in the abridged Estimates volume gives the impression that Bord Fáilte's 1987 allocation under subhead D1 was down only 4 per cent on the 1986 outturn. However, if you add &mdash; and you are entitled to do so &mdash; the £2.395 million, you get the 1986 outturn in respect of the board's current budget, namely, £24,020,000.  Effectively this means that the current allocation for 1987 is down by £3.293 million or almost 14 per cent on 1986 instead of the 4 per cent reduction shown in the abridged volume of Estimates for which Deputy Kavanagh was responsible.</P>

      <P>This Government fully recognise the potential for real growth in the tourism industry.  They have provided a timely reminder of their commitment to the industry with the speed with which they introduced their programme of incentives to boost tourism in 1987.</P>
      <P>One of the main priorities of Government will be to maximise the employment potential within the industry.  The recently announced programme represents a concerted drive by the Government, Bord Fáilte, the access transport carriers and other sectors of the industry to restore growth to tourism this year.  I expect that this programme will result in an increase of 400,000 in visitor numbers in 1987.  Tourism revenue accruing from this increase will result in the creation of more than 5,000 new jobs in the economy this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present working on a plan for <Col N="2049" /> the development of the industry over the next five years.  In formulating this plan, I will be taking cognisance of the Price Waterhouse consultancy study of all State expenditure on tourism as well as the study on Irish tourism commissioned by the Irish Hotels Federation which concluded that tourism revenue could be doubled within six to seven years, with the resultant creation of 40,000 new jobs. The Price Waterhouse study is expected to be finalised by the end of this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate I was making the case that the multi-million pound Estimates which are the preserve of each Government Department are often thrown to us in global multi-digit figures which bewilder people at first sight.  However, on closer examination it can be discovered that some of the Departments are top heavy and that many rational cost saving measures could be introduced.  Taken collectively they could have a considerable <Col N="2078" /> impact in terms of savings.  I made the point that in relation to a simple matter like the erection of a new house in County Mayo, the constituency of the Minister for the Environment, when a person applies for planning permission to build a new house, qualifies for an SDA loan and applies for a new house grant and mortgage subsidy, five different inspections by five different engineers must take place.  Those officials are all paid travelling expenses and they carry out the same work, checking up on standards and the work carried out.</P>
      <P>Surely it is time we rationalised grants. Surely that is an indication that we should devolve to local authorities the entire area of housing. If local authorities are deemed competent to undertake expenditure in regard to road works in their areas they are equally competent to deal with all work connected with housing.  A person who applies for a house improvement grant, or a new house grant, contacts the Department of the Environment but if he qualifies for an essential repair grant or a disabled person's reconstruction grant the application is made to the local authority.  There are numerous cases where people qualify for a grant from the local authority and from the Department of the Environment.  That strengthens the case I am making for rationalisation.  We look to the Minister, Deputy Flynn, a Member with vast experience at local authority level, to grasp this nettle and do the sensible thing.</P>

    <P>I notice with a certain amount of bewilderment that in the revised Estimate for the Department of the Environment there is a figure of £2,750,000, or an increase of 11 per cent, for travelling expenses for the staff of the Department of the Environment next year.  That increase is provided for although there is a reduction in and termination of certain grants.  It is difficult to comprehend how there can be such an increase in view of those developments.  I must point out that that figure does not include an amount for engineers, inspectors and officials employed by local authorities.  In the case of the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="2079" /> there is a provision of £3,835,000, or an increase of 16 per cent on the 1986 figure, for travelling expenses although, according to the budget, benefits paid by the Department will increase by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>A lot of rationalisation, sensible restructuring and reorganisation needs to be carried out in all Government Departments, local authorities and semi-State bodies.  That would go a long way towards reducing excessive and unnecessary expenditure.  If we are to give the economy the lift needed to achieve the growth anticipated by the Minister for Finance, we must create a sense of confidence among the business community.  I do not think optimism was ever at such a low ebb or pessimism so prevalent.  While in the US there is a certain amount of emphasis in relation to manufacturing industry, the new thrust which has managed to fuel growth in the economy has been the development of the services sector.  We have vast potential in the services sector.  This potential needs encouragement and that is why low interest loans and capital in the services sector are of paramount importance.  People in Government Departments will say that the services area should respond to manufacturing impetus.  Anything that helps to generate economic activity is good so we should take another look at the degree of funding in the service area.</P>
    <P>The universities as sources of research and development and of developmental skills are largely untapped.  The development facet of the universities in terms of their potential for the business community should be vigorously tapped and encouraged.  The people who come up with the ideas that eventually become viable should be capable of harnessing and deriving the benefit from their ideas. The level of post graduate study going on here exceeds or is on a par with that going on elsewhere and we should use that resource.</P>
    <P>According to the balance of payments figures for this year the amount of timber imported for 1986 almost hit the £600 million mark.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to our failure to harness and <Col N="2080" /> develop our natural resources.  Forestry is an area that should be developed.  Our forests are lying dormant, untapped and underutilised.  When one looks at the amount of money spent on drainage to bring into agricultural production land that was never suited for agriculture and when one looks at the fact that County Leitrim for instance is capable of producing more sitka, pine and spruce than the Scandinavian countries, one can say that we are sitting on a vast resource which is underutilised.  The previous Government in co-operation with the European Community introduced a capital scheme for private afforestation giving lucrative grants of 80 per cent to individuals to afforest their lands.  It has been recognised that while there is a high level of generosity in relation to the grant, one cannot induce people to hand over their land on a sale or a lease basis until they can be guaranteed an <i>ad hoc</i> income.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, that he proposes to introduce a scheme whereby farmers investing their land in afforestation are now being considered eligible to receive a certain amount of headage payment in the interim.  While I laud the suggestion as a move in the right direction, it is not adequate compensation for people who hand over their land and I would urge that a dignified system of afforestation including a guaranteed base income figure be given to people in order to break the back of this major obstacle that has thwarted our ambitions in this regard.  We are now very much into the silly season with regard to speculation about oil in the Celtic Sea but we are sitting on a forestry reserve with an enormous potential which is streets ahead of anything we can produce from the oil and mineral industry in the short term.  If the development of forestry is undertaken right away it will be a source of pride for future generations.  As I travel the roads of rural Ireland I see lying idle lands that are manifestly unsuitable for agriculture.  The Government should implement a land acquisition programme either compulsory or voluntary to acquire for afforestation land that is <Col N="2081" /> lying idle.  The Government might also look at the possibility of using for forestry purposes the 40,000 acres of land that now lies with the almost dormant Land Commission.  Forestry is underutilised just as is the food resource.  We should immediately put serious investment into forestry to generate riches in future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Tourism about the introduction of a low fares structure to encourage an increasing number of tourists to this country so that we can attract a number such as was attracted in the sixties prior to the northern troubles.  This is an excellent idea which in time will yield dividends.  The Minister unwittingly overlooked one aspect and that relates to charter travel to this country.  Last year chartered air travel accounted for 14,000 passengers from the US.  When our tourist industry was on the broad of its back, the chartered travel industry was one of the main components in generating income.  It had been able to do so because of block booking and advance booking and because they could offer fares $50 cheaper than the scheduled flights.  As a result of the measures introduced by the Minister the advantage has now been given to the scheduled flights and chartered flights are $50 more expensive than scheduled flights.  It is not in accordance with the principles of fair play that this aspect of the tourist industry which has generated such wealth should be overlooked. The Minister should look with sympathy at the people in the chartering business and try to introduce a form of subsidisation to cushion them from the people who are now queuing up looking for money back because now Aer Lingus can give them a flight $100 cheaper than they paid when they booked.  Something should be done to help the people in the charter business out of their unanticipated difficulty.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the point made by Deputy Deasy, our spokesman on tourism, that in a purposeful fashion we have to lure back the English tourist who was the backbone of the tourist industry here and who was generally recognised as being the biggest spender. <Col N="2082" /> The British tourist has the greatest degree of common interest with us but that tourist has been lost to us as a result of the unfortunate consequences of the northern troubles.  I share Deputy Deasy's reservations in relation to many of the Republican utterances which deter these people from coming here.  In the past week we saw a number of unfortunate examples of bad publicity emanating from here which would deter British people from looking in this direction with a view to holidays.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned that bad advertising abroad can do irreparable damage to our image and he mentioned some remarks allegedly made by Deputy Spring in Lisbon.  The fact that Clare County Council and a number of other local authorities last week passed votes of sympathy for the people who were killed in the ambush in the RUC barracks in the North will do irreparable damage and will only serve to dismantle the good work done by the various tourist boards for our general image abroad.  It also undermines the work done as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>We should avail of every opportunity to decry in the strongest possible terms any act of violence which brings discredit on us.  It is time we stopped being ambivalent. There is far too much blowing hot and cold about Republicanism and far too much is made of thugs and criminals masquerading as patriots who attack public houses or military barracks and mow people down in cold blood.  It is time we cleared the air and made a united, unambiguous, unequivocal stand in this area.</P>
    <P>Land tax has been a major bone of contention.  There is a high density of small farmers in the west.  Coming as I do from the west I unreservedly welcome this tax.  It does not entail any red tape or the filling out of forms.  It is a sensible tax.  People with less than 20 adjusted acres will never receive a letter from An Cigire Cánach because they will not have a taxable income.  These people will now receive a profile form but we have not been told how elaborate it will be.  I have never seen an innocuous tax form.  The <Col N="2083" /> argument put forward by the ICMSA is that people with a non-taxable income will be unable to retain all the necessary documentation because of the type of farming they are engaged in and will have to enlist the support of accountants at considerable expense to prove that their income is not subject to taxation.  From the point of view of cost saving, not to mention fair play, this is something which should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>The main slogan used by the Opposition, particularly in relation to the health services, was that health cuts hit the old, the sick and the handicapped. That is true.  I would be the first to agree that if any areas are administratively top heavy they are the health services and the health boards.  The health services were intended to be patient orientated. If ever an area was crying out for rationalisation it is this one.  However, the axe or the cudgel is not the blunt instrument to use.  It cannot be dismantled in one fell swoop.  Trimming and pruning are needed and, rather than the axe the scalpel should be used.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in the health services where expenditure cuts could be made.  I suggested recently, having failed to impress the previous Minister for Health and Social Welfare, the present administration or the health boards, that there was a lot of duplication in certain areas.  A person applied for small farmer's dole.  He was factually assessed in relation to his income.  His net income was arrived at by subtracting the expenses necessarily incurred in the running of his farm from his gross income. It was £62 per week.  About the same time the person applied to the Western Health Board for a medical card.  The system they use was the notional system where the number of livestock is rounded off and a theoretical sum is arrived at in relation to the person's income.  The person discovered that there was an almost 100 per cent discrepancy in the assessment of his means by the Western Health Board compared to that done by the Department of Health.  There are numerous such cases in every health <Col N="2084" /> board area but there is a proliferation of them in the Western Health Board area. If two officials using different systems arrived at a different conclusion, something is wrong.  We all know there are two ways of doing any sum &mdash; one way can be cross-checked with the other but the answer should be the same.  The bewilderment of a person who received two different assessments can be imagined.</P>
    <P>I brought this case to the Ombudsman who decided that the system being used was not in accordance with the principles of fair play and justice.  The answer is to have the same official carry out a means test and an assessment of the person's income.  I do not care if the officer is employed by the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare. We should come down in favour of one system or the other.  I would prefer the factual system.</P>
    <P>The modest prescription charge of £1 proposed by the previous administration was based on a fairly sound principle.  It was a modest charge and would have been collected by the chemist.  It had considerable advantages over the amendment brought in by the present administration. The £10 per day will prove to be uncollectable because we cannot turn people away from our hospitals or ask them to pay £10 in advance.  When they go home they will forget all about it.  It would have been within the capacity of everyone to pay a £1 prescription charge.</P>
    <P>Having witnessed street protests by the staff of the General Hospital in Castlebar last Monday night in relation to cutbacks and grim forebodings in relation to closures, I visited the hospital.  The male A block area is now a mixed area for males and females.  There were two nurses on night duty looking after 40 patients. There were chronically ill people, some of whom were receiving the last rites. Beds were in corridors and if you wanted to get to a patient at the other end of the ward you had to move a bed, a trolly or an apparatus for holding a drip.  Conditions were barbaric.</P>
    <P>Health board administrators put sensitive areas into the firing line in order <Col N="2085" /> to heighten the political dimension, but when the service is affected at this level it is time to cry halt.  An indepth investigation should be carried out into how the cuts should be applied.  The old, the sick and handicapped are the people affected.  I will be in Ballina tomorrow night to participate in another mass rally in relation to cutting down the number of beds in the district hospital which caters for a huge rural area stretching to Bangor Erris.</P>
    <P>I accept that cuts are necessary but it is important that they are targeted at the least sensitive areas and do not affect patient care.  While we are pledged to support the broad thrust of the budget, there is no obligation on us to back any measures which will damage the basic structure of the medical and health services. That is what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>We have frittered away or underexploited much of our natural resources. We have failed to realise our potential. We have an enormous capacity for growth.  We have some of the best land in Europe.  We have the smallest and best educated population.  A nation that can excel itself in so many fields as Ireland has excelled itself in the recent past can lift itself out of the morass, the doom and the gloom by facing realism and achieving a consensus across the board in relation to what has been done.  Any country that can produce a Bob Geldof, a U2, a Bono, a Marcus O'Sullivan, a Sean Kelly, a Stephen Roche, a Frank O'Mara and an Eamonn Coghlan can hold its head high and supersede and exceed the best in the world and excel in that area.  It can set a headline for politicians.  Let us get our act together, put the nation first and start co-operating in the common interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not realise that the reason for the present position is that the last Government overspent by £55 million in the last two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little surprised that the Deputy did not even mention Barry McGuigan in that list of world leaders. <Col N="2086" /> A number of budgets of various Governments have reflected the people's wishes rather than the needs of the situation. Even though the vast majority of the people in the general election supported parties preaching on the need for greater restraint in handling the public finances, when cuts as witnessed here today were being implemented many of them protested as if the cuts were unthinkable.  Significant cuts must be made and they must be made in the high spending Departments.  That is the simple logic that applies.  We cannot get away from that.  The boom of the sixties and the advantages of entering the EC in the early seventies left our sights aimed too high.  Our expectations also were too high, and that was our downfall.  The oil crisis plus the depression which followed have changed the scene and we have been too slow in admitting to the change and in taking the necessary corrective measures. In that regard the previous speaker mentioned realism.  Fianna Fáil in their term in Opposition examined the position and the areas where there was an opportunity for the development of our resources and they had many committees looking into it.  They set their course principally on the development of those resources.  In that there is a very substantial job creation element, and we should be able to reduce the national debt which doubled in the last four years.  That was the one sad aspect of those last four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the development of our resources, in the last few days we had a promising statement from my fellow constituent, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, on tourism which has a terrific potential for development. Many speakers have mentioned afforestation.  Another area which has been examined closely in the last four years is the marine, and the spin-off in jobs from the development of that could be massive.  Fruit and vegetable production has been mentioned in conjunction with processing of agricultural products and my county bears testimony to what can be done in the food production field.  Fianna Fáil have set their sights on such development and I have no <Col N="2087" /> doubt that they will realise their targets in that regard.</P>
    <P>None of us likes a cut that pinches us and it is human nature at all times to ask the other fellow to carry more of the load. The present mix of cuts and redundancies is unlikely to please many.  I would like to see some cuts eased and more interest placed on other aspects.  However, generally we must concede that the main thrust of the budget must be sustained even to make a beginning to getting our affairs in order.  If a business concern were in the position that this country finds itself in at present, its backers whether they be the banks or the company's share-holders, would have withdrawn support long ago and would have called a halt to the whole affair.  Borrowing must be got down to a reasonable level such as in the business world would be considered acceptable for the size of the operation and related to the ability of the country to fund.  The price we have to pay is cuts. While it would be good to think that such cuts can take place without a reduction in services, that is unrealistic as most of the fat has been eliminated in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Any member of a health board would be well aware of that in regard to any areas where cuts and deductions could be made.  There must have been fairly heavy overexpenditure in many of those areas when we see what could be taken away and still, for example, we in the North Eastern Health Board were able to pass a budget last Monday and we are satisfied that there will be no serious hurt or effect on the people of the four counties served by that health board.</P>
    <P>What can and should be done is to apply the funds available to the best effect so that the drop in services is minimised. It serves no useful purpose for any sector to act as if this is the end of the world, to expect other sectors to bear the cost and to leave a particular sector untouched.  The extreme language of some of the protesters serves no useful purose either.  It merely creates the impression that if enough noise is made the cuts will go away.  One trade union <Col N="2088" /> have instructed their members not to handle the £10 hospital charge.  I can only view that instruction as a most improper act by a union or anyone else.  It is outside a union's proper functions.  While I do not like this charge, it is part of a package of proposals to get our affairs in order and it was decided on by a properly elected Government.  It is not proper for a trade union to try to thwart the rightful decision of a Government.  I trust that saner councils will prevail and that that union will see the error of their ways.  For much too long the pressure groups have exercised so much pressure that they have created a really serious position for Governments, and when we have a Government now who are willing to face up to that in a responsible, positive way it is important that they get the maximum support.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the budget must be about right as indicated by the downward movement of interest rates and some return of funds previously moved out of the country.  It was regrettable that such a large amount of money was moved out during the last few years.  However, because of the confidence generated by firm action we have the downward trend of interest rates and the indication that the funds previously moved out are returning at present.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the building industry.  Like others, I was disappointed the budget could not have included more provisions to get the building industry moving again.  However, I believe reducing interest rates and increased confidence will help in this regard.  Somebody with whom I was closely associated all my political life, a Minister in many Fianna Fáil Governments, the late Paddy Smith of Cavan, always contended that the most important thing in any country was the creation of confidence.  I am hopeful such confidence will be restored.  The building industry may well find that the indirect effects of the budget may be more beneficial to them than the direct benefits for which they had previously hoped.</P>
    <P>Many of us may have been suspicious that the control of cross-Border trading would have the desired effect.  From a <Col N="2089" /> national point of view there is no doubt that the restrictions imposed on that trading were necessary.  While some towns, such as Clones and Belturbet in my constituency, may have gained little from these recent restrictions, nonetheless I am satisfied that that action had to be taken because of the gross distortion of trade caused by the huge differential in prices on both sides of the frontier. People in towns situated even 15 miles from the Border now believe that proper trading has been restored.  While we may all like to have goods and services available to us at the cheapest possible rate, at the end of the day we would agree that a business or trading structure built up in any area must be retained.  Such cross-border trade was placed in grave danger by the variation in prices in recent years. Of course the ideal solution to this problem would be to have prices harmonised on both sides of the Border.  It will take some time to achieve that aim but until then the Minister's action is justified. Indeed I would expect that a substantial case could be made to the EC for the retention of this restriction on cross-Border trading.</P>
    <P>The tax position has been mentioned by previous speakers.  One of the difficulties encountered in persuading people to accept the present high levels of taxation is the widespread feeling among taxpayers that the load is not being evenly or equitably distributed.  This lack of confidence in the fairness of the taxation system, or even evidence of the existence of a will to ensure such fairness, constitutes a major obstacle.  There must be a major effort undertaken to address this problem.  I suspect that addressing that lack of confidence in the taxation system is even more urgent than the reduction in taxation rates.  The recently published lists of settlements by the Revenue Commissioners with various people and concerns &mdash; while showing some action &mdash; made many people wonder how some large sums had been allowed accumulate to such an extent.  Then there was the claim, later denied, that tax bills or arrears in excess of five years were being dropped.  We must restore public confidence <Col N="2090" /> in the fairness and effectiveness of the taxation system.  That is one of our greatest challenges.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the proposals of the Minister for Tourism and Transport in regard to the tourist industry, one of our principal growth areas.  I was a member of the Council of Europe for a number of years when the significance of tourism worldwide was brought home to me.  I discovered that many countries had not anything more to offer by way of tourism, if not much less, than ourselves. The Minister's quick action in the introduction of these alleviation measures is to be commended.  My constituency offers massive potential for tourism development having some of the finest lakes and waterways in the country.  Indeed, it offers enormous potential for cross-Border development.  In our recent discussions with British MPs at Westminster it was amazing the emphasis they placed on the development of the North, the proposals they advanced, based mostly on tourism-related measures in the hope of attracting people there.  In my county we have fisheries, water sports, cruising and, built up in recent years, equestrain centres, a number of golf clubs, people's parks and so on.  I hope a substantial amount of money will be made available for such development from this international fund.  For example, it would not be sufficient that three-quarters of such funding would go North with the remaining one-quarter to the five counties on the southern side of the Border.  It would be important that there be the utmost co-operation between both sides, that some of the projects on which such money would be expended would be of a dual nature, which would transcend the frontier and embrace organisations, associations and communities on both sides. Such co-operation did take place in the expenditure of moneys from previous Border funds.</P>
    <P>Other speakers contended we should concentrate on British tourists.  I would have to agree they do constitute our immediate tourist market.  Especially in <Col N="2091" /> the English midlands there is a considerable number of people interested principally in fishing, a solid group who come here and spend a substantial amount of money.  They return annually to some areas in my constituency.  We talked about the cheap fuel promotional scheme, which is a very good idea in this respect.  Indeed, we talked about it in this House in the mid-seventies at the time the then Coalition Government hiked up the price of petrol.  I was Opposition spokesman on tourism at that time.  Such a cheap fuel scheme was one of our recommendations, the other being a reduction in the price of hotel accommodation and meals, in order to compete with the more aggressive foreign markets, with a diversion of extra resources into tourism generally.  There appears to be evidence that the hotels and other promoters have sufficient confidence in the schemes now proposed by the Minister to act on them.</P>
    <P>I listed earlier areas in which I saw potential development, such as tourism, afforestation and food processing.  As has been said by previous speakers, in the tourist industry the most important area for potential is that of afforestation. Bearing in mind the drumlin soil of Leitrim, part of County Cavan, with a smaller portion of Monaghan, tests have shown that these areas have the highest potential growth in afforestation, probably in Europe, where some of the land is of a very poor quality.  With so much surplus production within the EC, it should be remembered that timber is the one product of which member states have insufficient supplies and which will continue to be the position in future years.  It is estimated there will be a 32 per cent increase in the shortfall in world timber supplies between the years 2000 and 2025.</P>
    <P>There was mention earlier of the £600 million timber imports.  What annoys me is that a number of years ago a report was published on the manufacture and processing of timber and it stated that by the year 2000 we would be self-sufficient <Col N="2092" /> and in a position to export timber.  With the progress at present, strong action will have to be taken if we want to be in that position.  The United Kingdom import 90 per cent of their wood requirements at present and they will only supply one-tenth of their needs by the end of this century.  We should utilise our advantages &mdash; the soil and the climate.  We have an annual growth rate in spruce, conifers and pine trees of 15 cubic metres per hectare as against 11 cubic metres per hectare in the UK and 2 cubic metres per hectare in the rest of Europe.  That is an indication of the growth rate here.  We can no longer sit on the fence.  Marginal farmlands are an important part of the EC Commission's new proposal for agriculture. As I said in the House before, we will have to examine our usage of land generally.</P>
    <P>There was very poor take-up of the grants for private afforestation although I notice from recent reports that the position has improved greatly in the past year or so.  ACOT and the farm development offices should be involved in the promotion of afforestation because they have a lot to offer in that respect.  Continually we complain in the Cavan-Monaghan region about the lack of timber processing plants.  In the IDA report of 1982 it was indicated there was over-capacity in those areas for processing. There is no grant aid available but many of the processing plants were set up in areas where there was a lot of afforestation and there is a substantial amount of mature timber in those regions as a result of tree planting after the war years. That timber is being processed in South Fermanagh and is being returned to the South in plank form, and timber for pallets, for paling, posts and so on.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine the position and will consider making available grant aid for the processing debarking and drying of timber.  It is important to ensure that in the future the outflow of timber will not be as great from the areas I mentioned.  We are not getting value for money.  All that happens is that a number of people fell the timber and bring it to the roadway where it is loaded <Col N="2093" /> and brought to another area for processing.</P>
    <P>In the counties which I represent there is a great tradition in footwear manufacture. I put down a question recently to the Taoiseach asking him about the imports of footwear for 1986 and its percentage on the Irish market.  He said that imports of footwear were valued at £95.2 million in 1986 and that in terms of the footwear involved it was estimated that the import share of the domestic footwear market for that year was about 93 per cent.  That represents about £27 for every man, woman and child in this country. It is food for thought.  In Cavan and Monaghan there were more people employed in that line of manufacture after the war than in any other industry. Footwear manufacture was one of the main sources of employment in the fifties and sixties.  At that time there was a very adaptable labour force but most of them have now moved to other areas and many of the factories are now used as stores for imported footwear.</P>
    <P>We export between 90 per cent and 100 per cent of bovine hides.  When I came to the Dáil in 1973 there were about 100 people employed in tanneries in County Monaghan and they were some of the last tanneries to close.  That position should be remedied.  As I mentioned earlier, the Fianna Fáil Party have made a positive approach towards import substitution in regard to fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>Another item mentioned by a previous speaker was potatoes.  During the years we have imported millions of pounds worth of potatoes per year.  In a recent report by Henry W. Kehoe, a potato breeder at Oak Park Research Centre, there was a very interesting article on seed potatoes.  He said:</P>
    <P>Seed potatoes for export are one of the few agricultural commodities that can be expanded, provided we have a steady flow of new Irish-bred varieties. However, the area under seed potato production has declined from 6,500 hectares in 1964 to 3,300 hectares in 1983, while exports of seed potatoes have declined from 42,702 tonnes to <Col N="2094" /> 10,837 tonnes in the same period. Exports from Northern Ireland have consistently been much higher, and while they too have declined, they are still five times as great as from the Republic.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the Dáil I was involved in the seed potato export business. At that time and since then, people in the North with very good land did not concentrate on cereal growing, milk and beef production the same as we did in the Republic.  They retained their interest in and their share of the export market. That is regrettable for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>The Irish Potato Marketing Board are just ticking over because in commercial terms the tonnage of potatoes which they export does not justify their existence. They are highly subsidised and I hope they will be retained so that we can get back into potato production and, as this writer has said, avail of the market in that area.  Mr. Kehoe also stated:</P>
    <P>Several new seed export varieties bred at Oak Park are now available, for example, Cara Avondale and Red Cara.  In 1984-1985 Cara made up 88 per cent of seed exports while King Edward and Arran Banner had declined ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said it should be possible to reach the 1963 export figure of 53,000 tonnes within five or six years and that this would demand a greater commitment from all the agencies involved.  We have the agencies and I hope the best use will be made of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Kirk has substantial proposals for the development of fruit and vegetable growing.  In the past number of years I accompanied him on a number of visits to areas in the North and the South where potatoes, cabbages and tomatoes are grown under heat as well as various other crops, including apples grown in Kilkenny.  We returned from those visits with the impression that Irish farmers are in a position to compete with any of their competitors in that field.</P>
    <P>Since our joining the EC, farming has <Col N="2095" /> been divided into two sectors.  Farmers in the first sector have developed their holdings and specialised in certain lines of production, using modern technology. These farmers are in a position to compete with farmers in most EC countries. They are in a position to show reasonable profits and to enjoy reasonable standards of living.  Farmers in the second sector are confined mainly to the Connacht-Ulster region.  The gap between the two sectors is becoming wider as the years go by.  The Connacht-Ulster region is characterised by fragmented and uneconomic holdings.  Much of the land there is marginal.  Many farmers have inadequate cash to develop their farms and land usage is severely limited, limited to grazing or grass production.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the first sector can fend for themselves but if attention is not given to the later sector during the next few years we will be faced with serious problems. Fianna Fáil's policy on the resource development of agri-tourism, afforestation and fruit and vegetable production will help to pick up the slack in this sector.  The biggest knock farmers in the Connacht-Ulster region got was the curtailment in milk production.  Many of those farmers were in the process of developing their farms when the super-levy was introduced.  It had a very serious effect on them and it seems that this levy will continue for some time.</P>
    <P>Close attention will have to be paid to store cattle and store cattle production. As a result of the super-levy the calf numbers in the EC are expected to decline seriously during the next number of years.  It is estimated that calf numbers in the EC will decline by up to 2.5 million head or 9 per cent by 1990.  Farmers and meat plant personnel will have to get together and modernise their systems of production and marketing.  More attention will have to be paid to farmers providing cattle under contract so as to eliminate the fluctuating prices we had during the early months of this year when prices dropped by 4p or 5p per pound in any given week.  This area of farming requires examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> The actions taken by the Government during the past few months are already bearing fruit.  The measures they have introduced will restore employment to many people and will improve the situation generally.</P>

      <P>In the course of my remarks on the budget I want to try to identify the budget because it does not seem to have parentage.  It has been described by the Government as the Fine Gael or Coalition budget.  A budget is not a budget until such time as it has been presented in this House and given approval on the day on which it is introduced. This is a Fianna Fáil budget introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and presented to and given approval by the House on 31 March.</P>
      <P>It is true that a considerable portion of this budget is similar to a draft budget put forward by the Fine Gael Party.  It was open to the Government to change that budget, to write a brand new budget and introduce it here as their budget.  The Government did not choose to do that; they accepted something like 80 per cent to 85 per cent at least of the Fine Gael draft budget.  Therefore, we must examine and test the budget as a Government document representing the proposed policies of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Leonard's speech today and to the speeches of other Fianna Fáil Deputies during the past few weeks. They have talked much about the necessity for confidence and the way in which this budget will introduce confidence among business people.  I do not think it will do any such thing.  The budget will confuse business people and people in general.  It will especially confuse and bewilder the supporters of Fianna Fáil and those who listened to their promises here during the past four years.  It will bewilder the people who supported the Government at the polls on 17 February last and returned them to power on foot of the promises, most direct and implied, made by them not alone in the run up to the last general election but during the past two or three years in this House and <Col N="2097" /> throughout the country in local authorities, health boards and wherever a platform was afforded to them.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the last Government Private Members' time in this House was taken up completely by the present Government, as was their right, in resisting every attempt made by the Government to put order into the finances of the country and in resisting every attempt made by the then Government to bring about economies and to get the people of the State to live within their means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Order of Business this morning, but I had failed to get a copy of the paper which alleged that the Libyans were supplying explosives to the Provisional IRA. Again, I tried to raise this matter by Private Notice Question but you were unable to give me permission because you said the matter lacked urgency &mdash; a point with which I respectfully disagree because the levels of killing and the atrocities committed by the IRA in the North makes it incumbent on all of us to do what we can as quickly as possible to cut off the supply of explosives and arms to that organisation.  This House is the appropriate place to bring up matters of this nature and to try to get the Government to act as quickly as possible.  While I am grateful to be given permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment, it is a less satisfactory way than by Private Notice Question where I would have the facility of asking supplementary questions, which is not available to me today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of the flirtation between the leader of the Libyan people and the IRA goes back a long way.  To <Col N="2098" /> the best of my knowledge it first asserted itself with the <i>Claudia</i> arms deal 14 years ago.  At that stage it was very firmly brought home to the Libyan leader the attitude of the then Government, and all previous Governments, to the IRA.  He was told that the determination to find a solution to the Northern Ireland problem was a matter for the Irish people primarily &mdash; of course the British Government had an interest as well &mdash; and that we did not want outside interference, particularly when it took the form of supplying arms and explosives to an organisation who had demonstrated their complete lack of regard for human life or for democratic institutions, one of whose objectives was to achieve power by any means, and who subsequently articulated this objective with the ballot paper in one hand and the armalite in the other.</P>
      <P>We obviously failed to get our message across on that occasion because there have been intermittent signs over the years of Colonel Gadaffi expressing support for the Provisional IRA.  When I was Minister for Foreign Affairs the Libyan Prime Minister said last spring that his people supported the Provisional IRA. On that occasion the Government instructed me to send the Irish Ambassador immediately to Tripoli.  First he was to call on the Libyan authorities in Rome &mdash; because it is there that the Irish Ambassador to Libya is primarily accredited &mdash; and explain our position. We wanted him to express our disquiet at the fact that the Prime Minister of a country with which we had diplomatic relations should express support for what is an illegal organisation in Ireland. Despite two visits to Tripoli by our Ambassador to get the Prime Minister to withdraw that statement, it was not withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To bring home to the Libyan people how seriously we took this move and how determined we were to bring home to countries who may have been misguided about the Provisional IRA that we found it impossible to maintain normal relations with a country which supported this organisation verbally, politically and &mdash;<Col N="2099" /> if the catalogue of what has happened in this morning's paper is correct &mdash; materially, we decided we would not issue visas to Libyan students from then on.  A number of organisations, individuals and politicians took issue with us about this and said we should not take it out on Libyan students.  I explained that we do not have any difficulties with the Libyan people but we do have difficulties with the Libyan leader as long as he continues to give moral, verbal and material support to the IRA.  However, we were not successful in our attempts to arrest this moral support for the IRA.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Herare in August, Colonel Gadaffi said he supported the IRA but that he was not supplying them with arms.  In October he repeated his support for the IRA but when asked if he was still supplying them with arms, he refused to answer.  In March 1987, in an interview with a reporter from <i>The Observer,</i> he again repeated support for the IRA.  Last month at a rally in Tripoli Colonel Gadaffi's son said they still supported the IRA and would supply them with arms.  Present at that meeting were two members of Sinn Féin, Noonan and McManus, and one of them is a very sinister figure indeed.</P>
    <P>According to the reporter in this morning's paper the explosive which he alleges is being supplied to the IRA by the Libyans is made in Eastern Europe.  It is highly sophisticated, much smaller quantities are needed to be effective, it has a longer life and therefore is less dangerous to handle.  This is a very dangerous weapon to have in the hands of an illegal organisation, but this has not been categorically proved.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that there was a large arms find in the north west last year but, as far as I know it has not been proved that those arms came from Libya, although they were labelled for the Libyan Armed Forces.  According to this morning's paper, this new type of explosive, manufactured in Eastern Europe and supplied through Libya to the IRA, was responsible for the death of a soldier in Belfast last March, The murder of Judge <Col N="2100" /> and Mrs. Gibson last month, and was used in the letter bomb attacks on British civil servants in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>The time has come when Colonel Gadaffi and the Libyan establishment must be faced.  This man can no longer be treated as a clown on the world stage whose utterances are thought to be off the top of his head and not seriously meant.  The Government have an obligation to confront him immediately.  The Irish Ambassador who is stationed in Rome should be sent to Libya to demand an interview with Colonel Gadaffi to bring it home to him that this country does not tolerate verbal, moral or material support from anywhere for this illegal organisation that has done so much damage to the aspirations of the Irish people for so many years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this is the second time this week we have had a debate relating to this organisation and the damage they are doing to the Irish image abroad, Irish nationalism and the aspirations of 99 per cent of the people on this island who want to pursue their political objectives by peaceful means.  It is so dangerous that something must be done immediately. Loss of life is my primary concern but it is ironical that the publicity given to this in newspapers this morning will be picked up by the press around the world, when the Government are trying to promote tourism in America.  I do not know if the Minister appreciates the damage which will be done to Irish tourism by the publication of this matter.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Minister to take every step open to him including calling in the ambassador accredited from Libya to Ireland to bring home to him in no uncertain manner the fact that we cannot and will not tolerate support for an illegal organisation by Libya or any other country. I hope he will have more success in this regard than I had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  I wish to retain a sense of perspective in response to Deputy <Col N="2101" /> Barry's statement.  I also wish to emphasise the Government's concern at any expression of support, moral or material, for the IRA and I made that quite clear in the House the night before last.</P>
      <P>I have read the newspaper report published in London which gives rise to this afternoon's debate.  I note it alleges that the plastic explosive Semtex has been supplied by the IRA by Libya.  I also note, looking at the matter in a balanced way, that this allegation is not supported by any evidence.  I assure Deputies, however, that the security authorities are well aware of the report and I also assure them that, should they uncover evidence to support these allegations, the Government will take whatever action is deemed appropriate.  At the moment, this newspaper allegation is being investigated by the security forces and, depending on what emerges, I will decide on what diplomatic action should be taken.  It would be unreal of me, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to proceed at this stage on the basis of an uncorroborated newspaper report.  It would be inappropriate to take diplomatic action of the kind suggested by Deputy Barry until investigations have been completed.</P>
      <P>I am just as concerned as Deputy Barry about this matter.  We have set in train, in conjunction with other security authorities, an investigation to ascertain the facts.  Any unsupported allegation in a newspaper report, no matter how disturbing its contents may be, does not provide an adequate basis for the sort of action suggested by Deputy Barry.  This applies particularly at present when the world media regularly reports all sorts of revelations in regard to security matters and when security forces themselves appear to be at odds with their own Government in several countries.  There is a whole miasma of suspicion and uncorroborated evidence reported in many parts of the world in regard to the activities of security agencies and relevations about them especially in relation to Libya.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are well aware of the fact that successive Irish Governments have <Col N="2102" /> sought to bring home to the Libyan authorities their concern at any expressions of support for an organisation which has consistently sought to undermine the democratically elected institutions of the State.  The previous Government protested to the Libyan authorities as late as 4 March this year and informed them of the statement issued on 1 March by the Taoiseach who was then Leader of the Opposition.  We are <i>ad idem</i> in that respect.  As Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey made it clear that he saw it as his duty to prevent support being given to the IRA from any source and that he would take any possible steps available to him to ensure that this would not happen.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear, the Libyan authorities are well aware of our position in this matter which has been frequently advanced by successive Governments. We do not, therefore, feel bound to repeat our view on the occasion of each new newspaper report.  However, I will repeat it here.  I say, quite categorically, that any support for the IRA from any source, if proved, is totally abhorrent to the Government.  We reject any agency, Government, body or people responsible for furnishing material help to the IRA in their campaign.  I have emphasised that point sufficiently here this afternoon and I am glad to have had the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Having said that, in the interests of balance and a proper perception of the matter it would not be appropriate for this or any other Government to take action on the basis of an uncorroborated newspaper report which only emerged this morning and which has to be investigated and examined by the appropriate security authorities.  However, there is nothing in my approach to Deputy Barry's queries which implies any change in the fundamental opposition of this and previous Governments, including the Governments in which Deputy Barry participated, to any attempt to promote physical objectives by violence or the threat of violence.  As I have said, the position of the Irish authorities in this <Col N="2103" /> regard has been made quite clear to the Libyan authorities.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government will continue to monitor closely support for the IRA which may emanate from Libya or from any other part of the world.  The Libyan Government can be in no doubt as to the principled and fundamental position of successive Irish Governments on the question of any form of support from whatever source for the IRA.  The authorities in Libya are also well aware of the wider dimension of our policy and that of our partners in the European Community on the question of State support of any kind for international terrorism.  There is no ambiguity, uncertainty or lack of resolve in our determination in this respect.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate that I am very glad to have had this opportunity to make this statement and that I welcome Deputy Barry's raising the matter in this manner.</P>

I gather from the Minister's silence on the matter that the Government did nothing about the outrageous statement which was made by Colonel Gadaffi's son last month at a rally which, as I said, was attended by two members of Sinn Féin, one of whom is a very sinister person.</P>

      <P>When the Transport (Reorganisation of CIE) Act, 1986, was under discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas some Members of both Houses supported the concept of two rather than three subsidiary companies. The Oireachtas, however, decided in favour of the three company proposal, and three subsidiaries, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, were registered by CIE under the Companies Acts, in accordance with the intentions of the legislature.  They commenced trading on 2 February 1987.</P>
      <P>The new organisational arrangements for CIE services are now firmly in place and so far are, I understand, working sucessfully.  To contemplate further changes in the organisation of CIE at this stage would, I believe, lead to confusion and uncertainty and would not be in the best interest of the CIE organisation as a whole and its some 14,500 employees.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to bring forward proposals for amending the legislation in the short term at least.  The real value of the reorganisation can only be judged on the basis of experience over a number of years.  When the organisational structure of CIE again falls to be assessed, the value of a two company approach can also be examined.</P>

Following analysis of capacity in the industry and consultations with the main operators I decided that a revised target for growth in visitors numbers in 1987 of 400,000 was appropriate.

      <P>The examination of a number of proposals in relation to this matter is at an advanced stage in my Department.  Some of the proposals envisage a roll-on-roll-off type vessel and attendant infrastructural developments.  No financial allocation can be provided in relation to this matter in advance of a decision by the Government.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that they have taken a number of measures to ensure adequate capacity during the summer. This was necessary because of the non-availability this year of the <i>Galway Bay,</i> a vessel which has been leased for a number of years to supplement the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> during the summer season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The <i>Naomh Éanna</i> sailings are being increased from two to six per week with no service on Mondays and passenger only services on Sundays; this service will be supplemented as required by a bus service to Rossaveal to link with a ferry service by a private operator; the provision of a limited freight service to the two smaller islands by a private operator is being arranged.  The <i>Naomh Éanna</i> will continue to serve the smaller islands twice weekly.  I understand that the Aran Islands interests are reasonably satisfied with these arrangements.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be already aware from statements I have made the Jobsearch Programme provides that 150,000 of those on the live register will be referred by my Department to the <Col N="2065" /> National Manpower Service for interview by the end of December next.  The purpose of this interview is to help those involved to assess their strengths and weaknesses and to assist in their efforts to find work.  On the basis of these interviews, 40,000 will be offered Manpower scheme opportunities and 12,000 will be placed in Jobsearch courses which are designed to assist participants in their search for a job, and to provide them with free facilities to do so.</P>
      <P>The broad guidelines governing the operation of this programme are that it should apply in the main to the longer term unemployed i.e. those out of work for six months or more and that it should concentrate generally on the 20-55 age group.  It was planned that the 150,000 concerned who would be interviewed by the National Manpower Service for the purposes of this programme, would all have been referred to Manpower by my Department.</P>
      <P>In order to fill Jobsearch courses during the first week or so in some areas and to get the programme fully under way the National Manpower Service selected some unemployed people from their own register for the purposes of these courses without reference to my Department. However, my information from the National Manpower Service is that in every one of these cases arising in the Deputy's constituency the people concerned have been interviewed in the context of the Jobsearch Programme.</P>

No appointments have been made from outside the Civil Service since the publication of the interim report and the committee has met five times since then.</P>
      <P>I am now considering whether to publish the results of the work recently concluded by the committee or to arrange for some further experimental work which would resolve in a more conclusive way questions about the technical and economic viability of some horticultural and agricultural uses of cutaway bogland.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee indicated broad agreement that forestry will be the optimum solution in considerable areas of cutaway, representing about 60 per cent of the total and that there will be significant tracts where grassland and dry stock raising could prove worthwhile. Some further testing of the latter is indicated as desirable.  Certain low-lying cut-aways are likely to be suitable only for reflooding and the creation of wetland for amenity facilities.  It is not my intention to let cutaway land stand idle, but to see that this valuable resource is put to the best possible economic use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department was aware that certain dangerous substances were stored at West Pier, Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin.  The substances in question are declared to be dangerous under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 (Part IV Declaration) Order 1986 (S.I. No. 267 of 1986) for the purposes of Part IV of the Dangerous Substances Act.  Section 25 of that Act requires, among other things, that a person engaged in the storage of dangerous substances shall take all practicable steps to prevent risk of injury to person or property.</P>
      <P>In the light of my Department's responsibilities as regards this legislation, the industrial inspectorate, along with the emergency services, was carefully monitoring the circumstances of storage at that location to eliminate storage in dangerous circumstances.</P>
      <P>More recently my Department was informed that the substances in question had been removed to another location in Mayor Street, Dublin.  I have asked the industrial inspectorate to examine the situation carefully to ensure that those substances are safely stored at the new location.  As soon as I receive a report of the outcome of those investigations I will write to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>An application for a second permanent post of paediatrician at Portlaoise, in replacement for a post which has become vacant, is currently being processed in accordance with established procedures.</P>
      <P>The filling of posts by health boards is, in the first instance, a matter for the appropriate board having regard to the priority attached to the post by the board, its ability to fund the post within its approved non-capital allocation and the arrangements it is making to meet the Government's requirements on staffing levels.  If these conditions are met, I will favourably consider applications from health boards to fill such posts on a permanent basis.</P>
