      <P>The interception by the French customs authorities of the coaster <i>Eksund,</i> the discovery on board of a huge cache of arms and the fact that the crew consisted of Irish persons has naturally been the cause of particular interest and concern to all Members of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that I should give the House as much information on this matter as I can at this stage.  I intend to confine myself to the facts which have been established.  The discovery of what this coaster contained and the personnel on board have been the cause of a great deal of comment and speculation.  I do not propose to add to that by getting into the realm of theories and possibilities.  I am giving the facts as I have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early hours of Saturday, 31 October, off the French Atlantic coast, a small coaster was apprehended by the French customs authorities who had been keeping the vessel under surveillance for some time.  The vessel had set out on this voyage from Malta.  Whether it stopped en route between there and where it was intercepted and, if so, where are matters <Col N="2472" /> which have yet to be confirmed.  The vessel was taken to the French harbour of Brest and the five-member crew was arrested.  The ship contained a very large quantity of armaments estimated to weigh something between 100 and 150 tonnes.  The value of the cargo has been estimated at between £15 million and £20 million, but a more exact evaluation cannot be put on it until the amount and condition of all the types of armaments have been fully assessed.  I have not a complete inventory of all that the vessel contained but notification has been received by the Garda Síochána that the cargo included the following: at least 20 SAM 7 surface-to-air missiles, approximately 1,000 AK 47 Kalashnikov rifles, at least 600 Soviet F1 grenades, approximately 10 Soviet 12.77mm heavy machine guns with anti-aircraft gun mounts, a quantity, not yet known, of anti-tank recoilless rifles and ammunition for them, Beretta M 12 9mm Belgian machine guns, quantity unknown, approximately two tons of Semtex explosives with detonators and fuses, a quantity not yet known of RPG 7 tubes and ammunition &mdash; these are rocket-propelled grenades, an unknown quantity of mortars and 50 tons of ammunition.</P>
    <P>The vessel was manned by a five-man crew who are all either Irish citizens or who have strong Irish connections.  All were carrying Irish passports, two of which were found to be part of a number of passports stolen in 1984 from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The persons carrying these passports were using assumed names but their true identities are now known to the Garda.  The five men involved have now been conveyed by the Fench police authorities from Brest to Paris where they have been charged. Given that all the crew were Irish or have Irish connections, or given that there are grounds to suspect that some at least of them may have Irish connections, there exists a very strong possibility that some of the armaments, if not all, were destined for landing here.  Accordingly, the Garda Síochána have been in constant touch with the French police since this <Col N="2473" /> vessel was apprehended.  A Garda assistant commissioner accompanied by another officer is now in France to liaise with their French counterparts and obtain all information relevant to the Irish dimension of this matter as the investigation develops.</P>
    <P>These are the essential facts.  I acknowledge that there are many gaps to be filled and questions to be answered but I am not in a position to give a more detailed answer at this stage.  I do not intend to be drawn into the realm of speculation but if developments occur which would make it appropriate for me to make a further statement to the House I am prepared to make one.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I wish to do is to express my thanks and congratulations and those of the Government to the French authorities for their most effective and commendable action in this matter which has prevented such a vast quantity of deadly weapons from falling into the hands of those who seek to subvert lawful authority and impose their will by terrorist tactics and the force of arms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister, as is the House, for setting out this matter as he has done.  I appreciate the Minister's desire to stick to the known facts but there are one or two other aspects to this case to which the House should give some attention.  This is a most appalling affair.  To my knowledge, it is the largest consignment of arms that has ever been apprehended in circumstances of this kind.  There have been previous cases of consignments of arms being intercepted on their way here but none has ever been as big as this.  The list the Minister has given of the types of arms covers the widest range of arms ever found in a shipment intercepted apparently on its way to this country.  The nationality of the crew is of extreme significance to us particularly as there must be a very strong suspicion that at least a part of this shipment was destined for use on this island.  There is nothing to suggest, even remotely, that this was anything <Col N="2474" /> other than an illegal arms shipment.  No Government has indicated that they were a customer for these and no legitimate buyer has indicated that he was a customer for these arms.  It is clear this shipment is part of a substantial activity in illegal international arms dealing.</P>
      <P>Although this is in the realm of speculation, there is a suggestion that this may have been the second vessel in a convoy and that there is perhaps another one that escaped the net.  The vessel is reported to have left Malta on 12 October and to have taken two weeks to pass the Straits of Gibraltar, a voyage that would normally take it half that time.  It is alleged that the vessel left Malta empty and there is a strong suspicion that somewhere between Malta and the Straits of Gibraltar this vessel took aboard the cargo that it has.  That is a matter of extreme concern to us because in that region of the world there are people who have indicated their support for, or at least their benevolence towards, the Provisional IRA.</P>
      <P>When we look at the size of the consignment from somewhere between 100 and 150 tonnes of armaments valued at about £20 million, it is abundantly clear that there must have been a substantial amount of outside financing to allow that quantity of arms to be assembled and sent to this island.  What we are facing here appears not only to be another very serious incident of potential arms subversion in this country but an even more serious case of apparent outside assistance to arms subversion of that kind. That is an aspect of this case which we must insist is fully and comprehensively investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us can be anything but alarmed at the indications that surround this case. As the Minister said, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the French authorities for their vigilance and rapid action in this matter.  God knows how many thousands of lives have been saved by the actions of the French authorities in this matter.  Not only must the Garda authorities here cooperate fully with the French authorities in getting to the bottom of this affair, but I would also ask the Government to call <Col N="2475" /> on the French authorities to allow the Garda authorities the maximum access to this case so that the Garda will be in a position to follow up any links there may be between this arms seizure and the activities of subversives in this country. It would appear that the ramifications of this seizure for life and for death in this country may be very far-reaching.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the whole business of illegal dealing in arms internationally is one which must concern us very intimately.  We have seen far too many people on this island killed and maimed because there are people who believe they can make their arguments through the barrel of a gun.  It is absolutley unacceptable that there should be any assistance for people of that kind. Anybody who feels the slightest ambivalence or the slightest goodwill towards people who profess a belief in the efficiency of armed conflict on this island should look again at the list of armaments the Minister has given us &mdash; surface to air missiles, grenades, rocket propelled grenades, automatic rifles, heavy machine guns and God knows how many tonnes of ammunition.  It is incredible that anybody could feel for a moment that allowing all of those munitions to be unleashed in any part of this island could do any good.  This House should clearly state that it will not tolerate activities of that kind.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is very clearly part of a substantial international trade in illegal arms.  It is part and parcel of international terrorism.  The size of the cargo and the death that could be dealt out by it must serve once again to underline for us the simple stark fact that we must play our part to the utmost of our abilities in any action undertaken for the suppression of international terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I compliment and thank the French authorities for detecting this cargo and preventing its importation to this country.  As other Deputies have said, their successful efforts have obviously saved the lives of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people both on this island and elsewhere.  All of us who are <Col N="2476" /> interested in having peace in this country and in suppressing terrorism cannot but thank and compliment the French authorities and we should not be shy about saying that.</P>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory at this stage to discuss a matter about which we do not have much information and that is regrettable. Since this matter arose last Saturday it appears to be easier to get information from the British media, radio and television than it is from our own services.  I do not know why that is the case. However, a number of matters have come to light, particularly in the last number of days and they are more than just suspicions.  It has been stated in many of the media reports, in yesterday's and today's papers both in Britain and in Ireland, that while this ship left Malta without any arms on board, somewhere on route it was able to pick up a supply of arms.  It is stated in today's papers that the French authorities believe that this cargo was loaded on 14 October last in Tripoli and that it was, as it were, personally approved by Mr. Gadaffi.  It is time that once and for all we stopped the double standards and double think when it comes to these matters.</P>
      <P>Last year 3,500 tonnes of beef or 1 per cent of our beef exports were exported to Libya.  It is also the case that 46,000 or 14 per cent of our live cattle were exported to that country.  Our trade to Libya is worth £30 million and imports from that country are worth £500,000 but unfortunately the balance comes by way of support for organisations that want to subvert this State and want to kill and maim Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Tuesday evening I watched on <i>Today Tonight</i> a recording of a programme shown last year in which Mr. Gadaffi clearly outlined his support and indeed his admiration for the Provisional IRA.  If that is the kind of behaviour of a country such as that, Ireland should not have friendly relations or diplomatic relations with that country, as we have; our Ambassador to Rome is accredited there.  I understand that a Government Minister is shortly to visit that country. We must stop the double standards and <Col N="2477" /> the double think when it comes to these matters.  We are great at talking about sanctions in relation to South Africa because perhaps it does not affect us very much but we are very slow to act when it affects ourselves.  If it transpires that these arms came from Libya, this country should no longer have diplomatic relations with that country and the Government or any Minister of the Government should not go on friendly visits to that country, be they in relation to trade or whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Provisional IRA, last weekend the political elite of that organisation, the people who sit back in their armchairs and send out young men and women to commit atrocities in the name of some phoney ideals, were given the Mansion House in this city in which to hold their annual árdfheis. I was interested to see one of the headlines from that árd-fheis which said that Sinn Féin believe we should renege on our foreign debt.  I thought to myself as I heard that statement that if they were not involved in so much subversion and so much terror on this island perhaps our foreign debt would not be anything like it is.  This organisation has to be taken on once and for all.  It is not right that Irish people, no matter what the situation may be at local level, can justify support for an organisation whose main aim is to subvert this country and to kill and maim fellow Irish people.  It is not right that the house of the first citizen of this city, the Mansion House on Dawson Street, should be given year in year out to this organisation as if it was just another group or another organisation.  We must take a stand on this matter because we want to do everything we can to try to stop Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, from getting support and helping their campaign of maiming and killing fellow Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need to bring in changes in our own legislation.  We need to make it an extraterritorial offence for any person <Col N="2478" /> anywhere in the world to assist, conspire or attempt to import arms into any part of Ireland, North or South, or to be in any way involved in their movement or possession with a view to their use in this country.  We need to get our own laws in order.  During the last few days I have heard a number of Deputies say that they do not seem to approve of extradition. Many of them do not seem to know what our extradition laws are at present.  I do not think anybody in this House is being responsible when he or she stands over not extraditing those who are wanted in connection with serious crime.  If we want to stop crime on this island and elsewhere we cannot be ambivalent when it comes to these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the remarks of the other Deputies who have spoken and who have professed a sense of profound relief that this massive shipment of arms has been intercepted and that we have been spared the appalling carnage and massacres that would undoubtedly have flowed from the use of these armaments.  The magnitude of the shipment is such that, clearly, all of it was not intended for use in this country.  Major parts of this consignment would have been used by the international arms dealing operations from which subversive and terrorists groups in other troubled spots in the world are supplied.  Quite clearly the IRA are involved and the massive amount of money and organisation that was involved clearly illustrate that.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Dukes to the international trade in arms. What he said is very true but we have to draw a distinction between two kinds of situations.  On the one hand there are these well known evil men who are arms dealers on a grand scale and they have their companies and their cover and their fronts to do this.  That is one situation that has to be met with through international circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is another category <Col N="2479" /> when Governments that stride across the international scene at the United Nations and Security Council are themselves part and parcel of this reign of terror and these arms supply dealings.  That is a different situation altogether.  Let us be clear about this.  We know full well &mdash; the Minister is reticent about coming out with it and I regret that &mdash; and it is clear from their reports &mdash; and we may as well call a spade a spade here &mdash; that this ship was loaded in Tripoli, Libya by Libyan soldiers with the imprimatur and in accordance with the stated policy of Colonel Gadaffi, the leader of the Libyan State.  He has made no secret of that; he has indicated quite clearly in statements that that is his policy and that he intends to do that.  Yet, this is a country with which we have diplomatic relations, whose ambassador strides the international scene and makes speeches in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The response we are seeing here so far from the Minister and the Government is just not good enough.  We must call into question, and do it quickly, the whole matter of our diplomatic situation with Libya.  I have not heard the Minister say he is considering lodging a formal protest with Libya or with the United Nations as to what has transpired here, at this deliberate attempt to wreak death and destruction and injury on citizens of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>And of the UK and of other places in the Gulf and wherever these armaments would be distributed.  I am asking the Minister and the Government to tell the House now, or soon, what diplomatic activity is proposed on the international scene.  Will this matter be raised in the United Nations?  Will this matter be raised in the Security Council calling to task and calling to account in a public, international way the policy of calculated interference, of death and injury, against citizens of this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word about the origins of these weapons.  These weapons are, by the description given by the Minister for Justice in his outlining statement, Soviet <Col N="2480" /> weaponry almost in their entirety if not in their entirety.  That is a matter that also requires to be looked at.  We have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union; that is a very important thing and a very good thing and we value diplomatic relations with friendly countries.  But, at the same time, when a cache of these dimensions of weapons emanating from the Soviet Union finds itself as a threat to life and limb in this country, then it is a matter for calling in the Soviet ambassador and making representations to the Soviet Union about the origin of these weapons and how such a massive consignment of weapons manufactured in that country became a serious threat to people of this country.  That is a question that has to be raised and I have not heard the Minister give any indication of his intentions in this matter.  We are dealing here with a country that strides across the international scene.  Many of these weapons can, no doubt, be bought or acquired through the private dealers and agents who deal with these matters but this is a different league, this is of a different dimension altogether.</P>
    <P>What the country expects now is intense diplomatic activity with a country with which we trade.  I regret we may lose trade with that country.  That would be unfortunate but if we are to trade with such a country and receive their money, all I can say is it is blood money.  That is the situation and this thing has to be stopped, and stopped at source.  There is an old saying in law that if there were no receivers there would be no thieves.  To put that into an analogy with the situation here, I would say that if there were no countries supplying arms to terrorists and subversives on this scale then the bombs, the killings, the threats, intimidations and so on that go on in our country would be avoided, or at least very much reduced.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what intelligence reports have been received on this whole issue.  Has the Minister been fully frank with us on it? Will we hear further statements as to what information has been furnished to the Government by Assistant Commissioner Crowley who has been in <Col N="2481" /> France investigating the matter for some days past?  I would remind the House that this is the second occasion on which the IRA have been thwarted in their efforts to obtain surface-to-air missiles.  Deputies will recall that the House passed emergency legislation to freeze certain bank funds to ensure that such moneys would not be used.  This is not the end of the story.  There will be further efforts, there will be further attempts.  We must ensure that all resources are provided to our own naval personnel, the Garda Síochána and our own security forces to ensure that these instruments of death are kept from our shore.  In the meantime I beseech the Minister for Justice and the Government to take the necessary steps, with determination and force, with the Libyan Government at the highest possible level and on the international scene as necessary to ensure that this interference with life and limb in this country will henceforth be avoided completely.</P>

      <P>Whatever the destination of these arms, we must be glad they have not reached that destination because their purpose was to create furthere death and destruction.  If that destination was Ireland, the huge size of the cargo must raise real concern as regards the intentions of the Provisional IRA.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation that the intention was to attack the Maze prison. That is most unlikely.  It seems much more likely that the arms were to be used for what we have always said is the main purpose of this campaign since it was first established, to start a full scale sectarian civil war in Northern Ireland.  They have always relied for their support in the Catholic community on creating an atmosphere where they could be seen as the defenders of the Catholic community. In order to do that they have engaged in various sectarian killings to provoke a reaction against the Catholic community so that they could then be seen as the defenders of that community, so that the Catholic community would see the Provisionals as being necessary to defend them and protect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2482" /> For their entire existence they have been engaged in what can only be called murderous political obscenity so that concepts such as freedom fighters, republicanism and national liberation now stink in the nostrils of democratic citizens.  In the very beginning we identified them as a sectarian and racist group which incited murder and violence against fellow-Irish people and which have nothing in common with the Irish radical revolutionary political tradition.  Indeed, it is fair to say that on many occasions The Workers' Party stood virtually alone on this point as, for instance, at the height of the H-Block hysteria.</P>
    <P>The Provisionals' military campaign has dragged on for 17 years.  It has now clearly reached a stalemate and the British are quite prepared to endure the present level of casualties.  In this situation the only hope is to provoke a full scale sectarian conflict.  That is why I believe that if these arms had reached this country we would have seen a spate of particularly vicious attacks, even massacres, on the Protestant community in the North.  This would have lead to a sectarian backlash against Catholics and then the cargo of the <i>Eksund</i> would really have been brought into vicious play in the matter of sectarian civil war.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Irish Government to make exhaustive inquiries as to the exact source of these weapons. It has been assumed in various newspaper articles that they came from Libya.  We know the reliability one can place on newspaper articles, creating guilt before judgment has been made.  It may be the case that they have come from Libya but we should not rush to judgment on the issue.  However, if the evidence does show that these arms were supplied by Libya, then the strongest possible protest must be made to Colonel Gadaffi. He has every reason to feel anger and resentment against the United States Government which bombed Tripoli in what can only be called a terrorist attack, leading to many deaths and indeed to serious injury to one of his own children.</P>
    <P>We can also, and must, feel anger against Mrs. Thatcher who provided <Col N="2483" /> bases for these US bombers.  However, this cannot in any way justify the supply of weapons which would have caused such suffering and death to Irish people. The Taoiseach and Colonel Gadaffi have often spoken of their special friendship. I hope that if the Libyans are in this the Taoiseach will now convey to Colonel Gadaffi that this conduct is quite unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of the Irish people and that, in supplying arms to the Provos, Libya is not taking a stand against imperialism but aiding a sectarian, fascist and evil organisation.  If, as Deputy Taylor said, the ambassador of the USSR is to be brought in in regard to the supply of Soviet weapons, we should also bring in the United States ambassador because United States weapons have been used for the past 17 years in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987    [Seanad]:    Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of bringing this Bill before the House.  The Bill is, I believe, an important step in strengthening competition and consumer protection policy.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to streamline the operation and to extend the scope of existing competition and consumer protection legislation.  I am introducing this Bill on the basis of a detailed examination of the matter which has been undertaken in my Department. The previous Government undertook to strengthen competition policy through the restructuring of current institutional arrangements and by means of new legislation to amend the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The examination which has been carried out included consideration of the overall effectiveness of the work of the Restrictive Practices Commission, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Director of Consumer Affairs in the promotion of greater competition and efficiency in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2484" /> In considering the need for new measures in the regulation of competition, it is important to bear in mind the purpose of competition legislation and, indeed, the function which competition itself fulfils in the economy.  When operating fairly, competition is a healthy element in the market.  It should not be viewed as an aim in itself but rather as an essential means towards the improvement of production so as to encourage an efficient economy and to benefit the consumer. Restrictive practices reduce the choices open to the consumer and can lead to higher prices than might otherwise prevail in an unrestricted market.  Also, an informed consumer is a valuable stimulus to industry, requiring producers to remain efficient and in touch with consumers' requirements.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to dealing with the contents of the Bill it may be useful to describe briefly the nature of the various institutions at present involved in the implementation of competition and consumer protection policy here in Ireland. Before the enactment of the Restrictive Practices Act of 1972 the functions which are now carried out separately by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Restrictive Practices Commission were discharged by a single body, the Fair Trade Commission.  This situation was regarded as unsatisfactory by trade and industry as it was felt that the Fair Trade Commission, in the conduct of inquiries, were both prosecutor and adjudicator and therefore could not be acting impartially in their adjudicating function.  In response to these arguments, the 1972 Restrictive Practices Act created the new post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices who was given the investigatory functions under the legislation, with the adjudication aspect being retained by the new Restrictive Practices Commission.  The later Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act of 1978 conferred further functions on the examiner and the commission.  Under that Act, the examiner is required to investigate any proposed merger referred to him by the Minister, while the commission carry out <Col N="2485" /> inquiries into apparent monopolies, again at the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the area of consumer protection, it is the Director of Consumer Affairs who acts as watchdog.  The post of director was set up under the Consumer Information Act of 1978, which was the first major piece of consumer protection legislation in this country.  Generally, the functions of the director under this Act and under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 are to ensure the reliability of information conveyed to the consumer in the advertising, promotion and sale of goods and services.</P>
    <P>The posts of Examiner of Restrictive Practices and Director of Consumer Affairs are now occupied by one person. This was, in my view, a necessary first step on the road towards improved efficiency in the areas of competition and consumer protection.  The Bill goes further down this road by assigning the examiner's functions under the 1972 Restrictive Practices Act to the retitled Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and most of the examiner's functions under the 1978 mergers Act to the Restrictive Practices Commission, to be renamed the Fair Trade Commission. This rationalisation, together with a number of provisions in the Bill designed to strengthen the powers of the commission and the director, will result in greater overall efficiency and a reduction in the number of State bodies.  This will, I believe, help towards the more coherent and integrated administration of related policy measures.</P>
    <P>A second element in the strengthening of competition policy is the extension of the scope of competition legislation to include a number of regulated service sectors such as communications, banking and electricity.  These services were generally excluded from the legislation on the basis that they were already subject to the control or direction of another Minister or regulatory body.  In recent years, however, the international trend has increasingly been to re-examine the rationale for the exclusion of such &ldquo;regulated&rdquo; sectors.  In the area of competition <Col N="2486" /> policy, in particular, the OECD have urged member countries to review the matter in order to establish whether the original justifications for exemption were still valid.  The areas of energy, transport and banking were particularly mentioned in this context.</P>
    <P>The Bill also brings within the scope of competition legislation anything done in the exercise of statutory duty.  This will ensure that State and semi-State bodies engaged in commercial activities which are in competition with the private sector, will be subject to scrutiny by the competition authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the exclusion relating to services provided under a contract of employment is being removed from the Restrictive Practices Act of 1972.  In view, however, of the responsibility of the Minister for Labour in this area, I am proposing that his consent will be necessary before any regulatory activity in relation to such services can take place under the Restrictive Practices Act.</P>
    <P>I am also availing of the opportunity presented by this Bill to remove a significant exclusion from consumer protection legislation.  I believe it to be untenable that banking is not subject to the provisions of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  While acknowledging the controls exercised by the Central Bank over the licensed banks in relation to various matters, I believe that the banks should be subject to the same controls as other businesses in relation to advertising.  I have, therefore, provided in the Bill that the exemption which the licensed banks enjoy at present will be removed.  I will, however, be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage which is designed to ensure that the confidentiality of individual bank accounts will continue to be assured.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of increased efficiency, I am providing in this Bill for the centralising, as far as possible in a single agency, of the enforcement functions contained in a whole range of legislation in the consumer protection area. I am speaking here of enforcement in relation to such areas as food labelling, textile labelling, price display and safety <Col N="2487" /> standards for particular products.  What I am proposing is that the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade should be the principal enforcement agency. Enforcement functions, including powers of prosecution, are at present vested in me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have provided in the Bill for the transfer of these functions to the director. The director will assume these functions in addition to his existing functions and I am confident that this arrangement will lead to the more effective enforcement of legislation in the consumer area and hence to better protection for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am availing of this Bill to effect a number of amendments to consumer legislation which will, I hope, serve to improve the efficiency of the administration of that legislation.  For example, this Bill will confer on the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade the power to seek an injunction against someone who is attempting to evade his obligations under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. I am also providing for the creation of a number of specific offences relating in particular to the impersonation of authorised officers and the supply of short weights or measures.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the content of the Bill and to explain the main provisions in the Bill to the House.  Part I of the Bill contains the usual preliminary matters common to all Bills.  There is no need to go into detail except, perhaps, on section 3.  This section provides for the repeal of the enactments listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  These repeals are, to a large extent, designed to remove my powers of prosecution under various pieces of consumer legislation.  These powers are, as I have already indicated, being transferred to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>
    <P>I have explained that the Bill will extend the scope of competition legislation by removing the exemption which relates to certain services.  Section 25 of the Restrictive Practices Act and section <Col N="2488" /> 52 (1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, are being repealed as part of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 13 (1), and paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the Second Schedule of the Restrictive Practices Act, is consequent on the abolition of the post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices, to which I have already referred.  These provisions relate to the appointment of the examiner by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the 1972 Act, which is also being repealed, deals with the reporting procedures of the examiner on the basis of investigations carried out by him.  These procedures, which will henceforth be carried out by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, are being simplified in the interest of improved efficiency.  The new reporting procedure is contained in section 15 of the Bill, which amends section 14 of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 2 (2) of the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972, follows from the abolition of detailed price control which the previous Government decided on in 1986.  At present, under section 2 (2), any statutory power to fix or control prices may only be exercised with my consent.  With the lapsing of price controls generally, it is appropriate to remove the requirement for this consent and to permit the statutory powers to revert to the Ministers and bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, is also being repealed. This section is being repealed in order to remove the exemption which licensed banks at present enjoy, thus making them subject to the supervision of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in so far as advertising is concerned.</P>
    <P>The final repeal which should be mentioned is that of sections 48 and 49 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  These sections deal with the appointment, composition and functions of the Postal Services Users' Council and the Telecommunications Users' Council. <Col N="2489" /> Their repeal follows the recent Government decision to abolish these two councils. This decision was taken as part of the ongoing review of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Part II contains the major thrust of the Bill providing for amendments to the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  Sections 5 to 7 are concerned with the change of name of the Restrictive Practices Commission to the Fair Trade Commission and the Director of Consumer Affairs to the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, and with the transfer of the functions of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices to these agencies.  Section 8 is designed to make the procedure for making orders under the 1972 Act more efficient by allowing me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make such orders, subject to consultation with certain interested parties, without having first received a report from the Fair Trade Commission as is required at present.  I should point out, of course, that any orders made under this section are subject to confirmation by Act of the Oireachtas, as are all orders made under the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 contains the new definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; for the purposes of the 1972 Act.  This definition takes account of the removal of the exclusions which I have already outlined to the House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of sections 11, 12 and 14 is to strengthen the role of the commission by allowing it to exercise its powers under the Act on its own initiative that is, without the existing requirement to have first received a request to do so from either the examiner or myself. Sections 15 and 17 also strengthen the commission's powers by conferring on the commission power to require information when conducting a study or analysis under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act.  Considerable powers of investigation are also being given to the authorised officers of the commission under section 17.  These powers already apply to authorised officers of the examiner under section 15 of the 1972 Act. <Col N="2490" /> As a further measure to strengthen the commission's powers, section 16 of the Bill allows the commission to request the director to carry out an investigation under the 1972 Act.  At present, only I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, can request the examiner to carry out such an investigation.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 20 are designed to ensure the efficient and effective enforcement of restrictive practices legislation, first by giving the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade power to seek an injunction to enforce compliance with an order made under the 1972 Act; secondly, by giving the director powers of prosecution under the 1972 Act; thirdly, by extending to 18 months the time during which offences under the 1972 Act may be prosecuted; and, finally, by increasing the fines payable on conviction of an offence to a level which will bring them into line with present-day money values.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of the Bill, currently before the House, which gives effect to the provisions of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.  This order bans below-cost selling of grocery goods and the payment or receipt of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; and includes intoxicating liquor and own brand goods under the terms of the order for the first time.  The effectiveness of this order, which is currently a matter for the examiner of Restrictive Practices, will be greatly improved by a number of the provisions of this Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill.  The penalties for offences under restrictive practices orders are being substantially increased, the amalgamation of the Offices of Examiner of Restrictive Practices and Director of Consumer Affairs will result in a larger field staff at the disposal of the new Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and, finally, the director will have power to seek an injunction, where necessary, to enforce compliance with the terms of the order.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 are contained in sections 22 to 24 of the Bill.  Section 22 provides the <Col N="2491" /> new definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; for the purposes of the 1978 Act.  This definition takes into account the broadening of the scope of the Monopolies and Mergers Act to include communications, transport and electricity.  Sections 23 and 24 are designed to improve the efficiency of the administration of the legislation. Section 23, for example, permits the Fair Trade Commission to delegate one or more of its members to carry out a particular investigation into a proposed merger.  This type of investigation is at present one of the examiner's functions but is being transferred to the commission under section 7 of the Bill.  Section 24 of the Bill gives to the director power, first, to seek an injunction to force compliance with an order under the 1978 Act and, secondly, to prosecute for summary offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV of the Bill are, for the most part, designed to effect the establishment of the director as the principal enforcement agency in the consumer protection area.  Sections 25 to 27 confer on the directors powers of prosecution under the Prices Acts and makes some consequential provisions in relation to authorised officers under those Acts.  I should like to emphasise once again that although detailed price control has been abolished all the powers under the Prices Acts available to me as Minister are being retained.  I have, in fact, used these powers recently to effect substantial reductions in the price of petrol and I will not hesitate to use these powers again in this and other areas if the need arises.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 to 37 contain the major amendments in the consumer protection area, and I would like to deal with these, if I may, in some detail.  The main purpose of section 28 is to confer on the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade the powers necessary to enable him to carry out his functions efficiently. For instance, the provisions of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, in relation to authorised officers are being amended to take account of a recent Supreme Court decision affecting authorisations. The section also removes local authorities' powers of prosecution under the <Col N="2492" /> Consumer Information Act and the Merchandise Marks Acts.  This is in line with the policy of having, as far as possible, a single enforcement agency.  However, the powers of the Minister under the Consumer Information Act are being retained as there may be circumstances in which use of such powers by me may be necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Section 30 confers on the director power to seek a High Court order to ensure the observance of the obligations imposed under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.  Section 33 confers prosecution powers on the director in relation to a wide range of consumer protection legislation.  The full list of the legislation in question is in the First Schedule to the Bill and, as I have already mentioned, concerns matters such as food labelling, textile labelling and product safety.  This legislation is at present enforced by myself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, but these powers of prosecution are now being transferred to the director.  Sections 34 and 35 further strengthen the enforcement function by, first of all, prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained in the course of an investigation and, secondly, providing for the creation of a specific offence for the impersonation of an authorised officer under any competition or consumer protection legislation.  The offences created under sections 34 and 35 will be prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal briefly with just a few of the remaining sections of the Bill.  Section 29 amends section 40 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, and has the effect of bringing electricity services within the scope of the Act.  This amendment is in keeping with the overall policy of bringing regulated services within the scope of competition and consumer protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for a pension scheme for the holder of the office of Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  This scheme will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and must also be approved by both Houses <Col N="2493" /> of the Oireachtas.  Section 37 introduces a new offence in the consumer protection area which will form part of the weights and measures legislative code.  The section prohibits the sale to the public of short weights or measures.  It is an important provision in the context of consumer protection.  Prosecutions for an offence under this section will be brought by the weights and measures inspectors. Finally, section 38 is a straightforward section the purpose of which is to provide that judicial notice should be taken by all courts of the signature of the director or a member of the commission.  Under the existing legislation, it is necessary for the relevant officer to attend in court to prove his signature.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House has found this explanation of the Bill of use.  I will be happy to answer points on which further clarification is needed.  I recommend that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill which I prepared when Minister for Industry and Commerce and it was published by my successor, Deputy Michael Noonan, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As to its general thrust, which is increasing the scope of the operation of restrictive practices legislation, so that monopolistic services provided by the State in the transport area and elsewhere should be subject to scrutiny to see whether unfair competition exists, we are all in favour of it.  We are also all in favour of the idea of tightening up the enforcement and investigation provisions. In the past, one had four agencies essentially working in the same areas, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the National Prices Commission, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Restrictive Practices Commission.  None of them had enough staff and they tended to get in one another's way.  I decided when Minister that all consumer protection agencies should be reduced from four to two in order to have quicker enforcement of legislation, and essentially this is all about consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am appalled at one of the <Col N="2494" /> amendments that was introduced to this Bill in the Seanad and the manner in which this amendment was introduced.  I refer to amendment No. 7 in the Minister's name in the list of amendments made to the section which excludes banking from the scope of unfair practices legislation.  This amendment was not even referred to by Deputy Brennan in the Seanad and no explanation whatever was offered for it.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the services were subject to investigation under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 subject to a number of exclusions which were contained in the definition section, section 1 of that Act.  These exclusions included the supply of electricity, services provided by CIE, air service, any transport service, any shipping service, any services provided by a local authority and any service being banking business within the meaning of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  In the new section which is contained in this Bill but which was not contained in the Bill as circulated in the Seanad, section 22, the definition of service in the Act of 1978 has been amended to the following: &ldquo;service&rdquo; includes any professional service, but does not include any service provided by the holder of a licence under section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, nor does it include any service provided by a trustee savings bank, any service provided under a contract of employment or any service provided by a local authority.  In other words, some of the exclusions that were removed by the original Bill as I understand it, have been reintroduced in that amendment, including the exclusion of banking. I can only read what the word says.  It says: &ldquo;service&rdquo; means any professional service but does not include any service provided by the holder of a licence under section 9&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has just said that the method has been changed. I should like to refer to his speech in the Seanad where no explanation whatever was given.  I refer to the debate on this new section 22 which appears at column 2766 in the Seanad Official Report.  The amendment was moved and the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, said absolutely nothing.  Senator Robinson had much to say about consumer protection, which, as far as I can see, has nothing to do with the section.  At no point did the Minister of State explain during the Seanad debate what this section was about.  The section contains the words &ldquo;excludes banking&rdquo;.  I am very worried about any prospect that banking would be excluded.  The Minister in his introductory speech today did not explain the purpose or the effect of the amendments made in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>If a change is made in legislation in one House as against the Bill as published by the previous Government and the present Government, that change should be explained.  It has not been explained by the Minister either in the Seanad or in his introductory speech. I cannot understand why he would not explain a change which seems, on the face of it, to reintroduce the exclusion of banking.</P>
      <P>The Minister can say it is for other people to figure out that sort of thing, that he does not have to explain it, that he is after all the Minister and that it is somebody else's problem.  It is not someone else's problem.  It is his problem and responsibility to explain any changes he makes to legislation here in this House and he has not done so on Second Stage of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has failed to explain changes which he introduced and he hopes, perhaps, to avoid a debate on the subject.  He will not.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned at the poor record over the years in enforcing orders made under the Restrictive Practices legislation.  I want to know what improvements in regard to enforcement the Minister envisages as a result of this legislation.  I should like to remind the House of a number of orders made under this legislation in the past.  We had the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973, under which there was one prosecution. A second order of the same type was also made in 1973 which did not result in any prosecutions.  Similarly there were no prosecutions under the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Orders of 1975 and 1978.  The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) (Amendment) Order, No. 2, 1978, led to no prosecutions.  There were no prosecutions under the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Orders of 1979 and 1980.  A second order of the same kind in 1980 still resulted in no prosecutions. The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981 led to 11 prosecutions &mdash; I concede that.  The Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oil) Order, 1981 resulted in no prosecutions.  It is not surprising that there have been no prosecutions following the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 12 orders made under Restrictive Practices legislation there have been prosecutions in respect of only three.  The rest have not been the subject of any prosecution.  I do not believe that our people are so law-abiding that every one of these orders was in all cases entirely abided by, yet there have been no prosecutions. Certainly no one can say that enough time is not taken in drafting the legislation to make sure it is capable of being the subject of prosecution.  The procedure by which such orders are drafted is immensely cumbersome.  There <Col N="2498" /> has to be an inquiry and a report before an order is prepared.  The order must be approved by the Minister and then by the House.  Yet after all that trouble in making these orders, the prosecution record has been extremely poor.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that of the 12 orders made only three are still in force. One must ask what was wrong with the original attempt to deal with the problem that the vast majority of the orders had to be dropped.  Was it that the problem was solved?  I know that in virtually all cases it was not.  I am referring only to orders made since 1972.  There were earlier orders which had an equally dismal record.  It would appear that the orders were not competently drafted in the first place.  We have an example of that in other legislation currently before the House in regard to below cost selling where there are some quite incredible definitions, relating for instance to seasonal goods.  One must ask whether competition policy is really working.  We have a very cumbersome procedure for making orders, but having made them we cannot or do not prosecute under them. In many cases the orders have to be dropped because they appear to be unworkable. I am sure there are explanations and more than one Government has been involved in this problem.  I am not directing my criticism at the present Minister; it is a criticism applicable to all of us.</P>
    <P>One of our besetting sins is that we have a tremendous ability to make new rules and laws and to announce these new rules and laws on numerous occasions with photo opportunities and the like, but when it comes to enforcing them our record is worse than dismal.  The record of the number of prosecutions under this legislation and the fact that so many of the orders had to be dropped speaks for itself.  We also have another order under this legislation concerned with banning below cost advertising.  That order has proved to be unenforceable.  The prosecutions failed on some form of technicality before one of the superior courts. I want to know if all the defects in the law which prevented the prosecutions being successful where there was a genuine case <Col N="2499" /> or defects which prevented prosecutions brought at all are now being remedied. Could we have an explanation as to why in respect of all but three of the orders made since 1972 no prosecutions have been taken?</P>
    <P>I would argue that this Bill is welcome. I can claim to have been responsible for having got this Bill up and running, but I recognise that in itself it is not a full adequate response to the problem of competition policy in this country.  It is a step forward certainly, and a good step forward, but it is not enough and we must not rest on our laurels.  I would ask the Minister if he would consider an alternative approach.  Under the 1972 Act, if a practice is decided to be either unfair or in restraint of trade, there can be an investigation into it.  After that investigation a report is made and then an order is made banning that particular practice.  But that investigative process takes up to two or three years, and meanwhile the consumer is potentially being ripped off.  This process means essentially that no law is made without prior investigation and any law made is specifically in respect of a particular complaint and a particular practice.  The fact that analogous practices are going on in other sectors of the economy does not matter. It is only the sector which is investigated that is affected by any ban on a practice that is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It would make more sense to see if certain types of activity should be made illegal <i>ab initio,</i> either in the sense that the Minister or the examiner would prosecute if people broke the law, or, and this might be less expensive, anybody adversely affected by a particular practice which is determined to be against the law could take a civil action for damages. Therefore, rather than introduce new general norms of competition policy into criminal law, we could introduce them into the civil law.</P>
    <P>We should consider doing what they have done in Greece.  They have taken the competition policy provisions of the Treaty of Rome &mdash; Articles 85 to 90 &mdash; and said that these competition policy rules of the Treaty of Rome shall apply <Col N="2500" /> in Greece, directly in Greek law, not solely in respect of trade between Greece and other countries, which is the province of the Commission, but in respect of trade between citizens of Greece, which is the province of the Greek Government. If you like, they have bought off the shelf a readymade system of law, and a system of precedents as determined by the European Court as to what is fair and unfair practice and that is applied directly domestically in Greece.  For example, the sort of things that are banned outright in Community law would include the direct or indirect fixing of purchasing or selling prices, limitations or control on productions, marketing technical development or investment, sharing of markets or sources of supply, applying similar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties never placing them at a competitive disadvantage, making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by other parties or supplementary obligations which by their nature and current commercial usage have no connection with the subject of such contracts, and any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to that article shall be automatically void.  Therefore any contract introduced which is anti-competitive is knocked out under the provisions of the legislation.  That would be a much more effective way of dealing with our competition policy.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter in recent times with the Commissioner responsible for competition policy, Commissioner Peter Sutherland.  He indicated that from his point of view he would welcome the introduction of general bans on anti-competitive practices along the lines of what has been done in Greece, in other words, introducing into domestic Irish law the provisions of the rules in the Treaty of Rome banning competition.</P>
    <P>This would be good for business because Irish firms engaged in practices here which were legal would know that they could engage in the same practices in trade with Northern Ireland because the same rules would apply to international trade as apply to domestic trade. At present one set of rules apply to what <Col N="2501" /> a person may do when he is supplying a service across a national boundary, say from Leitrim into Fermanagh, and another set of rules apply when he is supplying the same service from Leitrim into Cavan.  If he is supplying the service from Leitrim to Fermanagh he is bound by EC rules on competition, in other words, by Article 85 and subsequent Articles of the Treaty, but if he is providing these services from Leitrim into Cavan, he is bound by this Bill which essentially does not give him much guidance because there will be no prohibition unless and until the investigation of a particular practice is introduced.  That is wasteful and is not helpful to business.</P>
    <P>It might make a lot of sense if, rather than approaching the matter from the point of view of building incrementally on our existing legislation and tightening it up as we are doing, we should look at a more radical approach of introducing bans on practices which would prevent them ever starting as against the present situation where a bad practice has to be in existence for some time, then investigated and an order made before it is banned.</P>
    <P>I will concede the Minister the point I am sure he wants to make that this is a radical idea and that if I approved of it why did I not do it when I had the opportunity.  The fact is that the discussions I had with Commissioner Sutherland which drew this approach to my attention occurred rather late in the period of office of our Government and this legislation was already on the stocks. While I did ask the Department, if I recollect correctly, to look at the general question of banning certain practices outright rather than this cumbersome investigative procedure, I did not get to the point of being able to do anything substantive about it.</P>
    <P>I feel this is the next stage in the development of competition policy in Ireland and it would be a much better way of dealing with the problem than the one we are using in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to investigate this as a matter of urgency.  There is a particular problem in <Col N="2502" /> regard to this legislation regarding imports.  There is a danger that some of the orders made under this legislation may have the effect of encouraging imports, a difficulty which would not exist if we adopted the approach I was suggesting of incorporating the provisions of the Treaty into domestic law because the same provisions would apply to imports as well as to goods supplied from within the State.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain this by reference to another debate progressing in the House without getting involved in that debate. Under the below-cost selling provisions we have a requirement in regard to invoices that one may not sell below a certain published invoiced price. That is fine if both the supplier and the receiver of the goods are within the jurisdiction but if the supplier is from outside the jurisdiction he can manipulate his invoice prices and the examiner has no way of investigating whether they are genuine.  Equally, a supplier who has stores or manufacturing facilities in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland or a retailer who has stores here and in Northern Ireland has the possibility of manipulating prices internally so as to show almost any price he likes.  Those people can supply goods to Northern Ireland and transport them back here. Unless somebody is employed to follow the trucks it will not be possible to know what the prices are.  That provision cannot be enforced.</P>
    <P>What will happen in respect of the ban on below-cost selling is that it will be much easier for people to buy imported goods because there will not be any of those controls, the examiner will not be able to check on whether the prices are genuine or not or whether there are two sets of invoices.  That will lead to a diversion of trade from domestic suppliers to importers.  That is an illustration of the possible area of danger that can exist in legislation like this.  This type of national approach to the elimination of restrictive practices was fine when there was relatively little trade but now not only can goods be supplied across boundaries but, <Col N="2503" /> increasingly, services are being supplied across boundaries.  Having one strict régime applying in the Republic is of very little use if a much more lax régime applies in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.  People will divert activity to the part of the Community where the restrictions, reporting requirements or whatever mechanisms of enforcement are used are less onerous.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to enforce competition policy more rigorously could lead to a diversion of trade out of the State.  That is something I am most concerned about. I should like to raise a query about an amendment to the Bill passed by the Seanad.  In the Bill as initiated section 10 reads:</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) after &ldquo;may&rdquo; of &ldquo;on their own initiative or&rdquo;, and the said subsection (1), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P>(1) The Commission may, on their own initiative or on the recommendation of the Examiner or at the request of an association representing persons engaged either in the supply and distribution of goods or in the provision of services, prepare and publish rules representing, in the opinion of the Commission, fair practice conditions with regard to the supply and distribution of such goods or the provision of such service.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Services&rdquo; as I understand it under the amendment, will now no longer include any services provided by a local authority within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  That is separate from an amendment containing another definition of &ldquo;services&rdquo; which was inserted before section 21.  &ldquo;Services&rdquo; is being defined differently in two places in the Bill.  Will the Minister say why services provided by local authorities are to be excluded from the definition of services in this legislation?  It seems to me that if local authorities are engaging in unfair trading practices any services they provide should be investigated.  I do not think the Minister explained that in his <Col N="2504" /> speech today.  In the time at my disposal I was unable to check whether Deputy Brennan gave an explanation in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one person can be in charge.  My main concern is that there should be no dilution of the scope of competition policy legislation.  In other words, banking and local government services should be included.  Amendments introduced in the Seanad should not have the effect of excluding them from all the powers that are applied to others.  In the medium and long term, rather than proceeding with the present cumbersome procedure dealing with unfair competition, which involves the practice growing up, the practice being investigated, orders being recommended, orders being made and the practice being banned in a particular sector, we should go for a more general statement of what shall be illegal, either under civil or criminal law, in the area of competition using the Treaty of Rome as the basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend that as part of a review of competition policy legislation which, hopefully, will take place soon, that a more general approach be adopted.  If that happened &mdash; and this is a point I did not make before &mdash; a lot of the staff time taken up at present conducting inquiries and investigations could be devoted to <Col N="2505" /> prosecution.  There would be no need to carry out these inquiries anymore.  The law could be established by the incorporation of the Treaty in domestic law. All efforts could be devoted to enforcing the law and officials would not have to engage in the rigmarole of investigations, which are so time-consuming.  I am aware that the Restrictive Practices Commission have to conduct hearings which are almost as laborious as court hearings and to which they invite people, some of whom are legally represented, and all sorts of obstruction is engaged in by those who do not want certain practices to be banned.  The report to be published has to take its place in the queue in the Government printing office because it cannot be brought into effect until it is published.  All that sort of delay would be swept away if the provisions of the Treaty of Rome were incorporated in Irish law in relation to unfair competition. All those resources could be devoted to going after people who break the law.  Indeed, to a great extent, it would not fall on the Minister to enforce this law because the commission would enforce it if there was any involvement of trade and people who are adversely affected would take civil action against those who were adversely affecting them, seeking damages for particular practices. It would only be in the case where civil remedies had failed that the Minister or the enforcement authorities would be involved in taking prosecutions.  That would be a better way of dealing with the problem in the long term and I urge the Minister to look seriously at it.</P>

I should also like to make some observations in regard to the general approach underlying the Bill and comment <Col N="2506" /> on specific aspects without going into too much detail which can be reserved for Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>When I had some time on my hands I took the liberty of reading the Minister's speech to the Seanad which is identical to that which he made this morning, with the exception of a few paragraphs.  I do not know whether that is normal, it must be very boring for the Minister to have to read the same speech twice.

      <P>The Minister said in the Seanad that the Bill removes the exclusions from the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 in the areas of communications, banking and electricity.  Therefore, some confusion is not unreasonable and there is a point to be answered.  The Bill appears to be tinkering with the problem to a large extent.  I know it is not possible to deal with all aspects of consumer legislation in one Bill but if its primary purpose is to streamline consumer legislation, it is reasonable to say what those priorites should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must come back to the basic point that there is obvious evidence of fairly massive consumer exploitation, particularly in relation to exorbitant pricing and profiteering.  It is clear, taking all things into account, that the Irish food basket is the most expensive in Europe and that much of this is not justified.  It is due to greed and inadequate consumer protection, which is not helped by the <Col N="2507" /> Bill, and exorbitant profits at a number of levels.  For example, there is evidence from a variety of sources to show that the Irish housewife pays an average of £6 more per week than she should be paying for basic foodstuffs.  There are also serious problems relating to standards in terms of quality, cleanliness and inadequate labelling.  Some imported foodstuffs, treated with radiation for the purpose of prolonging shelf life, are freely sold without any labelling or qualification and without any scientific evidence being available as to whether detrimental effects could arise from such artificial prolongation of their natural life.</P>
    <P>As the Minister also indicated, when he referred to the scrapping of price control, it is now very clear that scrapping it and surveillance machinery was a serious mistake.  Such monitoring by the State, which is the ultimate &mdash; the last guarantor &mdash; acting on behalf of the public, must be reintroduced.  Very severe sanctions should be imposed on those abusing the system.  Many foodstuffs are sold with inadequate labelling or none.  Many labels contain generalities using such words as &ldquo;colouring&rdquo;, &ldquo;permitted preservatives&rdquo; and so on.  Generalisations should be outlawed and regular random checking of the accuracy of labels and prices should be undertaken with severe penalties for abusers.  This is not so much a matter for business ethics as a fundamental matter of public health and I am not convinced that this legislation will do anything in those respects.  All irradiated food, which many people believe incurs nutritional deficiencies, should be clearly labelled so that the consumer can choose that food or something else.</P>
    <P>All Acts governing public services, such as An Post, Telecom Éireann, the ESB, communal television, publicly funded education and so on should be reformed to give consumers the same rights in relation to these as obtained in the case of most private services.  The State and semi-State sector should account for themselves following the <Col N="2508" /> same criteria which applies to other services. The Minister should introduce consumer legislation to ensure a right of access to personal files in public agencies such as hospitals and credit assessment bodies with the right to have corrections made where needed.  It is preposterous that a citizen does not have an automatic right to medical records of their immediate next of kin, for example, and that in some cases they have had to have recourse to law to obtain death certificates and medical data.  That is an area of funadmental consumer priority.</P>
    <P>Severe sanctions should be introduced for non-compliance with enforcement of price display orders but it seems that surveillance in that respect is more honoured in the breach than in the observance. That whole area has simply been dismantled.  Tough legislation regularising the growth of monopoly firms, including suppliers, middle men, supermarkets, distributors and so on should be introduced providing for such bodies, if necessary, to divest themselves of outlets or subsidiaries rather than tinkering with trading conditions on the ground that they are costly to implement, bureaucratic and ineffective.  Much of our approach to legislation is precisely that, it is micro management, dealing with the symptoms rather than the root causes.  It will not succeed because it would need an army of civil servants, inspectors and people in the field to police these regulations, particularly when most of them are backed up by fines and penalties which are woefully inadequate and which are derisory in the context of the profits made by some of the people abusing the present system.</P>
    <P>Rigorous analysis of price variances should be reintroduced by the Department. The prices of goods and services, where overcharging is suspected, should be published.  The names of stores who abuse the law or regulations should also be published and severe action taken in the consumer interest.  The Minister should introduce a small claims court to give cheap, informal and rapid decisions on small claims.  That would be extremely relevant and of interest to consumers who <Col N="2509" /> are increasingly uninterested in reporting or complaining, simply because they no longer believe that there is adequate recourse for them.  In short, the Bill is merely tinkering with existing legislation rather than making fundamental changes or proposing serious innovations.  I do not believe that it makes a significant contribution towards dealing with the fundamental problems of consumer exploitation which is rampant and in respect of which we should be particularly concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill tries to tidy up aspects of the present arrangements for dealing with the consumer interest in general.  Unfortunately, those arrangements, well intentioned as they are and hard working as the people behind them are, are inadequate because there is overriding evidence that at every level the consumer is being exploited.  I and my colleagues will produce our own consumer charter proposing legislation which we hope will help, and which will be based on extremely severe sanctions which we hope will be pre-emptive in terms of clearly demonstrating to anyone concerned that crime in this area will not pay.  This will apply whether it relates to abuse of standards of quality affecting public health or whether in relation to extracting exorbitant profits from a public already suffering from economic burdens including taxation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Bill misses much of those points.  It might be said that that is not the purpose of the Bill.  If this House is to deal with priorities and if the purpose of the Bill is, as the Minister said, to deal in a particular way with aspects of consumer legislation, it misses the target.  Our basic approach to this issue would be what is called the prohibition approach, the underlying principle being that in normal circumstances economic efficiency is promoted through the promotion of competition, that any significant interference with that competition may be contrary to the public interest and that in that context certain practices will be prohibited absolutely or might be subject to an overall prohibition <Col N="2510" /> with the possibility of exemption in the context of specific applications.  General principles will be laid down that certain things will be unacceptable but a business or an organisation could apply for exemption.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an approach which attempts to control abuses.  It tries to spot trouble points on the consumer landscape and deal with them by regulation.  That approach has failed.  It is not the approach favoured throughout Europe.  Throughout Europe norms are set in place which by definition protect the public.  Any deviation from those norms is automatically seen as a breach of the law unless an exemption has been obtained. Such a prohibition approach is what we recommend, rather than the nit picking micromanagement which goes on in terms of regulation by Government and which this Bill epitomises in many respects.  The control of abuse system is cumbersome and slow and sometimes unfairly discriminatory.  It will respond where a complaint is made but it will not deal with a bigger abuse about which no one complains.  That approach lacks legal certainty and is less effective in its enforcement.  The general prohibition system is more effective in preventing the restrictions on competition and it is more efficient and fairer.  It also has the advantage of greater clarity in the assessment criteria and a greater degree of legal certainty. Prohibition, with the possibility of exemptions, can be used positively to stimulate competition and to encourage co-operation between small and medium sized firms.  This latter, in the European context would include most Irish firms, especially, in the development of export market activities.</P>
    <P>Four founder members of the EC have long had this kind of prohibition type of legislation which I am recommending to the House, Germany, France, Luxembourg and The Netherlands.  Prior to accession, the three newest member states, Greece, Spain and Portugal introduced competition laws along the lines of Community law.  At the end of 1986 French competition law was amended to reflect more closely Articles 85 and 86 of <Col N="2511" /> the Treaty which are the underpinning Articles of this philosophy.  Adoption of this approach is now being strongly urged in the UK.  We urge the Minister to adopt the principle that Irish competition law should be based on prohibition with the possibility of exemptions, and that that prohibition should apply to agreements and concerted practices and to the abuse of a dominant position and should be supervised by a competition or a fair trades commission so that the positive aspects can be emphasised.  It is not possible in the light of our experience of the woefully inadequate implementation of regulations or the clear examples of abuse throughout the system, for Bills of this nature, based on a control of abuse system using Government regulations and civil servants to protect the consumer, to work.  Such legislation has not worked as can be ascertained from a glance at any of the reports of the Director of Consumer Affairs of the Fair Trades Commission or of the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>We need a more fundamental approach which lays down basic rules, for example, to the effect that certain types of practices are unacceptable, or that there cannot be a concentration of ownership in relation to multiple chain stores more than X percentage.  We should not work on the basis of complaints from frustrated consumers.  That has not worked and the people in Europe involved in this area of industry and commerce have told us that.  We need a fundamentally different approach.  We should not tinker around with the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  We need a different outlook on how to protect the consumer, setting broad standards, laying down the law and indicating that those who abuse the law will pay severely for it.  Anyone who breaks the law by putting public health at risk or by using inadequate labelling or by mislabelling is a criminal and should be treated as such.  Anybody who systematically steals from the consumers is a criminal and should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>The fines we have are derisory.  We have a very weird idea as to what are <Col N="2512" /> appropriate responses in these cases.  I recently had a constitutent who was sentenced to six months in jail for stealing 200 cigarettes and on the same day somebody got out of court having allegedly robbed from the taxpayer something like £200,000.  If we are to depend on individual consumers to complain before we have investigations and inquiries &mdash; and I am allowing for the fact that the system set up by the Minister can initiate certain complaints &mdash; what will happen is that we will only nibble at the edges of this problem instead of having a centralised attack on the key issues at its heart.  The people exploiting consumers must know that we are serious about this and they should be able to see in place the kind of laws and norms which are now becoming standard throughout Europe.  That is what I and my party are asking for.</P>
    <P>A number of practices which would adversely affect competition would in these circumstances be prohibited, for example, price fixing and withholding of supplies, practices referred to in the most recent report of the Director of Consumer Affairs, market sharing, entry limitations, and collusive tendering.  All of those facets of business which arise from either a dominant position in the market or from the safe knowledge that by the time the Department catch up with the abusers, it would nevertheless have been a good investment, will be eliminated. It is pitiful to meet people who have been abused and who in truth have no redress because the kind of redress they get is far too little and far too late. There should be a notification requirement for restrictive agreements, for example, and a complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>There should be a notification requiretions,  for general and individual agreements. I do not suggest that there are not a lot of cases where the norms laid down will be unfair in specific instances, but the onus should be put on those areas of trade to apply for such exemptions. Either the Minister or the appropriate body should grant such applications if they are warranted, but not in the way it presently operates.  Coverage should be extended to sectors currently exempted, for example, to energy, transport and <Col N="2513" /> banking, about which there has been some talk this morning.  Mergers, since they require individual assessment, would be treated more by way of a control of abuse approach.  There should be provisions for price control in the event of the malfunctioning of competition in certain markets.  That is our broad philosophy in that respect.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is my place to say this, but I have just been informed that the dentist who was kidnapped has been released.  I am sure I am not out of order in saying that all of us in this House extend our heartfelt and sincere congratulations to the Garda for their excellent work in the past number of weeks. We also extend our heartfelt best wishes to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go on but it is right that we express, on behalf of everyone in this House, our solidarity and best wishes to Mr. O'Grady and to his family who have suffered an incredible trauma.  We express our unanimous pleasure at this very happy outcome.  I have no doubt that in due course the Minister for Justice will wish to make a statement on the matter in this House. To the Garda and to the O'Grady family we extend our sincerest congratulations and good wishes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill before the House, it is perfectly clear that some measure of improvement was necessary. The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, has not worked well.  Very few inquiries were made, the prosecution of breaches of the orders was disappointing and the relations between the examiner and the commission, and sometimes perhaps even the Minister, were strained.  It was simply inadequate.  Under that Act the powers and the functions of the Fair Trade Commission were divided between the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Mergers, Take-overs and <Col N="2514" /> Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, mergers above a certain size should have been notified to the Minister who might allow them.  However, under that Act there were very few referrals to the examiner and there was no prohibition of a merger, although admittedly the existence of those procedures may have discouraged some undesirable mergers. There have been no referrals to the commission under monopoly provisions.  One might say that perhaps they were pre-emptive and discouraged abuses but it is perfectly clear that on the economic horizon there are dominant conglomerate ownerships which are not in the public interest.  It is only right and fair to ask if the legislation worked why was it not more usefully exercised?</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the Restrictive Practices Commission are to be retitled the Fair Trade Commission and the post of Examiner and Director of Consumer Affairs is to be merged to create a Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade. The scope of the legislation has been extended, with certain services which were previously exempt now covered, for example, banking, electricity, road transport, air transport and shipping and harbour authority services.  However, there is a doubt about the banking provision and I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify that matter.  It now appears to be included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by one point which the Minister made this morning.  Deputy Bruton raised the matter of the status of the banks in terms of this Bill and the Minister said that section 23 is being repealed in order to remove the exemption which licensed banks at present enjoy, thus making them subject to the supervision of the Director of Consumers Affairs and Fair Trade in so far as advertising is concerned.  It is the policy of my party, and that policy has been increasingly pressed upon us in recent times by the activities of the banks, that the banks in particular should be amenable to standards and criteria which are the norm throughout the economy.  They should not be in any sheltered position and should be open to be investigated not just <Col N="2515" /> in relation to their advertising standards but in all of their practices whether they be restrictive practices, the practices of usury, the practices of setting up subsidiary bodies, which now have the same impact on people's socio-economic standards as hire purchase companies had when the banks reviled them, or any other area of their activities.  There should be disclosure not of personal accounts but of general trading patterns in relation to the banks.</P>
    <P>If that was the norm I have no doubt that we would not have had the spectacle some months ago of the banks being publicly associated with the extension to creditors of the H. Williams chain of assurances that everything was all right when it was clear to everyone in the business that not only was everything not all right but was on the point of collapse.  I want the Minister to clarify in the House, without equivocation or qualification, whether the banks are involved in this legislation on the same basis as every other service to which the legislation extends.  That is the key issue in that respect.</P>
    <P>I note that services provided under a contract of service were brought within the scope of the 1972 Act but not the 1978 Act.  While local authority services are outside the scope of both of these Acts, the saver for anything done in the exercise of statutory duty is dropped from the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>The powers of the commission are being extended.  They may initiate inquiries except in the case of a monopoly. They may request the director to undertake an investigation.  They, instead of the director, may investigate mergers. They are given powers to obtain information under a study outlined in section 12 and they are given power to appoint authorised officers.  I am interested in obtaining some elaboration on this.  I want to know whether the director and the commission can initiate these inquiries of their own accord or do they have to be prompted in some way?  For example, will there be any response by them to prompting from, say, individual Members of this House or members of <Col N="2516" /> the public?  In other words, are there criteria which might hedge or inhibit them from pursuing inquiries which they would wish to pursue or are they unfettered and unlimited both in terms of self-initiated inquiries and inquiries suggested by the public?</P>
    <P>The director is given power to prosecute offences and I am pleased with that. The Minister is given the power to make an order without a prior inquiry, but after possible consultation with the commission, the director and other Ministers. That is a step in the right direction.  We feel that the EC law is directly applicable in Ireland and is perhaps particularly appropriate here because of our relatively vulnerable and isolated market position.  The EC law co-exists with the fundamentally different Irish competition law.  It is based on the prohibition principle which I spoke about, whereas the Irish law is based upon the control of abuse principle.  I want to see a quantum movement, a shift, in the direction of the EC norm rather than the control of abuse principle which we have tried to operate here.  Articles 85 and 86 are obviously the foundation stone on which that approach is based and countries have already taken major steps in that respect.</P>
    <P>I note that in spite of statements in the industrial policy document, the White Paper of the previous Government, in the document, <i>Building on Reality</i> and certain observations made in the Fianna Fáil election document, <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the post of Examiner of Restrictive Practices, regarded as an unnecessary quango-type additional layer of bureaucracy, is not being abolished. Instead, the new relationship between the commission and the director could be even worse than the old strained and unsatisfactory relationship.  While the commission can initiate inquiries under the proposals, the director can also require the commission to hold an inquiry as before.  At the same time, the commission can require the director to undertake an investigation.  The director seems to be at the same time both the master and the servant of the commission and the converse is also true, both having <Col N="2517" /> considerable autonomy.  This seems to be asking for trouble.  It is putting these officers in very difficult positions and it is also a questionable use of resources particularly when there are limited resources available to both bodies.</P>
    <P>There seems to be little or nothing in the proposal to replace the National Prices Commission and the prices division that will ensure effective price control and price surveillance.  I am not interested in who dismantled these or why.  I am simply saying that it was a mistake.  The consumer has to resort to Government as being the ultimate guarantor.  There is now effectively no way of complaining because there is no one who can handle those complaints.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the documents produced, for example, the Director of Consumer Affairs annual report for 1985, one will see that out of the whole of this country and out of all the activities, commercial and otherwise, the director summarises activities that year as follows: 540 complaints were received relating to allegedly false or misleading descriptions; prosecutions were taken in 11 cases resulting in a conviction on at least one count in nine of those cases; there were over 14,000 complaints and inquiries about unsatisfactory goods and services received, mainly by telephone, during that year.  The director goes on to say how they were dealt with.  It is obviously, to any thinking person, a vast understatement of the size and scale of the problem to suggest that that was the net problem.  It clearly was not.  It is no wonder that people have virtually given up complaining and now accept the rip-off factor which is highlighted, day in and day out, often in popular radio programmes such as the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; which has been doing this for years and doing it accurately and well.  The frustrations of the ordinary citizens are vented on such programmes because they cannot be ventilated or pursued in any other way.</P>
    <P>A major omission from this Bill is a mechanism for effective price control or price surveillance to replace institutions <Col N="2518" /> which may have had problems but at least were there and did some work in that respect.  The emphasis is on producing competitive markets to do the job instead.  Even if this is achieved, which is far from certain, it will be difficult and will take a very long time.  Whatever about the abolition of the National Prices Commission, experience has demonstrated that the scrapping of price control and surveillance machinery was completely mistaken, badly mistimed and should be redressed.</P>
    <P>I note as well that in relation to European practice it is perfectly clear that this country lags behind in a number of respects.  The bulletin of the European Community, supplement 6 of 86, entitled <i>A New Impetus for Consumer Protection Policy</i> says that the first impetus for consumer protection policy was given by heads of State and Government in October 1972 and deals with the main thrust of that particular policy which was essentially the protection of the consumer against health and safety risks, the protection of consumers' economic interests, the improvement of the consumers' legal position, improvement of consumer education and information and appropriate consultation and representation of consumers in the taking of decisions affecting their interests.  It is fair to say &mdash; and I am sad to say &mdash; that under each of those five headings this country has to be close to the bottom of the international league whether it is the protection of consumer health, economic interests, legal position, consumer education which is nonexistent, or appropriate consultation and representation of consumers in the taking of decisions affecting their interests.  In that latter context we have one voluntary organisation, the Consumers' Association, which has to exist from hand to mouth.  Would it not be an idea to channel towards them some of the savings now being garnered from this move to assist them in their work?</P>
    <P>Under the key points of policy which apply and are pursued throughout Europe, there is no achievable demonstrable progress here.  The bulletin I referred to gave four reasons for that. <Col N="2519" /> The first adverse influence was the economic recession; another break in the development of community legislation was the view that matters of issue in this area are the business of individual Governments, not of the community; the third issue was the question of unanimity required for the approximation of laws and an example was given of one particular country blocking a proposal to deal with doorstep selling for over a year while the fourth limiting factor was the practice of proposals prescribing rules for a restricted range of goods and ingredients. There are reasons why everything cannot be done at once.  But a look at any of the other European countries will tell us how we should proceed in this respect.  To date we have fallen very far behind.</P>
    <P>What I and my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats want to do is to put consumer legislation and protection back at the centre of the agenda and not as a peripheral area of industry and commerce. It is our view that the two should perhaps be separated.  The interests of pursuing industrial activity and economic development may very well be, in many cases, at their heart, the antithesis of that which should be the case in relation to consumer legislation, because industrial policy will often concern itself with output, with growth, with employment, with economic activity without regard or reference to rights of individuals.  But the interests of the consumer is a person centred, careful qualitative area of concern. I wonder whether it is appropriate that consumer legislation should fall at all within the remit of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I and my colleagues have a doubt about that because we see that the same Minister, who may very well be harried and harassed in terms of trying to get industry into Ireland or industry in Ireland up and going, will at the same time be told that in some cases that proposal may very well act against the interests of the consumer.  To some extent therefore there is a conflict of interests at the heart of that juxtaposition and it should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>In section 3 we note the removal of <Col N="2520" /> some exempted services, and that may be desirable.  Banking is still excluded however from the mergers and monopolies provisions of the Bill.  That is challengeable. I am convinced that is what Deputy Bruton was talking about this morning.  I do not know why there should be this exclusion.  If there is any area that is more open to abuse based on a monopolitic position in the marketplace surely it is the banking area underpinning all economic activity.  Perhaps there is some other way of dealing with it.  Perhaps the Minister has something else in mind, but he should tell us.  I do not see a reason for excluding from mergers and monopolies provisions, and the law governing those provisions, the areas of banking and the Trustee Savings Banks simply because of their pivotal role in the economy.  I am not satisfied to be told that the Central Bank has certain controls or supervisions in place.  Ultimately this House has to accept responsibility in relation to governing banking standards and practice and there is ample evidence, as I have already indicated, to indicate basic causes for concern in the way the banks operate in this economy.  We have had examples only recently in the H. Williams case.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of restrictive labour practices could be a major problem.  It should be explored.  There are still important exemptions however and there is nothing to stop a service being exempted under other legislation as happened, regrettably, in the case of telephone services. One of the things we want to do there is to ensure that in that particular case the various kinds of services excluded by various Acts, services which have a monopoly of essential supply, become again accountable to the public.  Unfortunately one of the drawbacks of removing them from within the ambit of control directly of the Minister has been a shift in accountability and the refusal by some of them to be accountable to the public.  So an essential element in this Bill which is headed the Restictive Practices Bill &mdash; there is hardly anything more restrictive than, for example, a State controlled or <Col N="2521" /> semi-State controlled monopoly of telephone or communication services &mdash; should have been a provision in which public services such as An Post, Telecom Éireann, the ESB who are increasingly arrogant in the way they treat inquiries, communal television and publicly funded education and a range of other services should now be examined and reformed with all the areas of legislation that impinge on them so that consumers would have the same rights there as they have elsewhere and so that these bodies would become accountable.</P>
    <P>I wrote recently to the Chief Executive of the ESB, sending on a letter from my constituent saying that he had observed a group of men regularly &mdash; as we say in North Dublin &mdash; dossing, doing nothing but nevertheless in the employ of the ESB.  I sent this letter confidentially to the ESB top brass in the hope that something would happen.  I got back a letter which was arrogant and discourteous, which took me to task for passing on a letter like that and for entertaining a constituent who would make that suggestion. The letter said that the chief executive had other things to do with his time than be worrying whether people on the ground were working or not.  I am deliberately taking this public opportunity of saying that the arrogance underlying that letter indicates that there is unfortunately a cocoon of non-accountability surrounding people like that.  I replied saying that, unfortunately or otherwise, I am accountable and must answer these questions and that if the gentleman concerned and others like him were doing their jobs properly they would have been appreciative of public interest and would have said that they would attend to the problem.</P>
    <P>If the gentleman involved wants to respond publicly, he is quite welcome to do so.  I have the correspondence and will make it available to anyone.  I am just using it as an example of the difficulties which one has in getting accountability from some bodies once they are removed from the State's ambit.  Bear in mind that <Col N="2522" /> that letter was from a public representative, not that that makes it a big deal <i>per se,</i> but it basically means that the ordinary citizen simply will not get a reply and regularly does not from people like those in the semi-State bodies that I have mentioned.  They do not bother answering awkward questions.  I want any Bill which is entitled a Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill to deal with bodies like that and make them comply with standards which are seen as the norm and in the public interest.  They are and should be accountable and if they are not accountable voluntarily, then I am all for regulating and legislating to ensure accountability.</P>
    <P>In section 5 the change of the name to the Fair Trade Commission is a positive step but the title of director seems to give him the appearance of competition supremo, which is misleading.  That is not what he is, but I have no doubt that there will be misunderstanding about that unless the matter is clarified and his title perhaps changed.</P>
    <P>In sections 6 and 7 a transfer of some powers from the examiner to the commission is welcome, although there are some anomalies with which I should like the Minister to deal.  For example, under the 1972 Act the Minister can now approach the commission directly rather than having to go through the examiner, but he must still go through the examiner in the case of a monopoly inquiry under the 1978 Act.  In addition, while the commission may initiate a restrictive practices inquiry under the 1972 Act, they cannot initiate a monopoly inquiry under the 1978 Act, although they can initiate a study into a monopoly under the 1972 Act.  It is an anomalous position.  The Minister has a different capacity to respond under the 1972 Act and the 1978 Act.  That seems to be problematic.</P>
    <P>In section 8 the Minister gives himself powers to make an order after consultation without the need for a prior inquiry.  This could be useful because a study at present cannot be followed by an order but only by full scale legislation and it could lead to orders being made without proper consideration of the <Col N="2523" /> issues beforehand.  This just could happen, but I hope it will not.  In addition, in providing for consultation with, among others, the director before making an order, this seems to give an unacceptable role of adviser rather than investigator to the director.  It gives him a different job fundamentally from that which he at present has, or indeed should have.  His job is to investigate, to act in pursuit of inquiry, not to be, as it were, the policy director.  There is again a conflict there. The role of adviser is a function properly belonging to the commission and that should be seen to be so and explicit in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 11 and 13, where powers of initiative are given to the commission, are acceptable and commendable; also section 14 where power is given to the commission to obtain documents and information in the course of a section 12 study is essential.  I should like to know the scope of that, whether it might extend to areas that I have mentioned earlier on in relation to documents and data in the hands of, for example, medical authorities. As somebody who has had some unpleasant experience in that respect, I should like to know whether it is conceivable that that recourse to insisting on documentation would extend to medical data on, for example, the next-of-kin of an applicant.</P>
    <P>In section 15 the commission are further directed to undertake investigation, which could be useful but could lead to difficulty.  In any case, the commission are now empowered to carry on their own investigations under section 16 which is very desirable, so recourse to the director could be unnecessary duplication.  The Minister might clarify that point.</P>
    <P>In section 17 and 19 the giving of powers of prosecution to the director is a major improvement, if there is to be a director.  This should be the director's only, or certainly primary, function.  A major defect in implementing competition law to date has been the appallingly poor record of enforcement undertaken by successive Ministers.  That enforcement simply has not happened.</P>
    <P>In section 18 the penalties are <Col N="2524" /> increased under the 1972 Act but the increase is insufficient.  It is still arguable, to anyone who makes a calculated, cold assessment of the facts and figures, that taking a chance will ultimately result in a better return economically, even if one has to take on board the penalties suggested in this Bill.  The penalties should also be increased under the 1978 Act but they are unchanged in this measure.  The actual penalties imposed, for example, for advertising at below cost have been derisory.  They were used deliberately by multiples who abused the system as a means of getting free publicity.  They advertised saying that they had been prosecuted for selling below cost and that they were going to carry on doing so and asking the public to come and shop in their stores and, of course, the public flocked in as naturally they would.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that there is no requirement for the commission to produce an annual report whereas one must be produced by the director.  That commission are the primary body in domestic competition matters at the moment and in EC matters, as they attend the advisory committee and are involved in the OECD.  While they can produce an annual report and have always done so, it seems that there should be a statutory requirement that this be done and that the report be published in order to get very clear standards and to assure that people will not, on their own initiative, have a cost cutting exercise and decide to dispense with a particular document or report.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that I should like to discuss, but I do not wish to delay the House.  There are points which I look forward to discussing on Committee Stage.  I note in passing that the Consumers' Association have specifically asked that the penalties for offences be increased and also that they would be dealing with the monopoly situation, particularly in relation to Telecom's monopoly, to ensure adequate performance and service.  I hope that the Minister will take on board those reasonable requests, which we support.  I look forward in due <Col N="2525" /> course to having an interesting Committee Stage of the Bill and I am grateful for the opportunity of being able to contribute today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for his continued great activity in bringing forward reforming legislation.  A number of Bills have emanated from his Department.  It is a great tribute to the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department as a whole that we are discussing this and other legislation which, from the consumer's point of view, will strengthen their rights and entitlements.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a great deal which is new but one of the fundamental aspects is the concentration in one agency, the Fair Trade Commission, of a whole plethora of existing legislation which, as already referred to by previous speakers, has resulted in very few successful prosecutions over the last ten years or so. That is probably an indictment of the legislation that has been in position. There is no doubt that consumers still feel hard done by in relation to their rights and entitlements with regard to the purchasing of a product or a service.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the primary purpose of the Bill is to streamline the operation and to extend the scope of existing competition and consumer protection legislation.  I am sure we all welcome that proposition because in our own way we have all come up against situations where the ordinary man in the street feels cheated of a service or a product rightly sought and paid for.  That is the nub of the problem which this Bill is trying to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main intention of this Bill is to strenghten competition policy and it is an extension of the scope of competition legislation. This is to be welcomed. There has been much reference to the regulated services sector including communications, banking and electricity. Under this Bill the Minister will be in a position to investigate bank charges and, again, that is most welcome.  Many <Col N="2526" /> people are becoming increasingly critical of the level of charges on their transactions with the banks.  The banks seem to be able to impose any charge they wish on the customer.  Under this legislation the Minister will be allowed for the first time to investigate these charges, to see how they are compiled and levied and, if necessary, take action to strike them out. He is to be complimented on this provision.</P>
    <P>There is much concern among the public at the level of charges which are levied by the banks and about the failure of the banks to offer interest on current accounts.  This amounts to unfair treatment on the part of the banks who can set their own interest rates.  The Minister should find out how the banks compile these charges, how they levy them and should take any action possible to strike out these charges.  In doing so he would have our full support.  He should make it impossible for the banks to levy these charges.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the ESB.  The main complaint which consumers have of the ESB is about the additional charges which have been appearing over the last number of years on the bills issued every two months.  These additional charges can amount to a very considerable sum. Many people ask why the ESB should be entitled to levy these extra charges without giving any explanation to their customers.  With the ESB holding a monopoly in the supply of power the customer is at a distinct disadvantage when seeking to query his bill with the ESB or when seeking to come to any alternative arrangement or understanding with them.  When making representations to the ESB on behalf of people who find themselves in difficult circumstances I have found that they can be a very difficult organisation to deal with.  Presumably this has something to do with the fact that they hold the monopoly in the supply of electricity.</P>
    <P>The ESB have been criticised consistently on the grounds of their lack of accountability in levying charges.  The people would welcome a commitment from the Minister that he will tackle both <Col N="2527" /> bank and ESB charges.  The results of his investigations could prove interesting and also very fruitful if he were then to proceed to the next step which would be to deal with the charges which are levied by the ESB and the banks.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to address himself to these two issues.</P>
    <P>The same also applies to the level of charges which are levied by Telecom Éireann.  Again, they hold a monopoly in the supply of communication services. There is increasing concern at the level of charges imposed by them for the use of the facilities they provide, such as telephone, telecommunications, Fax services and so on.  The Minister should find a way under this Bill in which to investigate how these charges are arrived at.  This Bill has its merits and in due course, when enacted, will prove very beneficial for the consumer.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to the part of the Bill which deals with fines.  I take the view that the fines outlined in section 19 of the Bill are considerable.  Those multinationals who have been referring in their advertisements to the fact that they have been prosecuted for below cost selling are not likely to commit that offence in the future because of the provisions contained in this Bill.  The strength of this legislation will lie in the ability of the Fair Trade Commission to secure prosecutions.  There was a failure over the last number of years to obtain prosecutions.  If this legislation is to be effective we must ensure that if prosecutions should take place they do in fact take place.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation the Minister is transferring from himself to the director of the Fair Trade Commission the power to prosecute.  The Fair Trade Commission should be in a position to initate the prosecutions and see them through rather than having to wait for the Minister to initiate the process.  The inability to obtain prosecutions was one of the failures of the previous legislation and as a result it was considerably weakened.</P>
    <P>The new fines are quite substantial. On summary conviction a person will be liable to a fine not exceeding £500 <Col N="2528" /> together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding £50 for every day on which the fine is continued. On indictment a person will be liable to a fine not exceeding £10,000 together with, in case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding £1,000 for every day on which the offence is continued or, at the discretion of the court, to a term of imprisonment.  I do not think any organisation, large or small, will treat these penalties lightly.  Neither do I think that any organisation should be entitled to flout the law and use the fact that they have done so to enhance their own market share.  That is an objectionable practice.  In the past we have seen advertisements in which these organisations drew attention to the fact that they had been convicted for below cost selling or improper advertising.  No senior management official should sanction that type of advertising.  Many conclusions could be drawn from such behaviour.  All of us in this House should object to such practice.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill provides that where an advertisement in relation to the supply or provision of any goods, services, accommodation or facilities is published and does not include the name and address of the person who procured such publication, or his agent, the publisher of the advertisement, shall, if the director or an officer of the Minister so requests within 12 months of the publication of the advertisement, give to the director or officer the name and address of such person or his agent.  That is a good insertion and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The authorised officer of the Fair Trade Commission in the pursuit of his duties will have under this Bill considerable powers of entry.  He will have the right of entry to any premises to assist him in his investigations and so on.  That is a very good provision.  An investigation can be impeded by the authorised officer's need to gain access to a premises, a manufacturing process, a packaging or storage area or to the whole process whereby a service was provided or a product manufactured.  The right of entry of <Col N="2529" /> the officer provided in this Bill is welcome. When an officer must enter a premises to carry out his or her investigation the people or organisation involved will know that this is a serious matter and that they are well advised to co-operate fully with the officer during the investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to labelling which sometimes can cause great confusion and can be an area of misinformation. Any provision in the Bill enabling the Fair Trade Commission to become involved in investigation into the whole labelling procedure is welcome.  A person going into a store and picking up a product may read that it is packed in Ireland or specially made for such and such a native Irish industry or multiple but the small, fine print somewhere at the bottom of the package indicates that it is made in Holland, Belgium or some other country.  That brings labelling into grave disrepute.  The Minister will be familiar with this type of practice.  People will buy products on the basis of their labelling because they are becoming conscious of the need to buy Irish and to have products that are manufactured or assembled in Ireland.  Products should be properly labelled to convey that information and people should not feel compelled to initiate their own little investigation of a product to find out its country of origin.  In the clothing industry, for example, products labelled as emanating from an EC country come in here but people in the clothing industry who are familiar with products and their components can tell us very quickly whether such and such a product was not manufactured within the EC but came from a Third World country or other source.  This has very serious implications for the clothing industry in Ireland which has suffered greatly in the last five or six years because of labelling which gave an incorrect impression of the product's origin, probably in breach of EC law on importation controls.  We in this city have seen not very far from this House the destructive results of such importation <Col N="2530" /> based almost entirely on improper, inadequate and misleading labelling.  Obviously boundaries are ignored in terms of the EC and of the countries of origin of the products.  An Irish consumer is anxious to purchase an Irish product where possible and if that consumer has to undertake a major investigation to find out the source of manufacture of that product because of inadequate labelling that is of no help to this economy.  I am glad that the Minister referred to that.</P>
    <P>State or semi-State bodies engaged in activities in competition with the private sector will be subject to scrutiny by the competition authorities under this Bill. For too long State organisations have been immune from proper and adequate investigation and accountability.  Under this provision they will have to account for themselves when they are in competition with the private sector.  They will have to account for the manner in which they trade and compete and in all other details which apply to the private sector. It is right that that be so.</P>
    <P>The centralisation in this Fair Trade Commission is to be welcomed.  The failure of previous legislation to deal effectively from the consumer's point of view with the manufacturer is an indication that maybe our efforts in trying to protect consumers were spread too widely and thinly.  The Bill provides for the centralisation in the Fair Trade Commission of the various powers etc. and gives to the commission a certain autonomy and a right to act within their own terms. The transfer of enforcement functions, including the power to prosecute, which were formerly vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce are to be transferred to the Director of the Fair Trade Commission.  That is a wise decision on the Minister's part.  We can all understand the implications for the Minister if he is to be the final arbiter of prosecution of those who do not conduct their activities in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  It is right that the Fair Trade Commission have those additional powers to initiate prosecution procedures.  I compliment the Minister on his decision to, as it were, give away <Col N="2531" /> some of his own powers.  Perhaps he was happy to do so, but in any event that is proposed in this Bill and it is a welcome step which will indicate to the consumers that the Fair Trade Commission have something to say for them, that they have a job to do for them and have received powers from the Minister to that effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the fact that there were so few prosecutions.  Presumably the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time the Deputy referred to had the powers to initiate prosecutions.  If there were so few prosecutions at that time was it because the Minister did not initiate them or because there were no complaints or no reasonable grounds for prosecution?  That bears out what I have suggested, that really it is as well for the Minister not to have those powers but to transfer them to the Fair Trade Commission.  The evidence of lack of prosecutions under the direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day suggests that the course taken by the Minister in this regard is correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been extremely busy on behalf of the consumer.  We have been discussing the Restrictive Practices Bill and he signed an order last May dealing with &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;.  He has shown that he is prepared to move rapidly on behalf of the consumer and he is to be complimented on his actions.  This legislation is part of the campaign to improve the consumer's lot so that he gets a fair deal. The consumer has not been getting a fair deal and it is recognised that we need legislation to strengthen his hand.  When consumers have a complaint they must be assured of a fair hearing with a reasonable expectation that action will be taken. Variations in prices, for example, will probably be referred to the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>There was much disappointment when the Prices Commission were abolished. It was an unfortunate step and people felt its impact by what they perceived as increased prices.  Many organisations expressed their disappointment at the removal of a body which gave some form of protection to the consumer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2532" /> I have referred to charges which have been creeping into various organisations providing almost a monopoly service. The Minister has given an assurance that this matter will be looked at.  This could have a beneficial effect for the consumer who resents these creeping charges which seem to go up every six or 12 months, sometimes without notification.  I know the Minister will not shirk his responsibility in this regard.  He has shown himself capable of bringing forward a whole range of measures designed specifically to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission are to have new powers to initiate public inquiries. At present inquiries can only be initiated at the request of the Minister or the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, or by any person whose request for an inquiry has been refused by the examiner. This change is to be welcomed.  It is very beneficial to inquire publicly into major problems affecting consumers' rights. For far too long many of the problems resulting from consumer concern have been dealt with behind closed doors.  That unnecessary practice is to be discontinued. Public inquiries to which people and organisations can contribute are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation will strengthen the position of the consumer and will probably send out signals to those who may not always have been inclined to take reasonable account of consumer interests.  Such people will now have to account for themselves.  There is a procedure which the consumer can follow in order to seek redress.  There should also be an increase in fair competition. In a small economy it is easy to get into the situation where certain protective measures are taken with regard to competition and there are understandings between suppliers of goods and services which are not to the benefit of the consumer.  The powers of the Fair Trade Commission to regulate competition are welcome and I know the Minister will ensure that the spirit of the legislation will be implemented.  This is very important if it is to make any <Col N="2533" /> appreciable difference to the position of the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the question of fines, which I believe are quite stiff.  The possibility of imprisonment also exists.  One felt that the fines could have been higher in relation to &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; and the various restrictive practices involved, but in this case the fines are very substantial. This will show the consumer that his needs are taken into account and that he has a court of appeal to which he can take his complaint.</P>
    <P>This is only part of the programme on which the Minister is engaged to improve the lot of the consumer in a variety of areas.  First he must have the necessary legislation available.  The future is looking better for the consumer in terms of the protection of his or her rights and the availability of a forum to which complaints can be taken.  It is a sign to those who have a product or a service to sell that they cannot get away with a slipshod approach and will have to account for themselves if there is cause for complaint or reason to query the manner in which they provide their service or the quality of the goods they sell.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this legislation and continuing his programme on behalf of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is not contentious. It was prepared by different Ministers in different Governments.  I would not like anybody to get the impression that what is being done in this Bill is very important.  Often we have the wrong impression of what is important. What we are doing here is changing structures and powers which in themselves are good and worthy but we are not changing things in any material way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This day last week we dealt with competition policy in the grocery trade and I outlined in some detail my view on competition policy in Ireland as it affects all sectors of the trade and I dealt with the OECD reports on buying power.  This morning I will not repeat myself and deal with those issues again.  Instead, I will deal exclusively with consumer policy in <Col N="2534" /> Ireland.  This is a very neglected area. For some months I have had meetings with the Irish Housewives' Association, the Consumers Association of Ireland, Jim Murray and his staff who are excellent people, and the environmental health officers who all have a role in this area.  I have tried to develop a charter for consumers and have come to the conclusion that there is an Irish rip-off factor. Although the consumers are the largest section of the free market, they are the weakest section because they cannot and do not act together and are treated as individuals.</P>
    <P>In the area of consumer law we have slavishly followed the EC directives three, five or ten years later and have not at any stage pioneered consumer legislation. A lot has been said today about consumer legislation but the important point which has been missed is that we have excellent documents from the Director of Consumer Affairs on what are people's rights under the Consumer Information Act, under the Sale of Goods Act, information from the Incorporated Law Society and so on.  The fact is that consumer law in Ireland is unenforceable because it is too costly, too time consuming and too remote from the ordinary public through the court structure. Until we develop a new system of redress, consumer legislation will not work.  It has not worked when implemented by the Director of Consumer Affairs or through the civil process. Any cursory discussion with any consumer groups will prove that.  Any study of the United Kingdom will show that unless there is a system of redress the whole thing is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The number of cases relative to the number of complaints the Director of Consumer Affairs takes up &mdash; he gets approximately 17,000 telephone queries annually &mdash; is minimal.  We need a proper system of redress because it can cost up to £600 to go to the District Court for redress.  I suggest that we have proper legislation to set up a small claims court system in the Republic similar to that in Northern Ireland.  If there is a delay in setting up this system, we should set up <Col N="2535" /> an interim arbitration system where the consumer and the vendor can go to, say, a retired judge.  There would be no legal representation, no wigs and gowns, the people could state their case and have quick access to the law.  If we look at other countries we will see that this system works and is enforceable.</P>
    <P>What is the up-to-date position of the consumer forum set up by the previous Minister of State, Deputy Richard Bruton?  When we in the small businesses committee were trying to set up a small claims court for debt collection &mdash; where a businessman was trying to collect a debt of a few hundred pounds but found it was more difficult to collect it through the ordinary court system &mdash; the Department of Justice set the face against such a suggestion.</P>
    <P>The magazine &ldquo;Consumer Choice,&rdquo; January 1987, sets out the different reports produced in 1983 published by Alec Schuster and Jack O'Farrell, both of Trinity College, and subsequent reports by Brian McMahon of UCC. Those reports set out in detail the structure of such a small claims court system and how it could be set up quickly, effectively and cheaply.  This court would deal with debts up to a limit of £600 and the District Court would take over after that. Unless we can find a remedy along these lines, we will not have any worthwhile consumer protection.</P>
    <P>This Government in their restrictions on expenditure have, unfortunately, seen fit to exclude consumers' needs.  I remember from our time in Government that one of the considerations in the abolition of the National Prices Commission and in the restructuring and streamlining &mdash; a nice word for rationalisation &mdash; of these structures was the cost saving.  There is no denying that.  It is disappointing to see the abolition of the National Consumers Advisory Council whose members represented different types of consumers. We have seen severe curtailment in the expenditure for the Ombudsman's office and we have seen the abolition of the National Savings Council which provided valuable advice as to the merits and demerits of different types of savings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2536" /> We have seen a gradual and steady erosion of the consultative process in which consumers have been involved. This process can only be reversed if politicians take it seriously.  As a matter of urgency the Government should set up a proper structure of political responsibility for consumer affairs by appointing a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with exclusive responsibility for this area.  Many of the consumer issues I am about to outline deal with drugs, food, the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment at local authority level, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Garda as regards weights and measures and so on. There is a multiplicity of departmental responsibility involved but no single group co-ordinating consumer affairs, and there are no teeth in the approach we are taking to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>We have also seen an abandoning of funding in this area.  For as little as £40,000 the Government could give invaluable aid to the voluntary bodies in the consumer area.  Perhaps we could get EC support for these organisations which would not have to produce magazines to remain in existence.  They could spend their time and effort working at European level by being affiliated to European consumer groups and by being directly involved in a policy and lobbying role which is not the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>The lobby of vested interests far exceeds the consumer lobby.  Every restrictive group, whether dentists, doctors, solicitors, architects, big business or small business, has an effective lobby and the only people who do not are the three and a half million consumers. Business men must realise that if they are to compete, their goods must have reached certain quality consumer standards. That is one of the reasons in terms of indigenous industries, we have such an appalling track record in the area of exports.</P>
    <P>I would like to see law reforms in certain areas.  What is the position in regard to one's legal right to a receipt?  I have asked this question of the Director of <Col N="2537" /> Consumer Affairs and a number of barristers but this seems to be a very grey area.  This point should be clarified because this technicality has led to cases under the Sale of Goods Act being dismissed. We need also to deal properly with the area of public information. While there is a hot line service provided by the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Consumers Association of Ireland, there is no facility in our education system for people to be taught any facet of consumer affairs.  That needs to be changed so that people will have some concept of the standards they should demand in respect of services and value.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates one can find the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Stationery Office, and other independent bodies &mdash; I wasted half an hour this morning searching through that publication &mdash; but one cannot find a subhead for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce. An indication of the amount of consideration given to consumer affairs is that it does not get a ranking of its own within its Department Vote.  Therefore, it is impossible to scrutinise the percentage cut in the expenditure between 1987 and 1988 although I have no doubt that a parliamentary question will elicit that information.  Giving the Minister and the Government the benefit of the doubt, I believe that information will show that expenditure has stood still instead of a net curtailment.  We must be prepared to invest in enforcement and back up services.  If we do not we are wasting our time.  Deputy Bruton was critical of the lack of a proper approach to enforcement and I agreed with his remarks in regard to that.</P>
    <P>The onus of proof in regard to misleading advertising still lies with the consumer. If a person in business who produces, for example, a washing-up liquid and claims that it is superior to any other in the market and a consumer holds that the claim is wrong and that the advertisement is misleading the onus is on that <Col N="2538" /> consumer to drag the producer through the courts.  In my view the onus should be on the producer to prove that his or her statements are correct.  We need to reorientate aspects in regard to misleading advertisements.  We must put the onus of proof on those who make misleading claims.  There are so many grey areas of subjectivity in that regard that the consumer can be easily misled.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, like most of us, has seen signs on items like fridges with a figure of £200 crossed out and a figure of £80 inserted.  One thinks that one could save £120 on that item but the item may not have been for sale at £200; it may have been on offer at £120.  There is no law to say that a shopkeeper cannot put up such a sign.  I note that the civil servants are shaking their heads but I must point out to them that the statements I am making arise out of discussions I had with the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I accept that there are laws which state that one cannot mislead in terms of advertising but there is no precise wording as to what price an advertisement should relate to.  There is no law to say that a person, when offering a discount, must state the original price.</P>
    <P>We then move into an area where there is no control whatever.  There is an even bigger scandal in the whole area of public relations.  Marketing managers, and others, no longer spend their money on straight advertisements telling people that their products are the best on the market.  When they are selling products they wine and dine motoring correspondents and so on to ensure that they have every facility to test their new cars in the expectation that the correspondents will write flowing reviews about them.  In some cases they even go as far as to produce supplements to newspapers which do not spell out clearly that they are advertisements.  People may think that an article decorated by advertisements is a bona fide commentary by an independent journalist on a car but, in fact, the entire supplement is an advertisement. Such articles have been bought and paid for, like the advertisements.  In my view the whole thing is an effective <Col N="2539" /> con job.  While we are talking about structures we are light years behind the whole area of public relations which has taken over advertising.  No longer does a manufacturer have to say that his or her washing-up liquid is the best because it is now possible to get the washing-up liquid correspondent to say it is the best by adequately wining and dining him or her. A supplement, whether it is a property or motoring supplement should carry a banner headline to the effect that it is an advertisement from start to finish.  People should be told that articles contained in it are not written by independent people, that such supplements are bought and paid for by advertisers.</P>
    <P>We have all read articles in the newspapers telling us how brilliant new cars are.  I heard an advertisement by a company telling people that Ted Bonner, or some other motoring correspondent, had said their car was excellent.  The public have no idea of the expenditure involved in such public relations exercises.  There are areas where technical claims are made about products which only an IIRS test, costing in the region of £20,000 or £30,000, could prove.  The position is different in Britain because with about 50 million consumers they can afford to scrutinise the claims of the various manufacturers, whether it is a claim by a manufacturer of washing machines or a claim by a car manufacturer as to the petrol consumption of their product.  The cost of such a test here is very high.  The public should be protected and producers should not be allowed make claims because nobody will go to the expense of testing them.  We must look at the many misleading advertisements and claims particularly in regard to PR exercises.</P>
    <P>Another area of the law that needs to be revised is in regard to liability.  At present if I have a complaint in regard to any goods I make a claim against the vendor although he may not be responsible. If I buy a tin of baked beans and find it defective the retailer or the wholesaler is not responsible but I must make a claim against them.  We must review this area and put the blame on the real culprit.  Retailers should be given some <Col N="2540" /> protection because in regard to product liability at present the retailer is always responsible.  I accept that the Department published a discussion document in regard to that some weeks ago.  Up to now suppliers have been able to escape litigation and retailers do not want to have a double legal bill by having to deal with the consumer and, in turn, being forced into further litigation against the manufacturer.  We must introduce changes in this area and give an element of discretion to a judge as to who is responsible in the case of an item such as a can of beans, the shelf life of which is not relevant to the retailer.  There are many injustices in those areas at present.</P>
    <P>The new areas of inclusion in the Bill are banking, electricity and communications. The banks are responsible for some outrageous, restrictive and unfair practices against the public.  Their opening hours are more restrictive than those of any other business dealing with the public.  Their charges are exorbitant and the Minister should pay particular attention to the profits of Visa and Access.  I know inquiries are taking place in Britain in regard to plastic money because of the profits made.  The cartel of the associated banks and the standing committee has effectively been broken up but the cartel in relation to Access and Visa has never been stronger.  If I have a meal tonight which costs £50 the owner of the restaurant will have to pay 5 per cent to Access or Visa.  Their profits are very high and there is limited competition as different cards have been amalgamated into a single card.  Perhaps there could be a public inquiry straight away under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The banks are bad but the ESB are far worse.  The ESB are a public disgrace in relation to their consumer approach.  I am sure that every TD has had experience of their practices.  If someone wishes to have electricity connected to a caravan or house they are quoted an outrageous capital cost to bring it across a field or road.  The cost is between £2,000 and £4,000 and when the customer asks how many poles and transformers are <Col N="2541" /> involved he or she is told that the company are not under an obligation to give such information.  They add that they cannot reduce it and that if the offer is not accepted within six months the cost will be even higher.  There is a need for an immediate inquiry into the inefficiencies of the ESB and the method by which they calculate capital costs for new installations and works generally.  I have no doubt that they are unaccountable, uncompetitive and inefficient in their dealings with the public.  I should like to see an inquiry which would result in them giving a detailed breakdown of the cost per pole, the man hours involved and the cost of a transformer, coupled with an independent body being able to say whether their practices are fair.  The cost of installing your own generator is prohibitive, especially for a domestic dwelling. It would only be justified in the event of a strike or for a milking parlour where the emergency value would be worthwhile. The ESB are not interested in the public perception of fair play and are not answerable to the NPC or anybody else.</P>
    <P>The total arrogance with which the ESB disregarded the Fletcher and other reports in relation to their accounting system and double depreciation leads one to believe that they have no concern for the public.  I am delighted that they have been brought under the scope of this Bill because they have got away with very unfair, monopolistic practices for too long and have been totally unaccountable for their actions.  That is the good news but the bad news is that this legislation does not deal with a further list of culprits who have been completely let off the hook.  Of course we must ask what rights the public have in relation to State services provided by local authorities and health boards.  There must be some independent performance related body supervising some of these bodies and someone to whom the public can go as voluntary and independent arbitrators.  At present one can point to the Ombudsman but he can only make a recommendation.  I have seen cases where the Ombudsman made <Col N="2542" /> a recommendation in favour of the complainant but that is as far as it went because the Department decided that they were not prepared to go any further. That is not satisfactory and I should like to see fresh powers given to the Ombudsman to strengthen his position or a proper structure put in place so that in the case of local authorities codes of practice would be developed to ensure uniformity. These codes of practice should be available to the public so that they would know where they stood.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether the insurance sector is included under banking.  At present people are travelling all over the country as agents and brokers selling life assurance policies and making claims about returns which are totally misleading and unfair.  Unsuspecting widows and old people are taken in by these people.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has expressed the most serious concern about this matter and has asked for a voluntary code &mdash; in the event of politicans taking no action &mdash; to be set out giving genuine rates of return on some of these investments, the benefits and a clear understanding of the small print on these policies.  This is an open area at the moment and we are depending on quasi-ethical behaviour which does not exist, especially in relation to some companies.  I heard of a case the other day where a man paid into one of these companies and, when he died, his sister was convinced she would collect his insurance.  The sister came to me telling me that she wished to collect £2,000 which she thought was now payable.  I wrote to the insurance company concerned who informed me that the money was payable only in the event of a range of very limited accidents.  As the person concerned had died of natural causes he was not covered.  There are many cases of this kind where people are totally misled. We assume here today that we are making a major contribution to consumer policy by changing the structures but that is not the case.  These are the real issues and I should like to see an immediate code being put into practice as far as the insurance sector is concerned, especially <Col N="2543" /> in regard to investment.  Fire, theft, employers' and public liability is another day's work.</P>
    <P>Another area in which there has been a lack of any political backbone in dealing with consumer issues is the classic one of the professions.  Members of these professions are not allowed to compete and the public are not even allowed to know in advance what they will be charged for certain services.  There are no regulations in regard to doctors, dentists and opticians.  There is no scope for finding out the range of prices.  Up to a few years ago opticians were merely allowed to put up a name plate but they were not allowed to put prices on their display of glasses.  Thank heavens, something has been done about that but, generally speaking, the professions have got away with behaviour in this country which would be inexplicable in others.  There should be a universal code for professions to help the public.  They should be obliged to display prices, and to give quotations in advance so that people can compare prices, and they should be allowed to advertise their services in whatever way they see fit.  These are three very basic areas of information.  All of our consumer legislation has exempted the professions. I know they have political clout but it is in their own interests that the good practitioners succeed and do well.  No other line of business would sustain the type of practices that they have been allowed by the professions.  People should be able to assess who is the best doctor in town, the best solicitor, the best and cheapest architect and so on.  I have not done enough research on chemists but I suspect that there are here a whole series of practices that should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Consumer legislation should be brought into the ambit of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach because a lot of the basic tenets of consumer law deal with health, hygiene and safety.  They do not come within the remit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Sale of Drugs and Food Act, 1875 is basic legislation which protects <Col N="2544" /> the consumer if for instance he goes into a restaurant and asks for pork but is served with rabbit.  However, despite legislation if one complains to the local friendly environmental health officer, one will find that he has a limit of 28 days in which to bring a prosecution.  He must take the sample immediately, send it to a laboratory for tests, await the results and go to the prosecutor's office to bring a prosecution.  It cannot be done in 28 days. That law is unenforceable.  We have a completely outdated law.  It is well over 100 years old and the fines are still only £20 no matter what type of fraud one commits.  That legislation is redundant. Also samples in the ratio of 2½ per 1,000 taken by EHOs are not sufficient in any one town.  Consumer law in Ireland has not come from politicians but it has been built up by case law.  I am outlining here a litany of neglect by successive Governments and politicians over decades in giving our population a fair ride.</P>
    <P>Another example where the law is an ass in relation to consumer rights is, if I go into a shop and buy a loaf of bread and find when I cut it that it is full of maggots or other foreign bodies, I can only take a case against the retailer.  A case like this should be extended to include the culprit.  Fine Gael will put forward detailed amendments to the Sale of Drugs and Food Act, the Health Act of 1947 and the Food Standards Act, 1974, which will give a proper legislative base for this aspect of consumer affairs. A single Act is required.</P>
    <P>A number of areas are not covered by legislation.  For instance, if one goes into a hairdressing salon for a straight wash and cut and a mistake is made the hair is dyed, there is no statutory provision for compensation.  Another area of concern relates to swimming pools.  One can get many diseases in swimming pools, eye sicknesses, skin rashes and so on and there are no regulations governing the running of public or private swimming pools.  It is very common in summer time when, for instance, a pool attendant is on holidays, that his replacement will put in too much bromide or chlorine into the water and the public are not made aware <Col N="2545" /> of the dangers.  Nobody checks up on this and even if somebody did there are no regulations to deal with it.  There are areas where the consumer is totally neglected.  If one has to suffer disgraceful smells from a nearby meat factory or from noise pollution &mdash; and there are ways of quantifying these things &mdash; there is no protection here although there is in every other country.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that appropriate consumer legislation is introduced.</P>
    <P>Another area in the remit of the Minister relates to the operation of the ASAI, the Advertising Standards Authority in Ireland.  The House has abdicated its responsibilities in relation to that body. This body have traded on the basis that there is consumer representation on the body when in fact they do not have consumer representation.  Voluntary bodies have withdrawn from them and although the Director of Consumer Affairs had a representative there, he has not withdrawn his imprimatur from that association. We cannot accept that there should be only voluntary controls, on a self-policing basis, in advertising.  The pressures and the competitiveness of business make people cut corners and the public can be misled.  The Minister should ensure that the code under which this association operate is far more stringent.  Coming up to Christmas there is misleading advertising of toys.  The size of the toy is grossly inflated and one gets a very quick glimpse of the size of the toy relative to the size of the child.  Children pressure their parents into buying these toys and only afterwards do they realise that it is not what they thought it would be.  The credulity of children has been exploited by marketing and advertising executives.</P>
    <P>There is also sex discrimination in advertising.  I was down at the Ard-Fheis in Cork at the weekend and I saw a hoarding with a very sexist although witty advertisement.  One saw a very attractive woman laid across a sofa with a glowing fire in front of her and the caption read, &ldquo;Rekindle an old flame &mdash; Bord na Móna&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that that was very witty, that it was a nice pun but it <Col N="2546" /> was also very sexist.  Some people might object to that but I have no doubt that the ASAI would pay scant regard to such an objection.  There is need for the Minister to put the boot in and for the Director of Consumer Affairs to put the boot in to ensure that the consumer has a majority on that body, if he is not prepared to make it statutory.  The people who are supposed to be chairing it are not involved at all.  It is self-policed by those who are dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with public relations which is very misleading.  I recently came across a case of a person who was misled by small print.  This person was told that if one uses a Visa card when going on a holiday one's insurance would be provided. This person's Visa card was stolen out of her handbag with the result that she had no insurance cover on the holiday.  At the same time, we have seen the abolition of the price line inspectors who provided a very valuable service.  Undoubtedly, the Cinderella of public life has been the protection of consumers.  There is an immediate need for an all-party study to provide activity in this area.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has become outrageous in recent times is door-to-door selling.  Not a month goes by but there are complaints on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; about Italians or other people selling shoddy goods and we are doing nothing about it.  There is an EC directive on door-to-door selling but why should we have to depend on an EC directive?  Why do we not introduce an order &mdash; the Minister has the power to do so &mdash; which would give a right to a person who makes a door-to-door purchase get a legal receipt on which must be stated the address from which that business is trading and within seven days the consumer can revoke the deal he has entered into and can obtain a refund if the item is not satisfactory.  That is a very simple and basic right that should be provided to consumers.</P>
    <P>If you go to a shop or to any place of trading you can go back to that shop or office a month or a week later if the item is not up to the required standard and you can ask for a refund or to have the <Col N="2547" /> item repaired.  I ask the Minister to do more than what is proposed at EC level and to introduce a simple directive that would give the consumer three basic rights for any door-to-door sales.  First, they should have a legal right to a receipt; secondly, on that receipt should be the name and address under which that business is registered which could be used for any future correspondence and, thirdly, written on that receipt should be the legal right for the consumer to revoke, within a period of seven days any deal entered into and if the seven days elapse then the deal must go ahead.  There are housewives who are hustled and bustled into buying items which they do not want. Something needs to be done about that matter.</P>
    <P>Recently it came to my attention that there are over 6,000 food additive drugs being used in this country.  When one realises the number of people involved in this area it is obvious that many products are being sold which are injurious to health.  The National Food Advisory Council do not have the facilities to check every product in every way.  I know checks are made by the EC on imported products.  It may be the case, and there is no way it can be disproved, that we are now consuming products which, in a couple of years time we will be told, caused some illness.  Nobody is doing anything about it.  Each report I read on food additives gives a different recommendation on the same food additive, as to whether they are carcinogenic or whether they are the cause of one health problem or another.  The public are guinea-pigs for many foods which contain additives.  This is a matter for the EC but I hope the Government will give priority to consumers' interests.</P>
    <P>As has already been mentioned, the CAI have made two proposals.  Under section 18 it is proposed to increase fines from £500 or six months imprisonment to £10,000 or two years imprisonment.  In terms of restriction of competition legislation, the fine for breaches of the law under the Air Transport Act is one year or £50,000 and under the Dentists Act, <Col N="2548" /> where a restrictive practice is incorporated whereby people cannot make and sell dentures, the fine is £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  I suggest that a doubling of the fines would be reasonable in this case if we want to get a balance on our priorities.</P>
    <P>The national communications monopoly has already been referred to by Deputy Keating and I will not dwell on it.  I wish to make a few other brief points. First, the public should have rights of access to information.  There is more to the rights of information than public education and public information on consumer law.  In particular there must be rights of access particularly with regard to public administration so that if some element of impropriety exists the public are entitled to a detailed explanation. Much of the time of politicians is taken up trying to get explanations for certain decisions made which seem to the public to be arbitrary.  There is merit in what Deputy Bruton said in relation to competition policy in terms of incorporating some of the articles of the Treaty of Rome in our competition law.  There is also a case for widening the civil process as opposed to the criminal process in terms of retribution.</P>
    <P>This legislation is commendable and will be supported.  It is non-party political but let us not cod ourselves into thinking that is a significant step forward for consumers' rights.  It is the practical nitty-gritty issues, of being misled by PR and advertising, the perception of good value, the nitty-gritty issues of comparing prices and having competition in the professions and the issues of getting quality when one is under the impression that one is buying quality which are the kernel of Irish public concern at present.  The only way we will bring about an improvement in the position is to appoint a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for consumer affairs who would immediately set up an interdepartmental committee to do something about the matter.  I hope to publish in the next few months a detailed consumers charter for Ireland.  I commend this legislation. I wish it a speedy passage through <Col N="2549" /> the House and I hope there will be early action taken on the measures which I mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  He has already proved in a number of areas that he is prepared to take decisive action where necessary, particularly in relation to petrol prices.  It is a very positive step in the right direction to streamline the agencies related to consumer protection, restrictive practices and so on.  It is a cliché that competition is the life of trade but there is a need for watchdog bodies that will ensure the consumer is getting value for money and is being protected.  One does not want to interfere with the free market or open competition but, with the smallness of the world today because of improved communications, there is a need to ensure that the consumer is protected. This Bill is a decisive step in that direction. We are at a stage now where the OECD is drawing attention to the need for regulation in a number of crucial areas specifically transport, communications and banking.  Because of advanced technology in these areas competition can transcend borders so there is a need for the various countries to have adequate legislation to ensure that the consumer does not fall the victim of unfair trading practices, price fixing, defective products or whatever.</P>
      <P>I concur with some of Deputy Yates's points on advertising.  There is a definite need for strict regulation of the promotion and sale of goods because often products are inaccurately described and unsuitably presented in such a way as to over-enhance the product.  No doubt the Minister will look at this and see the need for guidance and proper control in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to energy, transport, communications and banking in his address to the House this morning.  Let me deal first with energy.  The country is crying out for some form of integrated energy programme.  There is a ridiculous overlap with duplication of overhead <Col N="2550" /> costs and so on relating to State and semi-State bodies.  The taxpayer is footing a very heavy bill due to lack of efficiency and co-ordination.  Bord Gáis and the ESB are both trading on the high street from different outlets, both carrying substantial overhead costs and competing with each other for the energy market. While we do not want to restrict the available choices to the consumer, we need to see a great deal of efficiency introduced in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the typical monopoly situation of the ESB who had down quotations for different types of work on a take it or leave it basis.  There is no justification for some of the charges but because they control the national grid they can dictate the terms of service.  The whole area of energy has such implications for job creation and is such an essential service that it is important to look at this area.</P>
    <P>It is likewise with transport.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on semi-State Bodies are at the moment looking at B &amp; I and the very complex issues of transport. Again, there is duplication and a lack of co-ordination particularly between the State bodies such as CIE and B &amp; I.  In this area there has been much empire building and the consumer is not getting good value for money and there is not a good return on the taxpayers investment.</P>
    <P>Banking is increasingly before the public with the whole range of banking services, competition with building societies and colossal spending on advertising which is a very substantial overhead cost being passed on to the consumer. Many of the costs incurred by the banking organisations are not in the interest of the consumer but are undertaken to promote the organisation.  The larger they are the greater their financial muscle and the greater the lack of a responsible approach.  When this legislation is effective, the director will have a key role in ensuring that the financial institutions, the banks in particular, are providing value for money.</P>
    <P>The whole area of credit cards was <Col N="2551" /> referred to.  This particular service is costing the consumer far too much.  The Minister referred this morning to an amendment to be brought in on Committee Stage and designed to ensure that the confidentiality of individual bank accounts would continue to be assured. This area needs to be properly scrutinised and the director will have a very important role in that area in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of comments were made about food labelling, textile labelling, price display and safety standards.  The labelling of products can be very confused and there should be some standardisation so that consumers can see readily whether they are getting value for money.  Safety standards cause particular concern.  In the past various products dangerous to the purchaser or to children have been sold in the rush, for example, of Christmas shopping.  It is important to lay down standards to avoid this type of risk particularly to children.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on the fact that in this legislation he is passing over many of his present functions to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  That is a step in the right direction.  The director has a major task ahead because of the ever changing market which has already been dealt with by the Minister when he spoke about the issue of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;. The director's task will be complex but it will be his responsibility.  The delegation of that power was a decisive step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>The exact manner in which the income tax proposals contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be implemented will be considered by the Government in the context of the 1988 and subsequent budgets.  It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to indicate the average yearly saving to PAYE workers in each year of the programme from these proposals.  However, the overall package of £225 million will result in total savings of about £295 for the average PAYE taxpayer over the period of the programme.</P>

It might, however, be no harm for all of us to recall the fact &mdash; and we accept it &mdash; that income tax and taxation generally are too high but the level of borrowing we have in this economy amounts to £1,858 million, which is the extent to which we as a community as a whole are living beyond our means and until such time as we drastically reduce that amount we cannot, unfortunately, be talking about any greater concession than what was negotiated and discussed by the social partners and agreed by them for the next three year period, as I outlined in my reply.</P>

In view of the fact that there is to be a 2½ per cent increase in wages to PAYE workers, is it not a fact that there will actually be an increase in take from these workers over the period of 3 years rather than a reduction, that it will be higher in three years' time than it is now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will define the terms net income and gross income as assessed for income tax purposes in respect of self-employed persons and farmers; the number of such persons; the number currently liable for income tax; the estimated amount to be paid by them in 1987; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms &ldquo;net income&rdquo; and &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; are not used in the Income Tax Acts and are not legal tax terms.  The terms &ldquo;total income&rdquo; and &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; are, however, used in this context.  These are technical terms relating to certain steps in the process of determining a person's tax liability.  In relation to the self-employed, which term includes farmers, &ldquo;total income&rdquo; broadly means an individual's income from all sources reduced by such items as capital allowances, interest, losses, pension contributions, etc. &ldquo;Taxable income&rdquo; is the income on which the individual's charge to tax at the prevailing tax rates is actually calculated.  It is total income further reduced by the various personal allowances and reliefs.</P>
      <P>As regards the figures requested by the Deputy, the relevant statistics available are in respect of the income tax year 1986-87.  From figures contained in Table 14 of the results of the 1985 Labour Force Survey, published in September 1986, it is estimated that 129,500 farmers were chargeable to income tax in respect of the tax year 1986-87.  This comprises some 119,000 full time farmers together with a further 10,500 farmers, who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 81,400 self-employed persons other than farmers were chargeable to income tax in 1986-87. The number of self employed persons including farmers who are ultimately expected to make tax payments in respect of 1987-88 is provisionally estimated at 110,000, of which the number of farmers is tentatively estimated to be of the order of 27,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post-budget estimate of income <Col N="2558" /> tax to be paid by farmers and other non-PAYE taxpayers in 1987 is £35.5 million and £226.1 million respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us why the terms &ldquo;net income&rdquo; and &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; were used in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and why these terms were particularly impressed on both the trade union and farmer leaders when, as he correctly concedes now, the Income Tax Act states that the phrases &ldquo;total income&rdquo; and &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; should be used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that neither of those phrases were used in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The programme stated that the Government have decided to introduce PRSI for farmers and the self-employed in 1988 on the basis of income as assessed for income tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Taoiseach in contacting the Irish Congress of Trade Unions assured them that farmers would pay a higher rate of PRSI on their net income and on that basis the Irish Congress of Trade Unions finally signed this so-called <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i>  The Minister went on radio and spoke about taxable income and the IFA deliberately used the phrase &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; to suit their own purposes.  A very serious deception was deliberately perpetrated by the Taoiseach to the Trade Unions and the farmers in order to get them to sign the programme.  As a result, there were many different interpretations put on what this scheme is going to cost the Exchequer.  Would the Minister concede that the Taoiseach put him in an unsustainable position?</P>

      <P>The Deputy must think that the trade unions and the farmers are very naive if he thinks that they <Col N="2559" /> have been misled in the way he has outlined. Quite clearly, what the programme said, what the Taoiseach and I also said and what the people fully understand is that we will introduce PRSI for farmers and the self-employed on the basis of income assessed for income tax purposes. I have been very careful when speaking about this to use exactly those terms. What should be understood is that the precise details of the arrangements that will be worked out regarding PRSI for the self-employed, which includes farmers, are still under consideration and that what must be accepted and realised is that we are now extending the payment of pay-related social insurance to these categories.</P>

    <P>Interest earned on moneys on deposit in the national lottery fund deposit account amounted to £920,706.55 up to the end of September 1987; this amount forms part of the national lottery fund's surplus for payment to the Exchequer and will be available for allocation to spending projects in due course.</P>
    <P>The terms of the licence under which An Post National Lottery Company operate the lottery on the Minister's behalf envisaged that when the lottery was fully operational, its proceeds would break down as follows:</P>
    <P>Prizes: 45-50 per cent</P>
    <P>APNLC</P>
    <P>&mdash;operating expenses: up to 18.65 per cent</P>
    <P>&mdash;management fees: 1.1 per cent</P>
    <P>Surplus paid over to the Exchequer 30.25-35.25 per cent</P>
    <P>It is expected that the company will operate within these limits in 1987.</P>
    <P>Prize expenses to date amount to approximately £36 million.  Total operating costs incurred, including agents' commission and all start-up costs, amount to approximately £16 million.</P>
    <P>The profits from the national lottery to date, which will be available for distribution and taking into account unclaimed prizes and other current liabilities, amount to approximately £32 million.  The total surplus accruing to the Exchequer in 1987 is now estimated at £35 million &mdash; £28 million in excess of the projected target in the 1987 budget.  The estimated surplus for 1988, as published <Col N="2568" /> in the 1988 Estimates volume, is £36.5 million.</P>
    <P>The surplus which accumulates in the national lottery fund is taken in to the Exchequer as non-tax revenue.  It is only taken in as it is needed for spending on approved programmes, and £5 million has been transferred to the Exchequer to date.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funds to the different spending areas is decided by Government on the basis of the resources available and in the light of the requirements of the different programmes.  It is not the practice to apply predetermined ratios when deciding the allocations.</P>
    <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986, the lottery surplus may be applied for the purposes of sport and other recreation, national culture (including the Irish language) the arts and the health of the community, and such other purposes as the Government may determine from time to time.  Last May the Government decided to include youth activities among the purposes for which lottery moneys may be applied.  The Government have recently decided that amenity and welfare projects may also be funded from the lottery surplus.  A notice to this effect will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Spending Ministers are responsible for the selection of individual projects within their own areas.  When spending programmes have been approved the funds are paid out, as needed, from the national lottery subhead in the Finance Vote.  The funds are transferred to suspense accounts operated by the spending Departments who are responsible for their administration.  Detailed questions about the issue of grants to recipient bodies and the criteria used to determine successful applications should, therefore, be addressed to the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government announced the allocation of the first £7 million of the lottery proceeds on 12 May; £3.15 million was allocated for youth and sports projects, £1.75 million for arts, culture and the Irish language, and £2.1 million for projects in the health area.</P>
    <P>The Government are now in the process <Col N="2569" /> of finalising their decisions on the allocation and distribution of resources for the remainder of 1987 and 1988.  Allocations will be made to projects in the sports, youth, amenities, arts and culture, health and welfare and Irish language sector.  Because of the amounts involved, the Government are particularly anxious to achieve the most equitable distribution of funds in line with the purposes for which the lottery was established.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement of detailed allocations in the next week or so.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in practical terms to calculate the precise impact of the lottery on the finances of organisations claiming compensation for loss of revenue. However, the Government have taken steps to improve the position of lotteries operated by voluntary and charitable organisations by increasing substantially the prize limits for these lotteries.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, open to voluntary and charitable organisations to apply to the Departments concerned for grants from the national lottery funds allocated to youth, sports, health and other areas and I would encourage them to do so.</P>

      <P>The House will appreciate that we have a considerable number of questions here and many Deputies will be entitled to ask supplementaries.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for a very full reply.  I know many Deputies want to ask supplementaries. I want to explore one area and as the person who won this particular lottery and came out as number six I get first shot.  Will the Minister inform us whether it is the Government's intention to use money from the lottery to substitute from revenue or borrowing in 1988 to fund projects which the Government would undertake anyway or is it the <Col N="2570" /> Government's intention to have a new set of projects in the appropriate areas which would be funded exclusively from the lottery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind words.  The details are not decided fully in relation to how the money will be spent on specific projects. It is an unusual kind of exercise, particularly for this Government because we have spent a number of months curtailing expenditure and abolishing schemes, yet now we have to set our minds towards the allocation of these substantial resources arising from the success of the lottery. We will be very careful about how this money will be allocated.  Without being specific but, at the same time, not trying to avoid the Deputy's question, it would not be our intention to substitute this expenditure for other expenditure in the 1988 programme.  Most of it will be for new projects which would not otherwise have gone ahead.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give any indication as to the proportion of grants which might be made available to various agencies on the basis of capital grant aid as opposed to grant aid for current expenditure purposes?  Does the Minister envisage in the case of agencies which come within the ambit of various Government Departments, for instance, the Department of the Environment, allowing the grants to be distributed through their subagencies such as the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have to decide finally on the details but I am sure that some of the money can <Col N="2571" /> probably be spent in this way.  We have added amenities for inclusion.  Most of the amenities schemes are worked through the Department of the Environment and the local authorities.  Any information regarding these projects would come through these channels. Where money is going towards amenities we would expect the local authorities to be involved as they have been up to now. As to whether the recipients would receive money towards capital or current expenditure, it could be either, depending on the decisions of the Government.</P>

      <P>The original allocation to sport was to be 55 per cent, but the Minister announced last June that it was being reduced to 45 per cent and was to cover both youth and sport.  Is it intended to adjust that figure upwards or downwards? It should preferably be adjusted upwards since there is no allocation in the Estimates for youth and sport and there is great anxiety among various organisations as to what the future holds. Their attention is focussed entirely on the lottery now.  Will funds be available to enable them to continue with projects in hand and what percentage can they expect?  Will it be further reduced or increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentages outlined by the previous Government and the present Government will change because of additional areas for consideration such as the amenities I have mentioned and social services.  However, there is much more money to be spent than was envisaged at the beginning of the year.  It has gone up from an anticipated £7 million at budget time to £35 million at this stage.  Regarding the fact that there is no allocation in the 1988 Estimates for youth and sport in the Department of Education, it has been made quite clear that the funding will be coming from lottery sources.  I do not know the details of the overall decisions the Government have to take in all areas but the Deputy can take it that the money for the area of youth and sport will be increased.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the procedures being adopted.  Is he suggesting that questions about individual approved projects should be addressed to the individual Departments?  Are the decisions being made in the Department of Finance?  I have heard other replies which indicate that the decisions are being made by Government.  Where does the accountability lie?  How will we establish accountability? In relation to the publication next week of the sums from the lottery, will the replacement sums be identifiable as separate from the new funds?  For example, the Arts Council had £1 million taken away and received £800,000 and they are expecting a sum of money which would make up the amount of the cut. This is terribly important.</P>

      <P>The Deputy misinterpreted what I said when I spoke about the issue of grants to recipient bodies and the criteria used to determine successful applications, saying that questions should be addressed to the Ministers concerned.  I meant that questions in relation to youth and sport should be addressed to the Minister for Education when the Government's decisions are announced.  Questions relating to the arts, culture and the Irish language should be addressed to the Taoiseach and Minister for the Gaeltacht.  Where the area of health is concerned, questions should be addressed to the Minister for Health.  Regarding the Deputy's questions about accountability, normal procedures will operate in whatever <Col N="2573" /> Department is spending the money.  That is the reality.  That means the Departments of Education, Health, the Gaeltacht and the Taoiseach, as well as the Department of the Environment, will be concerned with amenities.  So far as any displacement of funds arises, they will be identifiable.  As regards youth services, I am not clear what the Deputy was saying.</P>

How can he justify that principled opposition with what the Government are doing, which is precisely what they opposed less than two years ago, that is, using the money to make up shortfall in other areas?  I cannot understand that and perhaps the Minister would tell us how he can square those two views.  This appears to be a confidence trick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to assertions that the oil companies, who are engaged in the business of distributing free gifts, usually electrical appliances, do not pay VAT for their goods, thus avoiding a liability of approximately £10 million per year; the proposals, if any, he has to bring about any change in this situation, in view of the fact that all other people engaged in the electrical industry are obliged to pay VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under VAT law there is no liability to tax on business gifts generally where the cost to the donor of each gift does not exceed £15, exclusive of VAT.  The limit of £15 which was fixed in 1979 was raised administratively in 1986 to £30 in order to take account of inflation.  Gift schemes operated by the oil companies have been treated by the Revenue Commissioners as qualifying for this relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to estimate the amount of VAT foregone through the relief.  To the extent that such gifts are in fact paid for by the customer in the form of higher retail prices for petroleum products additional VAT would be paid by the oil companies thereby reducing significantly the VAT foregone.  As the <Col N="2580" /> Deputy will be aware my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce has recently taken action to stop the price of petrol being kept higher than it should be in order to pay for such schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is an enormous anomaly in this case and that the oil companies are, in effect, indirectly selling these goods in direct competition with electrical trades where thousands of jobs are being lost because of unfair competition?  Will the Minister look again at the loophole in the legislation which allows these companies to sell on goods without having to pay VAT in direct competition with the electrical trades who are suffering enormously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the limit of £15 was increased to £30 last year by the previous Government.  In my view the issue in regard to oil companies is largely academic as most of them have dismantled their gift schemes or will do so shortly since my colleague, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, took action.  The position is that Esso, Shell and Jet have discontinued their schemes and BP (Ireland) will do so at the end of December.  Texaco, Burmah and Maxol are to continue until the end of the year and their plans thereafter are uncertain. It seems obvious that as far as the oil companies are concerned the action by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has eliminated the problem correctly described by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank have provided funds to finance the Exchequer borrowing requirement on a number of occasions when they considered that the circumstances warranted this approach.  These funds were provided by way of the purchase of Government securities, carrying normal commercial terms, by the bank.  The bank advanced £20 million in this way in 1965, which was repaid in 1969; £28 million in 1974; £50 million in 1975; and £100 million in 1979; in all a net total of £178 million.</P>
      <P>Also since 1974 the bank has provided normal overdraft facilities to the Exchequer; as at 19 August 1987 the Exchequer had no overdraft liability to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also borrows from the Central Bank in respect of Ireland's subscription to the capital of the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and International Finance Corporation. As at 19 August 1987 the total amount borrowed under these headings <Col N="2583" /> was £22 million.  The cost of these funds is related to the yield on Exchequer bills.</P>
    <P>In 1985, the bank made available to the Minister for Finance a loan of £100 million for a period of 15 years for onlending to the insurance compensation fund in connection with the funding of the administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  This loan involves no net payment by the Exchequer.</P>

As regards the last of these requirements, detailed performance criteria for each company will be agreed on a case by case basis and will be incorporated in the conditions attaching to the certificate as provided for in subsection 30 (3).  Failure to meet the conditions of a certificate may result in its withdrawal in accordance with subsection 30 (4).</P>
    <P>One certificate has been issued to date under subsection 30 (2) and the company to which this certificate has been issued will benefit from the provisions of subsection 30 (7) which permit trading outside the Custom House Docks area on a temporary basis pending the availability of suitable premises within the area.</P>

Could the same criteria apply in both cases so that the Shannon area will not continue to suffer from the six serious disadvantages, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, under which it operates at present?  Has the Minister put a time limit on the licence he gave to the company availing of the provisions of section 30 (7) to operate the Custom House Docks site area or can people involved in financial services anywhere in the country enjoy the 10 per cent tax régime if they give a commitment that they will eventually move into the Custom House Docks site?  How does the Minister propose to ring fence the activity to ensure that an increment is added to <Col N="2586" /> economic activity and that we are not simply licensing displacement from one part of the country to another?</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised a number of important issues.  I replied in a general way to the query regarding the criteria in the framework of the legislation. I have not gone into detail by reading section 30, which is two pages long, as I am sure the Deputy has a copy. The criteria for each company will be on a case-by-case basis but since the Deputy mentioned Shannon, a different area, specific criteria on a case-by-case basis will be set for each company in the international financial services centre and will not be dissimilar to the requirement imposed on companies in Shannon generally. In relation to the point about the ring fence, that is already covered in the case-by-case arrangements that will be made with a particular company.  One cannot have an employment criteria right across the board because one type of operation may employ a maximum of ten people and another could have an employment potential of 1,000 people.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When it operates on a case-by-case basis it is impossible to find out exactly what will happen.  When people can enjoy a 10 per cent tax régime anywhere in the State simply by stating that they will eventually set up in the Custom House Docks area and complying with certain criteria, the Minister should inform the House how he intends to ensure that present activity in the financial area is not simply benefiting by the 10 per cent tax regime with no benefit to the economy or the Exchequer?

      <P>I propose to take together Questions Nos. 68, 33, 41, 44, 51 and 61, all of which deal with aspects of the voluntary early retirement/ redundancy schemes for the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the main elements of the scheme, I am circulating a summary of the relevant measures which covers all the essential features.  As indicated in the summary, the measures are designed to apply over the entire public sector, <Col N="2591" /> excluding the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána.  To date the package has been offered in areas where staff surplus to requirement have been identified, and this process will continue.  In addition, it has now been decided to extend the scheme to other personnel aged 50 or over in the Civil Service, health and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  As with the existing offers, management will still retain the right to refuse the terms to key personnel.</P>
    <P>Since this is a voluntary scheme, it is not possible at this stage to predict how many public servants will avail of the scheme and from what categories, organisations and grades they will come.  Similarly, it would be futile to attempt to give a precise figure as to the eventual cost of lump sums and additional pensions, as these depend on the salary levels and length of service of the people who apply for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The position as regards financing is that, as I explained to the House on 25 October during my closing speech in the debate on the 1988 Estimates, the Estimates volume takes account of both the savings from the fall in numbers employed as a result of the voluntary redundancy package and the cost of pensions payable to employees who accept the package.  I also pointed out that the cost of lump sum redundancy payments was not taken into account in the Estimates volume and that the costs of these payments would of course be influenced by the volume, nature and timing of the redundancies.  I informed the House that the Government were discussing with the Central Bank arrangements for meeting these exceptional costs and that, when the total cost had been determined and the funding arrangements had been finalised, I would present the full details to the House.  This is still the position.  The full costs and their financing will of course be included in the relevant public accounts in due course.  I have nothing further to add at this stage.</P>
    <P>The position requested by Deputy Farrelly in respect of posts created from 1977 to 1981 is set out in a tabular statement which I have also circulated.</P>

      <i>Summary of recently-announced measures to reduce public sector staff numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Subject to 4 below, the measures are designed to apply over the entire public sector, including commercial State bodies but excluding the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána, and are intended to meet situations where identifiable staff or groups of staff are surplus to requirements. Because of the range of organisations covered, there may be some variations, arising from local conditions, in the practical implementation of the scheme of early retirement but its essential elements, particularly as regards cost, will be the same in all areas.</P>
    <P>2.  The scheme of voluntary redundancy/early retirement terms is to be applied only in areas where identified redundancy or overstaffing exists or is reasonably expected to arise.</P>
    <P>3.  Where a prospective redundancy or overstaffing situation is identified, management will ascertain: the contribution which career breaks or job sharing can make to the reduction/deferral of the potential redundancy; the possibility of redeployment; the numbers likely to avail of the financial terms for retirement already announced (where it is apparent that the arrangements referred to above will not entirely eliminate staff surpluses). The application of these measures will be without prejudice to the existing rights of public sector employers in relation to termination of employment.</P>
    <P>4.  Further details of the measures as they apply to the Civil Service, health and local authority services are attached. They will be adapted for other public sector organisations and, in this connection, the provision in regard to guaranteed return from career breaks may require modification in the case of commercial State bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Career Breaks</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to promote opportunities for redeployment an extension to the career break scheme has been approved to allow staff to take up to five years special leave without pay with a guarantee of reemployment in a relevant grade within <Col N="2593" /> the service (but not necessarily within their existing organisation) within a period of twelve months of the date on which they had planned to return to work.  The terms outlined below will not apply to staff returning from career breaks until they have given an adequate period of post-break service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Job Sharing</i>
    </P>
    <P>The present job sharing scheme is being examined to see whether a more flexible approach could facilitate a wider application of the scheme.  As an initial step, application of job sharing for a one year period will be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Redundancy/Early Retirement terms for staff</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1)  Staff with at least 40 years service &mdash; Immediate payment of pension and lump sum (based on actual plus purchased service subject to a maximum of 40 years)</P>
    <P Just="Center">plus</P>
    <P>severance gratuity calculated at the rate of 2 weeks pay per year of potential service to age 65 (subject to a limit of 18 weeks' pay)</P>
    <P Just="Center">plus</P>
    <P>statutory entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>(Note: Staff in category (3) below may also opt for these terms if they wish).</P>
    <P>(2)  Staff with less than 5 years service &mdash; Immediate payment of a short service gratuity calculated on the following basis</P>
    <P>(a)  1/12th of salary per year of service</P>
    <P Just="Center">plus</P>
    <P>(b)  3/80ths of salary per year of service where reckonable service exceeds two years</P>
    <P Just="Center">plus</P>
    <P>(c)  2 weeks' pay per year of service (inclusive of statutory entitlements under <Col N="2594" /> the Redundancy Payments Acts, where appropriate).</P>
    <P>(Note: staff in categories (3), (4) and (5) may opt for these terms, in which case their benefits will be calculated as if they had service of 4 years and 364 days).</P>
    <P>(3)  Established civil servants and other public sector staff on modified PRSI with at least 5 and less than 40 years service &mdash; Immediate payment of lump sum and pension, with a maximum of seven years added to existing service entitlements. The seven-year maximum will apply only to staff with at least 20 years actual service. For those with less than 20 years actual service the number of added years will be calculated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, as following:</P>

However, the existing rules governing supplementary pensions (hitherto applicable only to ill-health pensioners or pensioners over age 60) will be extended to apply to all staff who retire on grounds of redundancy.  Thus, any person who retires on grounds of redundancy with a co-ordinated pension and who is (a) under age 65; (b) unemployed and; (c) ineligible for Social Welfare benefit due to circumstances beyond his control; will qualify for a supplementary pension sufficient to give him a total pension from the scheme equivalent to a pension without co-ordination.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What is the minimum number of redundancies the Minister requires over the next three years to fulfil his policy objectives?  Will the Minister inform the House as to why if he found it possible to include in the pension subheads across all Votes the increases required to pay the pension element of the redundancy scheme, he cannot give the House a total for the lump sums, with the excuse that he does not know how many people will retire?</P>

      <P>In relation to the numbers of personnel, the underlying assumption is that there will be a reduction of approximately 9,000 on the public sector payroll, including local authorities, during 1988.  The corresponding figure for 1987 is 10,000. Those figures do not necessarily imply specific figures for redundancy or early retirement since much of the reduction will happen by natural wastage, retirements, career breaks and so on.  The extent of this is impossible to predict as is the final takeup or the eventual mix of grades of those leaving on early retirement. In relation to the subheads, that relates to the pension.  It does not count the lump sum, as we said quite clearly when the Estimates were published and as we have been saying ever since.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question may refer to remarks published in the <i>Sunday Press</i> on 20 September, 1987. In this connection I would refer the Deputy to a press statement which appeared in the daily newspapers of 13 October, 1987.  In this statement the Revenue Commissioners expressed their concern that recent media reports could have led to a public misunderstanding as to the position about estimated assessments made by inspectors of taxes.  The statement indicated that inspectors of taxes do not deliberately inflate the tax assessments made by them and that, in the absence of a statement of income from the taxpayer concerned, the inspector makes an estimated assessment to the best of his information and judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer is the only person in a position to provide an accurate return of his income.  If he does not provide such a return on a timely basis, the inspector must resort to estimated assessments <Col N="2599" /> which may ultimately prove to be excessive. The remedy is in the hands of taxpayers and it consists of the submission by them of returns of income on time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to dissociate himself from the remarks which were published in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 20 September to which he referred.  They contain the sentences:</P>
      <P>These figures of large amounts outstanding from the self-employed tend to be bandied about but what appears to be outstanding is not real money at all.  Estimates are sent out to provoke people into giving us information of accounts and the figures published tend to be the inflated amounts of the estimated asessments.</P>
      <P>If that is not a clear indication from the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that there was a policy of sending out inflated assesments I cannot imagine what is.  I ask the Minister to dissociate himself from those remarks and to indicate to the public at large through this House that such a policy will not be pursued in the future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that <Col N="2600" /> early this afternoon two members of the Garda Síochána called to a house at Carnlough Road, Cabra, in pursuance of routine inquiries into the kidnapping of Mr. John O'Grady.  When searching the house their suspicions were aroused and one went to the patrol car to radio for assistance.  His colleague in the house was set upon by a number of men and received injuries, happily not serious ones.  A shoot-out subsequently occurred during which one member of the force, Detective Garda Martin O'Connor, sustained bullet and shotgun wounds.  As I understand it, he is being operated on even as I speak.</P>
      <P>Two men who had been holding Mr. O'Grady hostage in the house managed to escape from the area in a hijacked car but not before they had shot at Mr. O'Grady wounding him in the hand.  One of them is believed by the Garda to be wounded.  A third man was arrested.  The two men who escaped subsequently hijacked a second car in the Clondalkin area and a massive search is under way in an effort to locate it.  The Air Corps have been called in to assist.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to join with me in commending and congratulating the Garda Síochána for their excellent work today.  The good news is, however, marred by the bitter knowledge that one member of the force has sustained what are apparently serious injuries and a second was also injured.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by adding that the Garda are following a very definite line of inquiry in their search for the kidnappers of Mr. O'Grady.</P>

We ask for the support of the community at large in helping the Garda to seek our those who were responsible for this atrocity.  I <Col N="2601" /> wish to ask the Minister if he was aware that ransom was being paid in this case and, if so, what was his attitude?

In view of the belief held in respect of previous kidnapping events, I ask the Minister if he is absolutely certain that on this occasion no moneys passed to the perpetrators of this vicious crime?

      <P>Before moving the Adjournment I said that in the areas of banking, communications and transport this legislation will have a major impact. It will allow the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade the opportunity to analyse in some detail some of the concerns the public have to ensure that value for money and quality service is available.  I referred earlier to the whole question of energy and it is worthy of further comment.  There are major implications in this area for job creation, which is something that affects every household in the country.  None of us can feel satisfied that the monopoly situation that exists in the energy field is acceptable.  In the transport area Aer Lingus made great efforts to ensure that there would be no competition, but since competition was introduced it has benefited not only the consumer but the organisation that so resisted its introduction, namely, Aer Lingus.  The same could be said of the ESB.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will have to look into this in detail to see if the monopoly of the ESB could be broken and the provision of the service dissipated in some way to the private sector or some other body interested in providing the service.  Deputy Yates raised the question, particularly applicable to his constituency, of exorbitant charges being quoted and demanded by the ESB for the provision of a power supply.  This is because of the ESB's monopoly; there is no alternative competitor so one must pay the price demanded or go without the service.  That, today, is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>This legislation will have a tremendous impact and give a tremendous benefit if it is properly and vigorously pursued.  I compliment the Minister on bringing the legislation to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been anxiously <Col N="2669" /> awaiting the introduction of this Bill because in my own constituency certain areas have been adversely affected by the lack of power to deal with local monopolies. The effect of that has been to seriously and adversely affect the choice, range and quality available to shoppers.  I speak in particular about the Ballyfermot area.  It is seldom that I come into this House to speak on such a localised matter.  But Ballyfermot is just one example.</P>
      <P>People will say that in many parts of the city and the country people do not have any choice, that there is just one supermarket. That may well be but in those cases what the Minister or the State can do is quite restricted.  But in an area as big as Ballyfermot with between 40,000 and 50,000 people, only a couple of years ago there were three main groups, three different supermarkets and, by osmosis, as Lyndon Johnson might say, with the development and passage of time and take-overs and so on the only supermarkets now in the Ballyfermot area are owned by one group, Quinnsworth.  There is a widespread view in Ballyfermot that since all competition was removed there has been a very marked narrowing of (1) the range of goods available in those supermarkets, (2) the quality of those goods, (3) the price of those goods and (4) the courtesy and efficiency of service.  Quinnsworth deny this but it is the strong view of the overwhelming majority of shoppers in the Ballyfermot area.  I did a survey in the area and the view is held by as many as 93 per cent that there has been a serious deterioration under all four headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to do something about it last year as I was a Minister at the time and I found that as the law then stood there was very little that could be done about it.  However, I was very glad to hear that my esteemed colleague now sitting beside me here, Deputy Bruton, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, had plans afoot to introduce the legislation which is before us today.  I know this is not the be all and end all of restrictive practices legislation, that is not the last word <Col N="2670" /> because other things will have to be considered but my purpose in coming in here today &mdash; and I know Minister Reynolds will take on board what I am saying &mdash; is to point to the need to address the question of local monopoly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to interrupt because I know the Minister's civil servants will keep him very well informed of all the points raised but I would ask the Minister if he would consider, during the passage of this Bill, making such amendments as are necessary to give sufficient powers to control local monopoly, or to increase such powers.  Perhaps he would tell me what powers he has now to control local monopoly.</P>
      <P>I know there are problems. Quinnsworth could in fact close down two of the three supermarkets in Ballyfermot. In fact, they have already closed down one of them and are now building shopping units which they are going to sublet so the supermarket numbers are down from three to two already.  In response to any powers the Minister might exercise they might in fact close the second supermarket and leave only one and then where does competition lie? It is true that one cannot force other groups to go into Ballyfermot or any other area to open supermarkets in competition and I do not think this is the time for the Minister to introduce State supermarkets just to provide competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want my levity in any way to detract from the seriousness of the point I am making.  This point is especially valid in some of the large working class suburbs of Dublin with which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be particularly familiar.  These are areas where there is not enormous disposable <Col N="2671" /> income per household, although the shortage of disposable income per household could be somewhat balanced by the density of households in these areas like Ballyfermot, Finglas, Cabra and Drimnagh.  I plead with the Minister to look at these areas which are the areas of most deprivation, of greatest poverty, of greatest need, where they really do need to have available to them the cheapest possible goods and where very often the reverse is the case.  Because the supermarkets do not see these areas as particularly &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; there tends to be less competition, range and quality of service. The people who most of all need consideration and cheapest prices have least chance of getting them.</P>
      <P>I cannot pretend to have solutions to this problem.  Certainly, we could take steps to prevent local monopolies developing where there is already a number of supermarkets in a particular locality.  There are, it is true, difficulties in defining what is a locality.  Is Ballyfermot a locality?  Is Dublin west?  Is County Dublin?  How do you define localities around the country?  Is Ballinasloe a locality, or would competition between Ballinasloe and Athlone be sufficient? I can see difficulties in a Minister trying to force supermarkets to open up in specified localities just to provide competition. They are not going to do that if in their commercial judgment it is unwise.  In a democracy that is not possible. At least, the Minister should see to it that he has sufficient powers from here on to prevent the take-over of supermarkets in what he considers to be reasonably adjacent areas by people who already have a preponderant interest in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will forgive me for dwelling for so long on the Ballyfermot area, but there is a particular problem there.  There is no doubt about that.  It has been very badly served on the shopping scene by developers in the past two years.  I ask the Minister to look especially at the situation that has developed there, to see if there is anything that he can do to improve matters. <Col N="2672" /> If he cannot turn back the clock, can he hold out any hope for the people of Ballyfermot that they will have restored to them the same level of service, efficiency, courtesy, quality and price to which they were accustomed when there was competition?  Better still, is there anything that he can do about introducing competition into that area?  This is really an extremely vexed question.  It is of vital importance to the 6,000 households in Ballyfermot.  I very much hope that what happened there in the past few years will not be allowed to happen in other areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be of particular interest to almost every household because while it is very nice to have all sorts of very cheap goods available due to intense competition, how long can that last?  How long will the competition last? Will other areas end up, as Ballyfermot has, with a monopoly and a perceived dramatic worsening in service, quality, price, etc.?  That we cannot allow to happen.  It is what is happening, for example, in the American aviation industry where a very great number of airlines have gone to the wall and been taken over and there is now a very small number of mega-carriers.  The result is that many areas have lost their aviation services or had them reduced dramatically and in those areas prices have gone up, not down.  Certainly on the big lucrative routes air fares have gone down because they are the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; routes and there is intense competition.  That will last as long as there is competition, but if we allow prices to be charged which in the end destroy competition that is very shortsighted indeed &mdash; short-term advantage for long-term loss.  That was precisely the experience of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>I am especially pleading with the Minister to look specifically at the question of what happened there.  There are other areas such as Ballymun which is not in my constituency and where there is a fluctuating population but in Ballyfermot there is a very settled population who have seen their choice dramatically reduced.  I would be very grateful if the Minister launched a local inquiry, or took powers to enable such an inquiry to be <Col N="2673" /> launched, to look into what happened in Ballyfermot.  Then, having looked at the situation, I ask him to take powers to correct the deficiencies in choice, price, quality and efficiency of service in order to protect the most vulnerable and least well off in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me briefly comment on the Bill because I am sure the Minister wishes to complete Second Stage today. I wish to make only three points, the first being to welcome the Bill.  It is an essential piece of regulatory legislation which is very much in the public interest.  Many of the more recent happenings in the retail and wholesale trades and many other aspects of pricing mechanisms underline the necessity to have this legislation in force as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it exposes much of the mythology which abounds on these islands about the free market competitive system.  As the House well knows, there is no such thing and it is vital that the State should, as a matter of democratic regulation, exercise a degree of responsible control, not just democratic control, over the developments in the system.  The legislation is necessary and in a climate where there has been so much emphasis on deregulation in what is perceived to be the wish to develop a more competitive system, there has been an interesting pull-back in public interest in the bringing forward of this legislation.  To that extent there is a change of approach which is entirely welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, if we are to have a legislative mechanism working with benefit to the community at large, we must have some degree of effective monitoring of the overall system.  My greatest criticism of what has happened to date in that regard is that it is an intermittent fire brigade action and I regret that those involved in the more recent closures treated the Minister and his Department officials with a degree of contempt in giving the proposals to the Department at the last minute.  That should not be permitted to happen.  I appreciate the anger of the Minister in that regard.  In order to prevent <Col N="2674" /> it happening, we must have sufficient staff in the Department with sufficient competence and flexibility to get in early, to anticipate, monitor and review and, so to speak, investigate the likely trends.  It is essential that there be sufficient staff to undertake the vital work including, I would suggest, an overall degree of price monitoring which, if it is to be authentic and effective, must be done with thoroughness and expertise rather than a response to the various crises as they occur.  I urge the Minister, in impressing upon his colleagues in Government the need for this legislation, to hammer them over the heads now and again about the need to provide sufficient staff to undertake this work.  The Minister will find the members of the Labour Party and the other political parties in this House more than anxious to facilitate him in that respect.  On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill.  It has had a protracted period of gestation and I hope it will be enshrined without much delay.  It will make a considerable contribution towards regulating the economic areas which have to be dealt with in a more equitable and democratic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister for introducing it.  It is quite appropriate that it is this Minister who has introduced it because in the very short period he has been in office he has done more to try to break the cartels and the monopolies which are operating in this country than any previous Minister.  I have many concerns in regard to the monopolies which are operating and I ask the Minister to treat them seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to bank charges. The customers of the banks are concerned that the banks have been able to rip them off, particularly in recent years, through the introduction of charges for cheque books, money orders, lodgements and so on.  From the information which I have been given it appears that one of the biggest problems at present is that big businesses do not have to pay these charges while smaller businesses do.  Of course the banks will not admit <Col N="2675" /> that big businesses do not have to pay these charges but it is an absolute disgrace that small businesses have to pay these charges.  The banks are making massive profits and should not introduce these charges at a time when many businesses are finding it difficult to survive.  The Minister should seriously consider allowing building societies and post offices to offer these services in order to break the monopoly which exists at present.</P>
    <P>Another monopoly exists in the distribution of newspapers.  New shops which open up are not always given the right to sell newspapers due to the pressure which the newsagent associations can exert on the newspapers.  The circulation managers in <i>The Irish Press, Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> will tell a prospective customer that they are not accepting new accounts but the real reason why they are not accepting new accounts is that the newsagent associations exert pressure on them not to open up such accounts.  Any shop which wants to sell newspapers should be allowed to do so as selling newspapers increases the profitability of these shops, particularly those which open early and close late.</P>
    <P>Following the collapse of the H. Williams chain, there are now only four major supermarket chains operating in this country.  A monopoly exists in this area and it needs looking at.  Because of the monopoly which exists many small businesses have been forced to close down.  Some wholesalers can be prevented from selling to small shops and to new businesses which open up.  I have seen in my own constituency, and I am sure it happens in all other areas also, cases where a wholesaler has supplied a retailer for many years; when a new retailer opened up near the existing retailer the wholesaler has usually been threatened and told that if he supplies the new retailer the existing retailer will stop purchasing from him.  The Minister should ensure that each retailer will have the right to purchase from the wholesaler of their choice and that they are given a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Where does the consumer fit into this <Col N="2676" /> Bill?  The consumer is the one person who is affected most by the existence of monopolies.  The prime motive of those who hold a monopoly is to make massive profits.  There is nothing wrong with making a profit and I would not like the Minister to think that I am against people making a profit but the consumers have no one to protect them from the monopolies. Both the retailers and the wholesalers have associations to look after their interests but the only people who speak up on behalf of the consumers are the politicians who try to ensure that they get a fair deal from the companies they deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We should continue to play that role and ensure that the consumer will be able to buy goods at a fair price while at the same time protecting jobs.  The Minister should ensure that the consumer at all times is protected.  As I have said earlier, they have no one to speak up for them except themselves and I ask the Minister to ensure that as a result of the restrictions which will be placed on the monopolies the consumer will benefit.  Again, I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill and I hope that as a result of its enactment the consumer will be protected at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to take the opportunity of thanking all the Deputies who contributed to the debate which was both useful and informative. There appears to be some misunderstandings in the minds of some Deputies as to what this Bill does and does not cover and I would like to clear the air.  The banks, insurance companies, transport, post and telecommunications are all covered under this Bill.  Reference was made to both Visa and Access cards. I have already introduced a regulation in the Seanad, which I hope to introduce in this House in the near future, in relation to the investigation of the rates of interest charged, how they are advertised and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2677" /> Information was sought as to why the Government are pursuing actively the question of consumer protection.  In relation to the Estimate for the director's office I want to compare the position as it was with what it is now and allay some of the fears expressed in the House.  The outturn for 1986 was £192,00.  The Estimate for 1988 is £387,000.  I can understand that people might have doubts as to what might have happened.  We might be bringing in legislation and making no arrangements for its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister comparing like with like?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  This is streamlining the operations in the protection area.  There is no division of opinion in relation to it.  Deputy Bruton as Minister for Industry and Commerce in the previous Government had this Bill.  He asked here today whether the whole basis should be changed.  That is fair enough for future debate but, having gone through the Bill in his time in Government and since then, he should know that the prohibition system he talks about is not a new idea.  It was the subject of a report in 1977 by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  He stated in the House that he had discussions recently with the commissioner.  This has its pros and cons as everything else has, and probably we will go into this in more detail on Committee Stage, but I hope that this House will not hold up the present legislation while we get down to examining the prohibition system as against the control of abuse system.  This Bill is important and necessary in order to try to attack many of the areas about which serious concern has been expressed by various Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised regarding various professions, accountancy, the legal profession and so on.  Lest Deputies have any doubts about that, let me say that all those professions now come under this legislation.  They are being considered at the moment.  They have not been examined for years.  Do not look at me when somebody asks why they have not been looked at.  Why did the legal profession <Col N="2678" /> get away for so long?  Why did accountancy or any profession escape, if they did?  I have heard remarks being thrown around this House about rip-offs.  I am not saying there have been rip-offs but this matter could have been looked at and nobody seemed to look at it.  I will consider every aspect of every profession in an effort to achieve what I set out to do, that is, to get a better deal for the consumer.  As Deputy John Browne has just said, various areas of business and professions have their own lobbies.  Consumers have one lobby which should be the most effective of all, that is, their representatives in this House.  It is up to us all to ensure we give them the best deal possible.  Therefore, I hope there will be no misunderstanding about what is in and what is out.</P>
    <P>There may be some confusion about the banks.  The banks will be fully covered by the Restrictive Practices Act but they will not be subject to the Mergers and Monopolies Act, 1978.  That may be where the confusion arises.  It was never intended that the banks should be covered by that.  The Bill as published by the previous Government did not include them within the Mergers and Monopolies Act and none of the amendments made to the Bill in the Seanad had any effect, good, bad or indifferent, on this.  The Central Bank is responsible for the supervision of the financial institutions in this State.  The Central Bank monitors mergers and takeovers by banks in the context of their overall functions.  To bring banks within the Mergers and Monopolies Act would result in an undesirable duplication.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment that was brought in was to bring the new definition of service in the Second Schedule to the Bill into the body of the Bill.  I have not read the report of the Seanad debate.  Because something was described in a double negative fashion there may have been some difficulty about understanding it.  All we are doing is taking it from the Second Schedule to the Bill and putting it into the body of the Bill in order to make sure that the removal of exclusions was made clear to <Col N="2679" /> those reading the Bill.  It appears to have the opposite effect for some people but I hope it is clear now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and others asked why local authorities are excluded from the legislation and why this amendment was introduced in the Seanad.  The amendments introduced in the Seanad had no effect on the services excluded from the scope of the legislation.  Local authorities have always been excluded from the restrictive practices and mergers legislation on the basis that they do not engage in commercial activity.  Perhaps some Deputies misunderstood the purpose of the amendment.  Now I hope they will be clear in their minds about this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked why there were so few prosecutions.  I do not know how long he was in the Department but he was there longer than I have been up to now and maybe he could have answered the question for himself.  There were not many prosecutions.  The Examiner of Restrictive Practices is the man who acts on the complaints in relation to the operation of restrictive practices orders and where a <i>prima facie</i> case is established it is the policy of the Minister &mdash; and, I am sure, previous Minister &mdash; to pursue or prosecute.  The low number of prosecutions reflects the small number of complaints received by the examiner.  It is not just one-way traffic with piles of complaints coming in and no action taken.</P>
    <P>The question of cumbersome investigative procedures was raised by Deputy Bruton.  The purpose of the Act is to streamline the operations and to include those who were excluded.  The commission now are being given power to undertake inquiries on their own initiative rather than in the cumbersome way it was done previously.  I am sure the Deputy understands that.  He was quite clear about it when he was Minister.  If he does not understand any other part we will have plenty of time on Committee Stage to clarify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a reference to <Col N="2680" /> the desirability of the prohibition approach.  It has been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating said BTE and An Post should be covered. They are covered; they are in.  What may be confusing some people is that they have existing monopolies.  They are not excluded from the scope of this Bill.  They have been excluded up to now but they are brought fully into the scope of this Bill.  The monopoly position of those bodies does not change and their business will be scrutinised where they are in competion with anybody in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating said the penalties should be increased.  The penalties are being increased from a £200 fine and £10 per day for a continuing offence to £500 and £50 per day and on indictment from a £5,000 fine and £500 per day for a continuing offence to £10,000 and £1,000 per day.  I do not think anybody could object to that but, if so, we will hear from them on Committee Stage.  Deputy Keating must not have spotted where they have been increased.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating said that enforcement of consumer protection legislation is not effective and others made the same point. As I have explained, one of the primary purposes of this Bill is by the rationalisation of the procedures to streamline them and give them a better opportunity of being enforced.  The staff of the director's office have not been decreased but have been increased in the past year or so.  I have given the allocation, comparing 1986 with 1987, so this is not a cosmetic exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flood raised the importance of labelling and other Deputies referred to this, too.  That is covered by the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  Food labelling regulations of 1982 are being enforced by the Department.  Similarly, there are textile labelling regulations under the Bill and the director will enforce all this legislation.  Let me draw Deputy Flood's attention to the fact that new regulations in June this year require the E numbers to be given in the case of additives in food products.  I provided in regulations in June 1987 that the letter <Col N="2681" />&ldquo;E&rdquo; as a clear indication that additives are in the product be displayed for everybody's benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said that we have never pioneered our own legislation and that we have slavishly follwed EC Directives for five to ten years.  It is much the same point that Deputy Bruton raised in relation to the control of abuse system as against the prohibition system.  I will deal with that in more detail later.  The allegation by Deputy Yates does not stand up, certainly not to the extent he was trying to infer.  Our two major pieces of legislation, the Consumer Information Act and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, date from 1978 and 1980 respectively.  The main thrust of the Consumer Information Act is to deal with misleading advertising.  A directive in misleading advertising was adopted by the EC only in 1984, six years after we passed our Act.  Instead of lagging behind the EC we are ahead in consumer legislation. Neither do we lag behind any other member states in relation to other directives.  We are up to date and are ahead in many areas.</P>
    <P>Legislation is currently in preparation in a whole range of areas as a result of which further protection will be afforded to the consumer.  Legislation is in preparation on product liability, consumer credit, the practice known as doorstep selling and product safety.  I am requiring that the annual percentage rate of charge in interest be shown in advertisements which make reference to the cost of credit.  This is the regulation which has gone through the Seanad and will be coming before this House.  Since the regulation was brought before the Seanad it has been represented to me that perhaps the limits should have been increased somewhat.  I do not have a closed mind on this matter and I am concerned that regulations should be made to meet present-day circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates gave an example of an advertisement offering a refrigerator for sale, the price having been reduced from £100 to £80.  I suppose we could almost offer him a job in the Abbey Theatre on <Col N="2682" /> the basis of his presentation.  He alleges that misleading advertising of this type is not dealt with, but I take issue with him on that point.  Whatever example is given, the Consumer Information Act prohibits any indication that a product has been reduced from, say, £100 to £80 unless that product had been sold at the higher price for at least 28 days beforehand. Deputy Yates made wild allegations that we do not have legislation to deal with that situation but it is well and truly covered in the Consumer Information Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also talked about the possibility of a small claims court.  This is currently under examination in my Department.  The Deputy will be aware that there are major problems involved in setting up such a tribunal for dealing with consumer complaints which would operate outside the existing courts system.  Apart from the question of cost which must be significant, there are issues such as the procedures to be followed by such a tribunal, the legal representation of parties appearing before it and the enforcement of decision once reached. All these questions require to be teased out and when examination of the matter is fully concluded we will have consultation to see if it is feasible.  Deputy Yates was portraying the procedure as similar to a nice cosy chat involving two or three people, whereby agreement would be reached.  What if the agreement is not carried through?  It is a nice idea but when one thinks it through one realises that there is another side to the coin.  However, it is being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Col N="2683" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as loosely as represented here today.  I am not throwing away the concept but I cannot accept that it is simple and straightforward.  Regarding door-to-door selling, Deputy Yates said we should not wait for an EC directive but should go ahead and introduce our own measures.  The legal measures suggested by the Deputy are already covered by EC directives which have been adopted here and we hope to make regulations under these directives in the very near future.  This will provide the protection sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates also spoke about Visa and Access cards and the rates of interest being charged.  In June this year an order was approved by the Seanad which is currently awaiting approval by this House.  It will require that any advertisement which makes reference to the cost of credit shall indicate the actual cost of the credit by means of the annual percentage rate of charge.  This will enable the consumer to make up his or her mind in relation to the credit which is about to be availed of and to find what may be regarded as the best offer available. There will be transparency in the rate being advertised by various finance houses, Access, Visa, etc.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked why we abolished the National Consumer Advisory Council. He has long been a member of the party opposite with Deputy Bruton and he should remember that the council was abolished late in 1985 by the previous Government.  I do not think he should be asking me why it was abolished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points raised.  Any Deputy who wants further <Col N="2684" /> clarification will have an opportunity on Committee Stage.  It is no harm to tease out a little further the prohibition system as against the control of abuse system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question, if the Minister has the time, I do not expect an answer but the Minister might consider this point between now and Committee Stage.  A problem arose when I was Minister in regard to recommendations concerning conveyancing by solicitors.  We thought we could deal with the matter by means of an order under this legislation but the Attorney General in due course advised that this could not be done because there would have to be an amendment to the Solicitors' Act.  Once the matter was passed to another Department which was not directly concerned with competition, one got into inordinate delays.  The same problem is likely to crop up again and again in this area, particularly in view of the fact that we have extended the scope of the legislation.</P>
      <P>What I would ask the Minister to consider between now and Committee Stage is the possibility of introducing an amendment which would ensure that existing legislation can be amended with the agreement of the Cabinet under this legislation without the necessity of introducing a separate Bill.</P>
      <P>Since March and May respectively the Minister has on his table reports from the Commission on Restrictive Practices on the accountancy profession and the engineering profession.  When can we expect these reports to be published and acted upon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

As regards the Deputy's second question, the report dealing with the engineering profession is not back yet but the report on the accountancy profession has gone for publication and should be out next week.  Deputy Yates asked why we were not looking at the engineering and accountancy professions and other professions as well and perhaps Deputy <Col N="2685" /> Bruton would advise him when he meets him that work has gone ahead.</P>

      <P>What amuses me is that Deputies who have been in Government for four and a half years come in here asking me about legislation which, to a large extent, their Government drafted. I am not saying these Bills were drafted by anybody else.  Still, people who were involved in drafting this legislation are asking questions as if they had no responsibility for what was in the Bill. That amazes me.  I admit we do not all have great memories but we could not forget the most important part of legislation we drafted.  I cannot understand why all these questions are being raised. Anything the Coalition did we will give them credit for, but for heaven sake they should not run away from responsibility for things they did but did not like because they cannot have their loaf and eat it.</P>

      <P>It is because I have their questions in front of me and they are not here for my replies.  One would think they were new Deputies.  Deputy Flood, a new TD, made a decent contribution and pointed out the problems as the consumers saw them.  Listening to his contribution one would think he had been in this House for the past ten years but listening to experienced Deputies who spoke on this Bill &mdash; they were part of a Government which was in power for four and a half years &mdash; one would think everything was brand new to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flood raised the question of the ridiculous prices being charged by the ESB.  He said they did not seem to be responsible to this House or to anybody else, but these charges will be investigated. Telecommunications too will be investigated as well as postal charges and other areas which up to now were excluded.  They will get the same treatment as everybody else.  I hold the view that for far too long some monopolies have been providing services to the community and were allowed to decide their own charges.  At the end of the day those charges were passed to the private sector who had to sell their goods on competitive markets abroad.  There was no way those people could retrieve the cost of these services although for their competitors energy costs, telecommunications charges and postal charges were much lower.  Is it any wonder Irish industry is so uncompetitive? Hopefully this Bill will be able to make these companies justify their charges.  This applies also to banking charges, Visa cards and other new developments.  We will take this opportunity to have these areas investigated because the purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the Irish consumer gets a better deal.  We are trying to keep costs down and this is part of an ongoing operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a very quick word about a fundamental change in our approach to competition legislation about which <Col N="2687" /> Deputy Bruton was talking to Commissioner Sutherland in Brussels recently.  This idea is not new.  A study was carried out in 1977.  Without having gone into this in detail, I will give a quick, off the top of my head reaction to it.  The theory is nice but the cost of applying this practice to a small country like Ireland would be fairly hefty.  Even when the study was carried out in 1977, and when one takes into account the inflexibility built into the EC bureaucracy, I am not sure, on balance, if our approach, where we can home in on a specific problem with an order, is not better than the very expensive procedure suggested by the Deputy.  All I can say is that it is worth looking at the Deputy's suggestion that we consider the Articles in the Treaty of Rome but I would not be prepared to hold up this legislation for such a basic change.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann welcomes the present regional initiative for peace represented by the peace accord known as ESQUIPULAS II signed in Guatemala by the leaders of the Central American States:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;In so far as this development has been regarded as the most hopeful prospect for peace in this region;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;in so far as a response has already been forthcoming from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa <Col N="2689" /> Rica, in relation to democratic rights, civil liberties and press freedoms, in response to the terms of the peace accord;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and noting the actions of the Government of Nicaragua in particular, in complying fully with the spirit and the letter of the peace accord ahead of time; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting that the Nicaraguan response contains <i>inter alia</i> the inclusion in its national and local Reconciliation Commissions, many of those who have been most critical and opposed to the Nicaraguan State since the revolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann now commits itself to actively supporting nationally and internationally this peace initiative leading up to its valid date for implementation on 7th November, 1987 and supports the call to all States with an interest in the region to honour the spirit and letter of the peace accord.  And Dáil Éireann urges that we advance this view within the European Community and that it transmits this resolution to the Governments of Central America, The United States, The Soviet Union, Member States of the European Community and the EC Commission and Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that a consensus has emerged in the House to support what is now regarded as the last and best prospect for peace of a political kind in the region.  There is a precedent for this.  The House in 1981-82 adopted a consensus position in relation to developments in El Salvador which was extremely important and at a difficult time when there were important meetings at San Jose to discuss the relationship of the European Community to the Central American region. It was very important that that consensus had been established.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that there is an urgency about our motion which represents a consensus view.  Obviously, most of us will have our own views on what has taken place.  If people had been watching television <Col N="2690" /> yesterday evening they would have seen in one of the reports from John Snow, who has produced many reports in Central America, a very moving sight. It was of the efforts by the Nicaraguan Government to try to build on the process of reconciliation.  Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have been moving towards the Honduran border to make contact with the members of their families who had either left to join the Contras or had been in Honduras for other reasons.  It was clear in the programme that the period of the cease fire, which had been introduced in selected areas by the Nicaraguan Government, had been used by the Contras to extend their activities. That programme showed the Contra troops with new uniforms which they claimed were given to them in the last 14 days, new weapons and so on.  In other words some of the best efforts of the Nicaraguan Government had been met by a response from the agents of death, as I call them in the United States and elsewhere who formally and informally are providing funds to buy weapons to send to organisations which are trying to destabilise the Nicaraguan Government.</P>
    <P>My views are heavily influenced by that part of the motion which stresses the efforts the Nicaraguan Government have made to comply with the spirit of Esquipulas II.  There have been an extraordinary series of concessions by a country that has suffered badly in recent years.  For example, few people realise that over 60 per cent of domestic production in Nicaragua has to be spent on defence, dislocating the internal economy enormously.  Few people realise that tens of thousands of people have been injured and murdered, including foreign workers who assisted Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>Members of the House representing all parties attended the Nicaraguan elections in November 1984 and we saw free democratic and open elections.  The Government of Nicaragua is a sovereign Government.  It has been elected properly but it is under siege from hired mercenaries funded by an outside State privately and, on and off, publicly.  That is unacceptable because what is at stake <Col N="2691" /> is the sovereignty of a nation and its independence as it has to compensate for the dislocation of the economy which is being visited in terms of food shortages and other hardships which the people have to bear.  The Nicaraguan Government find themselves in the unique position of having to state a case before the International Court of Justice.  That case was based on the mining of its ports and the threats to international shipping that took place.</P>
    <P>The Government in Nicaragua have gone along with a great number of peace initiatives.  The history of the peace initiatives began with the formation of the Contadora in January 1984 and involved Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, Panama, Latin American and European nations which then supported the Contadora process.  However, whatever Nicaragua has agreed it finds, as the Vice-President, Dr. Sergio Ramirez stated, that the goal posts are continually being changed, something else is being looked for.  The Nicaraguan Government in honouring the spirit of this latest initiative have gone beyond the letter and the requirements of the agreement.  The five presidents of the Central American countries signed the procedure for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America in Guatemala, an agreement referred to as Esquipulas II on 7 August.  On 10 August the President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, organised a presidential commission to watch over the implementation of this accord.  The commission was initially presided over by President Ortega and when the subcommittee was established it included Dr. Ramirez and Miguel D'Escoto but, more importantly, when on 21 August the commission for reconciliation was appointed the Catholic bishops submitted its list of three which included His Eminence, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Archbishop of Managua; Monsignor Salvador Schlaeffler, Bishop of Bluefields and Monsignor Bosco Vivas Robelo, Auxilliary Bishop of Managua.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2692" /> It was open to the Nicaraguan authorities to pick a person who was less a critic of themselves than Cardinal Obando y Bravo but the Cardinal was chosen to chair the commission for reconciliation. On 24 August a group of five opposition political parties, the Popular Social Christian Party, the Conservative Democratic Party, the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement, the Nicaraguan Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Workers Party, submitted a list of candidates for inclusion.  The point I am anxious to make is that the Nicaraguan Government have included in their institutions, which are mechanisms for achieving reforms within Nicaragua itself, many of the people who have been their greatest critics.</P>
    <P>Much has been made from time to time in the European press of the censorship of <i>La Prensa</i>.  I very much appreciate the concession the Nicaraguan Government made.  I was in Nicaragua at a time when <i>La Prensa</i> published some material which suggested that a plague was taking place in the northern part of Nicaragua.  I assure you that such material would not be published here in conditions of war. Nevertheless, the censorship on <i>La Prensa</i> has been lifted and it has been appearing regularly.</P>
    <P>A whole series of concessions have been made by Nicaragua.  In addition, as I mentioned, there have been ceasefires in certain areas.  There have been dramatic and moving visits by people to the Honduran border to meet their relatives. Some of the sons of the families have come home, some husbands have also come home but some have not.  What is very clear is that Nicaragua, from the time of the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, has moved from being a country in which there was very little participation, where over 40 per cent of the total arable land was owned by the extended Somoza family, where there was very little opportunity for participation, where there was a high degree of illiteracy, to a country that has put its people's needs first.  There have been dramatic increases in the reduction of illiteracy.  It has established communal <Col N="2693" /> health clinics, it has allowed greater participation in society, it has held elections which have been witnessed by 1,000 observers and 1,000 journalists.  It is a country which has been under siege.  A country that has suffered as much as Nicaragua, that has been attacked not only by the continuing threat of military aggression which has dislocated its economy but in terms of trade and tacit and overt attempts to isolate it and has had obstructions placed against it in relation to the raising of loans internationally, has also been the victim of a massive campaign of disinformation in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It gave me no pleasure a few months ago to draw attention to those papers which had become available which showed that at the very time the elections were taking place in the United States and in Nicaragua, meetings were taking place on how to vilify the electoral process in Nicaragua among significant European intellectuals.  It has been to the great credit of the Irish people that they have very quickly seen the issues at stake in the case of Nicaragua.  They know that the issues are of a people who have been struggling for independence, a people who simply want bread, freedom and participation. They are people who have been attacked, not so much because of what they are but because of the example they offer in relation to the path of development in Central and Latin America.</P>
    <P>There are three models historically available for changes that have taken place in the Central and Latin American Continent.  One was the bouncing in and out of dictators from time to time with the occasional heave of the army.  The other was some kind of transition from military to puppet régime.  However, the transition that took place after Somoza had left Nicaragua was one that offered participation to all the citizens.  It did so in extraordinarily difficult conditions and it is that kind of large, popular participation and choice given to build a civilisation of simplicity, to meet basic needs and then move on, that has drawn <Col N="2694" /> the harangue against Nicaragua.  The people I have heard described as the equivalent of the Contras, for example, the so-called freedom fighters of the past, who are in the camps in Honduras, were closely associated with Somoza's national guard and many of them have blood on their hands.  Every single condition of Esquipulas II has been met by Nicaragua but sometimes the downright mischievous insistence on the condition that the Nicaraguan Government have to enter into direct negotiations with murderous mercenaries who have slaughtered its citizens, placed ambushes and mines for foreign aid workers, means that they must be precluded from direct negotiations from those who are paying the bills in Washington.</P>
    <P>If there are negotiations, they should be in the context of strengthening this regional initiative and, if other negotiations are needed, they should be between the United States and the sovereign Government of Nicaragua.  It is very interesting to think of Nicaraguans being reconciled on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.  In one ambush, two weeks ago, as a result of mines, 40 Nicaraguan soldiers were killed because the Contras had penetrated beyond the Honduran border, using the period of a ceasefire to try to consolidate their position and to represent a greater threat to the Nicaraguan Government.  The principles of the treaty which we are discussing in relation to international reconciliation, dialogue and amnesty, means that the dialogue is an internal one in Nicaragua. It does not include talking to the Contras.</P>
    <P>The ceasefire has been implemented with great risk by Nicaragua.  In relation to the calendar of democratisation, I have given examples of where it has been extended.  I believe that free elections to the Central American Parliament can be achieved.  The suspension of military aid to irregular and insurgent groups is the challenge and one to which we must lend our voice.  We want those insurgent and mercenary forces &mdash; and the assistance given to them &mdash; ended.  In relation to the non-use of other territory for destablisation attacks, the countries involved in <Col N="2695" /> the region do not want to attack each other but want to live as a region in peace. They are in favour of arms reduction and there is a necessity for refugees and displaced persons to be returned as quickly as possible.  There are statements in the accord for co-operation and development and there are procedures for international verification and monitoring.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this House has lent its voice &mdash; and is willing to lend its voice &mdash; to the importance of Esquipulas II.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to be speaking on an all-party motion supporting the peace accord known as the Esquipulas II Agreement.  The core concept of this agreement is the notion of States settling their disputes by peaceful means, and without external intervention.</P>
      <P>The accord represents the hope that the countries of Central America &mdash; whose continuing political experience is of revolution and violence &mdash; can now work together for the peaceful and democratic development of their countries. The Esquipulas II Agreement signals the consolidation of the struggle for democratic freedom and political structures. The full scope and intention of the accord is stated in very positive terms:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to fully take up the historic challenge of forging a destiny of peace for Central America;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to commit ourselves to the struggle for peace and put an end to war;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to ensure that dialogue prevails over violence and reason over rancour;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to dedicate this peace effort to the youth of Central America whose legitimate aspirations for peace and social justice, freedom and reconciliation have been frustrated for so many generations;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;to make the Central American <Col N="2696" /> Parliament a symbol of freedom and independence, and of the reconciliation we aspire to in Central America.</P>
    <P>This is a very powerful assertion of regional solidarity, which provides the most feasible and potentially successful basis for ending the different conflicts in the region and tackling the fundamental causes of instability.  It is also the best possible option for setting out on a sound course for instituting economic growth and development in the region by tying it into the process of building political stability.</P>
    <P>The individual states realise and accept the urgent need to restore a Central American Common Market.  The seventies saw the end of three decades of rapid, if badly distributed, growth, with falling commodity prices, Latin debt problems and the collapse of the Central American Common Market all contributing, in a context of violence and instability, to negative growth rates while the region's population doubled over a period of 25 years.  This is truely a recipe for desperation and despair.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would point out that our concern on matters in the Central American region is based on three main elements, the furtherance of respect for human rights, the promotion of essential social and economic reforms, and the necessity to have a political, as opposed to a military, solution to any conflict there.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to Central America is generally shared by our colleagues in the European Community who have supported initiatives such as the Contadora Initiative of 1982 and the Costa Rica Declaration of 1984 and who have publically stated that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means, but only by a political solution springing from within the region itself, and respecting the inviolability of national frontiers.  That is why I hope that this House will very warmly support this latest and, I hope successful effort to find that solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2697" /> The European Community has been granting economic assistance to the Central American countries.  It is now essential that we forcefully underline our continued support for European aid to the region.  In the preamble to the Accord, the political leaders specifically appeal for support from the international community, when they say:</P>
    <P>We ask for the respect and assistance of the international community in our efforts.  There are Central American ways to achieve peace and development, but we need assistance to make them a reality.  We ask for international treatment which would guarantee development so that the peace we seek will be a lasting peace.  We firmly reaffirm that peace and development are inseparable.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>The Esquipulas II Accord is an extended approach to a series of wide-ranging and seemingly intransigent problems. The plan provides for all five countries to hold &ldquo;dialogues&rdquo;, which would allow for popular participation with &ldquo;full guarantee in authentic political processes of a democratic nature based on justice, freedom and democracy......the corresponding governments will initiate a dialogue with all unarmed internal political opposition groups and with those who availed themselves of the amnesty.&rdquo; This amnesty will be extended to all those in the broad category of &ldquo;irregular forces.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Democratisation is assured by the commitment contained within the Accord that:</P>
    <P>The governments commit themselves to promote an authentic, democratic, pluralist and participatory process that includes the promotion of social justice, respect for human rights, [State] sovereignty, the territorial integrity of States, and the right of all nations to freely determine, without outside interference of any kind, its economic, political and social model, and to carry out in a verifiable manner <Col N="2698" /> those measures leading to the establishment, or in their instances, the improvement of representative and pluralist democratic systems which would provide guarantees for the organisation of political parties, effective popular participation in the decision-making process and to ensure free access to different currents of opinion to honest electoral processes and newspapers based on the full exercise of citizen's rights.</P>
    <P>We would all subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>The commitment to hold free elections is seen by the architects of Esquipulas II as a central element of the process.  The document envisages elections being held for a Central American Parliament, proposed in the 1986 Esquipulas Declaration. These elections are envisaged as taking place simultaneously &ldquo;in all countries throughout Central America in the first half of 1988, on a date mutually agreed by the Presidents of the Central American states.  These elections will be subject to vigilance by the appropriate electoral bodies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Prior to commencing the electoral process, Esquipulas II provides for the establishment of national reconciliation commissions.  I quote:</P>
    <P>In order to verify the compliance with the commitments that the five Central American governments subscribed to by the signing of this document, concerning amnesty, cease fire, democratisation, and free elections, a National Reconciliation Commission will be established whose duties will be to verify the actual carrying out in practice of the national reconciliation process, as well as the full exercise of all civil and political rights of Central American citizens guaranteed in this document.</P>
    <P>The Chair will notice that I am repeating the words, justice, freedom and democracy.  I do so because these are so essential to bringing about a solution in Central America.  We encourage everybody to take part in that.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Esquipulas II are <Col N="2699" /> intended to be symmetrical and simultaneous. Regrettably, the circumstances in each of the countries are not so streamlined.  A range of different factors characterise the internal balance of power in each of these states.</P>
    <P>Honduras, for example, does not have regular forces of any major size or significance, nor have the authorities there yet established a national reconciliation council.  The Honduras administration has not yet adopted a realistic approach to the political consequences of the continuing Contra presence on its territory, and the impact of this presence on the Esquipulas process.</P>
    <P>In Guatemala, there exists a quasi-civilian government under Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, which is currently preoccupied with pushing forward tax reforms against the establishment.  The breakdown of talks between the authorities and resistance movement leaders in Guatemala, held in Madrid, has been followed by the inconsistent resorts to violence by both authorities and rebel leaders.  This pattern of behaviour bodes ill for the prospect of establishing a joint committee for reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Costa Rica enjoys an altogether more comfortable, and developed social structure, a Welfare State mechanism and a free education system.  However, it also struggles under the yoke of a masssive national debt &mdash; almost 4.5 billion dollars &mdash; which will make this State very vulnerable indeed to the continuing social and political instability of the region.</P>
    <P>In El Salvador, the efforts made by President Duarte, and his continuing and courageous commitment to secure peace and progress in this country are worthy of salute.  The arbitrary and inconsistent response of the FMLN is regrettable for the prospects of a successful implementation of the contents and provisions of Esquipulas II.  This plan offers the best possible and available mechanism for building a lasting peace and there must be more whole-hearted response from the FMLN in respect of the efforts of the Duarte Government to find a common-ground for all groups to engage in this process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2700" /> In Nicaragua, the rate at which the society, its social, economic and political structures have been transformed has been rapid, to say the least.  But fundamental and lasting economic progress is not possible without equal recognition and protection of human rights and the full official acceptance and endorsement of a legitimate role for democratic parliamentary opposition.  Again, continuing absence of progress on this matter will impede the realisation of those objectives set out in the Esquipulas II Accord.</P>
    <P>Throughout the whole region, there has to be an acceptance and active promotion of the essential link between economic development and the introduction of democratic institutions with full public participation.  This feature is, characteristically, the cornerstone of any acceptable system of human rights.</P>
    <P>If the Arias Plan, as it is also termed, is to have any real chance of being actualised in the Central American region, there must be a clear understanding among all the parties involved in this region as to the responsibilities which are imposed by acceptance of its terms.</P>
    <P>On the resistance movements in each of the countries involved, the plan imposes a responsibility to make a genuine transition from armed resistance to the political process proper, and an acknowledgement that this is the only acceptable manner in which to effectively secure and underpin peaceful and democratic progress.  This is simply not achievable if these groups continue to act with the ballot box in one hand and a Kalashnikov in the other.</P>
    <P>On each of the Governments in the different states is imposed a responsibility to develop a unified position which effectively established the conditions where a ceasefire may be secured prior to any commencement of talks aimed at building up a lasting and a genuine peace settlement for the region.</P>
    <P>On the Government, and indeed the President of the United States, there is imposed a duty to avoid, at all costs, introducing an artificial and an unhealthy rigidity into the actualisation of the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2701" /> Esquipulas II Accord.  The frame of reference which the US administration is using to judge the success or failure of the accord is not one which gives any weight, or which appears not to give sufficient weight to the fact that the individual governments within each of the states in the Central American region are trying to operate in a highly sensitive and extremely volatile situation.  The consequences of even a minor wrong move are so serious that these governments must be given a full and positive scope to pursue the peace process without unhelpful pressure distorting the timescale within which progress is possible.</P>
    <P>All parties involved in the Esquipulas II process, including the Soviet Union and Cuba, must acknowledge and appreciate that establishing peace, securing democratic development and the promotion of human rights is a complex process, and a process which will inevitably take a long time.  The emphasis currently being placed on the so-called &ldquo;November 7th Deadline&rdquo; and references to a vital &ldquo;simultaneity&rdquo; of progress must not be used by any external state as offensive weapons in a dangerous diplomatic battle.  This is not just playing politics, it is playing with people's lives, because the well-being and indeed the lives of many people in the Central American region are inextricably bound up with the success or failure of Esquipulas II.  It is essential that there be a sane, rational and mature approach taken by all those involved in the process.  Hard-line rhetoric and artificial posturing for the sake of attracting media attention cannot be permitted to interfere with or impede in any way the vital objective of ending bloodshed, repression and despair.</P>
    <P>It often seems that the business of conducting foreign policy is a mysterious art, cloaked in an obscure series of rituals.  Its procedure and its objectives may be seen at times to be complex and its results hard to determine, identify or quantify. Nonetheless, the basis of foreign policy is, and continues to be, concerned with how nations and people live and work with each other.  Our foreign policy in <Col N="2702" /> this country must reflect the idealism of our people and must mirror the values which we in this country cherish.  At all times we must seek to reflect our passionate opposition to violence and war, as unacceptable instruments for promoting any view in a national or international forum.  Furthermore, Irish foreign policy has to be based on a shared belief that human rights around the world are the vital concern of every nation and of every individual.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the debate which we have here today, and I would urge all my colleagues to support the proposal to increase the amount of Dáil time which is allocated to debate and discuss matters relating to foreign affairs.  A policy best serves and reflects the nation when it is based on public awareness, involvement and knowledge of the issues.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Esquipulas II Accord, we know that it represents the most hopeful prospect to date for peace in the region &mdash; and I agree with Deputy Michael Higgins on that.  In so far as there has been a positive response from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica in relation to democratic rights, civil liberties and press freedom, we know that there is a realistic hope of real progress being made towards the objective of peace.  As a political body, Dáil Éireann must commit itself to actively supporting Esquipulas II both at a national and at an international level. In particular, we must use our voice at European level to secure the maximum level of support for this process, and to ensure that the established channels of communication and support which currently exist between Europe and Central America are enhanced sufficiently to allow this support to have a positive impact on developments over the next few months.</P>
    <P>There are 12 separate sections contained within Esquipulas II.  The provisions of these sections cover reconciliation, cessation of hostilities, democratisation, free elections, cessation of assistance to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements, the non-use of territories to attack other states, negotiations on matters <Col N="2703" /> relating to security, verification, control and limitation of armaments, refugees and displaced persons, co-operation, democracy and freedom for peace and development, international verification and follow-up, acceptance of a calendar for implementing the agreement.  Each of these elements must receive full attention and full consideration by all of the parties involved, but we must be careful to avoid a situation where all possible progress on the individual headings is jeopardised by unnecessary or artificial restraints.  This is not a simple process.  We must avoid a simplistic approach or an unrealistic insistence on compliance by all states without reference to the individual conditions which obtain within each state.</P>
    <P>The possibility for peace, free and democratic development and the safeguarding of human rights is within the grasp of the peoples of Central America. Let no nation, no individual, be responsible for destroying this precious opportunity.</P>
    <P>I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, to discuss the present regional initiative for peace represented by the peace accord signed in Guatemala by the leaders of the Central American States.  I welcome also this opportunity &mdash; the first since this Government came to power earlier this year &mdash; to discuss a particular aspect of foreign affairs policy in this House.</P>
      <P>At a time when the Anglo-Irish Agreement is being thrown into sharp relief by the unique demands made on the British and Irish Governments, it is particularly appropriate for the people of Ireland to be reminded of the spirit of compromise and community and a new awareness of political realities which has grown in the five Central American States covered by this peace accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations, summed up the significance of this peace accord when he referred to it as &ldquo;an event of great importance which provides an <Col N="2704" /> unprecedented opportunity to establish peace in Central America&rdquo;.  The motion before this House, which has been signed by representatives of all of the parties, welcomes the initiative in so far as it is regarded as the most hopeful prospect for peace in the region; in so far as a response has already been forthcoming from the Goverments in relation to democratic rights, civil liberties, and press freedoms; noting the actions of the Government of Nicaragua, in particular, in complying fully with the spirit and the letter of the peace accord ahead of time; and noting that the Nicaraguan response contains <i>inter alia</i> the inclusion in its national and local reconciliation commissions, many of those who have been most critical and opposed to Nicaragua since the revolution.</P>
    <P>On this basis, I am pleased to give the endorsement of the Progressive Democrats to this peace accord this evening.</P>
    <P>The Presidents of the five Central American States who signed the accord three months ago in Guatemala asked for the respect and assistance of the international community in their efforts.  We are pleased, by passing this motion, to add Ireland's voice to those of the United Nations, the European Commission, the European Parliament and, in a more qualified way, the American Government in supporting the peace plan.</P>
    <P>Like the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the peace accord marks a very significant and large step on the road to peace and stability, but it would be naive to think that the problems of a region like Central America can be solved overnight.  A number of aspects of the accord are worthy of particular attention.  It is particularly heartening to see the extraordinary way in which the Presidents of five Central American countries have come to terms with their changed circumstances and have determined, in this agreement, to overcome their obvious differences for the sake of peace and stability.</P>
    <P>Up until the recent past, the States which have signed the accord were bitterly divided internally and against each other.  Nicaragua, in particular, was noticeably isolated from her neighbours <Col N="2705" /> and all countries were highly suspicious of each other.  This isolation and hostility has now been replaced by a spirit of trust and community, a new awareness of the need to be co-operative and to overcome the troubles which have beleagured Central American for so long.  This sense of community and co-operation is demonstrated particularly by the proposal in the accord to establish a regional parliament for Central America.  This parliament would have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the process of interregional reconciliation is advanced and in guaranteeing real stability in the region. If we cast our minds back not too far, we will be reminded of the similar role which the creation of the European Economic Community played in this area and of the success it enjoyed in putting an end to the climate of hostility and division which had plagued Europe after many wars.  We can only hope that the parliament for Central America, if it comes about, will enjoy similar success to the European Parliament and the EC.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the signatories to the accord to &ldquo;free pluralist and honest elections&rdquo; and to ensure that, as they say, &ldquo;dialogue prevails over violence and reason over rancour&rdquo; are also commendable provisions of the accord.</P>
    <P>That the leaders of El Salvador and Nicaragua, in particular, should commit themselves to such aims is what makes this peace plan so significant.</P>
    <P>This commitment, in itself, will not ensure the success of the Agreement and I would urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, to bring pressure to bear, on behalf of a neutral country like Ireland, in all fora to ensure that the five Presidents follow through on the implementation of the peace accord from next Saturday.</P>
    <P>While the aims of the accord are laudable in the extreme, it could be said that the provisions of the plan are high on aspiration while lacking in concrete proposals. The determination of the International Community to implement the plan, therefore, is extremely important. <Col N="2706" /> This is where Ireland can play a large role on the world stage.</P>
    <P>While supporting the proposals in the plan, there are some signs that events in Nicaragua and some Latin American countries have not been in full compliance with the plan since it was signed in August.  Some of the countries, for example, have not even commenced talks with their opposition parties and the fact is that the five Presidents who were signatories to the plan have asked in the last week or so for an extension of a further two months of the period within which the plan will be implemented.  I am just putting down a marker in this regard and in doing so I do not wish to take away from the significance of the achievement of the accord and what it represents for the Central American region.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, as I said earlier, that all parties in this House have agreed to support the Peace Accord in the motion before us this evening.  I would be a much happier person, however, if I knew that some of the smaller parties who are so willing to get involved in problems in Nicaragua, were as willing to condemn the Soviet presence in Afghanistan.  That, I think, is a point worth noting for a country which is supposedly neutral.</P>
    <P>Our so called &ldquo;traditional policy on Neutrality&rdquo; was &mdash; and is &mdash; the most important instrument of Ireland's foreign policy if this country, as a smaller nation, is to play a meaningful, independent role in the EC and the world at large today. I would be happier, as I said earlier, if The Workers' Party, for example, were as willing to condemn the USSR's interest in countries like Afghanistan as they are to condemn America's involvement in countries like Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>By and large, apart from the peace plan itself, which I welcome, there are several noteworthy features about this evening's special debate.  The most important thing is that it is happening at all.  This is the first debate on any aspect of Foreign Affairs which has occurred in this House for all of this year.  I draw to your attention, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the fact that it is taking place outside of normal sitting hours.  This debate <Col N="2707" /> only came about because a few members of this House offered to sit longer hours today to discuss such an important international development.  To that extent, no provision was made, in normal Government time, for a Foreign Affairs debate.</P>
    <P>Since this is the first debate on foreign policy since this Government came to office, I would again appeal to the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, to actively pursue the proposal from the Opposition parties to set up an all-party committee on Foreign Affairs. The Taoiseach appeared to be in favour of such a committee before the Dáil summer recess.  When asked if any progress had been made on the matter last week, however, he had nothing to report. As was evident in the debate and referendum on the Single European Act, the Irish people have a special interest in foreign policy issues and I believe that they would like to see such subjects being debated more often in this House.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that we practise a bogus neutrality in this country for the world of the eighties.  I stated this some months ago.  Our neutrality was inherited, in large part, from the Second World War when the circumstances were quite different.  In other words, the ground rules which applied then are not relevant in the world of today.</P>
    <P>The case can be made now for a major change in Ireland's attitude to neutrality so that we can help create the climate for, for example, disarmament between West and East in all fora in which we are involved.</P>
    <P>The practical manifestations of a truly neutral policy has not been pursued by our political leaders in the recent past mainly, in my opinion, because politicians are afraid to lead public opinion by opening up a debate on what we, as a people, mean by neutrality.  It was for this reason that the Progressive Democrats, in the name of Deputy Martin Cullen, tabled a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday asking him if the issue of disarmament was being <Col N="2708" /> pursued by this country in the context of European political co-operation, and I must say that I was very pleased when the Minister reported that matters relating to disarmament are raised and discussed by all partners, including Ireland, in the context of the meetings which take place in this area within the framework of European political co-operation.  I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>If as appears to be the case, we are now actively pursuing a positive policy on disarmament through European political co-operation, I would welcome that development.  In the same way, I welcome this opportunity to debate the Peace Accord for Central America in the House today and commend its contents. My hope now is that all points of view will be heard at the negotiating table in Nicaragua and the other four Central American countries, in order to move towards the true democratisation of the region.</P>
    <P>It is the peace accord which we are commending to the House this evening and I earnestly hope that the Governments of Nicaragua, Guatemala and the other three Governments will support and implement the letter as well as the spirit of its aims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when we here face so many social and economic problems, it is heartening that we have made time available in the House to debate the plight of those less fortunate than ourselves, mainly in the Central American countries.  In so doing we are displaying that old Irish characteristic of concern for our fellowman.  I am glad that that characteristic is still very healthy and alive here.</P>
      <P>We are of course also demonstrating that when it comes to matters of civil rights and injustice in any part of the world there are no political divides.  I am pleased to be associated with this motion and to stand solidly with my colleagues in helping to find a final solution to the problems of the Central American countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that we are debating this motion almost on the eve of November 7 <Col N="2709" /> which is the deadline set for the implementation of the conditions of the peace accord.  There are conflicting reports about the progress of that accord. The fact that the Presidents of these countries have tried to find common ground for peace and dialogue is progress in itself.  The fact that we are debating the issue here this evening will I hope be regarded nationally and internationally as an indication of the solidarity of the Irish people with any group of parliamentarians anywhere in the world seeking to bring about peace.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up to this debate we must forward to the Presidents of these countries indications of our goodwill and solidarity with them in their efforts.  We must also express our disapproval of and disappointment with any country putting obstacles in the way of finding a final solution.</P>
    <P>The subject of peace is particularly significant at this time.  The world breathed a sigh of relief at the report of progress in discussions between the Presidents of America and the Soviet Union.  These two leaders of the world's most powerful States must at the end of the day reflect in their decision-making the yearning for peace within each of the countries they represent and we in Ireland fully support them in their efforts.</P>
    <P>History, however, has taught us that the threat to peace does not always come directly from the actions of the so-called super powers.  It has in the past come, and is more likely in the future to come, from small developing nations in the shadows of these two super powers who are prepared to manipulate them as pawns in their quest for power.  It is in that context that the Central American peace plan is important and it is in that context, too, that I fully support the initiative taken independently by the Governments of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The plan represents the best hope in years of bringing about peace and of ending the bitter conflict between Central American countries which has existed for perhaps over 20 years.</P>
    <P>Attempts were made in the past by <Col N="2710" /> some of the Central American countries to bring about unity and peace.  Indeed, many of us had hopes that the Contadora Agreement would have been the basis on which unity and agreement would have been eventually reached.  We watched with disappointment at the manipulation of some of these small nations, mainly El Salvador and Honduras, which led to the collapse of the Contradora proposals.  It was, again, a further example of the old maxim with which we in Ireland are very familiar, &ldquo;divide and conquer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have had the honour and opportunity of representing this House as a member of the all-party delegation which supervised the first democratic elections in Nicaragua.  Our report on that election is in the Library of this House and is testimony to the efforts of the Government and the people of that country to secure their freedom as an independent nation and their right to self-determination. I have been also to El Salvador and have experienced at first-hand the terrible plight of the people as they search desperately for a say in deciding their own future.  I had hopes that the new Administration there under President Duarte would have brought about desirable changes and I am disappointed that the good people of that country continue to live in an atmosphere of desperation and, indeed, very little hope.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the full implementation of the peace accord could, and it is hoped will not only be the foundation on which world peace can be assured but will also be the turning point in the economic, social and political development of the Central American region. We in this House, because of our close relations and affinity with the United States of America, are slow to question or be critical of the decisions of the United States Government.  We acknowledge the role and the commitment of successive administrations in that country in negotiating for world peace.  We record the help which we ourselves have received in the past in our own struggle for independence.  The above fine record of international commitment to peace <Col N="2711" /> and economic development makes the role of the United States in relation to the peace accord all the more difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>I am happy to record that in recent times the American Administration have acknowledged that there is potential in the peace accord and their commitment to allow it to develop is very much welcomed. Any other action by the United States Government would, indeed, be a source of disappointment to me and I am sure also to the Members of this House. Any other decision would be all the more regrettable when one recalls that the President of Nicaragua was one of the first signatories to the accord and also was the first to announce the members of the country's national reconciliation committee which is very much part and parcel of the structure of the accord and will play a major role in relation to achieving peace which, it is hoped, can be achieved in that region.</P>
    <P>The choice of people to serve on that committee must also be noted and regarded as satisfactory evidence of the Sandinistas' desire to restore peace in the region.  One must recall also the statement of Bishop Obando y Bravo who was appointed to the reconciliation committee, a man who was regarded as being sympathetic to the Contras but who expressed the view that the accord is the first step towards peace in the Central American region.</P>
    <P>The accord, with the deadline set for November 7, is ambitious.  If it is over ambitious it reflects only the desire on the part of the participating countries to find a solution to the conflict.  If all of the objectives are not attained, we should not be discouraged.  There seems to be an abundance of goodwill which in time will be translated into action and, it is hoped, will bring about a final solution. It is for that reason that I join with my colleagues in solidly backing the peace accord.  We are making history in this House tonight when an all-party delegation can come in here to debate a matter which is significant in relation to world peace but is also significant in <Col N="2712" /> relation to human rights and civil rights in some of the smaller nations which we always should strive to support and to back in every way we can.  I am proud and pleased to have been associated with it and with my colleagues' efforts in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for giving me time.  In return, I shall be as brief as possible, having been allowed to come in before the Minister speaks.</P>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion and also welcome the consensus which has emerged in this House.  Unfortunately, we have been getting a consensus here in recent months but it is a consensus with which I do not agree, involving three parties.  Tonight's consensus straddles all the parties in the House so in that sense it is unique and I would agree with Deputy Hyland.  I am glad to be involved in this consensus.  The motion is long overdue and it is only right that such a motion should be discussed here in the House of Parliament of our country, the Dáil.  The motion represents a civilised response of our people and of our parties here to the present Central American peace initiative, something with which we should be concerned.</P>
      <P>Considering the killings, bombings, kidnappings and disregard for life in this country, in this island in fact, some people might very well say that we should mind our own business and that we should put our own house in order first before we interfere in problems as difficult as the Central American one.  I disagree with that attitude because it is mistaken.  Not only should all Governments in our country support the present peace initiatives in Central America, but we should also advance our views in the EC and the United Nations and not be ashamed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2713" /> Five Central American countries are involved in the present peace plan.  That in itself is a remarkable event, given the different backgrounds and political structures of the five countries involved.  It should also be said that the development of the plan has come about in a most unusual and convoluted way.  No matter what genesis it had, it is to be welcomed for all that.  Of course, the peace plan, if it is to succeed, will need the goodwill and the benevolence of the American Government.  We have not heard much about this apart from Deputy Hyland's references and he is rather naive in this respect.  I do not want to sound acrimonious or divisive in this debate but the United States has shown very little goodwill and benevolence towards Nicaragua in recent years.  The Deputy must know that very well; he has visited that country.  By the American Government's support for the Contras they have done everything they could to torpedo and destroy the Nicaraguan economy and also to topple its lawful and democratically elected Government, as he has said.  He must know that very well.  By its economic policies, by its military policies and by imposing a blockade on that country it has done everything possible to bring down the economy and the Government of that country.  If he travels to Central America he will find that out.  While he has come some way for his party in this House tonight I would like to see his views being more enthusiastically endorsed by that party because you cannot have it both ways in this regard. You must stand up here and see it as it is in Central America.  You cannot play both sides.  I believe the Nicaraguan people have heroic qualities and that they have shown these qualities in recent years in standing up to the physical intimidation and economic pressure that has been applied by America.  These people have shown themselves to be a brave and resourceful people, a people, as Deputy Higgins has said, under siege and they have stood up to that siege remarkably well.</P>
    <P>What I am saying here tonight does not <Col N="2714" /> amount to propaganda.  We see on our television screens almost nightly, certainly weekly, the situation which is unfolding in Nicaragua.  Again, Deputy Higgins has remarked on the work of the journalist Jon Snow.  I have commended his work in this House previously and I do so again tonight.  We can read reports in our daily newspapers from correspondents and journalists in Nicaragua who give accurate accounts daily of the situation there.  Let me say that one journalist writing from Nicaragua, who also writes for some of the Irish newspapers which include the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> is a Limerick man, Paul O'Driscoll. While he is not a supporter of mine, he is personally known to me and I can confirm that he is a most reliable and honest newspaper man, among the last of those people in the world.  I have no reason whatsoever to doubt the veracity of the reports he has been sending back from Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Sandanista Government are fully committed to the peace plan and I am also satisfied that they dearly want peace and justice to rule in their country.  In setting up the National Reconciliation Commission in Nicaragua it is clear that the Government have been leaning over backwards to be fair and just to all sides, including their opponents.  Indeed, we in this country could learn a lot from the spirit of compromise and reconciliation shown by the Nicaraguan Government.  We could certainly benefit from a study of how they have been able to do their best to accommodate disparate views in this regard but in the final analysis, as I have said, much will depend on the success or otherwise of this plan and on the attitude of the American Government.  There is plenty of scope for America to undermine and destroy the peace initiative.  It has the power and the money to do so.</P>
    <P>That is why public opinion is important in this regard.  It is why public opinion in this country and throughout the world must come down firmly in favour of this peace plan.  That is why public opinion must be mobilised in favour of peace not <Col N="2715" /> only in Nicaragua but throughout Central America.  As both Deputy Hyland and Deputy Higgins have stated, in 1984 this Parliament sent a delegation to Nicaragua to observe the general election which was taking place in that country at that time.  As Deputy Hyland has said, a report was prepared and may be seen in the Library by anybody who wishes to see it.</P>
    <P>The report states very clearly that the election at that time was fair, open and democratic.  This cannot be denied by anybody.  In this country we talk a lot about the need to preserve democracy and about the value of democracy both here and throughout the world.  It is also important for us to demostrate the principle of democracy in practice and to speak out loudly and clearly in favour of peace, human rights and democracy in Nicaragua.  It is important for us to support the present peace initiative in Central America and, above all, it is important for us in this House to ensure that this motion is passed by all parties.</P>

      <P>In rising to support this motion I would like to say that I am very pleased that it is an all party motion and that we are engaging in what is a significant event in the history of this Dáil and of previous ones, also.  It is only on rare occasions that this House has managed to agree on matters on an all party basis, particularly in regard to international affairs.  That is not to suggest that the positions of the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Fianna Fáil Party would match in all respects.  Indeed there have been references to one item or another during the course of the contributions of Deputy Kennedy and Deputy Barry which I do not propose to follow but which clearly indicates that there are differences of opinion and emphasis in how we would see a solution being arrived at ultimately in Central America and in other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to thank all those Deputies who responded to the original proposal <Col N="2716" /> for an all-party motion which was put forward by Deputy Michael Higgins and I.  Of course, we agreed to make alterations to our original proposal in order to accommodate the sensitivities of the other people who have put their names to it.  That in no way denies the value and the excellence of the motion which is before us.  It amounts to a genuine statement of goodwill from this House which is united in support of peace, democracy and justice and an end to hunger and terror in Central America.  The House can be proud of the fact that we are about to approve a motion in the terms we have put before it today in which we are urging the international community to support the Esquipulas II peace initiative.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern throughout the world for many years about the situation in Central America.  Apart from the horrific death toll, injuries, suffering, misery and destruction caused by the conflicts, the operation of Government-backed terrorist squads in countries like El Salvador and Guatemala, and the US Administrations support for the Contras and their activities in trying to destabilise the democratically elected Government in Nicaragua have brought terror to the civilian population in the region.  The world has also been conscious that a major flare up in Central America could lead to a far more dangerous and wider world conflict.</P>
    <P>It has to be said and said clearly that the single greatest threat to peace and stability in Central America is and has been deriving from the repeated attempts by the Reagan administration in the United States to overthrow the democratically elected Government in Nicaragua. That is not just my view or the view of the left wing in this country or other parts of the world but it is also the view of Senator Edward Kennedy in the United States and of the people of that country.  In an opinion poll which was carried out in August of this year before the present peace initiative was signed by the Central American Presidents some 59 per cent of those polled said they did not support the giving of aid to the Contras. <Col N="2717" /> Clearly, there is a majority of opinion in the United States against what the Reagan administration are doing.</P>
    <P>Since the election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980 US policy has been characterised by a shameful campaign of aggression against and interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.  During President Reagan's terms of office the United States has armed and financed anti-government forces, participated in mining the ports of Nicaragua, armed and financed right wing Contra groups and encouraged them in a policy of assassinations, kidnappings and acts of terror against the civilian population.  In addition, an attempt has been made to strangle the Nicaraguan economy by trade and economic sanctions.</P>
    <P>This has continued despite protests from many countries and international organisations and despite the ruling of the international court that the US activities were contrary to international law.  It has continued despite the clear outcome of the democratic elections held in Nicaragua in 1984.  These elections, which were observed by some 400 international observers &mdash; including Members of the Oireachtas of whom Deputy Liam Hyland was one &mdash; were judged to have been fair and democratic.  Indeed, it is worth mentioning that in those elections Daniel Ortega was elected to the position of President of Nicaragua with the support of 68 per cent of his electorate &mdash; a higher proportion of the vote than President Ronald Reagan received from his American electorate.  Yet we are told by the Reagan administration that the Nicaraguan Government are undemocratic. I speak specifically about the Reagan administration, not about the American Congress or the American people.  I have already indicated that generally the American people are opposed to the policies of the Reagan administration in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>Against this background the regional initiative for peace known as Esquipulas II, signed by the leaders of the Central American states, has been greeted in Central America and throughout the world as a great opportunity to bring <Col N="2718" /> peace to the region.  The agreement has imposed obligations on all Central American countries to undertake certain initiatives and reforms and, while it is still early days, the results so far have been encouraging.  It is equally encouraging that, despite the fact that the date set for implementation of the various accords in the initiative is 7 November, there is now a clear indication that that may be extended for two months in order to make allowances for the difficulties which various countries which have signed the agreement are having and may have for the time being.</P>
    <P>It is important to read remarks made by, say, the President of Guatemala when he spoke, having signed the agreement. He said:</P>
    <P>All five governments had to make many concessions, but we put the interests of Central America collectivity above all else... We know there will be many complaints, that these accords will unleash many pressures and much discord, but we demand that our will to build peace be respected.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that he was talking about demanding of the international community that their will to build peace be respected.  The quotation is from <i>Envoi,</i> the monthly magazine of analysis on Nicaragua, volume 75.  Managua September 1987.</P>
    <P>The President of Costa Rica said:</P>
    <P>We request the respect and assistance of the international community in our efforts.  We have Central American ways towards peace and development, but we need help to make them a reality.  We ask the international community to guarantee development so that the peace we seek can be lasting. We firmly reiterate that peace and development are inseparable.</P>
    <P>The source of that quotation is the Trócaire production <i>Special Brief on a Central American Peace Plan.</i></P>
    <P>In that regard it is important that we <Col N="2719" /> urge strongly on our Government to provide development aid in greater proportion than has been the case to date to Central America and to reverse the decision made already by the present Government to reduce that aid, which decision is deplorable.  I do not wish to introduce acrimony into this debate, but I urge the Government to reconsider their decision to reduce development aid internationally, particularly to the Central American region.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the Nicaraguan Government has been positive and encouraging.  It is worth noting that since the agreement was signed in August the following initiatives have already been taken in Nicaragua.  They have implemented a unilateral ceasefire in many areas where the Contras were active.  Unfortunately, according to recent reports, the generous initiative by the Nicaraguan Government has resulted in enabling the Contras to move deeper into Nicaraguan territory causing further untold death and hardship to the people of Nicaragua.  For no other reason we should demand that the US cease their support and aid for this vicious group.</P>
    <P>The Nicaraguan Government have lifted an 18 month ban on the opposition newspaper <i>La Prensa</i> and reopened <i>Radio Catolica</i>.  On 1 September the Nicaraguan Government appointed Cardinal Obando y Bravo as President of the National Reconciliation Committee and two expelled priests were allowed back into the country.  Talks with the opposition parties were held on 5 October. Local commissions of peace and amnesty have been set up in every town in Nicaragua and 4,000 armed men have turned themselves in and accepted the amnesty. Nicaragua has permitted anti-Government demonstrations and allowed Jean Kirkpatrick, former US ambassador to the UN, to give a pro-Contra speech in Managua to several hundred anti-Sandinistas despite the fact that Nicaragua is in a life and death struggle with the Contras.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the reaction of the US Administration has, on the other hand, <Col N="2720" /> been almost entirely negative and begrudging.  At the same time many courageous politicians and groups within the US, including the US bishops, have spoken out against the Reagan military aggression against Nicaragua.  The US Government will have to learn that they cannot dictate the manner in which other countries conduct their affairs or which social system is or is not allowed to any country.  Attempts being made by the US to dictate to the Nicaraguan people what sort of governments they can elect should be no more acceptable then would attempts by the same country to dictate to the Irish people what sort of government we should elect.</P>
    <P>In passing this motion we are making an important gesture of support for the people of Central America and the leaders of the Central American states who have shown considerable courage in signing this agreement.  However, I do not think that anyone should consider this motion on its own to be sufficient.  As a small nation we have a duty and a direct interest to take a stand against outside interference in the internal affairs of small countries.  I hope that in the new climate created by the signing of this agreement the Government will look again at the recommendations contained in the report from the Irish observers at the 1984 Nicaraguan elections.  In particular I call on the Government to agree to the establisment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Nicaragua. This could be done at minimum expense on a consular or non-residental basis but would be seen as a significant gesture of support for Nicaraguan sovereignty and independence.  Indeed, it would demonstrate our independence also.</P>
    <P>The report also listed a number of practical ways in which we could be of assistance to Nicaragua, such as the provision of food aid and financial and technical assistance and the encouragement of contacts and exchanges.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that while we have an all-party motion and are very glad that the presidents of the five Central American countries have reached a peace accord and are actively pursuing its <Col N="2721" /> implementation, the mere signing of that accord has not eliminated very many human rights violations in some of those countries. &ldquo;Human rights violations&rdquo; is a term which cloaks the horrific reality of what is going on in El Salvador, Honduras and other places where parents find the bodies of their sons and daughters or children find the bodies of their brothers and sisters on rubbish tips, horribly mutilated. The very basic human right to life is not one which is recognised in some of those states.</P>
    <P>If the peace accord which has been signed by the Central American states will lead to an end to that kind of horror this Government should do everything possible to help.  While this House can pass the motion, it is in the hands of the Government to promote the accord internationally within the European Community, at the United Nations and on other international platforms.  We must try to ensure that those who have an interest in the region &mdash; other third countries, let us say &mdash; will not interfere in the process which has been initiated.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge the assistance which I and other Deputies have received from various organisations in Ireland who support freedom, justice and democracy in Central America.  I refer to organisations such as Trócaire, the Irish Nicaraguan Support Group, the El Salvador Support Group and many others. I pay tribute to the many hundreds of Irish men and women who are working in Central America in a peaceful way, trying to assist the development of those countries.  Were it not for these people, we in Ireland might be unaware of what is going on.  These committed people who have returned home have raised the consciousness of Irish people in relation to our brothers in Central America and the terrible pain they are suffering.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House and thank all the Deputies and parties who have put their names to it.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Dáil has had this opportunity to express positive support in terms of all-party backing for <Col N="2722" /> the Guatemala Agreement of 7 August. I should like to emphasise one very happy parliamentary coincidence which is of some significance and which I will certainly use to good effect, namely, that the actual agreement comes into implementation today, 90 days after the signing on 7 August.  Reference was made to a later date but 5 November is the actual date of implementation.  It is a very happy coincidence that this Parliament is debating the matter today.</P>
      <P>I intend to follow on what has already been said by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Kennedy and Deputy De Rossa, by promoting the terms of the motion with the various governments concerned.  We will inform the Central American governments and the interested Contadora governments which are not in Central America such as Mexico, as well as all the South American countries, the United States and Canada so that the whole American continent will be aware of our feeling on this matter.  The terms of this motion will be presented tomorrow to the various governments I have mentioned.  I give this undertaking to the House and we will actively promote through our embassies the point of view expressed in the House. It is a point of view about which I feel very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are highly articulate people with an ancient civilisation who have been harmed by the vagaries of history and opportunism, on the part of various states and organisations.  They have not been allowed to express themselves fully.  This area of the world is very deserving of support.  I am certain that if the whole Central American area, with its rich civilisation and cultural background is given a real chance in terms of peace and harmony and allowed to pursue its own destiny by attracting investment in a civilised way, it is capable of great growth and of promoting very real prosperity.  It is sad in 1987 that we have a situation of the kind which exists there.  There is enormous potential in terms of cultural capacity and capability, yet the area is rent by trouble, violence and tension, largely imported.  It should not happen <Col N="2723" /> and if put in order it is an area capable of very rapid growth in its own interests and in the interests of the world at large.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Dáil has had an opportunity to support the agreement of 7 August, which is to be implemented today.  The Government welcome the agreement which we regard as the most encouraging development in Central America in a long time.  There have been fragmentary influences there over a long period and this accord binds the countries concerned to some degree, which is a first and basic step.  Violence and political instability rooted in the whole area of economic development, social injustice and lack of respect for human rights have characterised the area for too many years.</P>
    <P>There can very easily be a turn around in that area towards real economic development, real social justice, and above all, a respect for human rights, a point emphasised by Deputy Barry, Deputy M. Higgins and others.  Human rights are fundamental to the economic and social development of that region because unless there is a recognition by whatever government is there &mdash; I will not digress into what kind of government there should be &mdash; whether national or federal government, of the problem of human rights and unless that problem is addressed there will never be the social and economic developments we would like to see there.  If people think human rights are irrelevant in the pursuit of power and if that idea continues to be held in that area, there will be no real progress.  I see respect for human rights as a very important aspect of the Guatemala agreement.</P>
    <P>The people in Nicaragua have made a democratic decision which should be respected.  Right across the area there is a need to respect human rights and President Arias of Costa Rica has in his country an example of an area where human rights have been acknowledged and safeguarded.  At the moment, there is no effective judicial machinery to investigate or punish allegedly politically motivated people who commit human rights violations.  Under the umbrella of <Col N="2724" /> this or that political idelogy there are blatant and flagrant violations of human rights.  That is happening in the countries I have mentioned, particularly El Salvador and Guatemala.</P>
    <P>The perception of neighbouring countries that the coming to power in Nicaragua of the Sandinista Government was a threat to their security and the intensification of insurgent activity in El Salvador and Guatemala, as well as in Nicaragua, greatly increased tensions. That perception arose from a democratic decision in Nicaragua and any threat to human rights following from that type of perception has to be repudiated and rejected.  Military interference in Central America by outside countries on both sides of the ideological divide exacerbated the situation and diminished any prospect of a peaceful solution to the complex problems of the area.</P>
    <P>The first sign of hope appeared at a meeting on the Panamanian island of Contadora in 1983 when the Presidents of four countries bordering Central America &mdash; Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela &mdash; agreed on joint proposals for a settlement which they presented to the five Central American States in the form of a draft &ldquo;Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America&rdquo;.  The proposals were well received but differences on important elements emerged in the subsequent negotiations.  Nevertheless, what came to be called the Contadora process continued with the active support of other Latin American countries, particularly Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our European partners also support the Contadora process.  It conformed with our common view that the conflicts in Central America could best be resolved in the context of a political agreement emanating from the region itself, an agreement based on the Contadora principles, such as refraining from the threat or use of force, noninterference in the internal affairs of other States, the equal rights and self-determination of peoples and, above all else, the promotion of respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2725" /> Early this year when progress in the negotiations in a Contadora context seemed to be coming to a halt, President Arias of Costa Rica put forward proposals designed to reflate the process and to restore momentum to the peace process. These proposals were fully supported by the European Community, and in particular by the process of European Political Co-operation, a process which has come in for a lot of criticism lately.  I was at a number of Political Co-operation meetings of Foreign Ministers where President Arias was welcomed by the President of the Council.  His proposals were examined in depth and full backing and advice were given to him.  The European Community has given President Arias practical help and I am aware he appreciates it.  The drive he made to rehabilitate the Contadora process received total support from the Community within the framework of European Political Co-Operation.  I mention that because some times European Political Co-operation comes in for criticism here.  I want to emphasise that fact that on this occasion there was unanimity among the Twelve.  This success is furthering these proposals has resulted in the diplomatic and moral support of the Community for the Arias initiative.</P>
    <P>President Arias's proposals, modified in some respects in response to the wishes of other Central American States, constitute the agreement entitled &ldquo;Procedure for the Establishment of a Strong and Lasting Peace in Central America&rdquo; which was signed in Guatemala in August by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The accord is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Esquipulas II&rdquo; to differentiate it from a declaration of 25 May 1986.  The Guatemala Agreement to which we are giving support is based on the principles of the draft Contadora Act.  President Arias wanted to give impetus to that Act. A provision of the agreement is the creation of mechanisms for dialogue with unarmed internal political opposition groups.  That is important in the area. There must be some mechanism for dialogue <Col N="2726" /> with them because they exist. Other provisions are for amnesties and ceasefires; a commitment to promote authentic democratisation &mdash; that is important &mdash; free elections, including elections to a Central American Parliament in 1988.  I regard the latter as an important commitment to a regional dimension which should be successful. Other provisions are the cessation of aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements and the prevention of the use of one state's territory to destablilise the government of another.  That is fundamental in regard to Nicaragua.  Other provisions concern attending to the needs of refugees and displaced persons; seeking economic support from the international community &mdash; that has been given by the EC &mdash; setting up national reconciliation commissions and an international verification and follow-up commission and the continuation of negotiations on points in the draft Contadora Act which remain to be agreed.</P>
    <P>The agreement does not require that ceasefires be negotiated.  The commitments pertaining to amnesty, ceasefires, democratisation, cessation of assistance to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements and non-use of territory to destabilise other Governments were to enter into force simultaneously in 90 days from 7 August; that is today. That is one reason why it is appropriate that we are debating this motion.  The Government very much welcome this agreement which has greatly enhanced the prospects of reconciliation nationally and within the region.  It should make for an impetus towards peace and the strengthening of democracy in the region.  It has raised hopes of urgently needed improvement in the area of human rights which are fundamental to the whole matter.  I agree with Deputy Barry that that is basic to the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a need to regenerate a feeling for human rights because if that does not happen there will be an escalation of violence.  Social justice is an aspect of human rights which must be acknowledged <Col N="2727" /> across the board wherever a sensible democratic system is adopted. President Arias deserves commendation for his work.  He has already recieved recognition for that by being awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.  The other Central American Governments have helped to get this very significant agreement through.  Steps have been taken to implement it.  We are all keenly aware of the extent of the difficulties that remain to be overcome.  It is a question of getting all Governments in the area and the involved Governments in North and South America mobilised in an effort to facilitate this peace process.  We will continue to express our support for the agreement and seek to promote it by forwarding this resolution to all relevant countries.  I will send the Irish Ambassador's on the American continent to express our support for it and, above all else, our support for the implementation of its conditions.  I have expressed the Irish Government's support for the agreement at the UN and it is important that the terms of our resolution are brought to the notice of all the government's concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that this is not a problem that is easy of resolution but given the support that is forthcoming for the Contadora process by reason of the Arias initiative from the European Community, and very substantial sectors of public and political opinion in the United States, I am certain that the process can succeed.  Anything that we say, or statements in the US or the Eastern World, should be positive and supportive rather than negative.  We should not be concerned with apportioning blame. There has been too much of that over the years.  What is needed is a positive and supportive attitude to the agreement with the minimum of outside interference, if any at all.  We support that positive aspect of the agreement.</P>
    <P>A basic principle in the agreement is the cessation of outside aid to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements and the prevention of the use of territory to destabilise other Governments.  That is <Col N="2728" /> fundamental.  There is a Government in place and so be it.  There must be an approach that works within the framework of existing states, seeking to bring them together and they must set on foot a political process in which they will cooperate in a positive and sensible way observing human rights as a basic factor in any such process.</P>
    <P>It is heartening that on 7 October the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution expressing its firmest support for the agreement and that the US too has welcomed it.  It is important that the international community by endorsing the Guatemala agreement encourages and supports the continuing efforts of the Central Americans to resolve their problems peacefully.  The Government will continue to use every opportunity to further that endeavour.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank everyone who contributed to the debate.  It showed that an Irish Parliament is concerned in seeing that the right thing is done to people who are, in culture, civilisation and background, basically Europeans who are seeking to establish themselves.  Our support for them is very important and significant. I have always been struck, on meeting Central and South Americans &mdash; and previous occupiers of my office have also been struck by this &mdash; by the high regard in which we are held by reason of the contribution of Irishmen in these countries towards the achievement of independence.  The very high regard in which we are held is unfathomable and is not fully recognised here.  I will not go through the litany of names involved but it is appreciated, understood and is something to which we have rightly responded this afternoon.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flaherty has been given permission to raise the question of the statistics on child abuse presented to the women's rights <Col N="2729" /> organisations and also the withdrawal of moneys from voluntary organisations. The Deputy does not have permission to speak about matters dealing with legislation that does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that I would not be given such permission.  It is an important area.  The reason I raised this question is the recent publication by the Minister of the statistics of child abuse in 1986.</P>
      <P>These statistics indicate that there has been what was described in newspaper coverage as a shocking and alarming increase in the level of child abuse, especially in the Eastern Health Board area.  However, throughout the country as a whole there has been a significant increase in the incidence of child abuse in general which has gone up by two thirds in one year.  In the area of sexually abused children, the increase has been even more significant.  It was in that context I asked for the opportunity to debate this on the Adjournment because I am seriously concerned that current departmental policy is totally failing to tackle this problem on two fronts.  I am not allowed to refer to the fact that the Minister has failed to produce his redraft of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be a basis on which you would get permission to raise that matter on the Adjournment but a reference thereto will not be regarded as terribly out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we resumed after the summer recess &mdash; and prior to it &mdash; I have been asking the Minister to indicate when legislation would be before the House.  It is important and very relevant in the context of the statistics because they indicate that a relatively small number of cases give rise to proceedings under the Children's Act.  I am perfectly aware that that may not necessarily be the most advantageous and sensitive way to deal with this very difficult area of coping with families, vulnerable children and families who have many other problems. <Col N="2730" /> However, there has been concern that the powers to intervene are inadequate and the promised Bill is intended to redress this.  The Minister withdrew the Bill in February-March when it was on Committee Stage in the House. Therefore, there was an obligation on him to move quickly and I hope he will respond in the very near future to have this legislation brought before the House so that, at least on the legislative side, every support is given to the agencies, health boards and other forces of the State and concerned persons to protect the increasing number of children who have been confirmed as being at risk in the published statistics.</P>
      <P>The second area of concern is the level of cutback in funds to voluntary bodies engaged in this area.  There has been a total abolition of the funds which were available to the Minister of State for Women's Affairs.  The sum involved, £52,000, was spread around the country in small amounts but was given to many organisations who carry out preventive work and counselling for children who have been abused.  It also prevented families from deteriorating into this situation.  I appreciate that the groups to which I referred are not directly the responsibility of the Minister but, taken in conjunction with funds for the social services, it is relevant to mention it.  It is also relevant to mention that the health boards, the other major source of funding for these organisations, have also been under extreme pressure and have cut back on funds to these agencies.  They have also been forced to spend more and more of their precious time raising money rather than engaging in the work for which they were trained.  I refer to the Limerick Rape Crisis Centre, the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children and Gingerbread, who work with a particularly vulnerable group, unmarried mothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very tragic incident in my constituency recently which resulted in the death of a child.  Gingerbread have been anxious to set up a service in this area and in many other suburbs where the problem is increasing.  However, they <Col N="2731" /> are not getting the support to do so by State bodies.  It is regrettable that at a time when the demands on these organisations are greater, as the published statistics show, they are hampered by inadequate legislation and by lack of funding.  Other organisations losing funds are the Waterford Rape Crisis Centre, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and a number of groups who offered women alternative development opportunities outside the home which might have made them better able to cope and which would perhaps have reduced, perhaps not directly the figures for abuse, but the figures of children coming into care for neglect.  These relatively small amounts of money should not have been withdrawn, it is a very shortsighted policy. The specific figures do not relate to the Minister's Department but a similar picture would emerge from an examination of the funding to these and other organisations involved in either counselling, in family resource centres or in preventive work in the community with groups at risk.  They are all being further and further cut back and have been forced to spend time, which should be spent in providing direct services, in raising money.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to both these elements as they go hand in hand.  Legislation is needed and I hope that the Minister will urgently review his Department's response to this sensitive and worrying development.</P>

      <P>As you allowed Deputy Flaherty to mention the new Children Bill I should like to tell her that the Minister indicated to the Dáil last week that the Government had approved the heads of the Bill.  It is now with the parliamentary draftsman and it is the Government's intention to publish the Bill in the current Dáil session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty is critical of the funding for the Council for the Status of Women.  This is not my area of responsibility. I have been informed by the <Col N="2732" /> Department dealing with that section that the position in relation to Government financing is that the amount allocated was £88,000 in 1986 when Senator Fennell of the Deputy's party was Minister of State for Womens' Affairs.  It was £88,000 in 1987 and is £90,000 in the Estimates for Public Services for 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no reduction in that grant despite the fact that economic realities constrain the Government to reduce public expenditure wherever possible and that there have, of necessity, been substantial reductions in expenditure in other area. The position for 1988 must be set in the context of the overall reductions of £485 million that have had to be made in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position as regards 1987 is interesting. By the time this Government assumed office on 10 March 1987 the expenditure already incurred by Senator Fennell as Minister of State under the <Col N="2733" /> appropriate subhead amounted to just under £28,000.  If spending had continued for the remainder of 1987 at the same rate as in this brief period of months approximately £150,000 would have gone on promotion and on information to support development activities and grants other than to the Council for the Status of Women.  This would have led to a very small amount being available to the council had the Minister of State been returned to office.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Flaherty feels so strongly that the council is underfunded, it is only reasonable to ask why the council did not get a larger share of the total provision in the appropriate subhead for each of the years in which her party colleague, Senator Fennell, was Minister of State for Women's Affairs and had considerable discretionary control of the money in the subhead for her office.  For example, the position for 1986 is that Senator Fennell as Minister of State for Women's Affairs decided that the council should have £88,000 of the total provision of £189,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was to decide on the allocation of the remaining of the £101,000 to support development projects and activities she chose to assist.</P>
      <P>On any objective criteria some of the causes and activities she chose to assist deserved support if the means were available but what I cannot understand is that if she felt that the council with a grant level of £88,000 was seriously underfunded why did she not raise the grant significantly, indeed double it, when it was in her power to do so.</P>
      <P>On the question of grants to organisations, other than the council, active in the area of women's affairs, the position is that such organisations will no longer be in receipt of public funds through the Department of the Taoiseach.  I would like to make it quite clear, however, that those organisations carrying out particularly important work will still be eligible to apply for assistance to the health boards, to the Department of Social Welfare under their grants to voluntary bodies scheme, and to the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>I accept that the council and a number of its member organisations could use additional funds productively.  The fact is that the Government simply do not have the option of generally increasing the levels of funding available to interest groups, however important their aims and however worthwhile the work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards my support and the support <Col N="2736" /> of Dr. O'Hanlon, Minister for Health, for specialised services for sexually abused children and their families, I make no apologies for the initiatives we have taken in the short period since we came to office.  We are deeply conscious of the need to improve the present range of health and social services available.  As Deputy O'Hanlon, Minister for Health, has already announced he is providing the necessary additional resources to enable two special units to be established at Crumlin and Temple Street children's hospitals for the investigation of alleged cases of child sexual abuse.  The Minister has approved the appointment of eight additional Heads of Staff for each hospital for these new units.  The work to be undertaken in these two units will replace the work which is currently undertaken with children at the Rotunda Hospital Sexual Assault Treatment Unit. The new units are expected to be operational in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In July last my Department issued a revised set of detailed guidelines on child abuse which includes a special section on child sexual abuse.  In circulating the new guidelines formally to the health boards, my Department have requested the boards to review urgently their present procedures and services for dealing with reported cases of child abuse.  This review process is now underway and my Department will be discussing the outcome of the different reviews with the health boards with a view to improving present arrangements for the investigation of cases of alleged child sexual abuse and also the treatment and support services required for abused children and their families.</P>
    <P>As regards the statistics for the increase in the number of cases of child abuse reported in 1986 over 1985, I should state that these figures were made public by Deputy O'Hanlon, Minister for Health, in a detailed press statement which he issued in July last in connection with the launching of his Department's new child abuse guidelines.  These figures received much media and other comment at the time and the actions the Minister has taken to date demonstrate clearly the <Col N="2737" /> intention of the Government to treat this whole area of child abuse as one which merits special priority attention in terms of special resource allocation.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that we are deeply concerned about this area.  The increases were published by <Col N="2738" /> our Government to indicate publicly our concern in this area.  We are monitoring the situation regularly because of the seriousness of child sex abuse.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 November 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest rates in Ireland are basically market determined.  The market is influenced to a significant extent by developments abroad as well as by domestic developments.  The scope for direct intervention in the markets by the authorities is limited.  The most effective role open to the Government is the creation of favourable conditions for lower interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, therefore, in addition to reducing public expenditure and borrowing, taken a number of initiatives designed to help reduce the differential between Irish interest rates and bond yields and corresponding rates and yields abroad, including in the UK.  These initiatives <Col N="2604" /> include a clear statement of the Government's commitment to maintaining the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS, the issue of an ECU denominated bond in the domestic market and meetings which both the Taoiseach and I have had with major financial institutions.  I have urged market participants to look beyond developments in the UK when analysing interest rate prospects.  These initiatives have had a significant degree of success in reducing shorter term rates and the retail rates of banks and building societies.  Key Irish retail and short term interbank interest rates have for some time been below corresponding rates in the UK.  Long bond yields have also come down but there is scope for them to fall further, particularly in the light of recent falls in bond yields abroad and the steps taken by the Government to achieve another significant reduction in borrowing next year.</P>
    <P>The Government is currently reviewing exchange controls with a view to seeing what relaxations in the existing system may be possible.  We do not wish to jeopardise the improvements which have taken place in domestic money markets and interest rates by relaxations which could lead to substantial capital outflows.  Therefore, progress in relaxing the controls is likely to be on a phased basis.  We would hope, however, to be able to introduce some limited relaxations in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to publish a Green Paper or a White Paper on the matter.</P>

I would refer the Deputies to paragraphs 9 to 15 of section III of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which set out the commitments of the programme in relation to tax evasion, tax collection and enforcement.  In general as stated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government are fully committed to improving collection and enforcement, stamping out arrears and ensuring prompt payment of tax liabilities as they arise.  In the effort to meet these objectives the Government have indicated that whatever changes are considered necessary, whether administrative or legislative, will be made.</P>
      <P>While there are no plans to reconstitute the Revenue Commissioners the Government will ensure that they operate in a cost effective and efficient manner in pursuit of the objectives in relation to tax collection set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>The Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, empowers the Minister for Finance to distribute moneys standing in the dormant funds of suitors.  The uses to which these moneys can be put are laid down by section 3 (2) of the Act as follows: (a) not more than £600,000 for projects in the areas of culture and the arts.  Decisions on particular projects to be assisted are taken by the Taoiseach; (b) not more than £600,000 on renovation of the Kings Inns; (c) not more than £300,000 towards the cost of Culturlann na hÉireann at Monkstown, the property of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann; (d) not more than £100,000 towards the cost of the community, youth, recreational and employment programme administered by the Minister for Labour; (e) the balance of the cash standing in dormant funds of suitors to go towards the cost of a children's court in Dublin, the provision and maintenance of other court premises and the provision of civil legal aid.  Decisions on the detailed distribution of moneys under this head are taken by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Up to 21 October 1987 a total of £2,955,000 has been distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The balance of the moneys available under the Act are held in Exchequer Bills which have a maturity value of £713,712.</P>
      <P>The following is a tabular statement of the distribution of moneys to date in accordance with section 3 (2) of the Act.</P>

    <P>² This figure is a tentative estimate of the residue remaining after the other commitments have been met.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice under the Act to determine its actual distribution. The actual residue will depend on total final expenditure on individual projects, the rate of drawdown of that expenditure and prevailing rates of interest.</P>

      <P>My Department is one of a number of Government Departments which have received representations from the Irish National Bookmakers Association in regard to what the association describes as tax free trading.</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;tax free&rdquo; is intended to apply to the practice whereby certain bookmakers, both Irish and English, offer not to load the punter's stake with an amount, equivalent to the 10 per cent excise duty, normally collected thereon in bookmaking premises to compensate them for their own betting duty liability. Instead, in accordance with this practice, they draw on resources such as punters' winnings to offset their liability for betting duty.  The bets are not, in fact, &ldquo;tax free&rdquo; as the bookmaker remains legally responsible for paying the excise duty on such bets, and therefore the question of introducing regulations to ensure collection of the tax does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The certificates issued to disabled persons by local licensing authorities relate only to relief from road-tax, as provided by section 43 (1) of the Finance Act, 1968. Applications for repayment of excise <Col N="2613" /> duty and VAT are dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners under independent criteria.  The production of a road-tax exemption certificate is only one requirement in this regard.  Because of the substantial amounts of revenue involved in such repayments, the commissioners must ensure as far as possible that repayments are not made to persons who are not entitled to them.  I am advised by the commissioners that they are satisfied that in the small minority of cases where an individual application had been refused, that particular applicant was not entitled to repayment.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that relief provisions benefiting disabled drivers, should be rationalised as far as possible to cut down on administration and produce a better service for the disabled.  Tax repayments of the kind currently operated by the Revenue Commisioners are not the most effective way of providing such reliefs. On my initiative discussions are taking place with the Department of Health with a view to establishing under the aegis of the Minister for Health a comprehensive restructured scheme of assistance for disabled drivers.</P>

      <P>(a) Until the recent Government decision, the scheme of voluntary redundancy-early retirement was only applied in areas where identified redundancy or overstaffing existed or was reasonably expected to arise and could not be fully met by redeployment.  No such areas have been identified in this Department.  As a result of the Government decision, however, to extend the <Col N="2614" /> scheme to serving officers over 50 years of age, officers in the Department who fall into that category will now have to be offered the scheme.</P>
      <P>The position in the offices under my aegis is that 346 officers have applied for early retirement.  To date 34 officers have been accepted for the scheme.</P>
      <P>(b) Since 1 August 1987 six officers in my Department have applied and been accepted for redeployment.</P>

      <P>The numbers of staff serving in the former Department of the Public Service and in my Department at 30 September 1986 and the number serving in the amalgamated Department of Finance at 30 September 1987 are set out in a tabular statement which I will be giving to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will see from the tabular statement that there has been a reduction in numbers serving between 30 September 1986 and 30 September 1987 of 55.  Most of this reduction is attributable to redeployments of staff to the revenue task force and to the Jobsearch programme in the Department of Social Welfare.  A further small number of redeployments to other Departments is being investigated at present and it is hoped that they can be effected before the end of year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the claim for repayment of £4,522.45 on foot of value-added tax relates to the taxable period July-August 1987.  A cheque in the sum of £984.89 issued to the taxpayer on 8 October 1987 but the balance of £3,537.56 has been withheld pending payment by the taxpayer of arrears of PAYE-PRSI for the tax years 1984-85, 1985-86 and 1986-87 and of the interest and enforcement costs arising in connection with those arrears. The promise referred to by the Deputy was given inadvertently by a junior official in response to a telephone inquiry before a proper evaluation of the underlying collection position could be made.</P>

      <P>The full amount of the stock in question, namely £77.4 million approximately or 100 million ECU, was taken up by Allied Irish Banks.  Consequently, this bank was in effect the sole underwriter of the issue.</P>
      <P>A fee of three-quarters of one per cent of the nominal amount of the issue was paid for underwriting, management and selling the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that the Government stockbroker was not the sole broker to the issue is that, unlike other domestic Government bond issues, a market in the ECU denominated stock is being made, <Col N="2620" /> not by the authorities, but by Allied Irish Banks.  It was accordingly considered appropriate that Allied Irish Securities, a stockbroking subsidiary of the AIB group, should be joint broker to the issue, along with the Government broker, Butler and Briscoe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the comprehensive EC Commission proposals for the reform of the structural funds pursuant to Article 130D of the Single European Act are currently under negotiation in the Council of Ministers. There are many elements in these proposals but of particular interest in the context of the Deputy's questions is the intention that structural fund assistance for the less-developed regions of the Community will be predominantly in the form of &ldquo;operational programmes&rdquo;. Although negotiations on the details of the Commission's proposals are still in the early stages, it appears likely that the Council will endorse this feature of the proposals.</P>
      <P>By deciding, as recently announced by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, to move towards a programme basis for applications for assistance from the Community's structural funds, the Government have acted quickly to ensure that Ireland will avail to the maximum possible extent of the Community funding available under the proposed new methods of procedure.  As a first step, it is intended to prepare a number of programmes, including one for Dublin city and county.  Experience with these programmes will also provide us with an opportunity to establish the requirements for the contents of future programmes and how best to draw them up and implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to what the Deputy appears to imply in one of his questions, the Commission's proposals do not entail any change in the separate existence of each of the three funds.  Moreover, they leave <Col N="2623" /> open the question whether the programmes envisaged should be integrated programmes, involving more than one fund and/or more than one other financial instrument, or separate programmes under the individual funds.</P>
    <P>The Commission have always favoured direct contact with the regions and local authorities and I believe that such contacts are very valuable as a means of increasing the Commission's awareness of the needs and potential of the regions. At the stage of making applications for assistance from the funds, the existing fund regulations require that such applications be formally submitted by the relevant member state, and I understand that this requirement is likely to be maintained under the proposed new procedures. However, in order to ensure the fullest possible involvement of regional or local authorities throughout the Community in the planning and implementation of programmes, the Commission's proposals advocate the concept of &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; between those authorities, the national authorities and the Commission. In Ireland's case, it is envisaged that, through this partnership, local authorities will play their full part in the programmes which will be developed.</P>

In 1988, I expect such sales to realise over £12 million by way of Exchequer extra receipts.  In addition, the capital allocations to certain State agencies for 1988 were reduced by a total of £5½ million to take account of expected receipts from property sales.  My Department is already monitoring the disposal of State property with a view to ensuring the best return to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 to 79, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary redundancy terms applicable to public servants provide for four distinct types of lump sum payment viz, (a) retirement lump sums; (b) short-service gratuities; (c) entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts; (d) additional severance gratuities.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that payments under (a), (b) and (c) above will be exempt from tax.  Payments under (d) will be liable to tax, subject to the exemptions and reliefs provided for in section 115 and Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  In effect, this means that tax will not be charged in respect of additional severance gratuities if the amount involved is less than £6,000.  In the cases of payments in excess of £6,000, the amount of tax payable will vary, depending on individual circumstances. Full details of the relevant tax rules are contained in Revenue Commissioners leaflet No. 14, copies of which will be furnished to Deputies Boland and De Rossa.  The arrangements referred to <Col N="2630" /> above will apply to all categories of public servants who avail of the voluntary redundancy terms.

    <P>* These estimates are very tentative and are subject to a wide margin of error.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Notes on Table</P>
    <P>Married, single and widowed allowances</P>
    <P>The figures show the aggregate cost of (a) the allowances granted to individuals effectively liable to tax and (b) the allowances which would have been accorded to individuals if the exemption limits did not apply to them.</P>
    <P>Working Wife allowance</P>
    <P>This allowance was discontinued with effect from 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>Loan interest relief</P>
    <P>The breakdown of loan interest relief between mortgage and other interest is a tentative estimate. No breakdown is available prior to 1979-80.  From 6 April 1985 tax relief for interest on personal borrowings is available only in the case of loans for the purchase, repair or improvement of a borrower's sole or main residence.</P>
    <P>Child allowance</P>
    <P>Includes the cost of the additional allowance for an incapacitated child.  The drop in the cost of the child allowance for the year 1982-83 was caused by the reduction in the standard child allowance from £195 for 1981-82 to £100 for the years 1982-83 to 1985-86 inclusive.  The standard child allowance was abolished for 1986-87 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Capital allowances</P>
    <P>The cost included for corporation tax is by reference to accounting periods ending in the year to 5 April immediately preceding each of the years in question (e.g. year ended 5 April 1977 relates to the column headed 1977-78).</P>
    <P>Export sales relief and `Shannon' relief</P>
    <P>The figures for each year include the tax relief relevant to accounting periods which ended in that year and to earlier accounting periods in so far as such relief was allowed in that year.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing profits</P>
    <P>These figures represent the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at normal rates.</P>
    <P>Stock relief</P>
    <P>Stock relief was not renewed in 1986 for any sector other than farming.</P>
    <P>`Section 84' loans</P>
    <P>These figures include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.</P>

The claimant then indicated that he wished to claim disablement benefit in respect of occupational asthma.</P>
      <P>To qualify for disablement benefit for occupational asthma the claimant is required to be in employment involving contact with prescribed substances.  The claimant was requested on 10 February 1987 to indicate details of his employment and also the substances involved which he maintains caused the attack of the disease.  A similar inquiry was made from his employers.  The position was not clear however in the light of the replies received and the case was referred to the social welfare officer on 1 May 1987 for further investigations.  His investigations revealed that the employment also involved additional substances possibly relating to the disablement and the claimant was requested to furnish a specialist report.  It is expected that a decision will be made on the claim on receipt of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from Tallagh Community Council.  The Eastern Health Board have informed me that all the health services which they normally provided from Millbrook Lawn Health Centre continue to be provided there and that they have no intention of reducing their services.  Some short interruptions of service occur where vacancies arise and replacements cannot be provided immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the points <Col N="2658" /> raised in the representations in relation to specific services is as follows:</P>
    <P>Dentistry: Three dentists are employed full time at this health centre.</P>
    <P>Speech Therapy: There are two speech therapists attached to the health centre. One officer left the service in July, one half time speech therapist was employed in the vacancy since early October and the employment of another officer on a half time basis is in train.</P>
    <P>Special Services: The number of weekly developmental clinics at this health centre has been reduced from four to three for the present because there is a vacancy in the post of area medical officer.  However, the waiting list for examinations is shorter at present than is normally the case.  The number of BCG clinics has been reduced from a weekly to a forthnightly clinic which the board consider adequate to meet the demand in the area.</P>
    <P>Maternity Services: The position was that the board had provided, on request, accommodation in which St. James's Hospital and the Coombe Hospital through their own resources, provided ante-natal services for expectant mothers who had booked with their hospitals and who lived in the Tallaght area.  The maternity services provided by St. James's Hospital have now transferred to the Coombe Hospital.  The Coombe Hospital has withdrawn its ante-natal clinics at the health centre as part of the measures which this hospital introduced to live within its financial allocation. However, I am concerned with this development and I am investigating ways and means by which an anti-natal service can be provided at the health centre.</P>
    <P>I am making arrangements to meet a deputation from Tallaght Community Council.</P>

However, to date no officer in my Department has availed of the scheme. My Department is at present considering the matter in the context of its overall staffing requirements; (b) No members of staff have applied for redeployment; (c) Two staff members have applied for career breaks since 1 August 1987.  These two applications have been approved along with two other applications which had been made in July 1987.</P>
