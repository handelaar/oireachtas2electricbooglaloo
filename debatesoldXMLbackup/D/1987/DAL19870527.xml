      <P>asked the Taoiseach the plans and proposals, if any, he has to assist the entertainments industry in Ireland as promised during the election campaign; the proposals, if any, he has to establish a body to draw up an overall plan for the development of this industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that the entertainment industry in Ireland is an example of an indigenous industry which out of its own natural abilities and enterprise has developed and expanded remarkably.  It is for this reason that we identified in our election programme the need for a comprehensive policy for the industry to help its further growth and expansion. <Col N="2842" /> Representatives of the industry have put certain proposals to me and those proposals are at present being examined and I expect to have a report on this examination fairly soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Irish Film Board put a proposition in regard to the extension of the small businesses plan to the Taoiseach's Department and that they were supported by the Taoiseach's predecessor? Has this been incorporated in the present Finance Bill, and if not, will the Taoiseach take steps to have it incorporated by way of amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement indicating when he had meetings with the social partners since taking office; the topics discussed at each such meeting; and when he next plans to meet with any of the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office I, together with the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Food, Industry and Commerce, Energy and Communications, the Environment and Labour and the Minister of State for Food, as appropriate, have met representatives of ICTU on 15 and 29 April, of the Construction Industry Federation on 30 April, of the IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme on 7 May and of the FUE and CII on 14 May.</P>
      <P>At these meetings we considered the consultative arrangements that should be established to enable the social partners to bring forward and discuss with Government their contributions to an integrated national programme for growth and economic recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The topics discussed at the meetings ranged over the problems of the economy especially employment, tax reform, social services and incomes but also of <Col N="2843" /> the particular sectors especially industry, agriculture and construction.</P>
    <P>A number of joint working parties are being established at official level with the social partners to prepare proposals for the programme for growth and economic recovery.  These will be meeting over the coming weeks and reporting back to further meetings which my Government colleagues and I will have with representatives of the social partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the discussions with ICTU, were the questions of employment, pay and Government expenditure discussed and was it conveyed to them that present figures available on Government expenditure are likely to be altered as a result of the Taoiseach's circular letter to Ministers calling for further cuts in Government expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be answering a question about the specific discussions with ICTU later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention to have discussions with organisations representative of young people and by doing so to continue the process set in motion by his predecessor to afford consultative status to representatives of our young people on the same basis as the other social partners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will be happy to continue the process which I started to award representatives of young people consultative status, and discussions will be held from time to time with representatives of young people.  I am not sure that the process of discussions with which we are now dealing in this question would necessarily involve representatives of young people, though if that would appear to be advantageous I will certainly see to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that in areas like employment the voice of young people is a very relevant voice to listen to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2844" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but at this preliminary stage I take the view that the whole employment area and young people's interests should be dealt with through ICTU but if it were wished by young people to make a separate submission, that can be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his discussions with ICTU does the Taoiseach have on the table the question of low pay and minimum wages in the public and private sectors?  Is the question of wage increases on the table, particularly in the context of national arrangements to deal with increases in wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when he proposes to hold talks with the leaders of other political parties to discuss the full constitutional implications of the recent Supreme Court judgment on the Single European Act for other international treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Departments concerned are examining, with the Attorney General, the complex issues raised in the Deputy's question.  When the examination has been completed, I will be in touch with the leaders of the other political parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, in the course of the debate on the Single European Act, the Tánaiste informed the House that there was an urgent examination in particular of the constitutional implications of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and that it was anticipated that because of its importance that <Col N="2845" /> examination would be concluded fairly quickly?  Has it now been concluded and, if so, what is the result of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination is urgently under way.  It has not yet been concluded.  In relation to all of the issues which arise out of the Supreme Court judgment on the Single European Act all the fall-out implications are being included in that examination and, as I undertook to the House, when that examination has been concluded I will be glad to talk to the political parties in the House about what course of action might recommend itself to us arising out of that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are all the treaties being examined simultaneously or is priority being given to some of the more obviously urgent ones like the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole situation is being examined in its entirety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say, but I will let the Deputy and the leaders of the other parties know when it has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it appears possible that a further referendum is necessary does the Taoiseach anticipate holding that before the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pre-empt any decision of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not recall that during the debate on the referendum Bill he indicated that these discussions and considerations would take place during the summer, immediately after the referendum?  In the light of the debate we had in this House on the referendum Bill and of the public debate that has taken place since, and which, I am glad to say, with a major input from my party has concluded successfully, <Col N="2846" /> would the Taoiseach not agree that it is urgent that this matter be dealt with immediately?  As all of the questions that arise have been clarified and put before the public, is it not now up to us in this House to take the necessary steps in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a statement which I will be issuing this afternoon on the outcome of the referendum I will be acknowledging gladly the contributions which particular political parties in this House made to the successful outcome of the referendum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not worry about that.  The referendum we have had and the effort it caused to all the political parties in this House was made necessary by the mishandling of the Single European Act, in particular by Deputy Peter Barry as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to all the Deputies who are offering that there is absolutely no need for anybody to become excited about this matter.  I gave an undertaking to the House that these matters would be urgently examined and that when that examination was completed I would be in touch with the leaders of the political parties.  I think that is a very constructive way for the Government to approach this issue.  It is in sharp contradiction to precedents set on previous occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's consideration of the necessity of having a foreign affairs committee composed of both Houses of the Oireachtas with terms of reference concluded?  Will he indicate to the House whether he agrees in principle with the establishment of such a committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2847" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not come to any final decision about the desirability or need for the establishment of such committee. I propose as a first step to re-establish the committee who are responsible for examining the secondary legislation of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that the terms of reference of the Oireachtas joint committee to which he refers preclude them specifically from dealing with most of the matters which were discussed under Title III?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware but there is a statutory obligation on us to re-establish that committee and I propose to proceed as regards that obligation first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the fundamental issue in the referendum had to do with the relationship between the competence and extent of the Government's powers, in other words the extent of the powers of the Executive as against the extent of the powers of the Judiciary?  Does he agree also that neither he not any other member of his party or anybody else outside this House envisaged that question towards the end of last year?  Would he not agree that the issue is clear enough now in the light of the debate we have had to enable us to proceed quickly to clarify the matter and to propose the required constitutional amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will proceed as quickly as possible, but surely the Deputy must be acutely aware that these are very complex issues and that it was failure to go into them thoroughly on the last occasion that brought us to the stage where we had to have a referendum.  I do not intend to rush into anything until it has been fully and carefully examined in detail by all the authorities available to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the further judgment which may be expected from the Supreme Court on the question of the constitutionality of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and of the fairly widespread political awareness that the Taoiseach favoured in the recent referendum, a broader based amendment which was rejected by other members of the Cabinet, will he now regard it as imperative that, rather than be forced by another Supreme Court judgment one way or the other, he should have those discussions with the party leaders and that they should be held, with all due respect, in an atmosphere of less retrospective recrimination about the previous Government's performance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to pay tribute to the Deputy whose role in the recent referendum campaign was entirely honourable, responsible and mature.  What I am offering to the House here is fairly unprecedented in its generosity.  I am prepared as Head of the Government to enter into constructive and meaningful discussions with the leaders of the other political parties to see whether we can come to a consensus on what needs to be done.  As regards the opening sentence in Deputy Desmond's supplementary question, it is not very <Col N="2849" /> wise to say what we can or cannot expect from the Supreme Court on any issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied about the constitutionality of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Bill which has been placed on the Order Paper since the Single European Act judgment?  Some doubt was raised about that during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that the Government will not bring forward legislation of that nature unless we are reasonably satisfied as to its constitutionality. Perhaps what is in the Deputy's mind is that it is not too easy these days to predict what will or will not be found to be constitutional.</P>

      <P>There is an urgent need to provide alternative accommodation for Seanad Éireann in view of the major structural defects in the fabric of the premises until very recently used as the Seanad Chamber.

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the area of the National Museum being sought by the Office of Public Works is the Rotunda on the Leinster House side which is of great importance to the museum for the 300,000 or so visitors they have annually?  Furthermore, is he aware that the museum authorities organise school group outings there?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Government-ICTU discussions on 15 and 29 April, it was agreed that policy on pay and other incomes would be one of the issues to be discussed in the talks being initiated with a view to preparing a national programme for growth and economic recovery.  On the Government side, we stated that the principles we would be putting forward in the discussions were that &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;an income strategy will be necessary to ensure that the average rate of cost increases in Ireland will not exceed the weighted average of cost increases in our main trading partners and that since pay accounts for one-third of current Exchequer expenditure, public service <Col N="2853" /> pay must be restrained over the period of the programme in order to contribute to reduction of the national debt-GNP ratio.&rdquo;  ICTU will be putting forward their preliminary views on pay and incomes policy at the next Government-ICTU meeting.  The question of an agreement on this or any other issue has not yet arisen at this very early stage of these discussions.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that the proposed programme is a comprehensive one covering macro-economic policies, employment and development measures, taxation reform and social policies.  As I stated earlier in my reply to Question No. 3, joint working parties are being established to prepare comprehensive proposals which will be submitted periodically to the Ministerial-ICTU group for consideration.  Similar arrangements are being made involving the other social partners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated on a visit to Connemara in recent days, while we would be anxious to see an Irish language television service for the Gaeltachtaí as soon as possible, this matter will have to be considered in the context of all the other priority demands which are seeking Exchequer funding.  In addition account must be taken of the fact that this matter, together with other issues relating to Irish language programming on the television services, has been under examination by a working group established by the former Minister for the Gaeltacht in conjunction with my predecessor.  I understand that the work of that group has just been completed and that they will be submitting their report to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and myself very shortly. I expect that there will be important recommendations in that report relating to the whole question of a separate Irish language television service or a separate service for the Gaeltachtaí and in these <Col N="2858" /> circumstances I believe it would be preferable to take account of these recommendations before any definitive decisions are taken in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it was envisaged when RTE 2 was established that a significant percentage of the time available to that channel would be devoted to the Irish language?  Even though that station has now been established for a number of years very little time is given to Irish and there are very few programmes in Irish. Would the Minister instruct RTE to devote more time at least on RTE 2 to Irish language programmes to facilitate Irish language speakers particularly those in Gaeltacht areas.  In Wales there is a full channel in Welsh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass on the Deputy's views to RTE in relation to the allocation of time on RTE 2.  Regarding Wales it might be interesting to note that the Welsh language station transmits about 22 hours of Welsh language programmes per week.  It cost £32 million to run in 1985-86.  That will give some idea of the size and scale of the problem.  The Deputy can be assured that I, like other members in the House, want to see more programmes and better quality ones, in the native tongue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to bring legislative proposals to provide a legal framework for the licensing and regulation of local and community radio before the Oireachtas in <Col N="2861" /> the autumn session.  In formulating my proposals I will be considering especially the question of the role for RTE in any new regime.</P>
    <P>As regards Cork Local Radio, my predecessor took the view that it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on the extension of broadcasting hours in Cork until the future format of local radio became clearer and I concur with that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the urgency which his colleague, Deputy Leyden, demonstrated on many occasions in this House about the regularisation of local radio, what action does the Minister intend to take against existing illegal stations? He has said that the legislation will not be brought before the House in this session.  Will things carry on as at present?  Has the Minister a view on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister whether his approach to this legislation is a minimalist one of licensing and control or does he envisage that there would also be controls about the content of radio and the balance of programmes provided?  Does he envisage any subsidisation of stations under this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last part of the question first, there will be absolutely no subsidisation under this legislation.  As far as my approach to the Bill is concerned, the Deputy will just have to await the proposals which I will bring to the Government.  It is not usual to anticipate the legislation in this format in the House. I will bring the legislation to the Government and the Deputy will then be able to see the range of it, minimalist or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he will make a statement on the company or companies which are licensed to provide cable television service to Tallaght, Dublin 24, and Clondalkin, Dublin 22; the manner of the operation of the service; the degree of satisfaction therewith; and his degree of control of rental charges in any such licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Cablelink Limited are the company licensed to provide service to both Tallaght, Dublin 24, and Clondalkin, Dublin 22.  My statutory powers in relation to the operation of cable systems are laid down in the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, S.I. No. 67 of 1974, and in general are confined to laying down technical specifications for such systems, to approving the maximum rental and connection charges and to ensuring that cable licensees do not unreasonably refuse to provide service. The technical specifications are designed to minimise degradation of signal from the reception point to the subscribers' connection point and to meet certain safety requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2864" /> Complaints about the day-to-day operations of cable television companies are primarily a matter to be dealt with under the terms of the contract between the subscriber and the cable company in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that as a monopoly situation applies to cable television companies there is a responsibility on him and on his Department to ensure that a licensee from his Department gives a reasonably fair deal to people who pay their subscriptions? May I also ask the Minister if his Department have received a substantial degree of complaint about the level of service being provided in many large estates in the two areas mentioned?  In many cases people who have paid their rentals and licence fees, for reasons outside their control, find they are not getting the service they paid for.  As the Minister has licensed a monopoly to these licensees will he not put pressure to bear on Cablelink Limited or whatever company is involved to ensure that they do the job assigned to them under their licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The cable systems are natural monopolies because the sophisticated systems can only be developed through economies of scale which arise from having a reasonably large number of subscribers.  As far as the complaints from this area are concerned, yes, there have been complaints including representations from the Deputy on behalf of resident's associations in the area requesting rebates of rentals and so on. The question of rebates is a matter strictly for the company itself.  I have, through the Department, been in touch with Cablelink Limited and they say the had some severe problems in the regions mentioned by the Deputy through people connecting themselves to cable systems without authorisation.  They estimate that in some parts of the area the self-connection rate could be as high as 30 per cent, that a single self-connection can destroy or substantially reduce the quality of the service to other subscribers in the surrounding area and this is part of <Col N="2865" /> the problem.  Cablelink Limited are at present considering ways of overcoming these problems, including for example, for the information of the Deputy, an easy payment scheme with the involvement of the residents of the area.  This is something we are aware of; the blame is not on one side and we are trying to sort out the problem.</P>

      <P>Complaints are received on a day-to-day basis by the cable company from the subscriber.  The Department are of course always willing to listen to complaints from the general public if they are not satisfied with the service they receive from a cable company.  In one case a cable company lost their licence to provide the service because of the level of complaints and the fact that they were not being dealt with.  Rather than setting up another organisation, the general public are welcome to contact the Department of Communications on the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 28, 30, 31, 34, 52 and 111, together.</P>
      <P>I have written to the UK Secretary of State for Energy seeking an immediate end to reprocessing at Sellafield and closure of the plant as soon as possible.  I have also submitted, for consideration at the June 1987 meeting of the Paris Commission for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, a recommendation that Sellafield be closed.  This recommendation reflects the unanimous call for the closure of Sellafield, made in this House on 3 December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2868" /> The Government firmly believe that technology available at present can practically eliminate discharges from nuclear installations and we are determined that this technology be used.  In addition to the Sellafield recommendation, I have tabled a recommendation for consideration at the Paris Commission meeting calling on member states to declare their firm intention to use the best available technology to minimise and eliminate discharges from all nuclear industries including reprocessing plants. The texts of both recommendations have been sent to contracting parties by the Paris Commission in advance of the meeting.</P>
    <P>As a meeting of the International Energy Agency in Paris on 11 May last, I took the opportunity to seek support for these recommendations from Ministers of Governments who are signatories to the Paris Convention.  I brought to their attention the Dáil resolution calling for the closure of Sellafield. I am happy to be able to report that the response was generally encouraging. I am having bilateral meetings with the Ambassadors of Iceland and Denmark this week, and with the Norwegian Ambassador next week, on this subject.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department will attend the Paris Commission meeting in June and will press for the adoption of the Irish recommendations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the monitoring of radioactive discharges from Sellafield, the Nuclear Energy Board carried out an ongoing monitoring programme of the levels of radioactivity in the Irish marine environment.  This involves the sampling and analysis of seafood, seaweed, sediment and seawater.  Copies of the results of the board's monitoring programme during 1982-84 are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The monitoring programme has been stepped up in recent years with, for example, the number of samples analysed in 1986 being about 50 per cent up on the number analysed in 1985.  It is proposed to maintain monitoring in 1987 at the 1986 level.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's concern about <Col N="2869" /> the safety of Sellafield is backed up not only by the scientific advice from the Nuclear Energy Board but also by the UK Health and Safety Executive who stated in a report last December that the potential existed for a serious incident at the plant.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that extensive monitoring and a high level of expertise on the world's nuclear industry are essential to enable us to cope with the potential hazards of nuclear installations in other countries.  This will be reflected in the function of the new National Radiological Protection Institute, the legislative framework for which I am at present drawing up.  In the meantime the Nuclear Energy Board have been given increased resources for the provision of a new laboratory and additional staff and equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider pressing the member states at the Paris Commission meeting that Sellafield should stop emitting discharges until they instal the technology which he agrees is not available?  Has he secured any support for his motion from the Portuguese or Dutch delegations, who appear to be the people who will tip the balance?  If his approach fails in Paris, will he consider court action to achieve the closure of Sellafield?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than reading the resolutions I will make them available to the Deputy.  The first calls for the closure of Sellafield and the second calls for the elimination of radioactive discharges from nuclear plants to the marine environment. It says that contracting parties to the Paris Commission for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, while protecting the system of dose limitation recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, declare their firm intention to use the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate as soon as possible radioactive discharges from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, into the marine environment.</P>

We brought briefs to the Paris meeting outlining our view, our letters to the United Kingdom Secretary of Energy and the exact resolutions we were putting forward.

Would the Minister <Col N="2871" /> indicate if he will be attending the convention meeting in Bristol given that it will be a plenary session involving wider issues, and given the important resolutions the Irish Government will be pursuing?  Mindful of the fact that the British Government can refuse to recognise or implement any resolution from the Paris Convention, has the Minister, or his Department, considered initiating proceedings before the European courts to compel Britain to close Sellafield and to stop abusing our territorial waters with the discharge of deleterious and dangerous waste?</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be mistaken.  There are two resolutions, one is calling for the closure of Sellafield and the second is for the use of the best available technology.  This two pronged attack will be undertaken at the meeting. As far as other countries suffering from the effects of Sellafield are concerned I can assure the Deputy that many countries feel very strongly about Sellafield, although Sellafield is not affecting them. The Nordic countries in particular are affected because of the currents in the Irish Sea and the North Sea.  There is a very strong feeling among the Nordic nations about the nuclear policy and programme of the British Government, for example, the Sizewell decision and the proposed extension of Dounreay.  The Nordic countries have already taken initiatives in regard to these issues and, therefore, it would not help our case if it was assumed that other countries could not care less because it only effects Ireland.  The issue affects many countries.</P>

      <P>The question of price control is proper to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who continues to have responsibility for the legislation for price control, notwithstanding the discontinuance of the operation of price control itself.  I understand that the industrial costs monitoring group, which are associated with the Department of Industry and Commerce, have expressed certain views on the petroleum price trends which have developed since formal price control was abolished in early 1986.  As far as I am concerned, it is of the utmost importance that the benefit of lower crude prices is passed on to the ultimate consumers, both industrial and domestic. A number of public institutions have expressed the fear that this may not, in fact, be happening.  I am more than ready to co-operate with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in any actions which he deems necessary to take in order to achieve this object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gas distribution networks were installed over many years in compliance with the standards pertaining from time to time.  The combination of deterioration due to passage of time, a large increase in the weight and amount of traffic and the changeover to natural gas inevitably gave rise to some problems <Col N="2875" /> with pipes.  As is evident from the excavations in Dublin, Dublin Gas Company are carrying out repairs and replacements. There is no question of wholesale replacement being required.</P>
    <P>The Cremer and Warner report recommended that all gas companies should undertake a leak survey and inspection of gas services of all multi-storey buildings within their area, which are either supplied with gas, or located in the immediate vicinity of gas mains.  The results of these surveys will be reported to the Government Task Force on Buildings. The recommendations in the report which refer specifically to the Dublin Gas Company are being closely monitored by my Department and particular attention is being given to leak investigation procedures. In the meantime, I can assure the House that all new pipe installations comply fully with current Irish standards. These standards are well in line with international standards.</P>
    <P>A study into the Dublin Gas network is currently being undertaken by the VEG-Gas Institute in order to determine what long term replacement policy is needed to continue the safe distribution of gas.  Bord Gáis Éireann will similarly be reviewing the requirements of the networks in other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a Dutch consultancy company are at present investigating the gas pipe network in Dublin.  The Minister referred to the fact that most of the network is old as it is mainly cast iron piping which has become brittle.  There is a great public concern in regard to so many leaks occurring and the fact that there have been explosions at Raglan House, Rialto House and in Nicholas Street.  Can the Minister say when the Dutch consultancy company will issue a report?  Given the urgency of the matter, will the Minister seek an interim report in case the full report is delayed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to have the <Col N="2876" /> report in June from the Dutch consultants. They have completed preliminary investigations and are now proceeding with a more detailed assessment and investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A disturbing feature of these leaks is that many of them take place under footpaths where there is no axial loading, further evidence that the pipe work is deteriorating, which could cause serious problems throughout the whole network. The Minister said that natural gas is causing a problem with the old pipes in that it is a drier, lighter gas than manufactured town gas which is more moist and less leak-prone than natural gas.  Is there any evidence to suggest that natural gas is more leak-prone in the old system by comparison with systems elsewhere which have been converted from town gas to natural gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of the safety aspects of the gas network in Dublin, the Government were so concerned about this issue that they gave immediate instructions to An Bord Gáis to proceed with the completion of the takeover of Dublin Gas, to get it out of receivership and to put it under proper management because of the health and safety aspects which arose when Dublin Gas were in receivership.  The question of natural gas having a damaging and corrosive effect on pipes does not arise according to the best technical advice I have received.  Some joints will have to be replaced but this is not a major problem and it can be done on a phased basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 48 together.  I am not aware of any IEA report which shows a growth of energy intensity in Ireland of 4 per cent as compared with a drop of 28 per cent in other member states for a comparable period.  The most recent IEA review of the energy policies and programmes of the member countries compiled in April 1987 lists the energy intensity of the member states on the basis of the total primary energy requirement &mdash; gross domestic product ratio which is the measurement used both by the IEA and the EC.  The figures quoted for Ireland are 0.51 for 1973; 0.49 for 1979; 0.42 for 1984 and 0.46 for 1985. While that table indicates an increase in intensity of 4 per cent approximately between 1984 and 1985 there were increases also for six other countries.  The corresponding change for all IEA countries between 1984 and 1985 was a reduction of 2 per cent approximately. A recent comparison made by the EC Commission for the period 1983-85 shows <Col N="2878" /> that the level of energy intensity fell more in Ireland than in any other EC country and there were increases in intensity in seven countries and in the EC as a whole. Because of statistical fluctuations in any particular year, it would be more accurate to make a comparison over a longer period.  The average change in intensity specified for the period 1973 to 1985 for Ireland is a reduction of 1.3 per cent per annum which is almost the same as the average for all European countries.  The corresponding energy intensity level for the IEA as a whole fell by 1.8 per cent per annum.  The reduction in Ireland's energy intensity level, therefore, compares favourably with the other member states indicating that current conservation policies are proving effective. It must be borne in mind, too, that what can be achieved under this heading depends to a considerable degree on the nature and the level of the economic activities conducted within the state in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was based on the IEA report of 1985 which found that Irish energy intensity has grown by 3.6 per cent while that of other IEA members has declined by 28 per cent. Can the Minister tell me whether the discrepancy between the figures he has given and what I have quoted is that he is not looking at industry?  Does the Minister regard as adequate the reduced provision for conservation by his Department, from £685,000 in 1983 to £280,000 in the current Estimate.  Is this amount adequate to meet the challenge implied by these figures and what are the Minister's plans for this area in 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to make a fundamental mistake in thinking that if you provide X amount of money in the Estimate you will get a certain quality of work and that if you reduce an allocation the quality of a service or of work would deteriorate.  That is not the way it is.  I can assure the Deputy that a very efficient programme is now being undertaken. I am reviewing that programme within the Department.  The allocation <Col N="2879" /> for 1988 will be decided on at the time of the publication of the Estimates for that year.  So far as the figures the Deputy has given are concerned, there can be variations.  I am not disputing the figures he has quoted from the report but all I can say is that six other countries along with ourselves &mdash; Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom &mdash; showed an increase in the level of energy intensity in 1985 over 1984.  All those countries pursue a very strong conservation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not clouding the central question in that Irish industry is basically energy inefficient and has become more so?  May I take it from his earlier reply in regard to expenditure in his Department in this area, that he is rejecting the recommendation made by the IEA in that the way in which to approach this problem would be provide some fiscal incentives for conservation in industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Good management alone, with the concentration of an energy manager's mind on the potential for savings within his company and with direction from the Government, which they are now getting should be sufficient. That should encourage business generally to reduce their costs and energy accounts for a major portion of the costs within industry.  I suggest that rather than throwing grants at industry it would be far better if they were to see how they could save money in their own businesses and to follow a policy directed by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clear up a matter raised on the last occasion by Deputy Doyle in relation to section 39.  I have taken further advice in the matter. Deputy Doyle raised the argument about the words &ldquo;the Minister may if he considers it necessary&rdquo;.  The advice I have taken about the Deputy's concern is that it now appears, as stated by her, that there might be some inconsistency in the expression &ldquo;the Minister may if he considers it necessary&rdquo;.  This expression is used in section 39 (4) of the Bill.  My advice is that this expression directly repeats the wording of a similar provision in section 40 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976. Section 40 of that Act deals specifically with special amenity area orders.  There is a relationship between that legislation and the legislation we are now considering.</P>
      <P>The clause &ldquo;if he considers it necessary&rdquo; should be understood in the first instance as a limitation on the Minister's general power of directing an order to be made.  The Minister cannot direct such an order arbitrarily or even because he would like to establish the idyllic state of environmental protection.  He can only give a direction if he is satisfied that it is necessary to prevent or to limit air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While control of air pollution is the object of this Bill, it may not be the overriding consideration on every possible occasion, for example, the country <Col N="3009" /> might face a fuel emergency or some kind of financial scarcity which might make it impracticable to contemplate a special control order in a particular place at a particular time.  In such cases it might be necessary from the point of view of air pollution control that an order should be made but the Minister might wish to use his discretion to hold off an order until other non-environmental circumstances were more favourable.  This is the reason why this sentence is worded as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the considerable explanation he has given me.  The Minister quoted a precedent in the Planning Acts.  However, those Acts are some years old at this stage and all of us from different points of view find some deficiencies to a greater or lesser extent in the Acts as is easy with the wisdom of hindsight.  I do not think purely from the precedent point of view that it is necessary to compound deficiencies, if we consider this sentence to be deficient in any way, by saying that we must use it because it has been used in similar legislation before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's second point that there may be matters, other than matters which purely relate to environmental pollution, which may help make the Minister's mind up, all things being equal. However, it appears now that the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is incorrect if that aspect of the Minister's argument stands up.  I accept that fully but perhaps the word &ldquo;opportune&rdquo; to do so or a word of similar meaning could be inserted instead of the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is a fairly conclusive word &mdash; if something is &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to be done, it should be done and not &ldquo;may' be done.  This Bill deals with air pollution.  We are asking, in the event of a local authority, for whatever reason, not implementing a special control area order, if all of the points under section 39 (2) stand up, that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;, if he considers it necessary, introduce this special control area order.  My argument on the last occasion we discussed this Bill was that if it was necessary to do so the wording should be that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; introduce this <Col N="3010" /> order.  However, if we want to leave in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; and I accept that there is provision right through this Bill and other Bills for allowing discretion by the Minister and that is as it should be &mdash; surely necessity would not allow discretion. Perhaps it might be inopportune for reasons other than those strictly related to air pollution for the Minister not to proceed.  I accept that a national emergency, a fuel scarcity or some other major problem might prevail conceivably, however unlikely.</P>
    <P>This is not a point I want to labour much longer.  We discussed it at some length on the last occasion but I am unhappy about this because I feel there could be several outs there.  I want to nail down the occasions on which the Minister might consider not implementing an order when section 39 (2) (a), (b), (c) and (d) stand up.  Those occasions should be minimal and should be national emergency-type occasions.  I accept conceivably that occasions like this could arise.  If it was necessary to bring in a special control area order there should be no discretion &mdash; if the local authority do not do it, the Minister &ldquo;should&rdquo; and not &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; is what is causing the big difficulty.  Perhaps the Minister will agree to the word the Minister may if he considers it &ldquo;opportune&rdquo; to do so or any other similar word he might like to suggest. If the Minister agrees to this then I have no difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 39 it is foreseen that a local authority may make an order with the consent of another local authority outside of what they call their own functional area to influence a reduction in pollution or the control or management of proper air in that area. What concerns me is how a local authority in one area can have influence in another.  The most important example that comes to mind is what I would regard as the major source of air pollution in recent years, that is Moneypoint and its expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that this Bill did not concern itself with the area of urbanised pollution.  He said he did not wish us in this debate to confine ourselves to that question.  In relation to Moneypoint cumulative long term pollution at the rate of something like 70,000 tons per annum of suplhur dioxide is being spewed out into the regions close to the Burren.  I would be very concerned that a local authority would not have any effect in relation to the control of the local authority in the region of Moneypoint because of the huge vested interests <Col N="3012" /> that would be built up surrounding the production of energy from that source and that, consequently, massive amounts of coal would be burned with the resultant pollution of the Burren region.  Just a change of wind could cause irreparable damage to a very delicate ecological region that has literally nurtured and grown itself over centuries, a region that has been studied by botanists throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress enough the importance of the Burren.  It is one of our prime tourist attractions.  It is also one of the most important botanical ecological regions in all of Europe.  There is only one other area that compares with the Burren and that is in Yugoslavia.  Delicate plants and flowers similar to those found in remote areas of high mountainous regions in Switzerland are growing in the Burren.  The Burren has a very delicate climate and is combined of sheltered rock and peat and soil that has laid itself down there, all depending on a delicate air balance.  Will the Minister give an assurance that his Department will watch this area very closely and not just depend on a local authority to make some complaint to the local authority surrounding Moneypoint?  The Department of the Environment should take a direct interest in this region and the Minister's control should supersede the control of air which is being provided for in this Bill.  I regret to say that this is inept legislation which will prove to be inoperable.  The Burren is a region which must be protected and we must forcibly take every measure to protect it.</P>
    <P>We are breaking EC law, if one wants it strictly enforced.  I know derogation is not specifically geared for Ireland, but we are, if not breaking the law, sailing very close to it and we are breaking the spirit of the law in that new power stations after a certain date should have been fitted with sulphur recovery scrubbers to recover sulphur dioxide.  This has not been done at Moneypoint.  Thankfully we are still well involved with the European Community and after the recent referendum, we will not be considered <i>personna non grata.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3013" /> I appeal to the Minister to investigate in the EC the cost of subsidy to provide scrubbers for Moneypoint.  The prices quoted by the ESB were not the lowest prices for which scrubbers could be fitted. Now I see that the ESB are making independent inquiries.  It is a little late for that but we cannot just expect a local authority to take on this problem.  It would be a bit like a mouse trying to shout at a lion which was roaring at it. This is a huge pollutant which is sending sulphur dioxide right across the country and up as far as Scandinavia, affecting areas of northern Europe.  We are giving a very bad example in that respect.  It is all very fine to say that it is not a great amount of pollution in the context of what is happening in Germany, but that is not comparing like with like.  The fact that our air is pollution free is all the more reason for taking measures to safeguard it.  The Minister should take cognisance of the two points I make.  I would like to see a special amenity order for the Burren so that it is specially monitored. This would be apart from the two or three monitoring devices that are there at present.  Major concern should be addressed to the Burren region, because if the damage is done, as it could be done within a few years, it will be impossible to grow again anything like what is in that botanical region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all sympathise with and support the thrust of what Deputy Brady said about protecting the environment, with particular reference to the Burren in County Clare.  In connection with Moneypoint, Deputy Brady and a few others criticised what they saw as the derogation which the ESB were seeking from the draft EC directive on large combustion plant.  It would be just as well to offer some points of clarification on that, and I am in a position to do so because we have had some discussions in the recent past about this.  Last week I spent some time in Brussels dealing with this directive on large combustion plants and Moneypoint was uppermost in my mind during that time.  The matter has not yet been finalised.  The draft directive only <Col N="3014" /> proposes clean technology or scrubbers for new plant authorised after 1987. Moneypoint would not be new plant for the purposes of the directive and there would be no directive obligations on it to fit scrubbers.  The whole idea about scrubbers is that it would limit the emissions of SO 2 from large combustion plant but this does not arise in so far as negotiations on the directive on large combusition plant are concerned.</P>
      <P>The second part of the EC proposal would require total power plant emissions from member states to be kept within various limits which would be different for each member state.  One possible way for Ireland to keep within the national limit would be to fit scrubbers on Moneypoint.  It is not necessary in the light of the directive now so seek to have those scrubbers applied at this time because our limits will be away below the average limits that would apply eventually to mainland Europe and to other European States.</P>
      <P>That is in no way to minimise the risks that large combustion plants can have for our environment.  With that in mind a considerable monitoring system has been installed for the area close to Moneypoint, and the ESB, Clare County Council and An Foras Forbartha are working very closely together to see to it that the Burren is protected, first by having a baseline study done and then on an ongoing basis monitoring the situation so as not to allow Moneypoint in any way to act to the detriment of the environment and in particular the Burren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Deputy's notice that already some monitoring stations are installed.  There is a large one in the Slieve Bloom mountains and it is proposed to have two further large monitoring stations, one at Turlough Hill and one in Kilkenny.  Apart from that there are a number of other small monitoring stations in a circle right around the Moneypoint plant, nearly a dozen in total.  They give a readout of the exact level of emission from Moneypoint. However, I take Deputy Brady's view seriously because the prevailing wind in <Col N="3015" /> that part of the country is from the south-west and it will be necessary to have that monitoring carried out on any acid precipitation occurring along the Shannonside-Dublin corridor.  It has been discovered here and abroad that, particularly where there are high rising stacks on large combustion plants with a prevailing wind of several knots, emissions do not normally land close to the plant. They are carried on winds, as Deputy Brady said rightly, often as far away as mainland Europe.  That is the cause of much of the trans-boundary pollution we have been talking about in consultations with our EC partners.</P>
    <P>All these things are being very carefully assessed.  I do not wish to minimise the inherent dangers that could exist if the levels of SO 2 were to increase beyond their present limits.  All of that is being considered in the light of the new EC Directive and Deputies can rest assured that I am more than anxious to have a close watch kept on that unique piece of countryside known as the Burren which has an international importance, is unique in many ways and certainly will be protected.</P>

      <P>Once this legislation is passed one of the first pieces of retrospective implementation of the Bill could be the operation of Moneypoint, bearing in mind the total issues involved when we speak of Moneypoint and the input of the Department of Energy.  I take it that No. 2 in the Third Schedule would include stations such as Moneypoint.  I concur with the fears expressed by Deputy Brady.  Will the Minister confirm to us that retrospection will and can work effectively in relation to this legislation, and will he look at Moneypoint and the whole scrubber issue with that in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is worth considering and I will do so.  Many people imagine that Moneypoint, being a very large emitter of SO 2, must continue to be that way. In the past it has not always been possible to have available low sulphur fuels for burning, but as things are at the moment <Col N="3016" /> with low sulphur coals and particularly natural gas we have the matter under control.  What the Deputy says is quite right and I will consider it very carefully.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 40.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 40 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the regulations authorising the use of certain classes of fireplaces in a particular area.  Only last week or the week before that, many of us were invited to a demonstration of a type of smoke recovery fireplace which appeared, as it was spoken of, to be the panacea to all our problems here in regard to smoke recovery. It was claimed that this unit would recover up to 80 per cent of smoke.  If this is so we must compliment those engaged in active research and in endeavouring to combat the problem of air pollution and the high concentration of smoke particularly in urban areas.  On closer examination and questioning it became apparent that fireplaces of that kind could cost between £500 and £1,000 to install.  Some are being fitted through local authorities in Dublin city and in County Dublin, six in each case, on an experimental basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some areas of Dublin, such as Ballymun and Finglas, which have been identified as large, densely populated areas, would benefit greatly from fireplaces of that kind.  Under this section which permits the Minister to make regulations authorising the use of a certain class of fireplace it would be impossible for private individuals in many cases to install fireplaces of this kind.  The cost for conversion to this type of fireplace throughout the city would be of the order of £30 million.  Again I am looking towards the EC.  Will the Minister in his reply indicate whether some funding could be available by way of subsidy to assist people who want to install fireplaces of this kind?  Let me be clear and <Col N="3017" /> say that I am not looking for any grant-in-aid from the Government to do this because our finances could bear no strain of that kind whatsoever, but will the EC look to Dublin city as a region where the air quality is particularly bad and offer some type of subsidy, maybe on a pilot basis in some region, for the installation of these fireplaces?</P>
    <P>This section permits the Minister to regulate the type of fuels to be used in special control areas.  One problem here is the high cost of smokeless fuel.  &ldquo;Coalite&rdquo;, to give one trade name, costs something like £90 for half a tonne as against coal which is of the order of £60 per half a tonne.  That is a considerable price difference.  Here again, using modern technology of smoke recovery fireplaces combined with smokeless fuels, will the Minister indicate whether the cost of smokeless fuel could be assisted in some way through the EC rather than making a subsidy through our Exchequer?  That would go a very long way towards solving this problem.  We all realise that fireplaces have a social usage and are a comfort in many homes.  The fireplace is and has been traditional for centuries in Irish life.  Its usage will not die out overnight by way of a sudden conversion to some awful artificial burners.  If we can make inroads in the development of those two areas it would constitute a modern or two-pronged approach to the problem.  In that way funding could be sought through the EC for the installation of fireplaces and also in respect of smokeless fuels.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility of reactivating the anthracite mine in Tipperary.  My information is that this is a particularly difficult mine from which to extract anthracite because its passageways are narrow, somewhat dangerous and so on. We might examine the possibility of mining more indigenous fuel in order to combat the problem.  Much can be done without banning the use of fireplaces, coal and so on.  Under no circumstances must we pander to commercial pressures who would contend that there is no air pollution problem in Dublin, that people are exaggerating.  I find that argument an insult to people's intelligence.  One only <Col N="3018" /> has to go out into the open air at night time to nearly choke from it.  Medical evidence speaks for itself about our deteriorating air quality.</P>
    <P>I might mention for the information of the House something which may demonstrate the problem about which I speak.  From my experience or contacts with patients with eye problems it is apparent that there has been an enormous increase in recent years in the incidence of non-specific conjunctivitis, commonly known as the red eye syndrome, when people's eyes become irritable, in the main because of infection but also because of the environment to which they are subjected by way of bad quality air or water.  That is something that has been chronicled in many hospitals, that this complaint is on the increase and is due primarily to this pollution problem.  It is also apparent in the case of people who wear contact lenses and who find them intolerable in the bad quality air of Dublin.  Of course the Minister has the glorious advantage of living in the clear air west of the Shannon.  I see him nodding his head in contented agreement.  Yet, with his busy round of duties in Dublin he, too, is subjected to the Dublin air for a good portion of the week.  I am sure he would agree that the further west he drives the more the air becomes clearer and more tolerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the type of air we want to achieve in Dublin.  The Minister might take note of my suggestions, particularly that of developing the anthracite mines in Tipperary.  He might also make aggressive efforts to have the provisions of this Bill &mdash; particularly those of section 40 &mdash; implemented in an effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was nodding my agreement to the Deputy's remarks about the further west one travels the cleaner the air becomes.  I was doing it for the benefit of some young friends who happen to be with us in the Dáil today.  In a more lighthearted way perhaps I might encourage Deputy Brady and his constituents from <Col N="3019" /> the smoke-filled atmosphere of the large conurbations of Dublin to take themselves west for their annual holidays where the air is clear and unpolluted.</P>
      <P>There has always been the tradition of the open fireplace in Ireland that is not confined to Dublin city.  It is a practice firmly established throughout the country which will not be changed as a result of any legislation we pass here.  The overview in so far as legislation is concerned is that we should endeavour to be flexible in all these things.  We are not passing legislation to make life intolerable or impossible for people but rather because we recognise there is a problem of pollution, mostly smoke pollution in Dublin city and perhaps in a few other built-up areas.  It is that pollution the provisions of this Bill are endeavouring to adress.  In addition to being flexible in our attitude towards these special control area orders we must encourage people to seek ways and means of living better so as to create a better quality of air generally in their areas or surrounding their places of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo; has arisen here. It is purely a technical term which includes closed burning appliances as well as open fireplaces.  There are many new developments in so far as appliances are concerned.  For example, there are new designed smoke-eating backboilers using ordinary coal.  They are somewhat expensive at present but, as time goes on, they should become more readily available at a cheaper rate.  It must also be understood that there are many special types of appliances coming on the market at present, all being promoted as better users of fuel in so far as economy and smoke emissions are concerned.  There are other options which will have to be considered in conjunction with whatever decisions are taken by local authorities or by me as Minister.  I might refer in particular to new types of smokeless fuel to come on the market before too long. The price differential might not be as wide as is being suggested.  I am not at liberty, as is Deputy Brady, to mention trade names or types but I understand <Col N="3020" /> from some little research I have done myself in this matter that before too long new types of fuel will come on the market, home-based indigenous products that will meet much of the requirements we seek to have imposed under the provisions of this Bill.  I do not know whether we have experimented sufficiently with smokeless or less smokey fuels, such as certain types of gas and oil.  All of these things will feature in the decisions that will have to be taken in respect of an area when it is being decided to have a special control area order made.</P>
    <P>Different requirements may be prescribed for differing classes of premises, differing fuels and specific areas.  That is important as well.  It may be that, to achieve the desired result <i>vis-á-vis</i> the overall level of pollution in a given area, we would have to indicate different types of fuels, different types of appliances for different types of circumstances.  That will make for an overall flexible approach.</P>
    <P>I am not over-optimistic about the re-introduction of a special grant-aid system to deal with this matter in the immediate future.  That might not be possible but it is dealt with under the provisions of section 45 which we shall be considering later.  That provision has been inserted so that the option will be available and may yet have to be resorted to achieve the desired result.  But, in these areas, every other option should be tried before applying State assistance to remedy a problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to consider further the possibility of some EC support.  I had not travelled very far down that road.  It might be possible to seek such aid in so far as research and development is concerned <i>vis-á-vis</i> new appliances and/or new fuels.  With that in mind I will consider Deputy Brady's suggestion.  I recommend to those considering special control area orders that they be flexible in their approach and encourage people to use different kinds of appliances, better type fuels, which we hope would not be too much out of line with the price of our existing fuel, and new technology.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the expression &ldquo;as soon as may be after they...&rdquo;?  I am slightly concerned when I read a rather vague expression like that.  I have no doubt I will be quoted a precedent for its use as I know this expression has appeared in legislation before.  However I am not sure that this is a reason to compound deficiencies.</P>
      <P>Section 41 (1) deals with the confirmation of the special control area order and confers powers on the local authority to give notice, including (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) as outlined.  I have no problem with that.  However, if a local authority refuses to implement a special control area order and the Minister makes an order implementing a special control area for the functional area of the local authority in question, what guarantee is there that the local authority will subsequently play ball and proceed according to section 41?  I am presuming that what is included under section 41 is an executive function. If it was a reserved function of the members and if the members previously refused to implement one of these orders and the Minister had to do so what guarantees are there that the matter would proceed according to section 41? If the local authority refuse to proceed according to section 41 (1), what then? My reading of it does not allow the Minister to issue a notice and give the minimum of one month's display and so on.</P>

While one might not <Col N="3022" /> always subscribe to the language used by draftsmen in particular sections of legislation it has proved its worth.  This will stand up as well to the test of time as far as the words are concerned.</P>
      <P>The function is an executive one.  The Minister gives a particular order to the local authority and they have to comply with it within the terms of the legislation under which the order is made.  They cannot move away from that because if they did they would be in default of their statutory duty.  While local authorities are wont to do things they are not wont to break the law against a direction given by the Minister.  It has not been the case in instances where ministerial orders have been given that authorities went against them because of the serious consequences attached thereto.</P>

      <P>The words &ldquo;as soon as may&rdquo; are a little archaic and antediluvian.  Perhaps there is a need to keep using this language which is in the annals of legislation.  Perhaps it facilitates our over-taxed parliamentary draftsmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Herein lies the nub of the whole problem in that the legislation is enabling rather than directive.  It is important that it is identified that the legislation enables the local authority to work on their own initiative if they see fit.  It is very frail from that point of view, as is much of the legislation concerning the improvement of the environment and so on.  A lot of legislation passed in recent years suffered greatly in that it was enabling legislation rather than legislation which directed the local authority to carry out a particular task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) states: &ldquo;A local authority may, and shall if the Minister so directs&rdquo; formulate a management plan for a particular area.  Given the very vast number of demands on the Minister for the Environment, what input will he have in that regard?  There is a very serious situation in regard to air pollution in our capital city and I request the Minister to direct Dublin Corporation to immediately put into effect a management plan for air control in Dublin.  We should not wait for the local authority to come up with a plan if they see fit.  There is a half-hearted approach to this whole question by local authorities.  They acknowledge that a problem exists but they will say that the position here is not as bad as that in Europe and they will quote statistics to make that case.  Any of us who has taken the bother of examining the air quality control figures, given on a monthly basis by the section which deals with this matter, realises that we are in breach of the EC regulations in many locations in Dublin city.  In the spirit of this legislation the Minister has an ideal opportunity, and has the total support of this House, to demand that our largest local <Col N="3025" /> authority, in this case Dublin Corporation, would provide his Department with an air quality management plan.  I would like to see the whole question of smokeless zones incorporated in such a management plan.</P>
    <P>There are also other facets of air pollution and one in particular which causes immense problems in snarl-up traffic jams in Dublin is diesel fumes which emanate from buses and from cars that are badly tuned and are not serviced properly. They spew out noxious air, in this case carbon monoxide, and other gases into the atmosphere.  I realise that the legislation we are talking about does not deal directly with air pollution from cars, buses or vehicles of that kind but nonetheless it combines to giving very bad quality air in the city, with a high density of sulphur dioxide particularly in the winter months.  I plead with the Minister to consider an air quality management plan for Dublin.  If, during the passage of this legislation, he gave a commitment of this kind it would not be of immense cost to the State.  All the facts and figures are there, the research has been done and the evidence is available.  It is just a question of putting this information together, which could be done very quickly, and then identifying what can be done about the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anne Colley, during the last session of this debate, made a very constructive proposal which would be of benefit to Dublin and to other areas of the country &mdash; to introduce a monitoring service for air pollution.  Deputy Colley indicated that this could be coupled with the weather forecasting service.  Information should be given every evening if necessary to warn people of the impending high concentration of sulphur dioxide in the air.  This can be part of the measures taken into account in the drafting of a management plan.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.  Given the fact that many of us are less than happy about the effectiveness of this toothless legislation.  Nonetheless if the Minister uses the opportunity to direct Dublin Corporation in this matter we <Col N="3026" /> would be at least on our way to counteracting the problem for the coming winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Brady's comments on the Bill in regard to the lack of direction to local authorities and particularly in regard to air quality management plans.  Whereas I understand it is an enabling Bill, it seems, as Deputy Brady pointed out, the Dublin city area is crying out for such a management plan. I also appeal to the Minister to direct not just Dublin Corporation but also Dublin County Council to consider such a plan in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I also wish to mention the smoke alert or smog alert which I referred to in the last debate on this matter.  While I understand there is a lack of financial resources at present to make any great inroads into the problems of air pollution, I appeal to the Minister to use the resources which cost very little, among which would be such a smoke alert.  We should have the results from those monitoring stations available for us.  I do not think many local authorities will do very much arising from the results of the monitoring of smoke or smog.  However, one thing that could be done would be to use these results to raise the consciousness of people so that they would contribute to solving the problem of air pollution and also prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical problems are also associated with air pollution and these should be recognised.  Smoke alerts would usefully serve that purpose.  I do not wish such smoke or smog alerts to be sensational. They should be run on the basis as the pollen count which is given out at particular times during the summer.  The monitoring of smoke or smog would presumably take place mostly in winter.  I appeal to the Minister to consider first, directing the Dublin local authorities to have an air quality management plan and, secondly, to use the results obtained at these monitoring stations.  I do not know if it comes under this section but in terms of air quality generally may I ask the <Col N="3027" /> Minister to consider liaising with the Minister for Health to allow the Health Education Bureau to engage in a programme of making people aware of air pollution and its dangers to health?  Part of this could be done as a result of this Bill but it could also be done in conjunction with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to deal with Deputy Brady's remarks about air quality management plans.  We would like to have such plans and they would be regarded as an essential part of dealing with air pollution but they are not absolutely necessary so far as taking action is concerned.  While it is not relevant to this debate, perhaps I might refer to our progress under the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  There are 20 water quality management plans in preparation but only one has been adopted.  Even under the waste disposal regulations of 1979 to 1982, only 11 such management plans are in place and more are in preparation.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that the management plan as outlined in section 46 is not essential to get on with the job.  All the major functions of this legislation can be carried out without a management plan being in place.  All the urgent things which need to be done can be done.  As far as giving directions are concerned, a point raised by Deputy Colley, that is catered for in section 47.  It explicitly states that the Minister has power to direct in a variety of ways the making and the co-ordination of air quality management plans by local authorities and he can even go beyond that.  He can direct a local authority, or two or more authorities jointly, to make such a plan.</P>

      <P>Yes, because of the overlapping of jurisdiction.  I take note of the Deputy's remarks on liaising with the Minister for Health.  That is a good idea and I will consider it very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parts II, III and IV of this legislation are the principal parts and enable the job <Col N="3028" /> to be done as distinct from the management plan dealt with in this section. It is desirable to have an air quality management plan but it will not inhibit special control orders being made or action being taken to deal with a particular problem which may arise next winter.  Section 24 sets out in specific terms the best practical means to limit or prevent air pollution and section 39 deals with the putting in place of special area control orders.</P>
    <P>Part III allows for licensing of industrial premises.  All these things can be put in place and made workable to deal with any problem which might arise in the immediate future rather than waiting until such time as the air quality management plan is ready.  I take note of Deputies' concern about this matter, particularly Deputy Brady, and I want to put their minds at rest so far as the necessity for the management plans are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, and I think Deputy Brady, referred to the proposal for the system of smog alerts.  With the proper investment in new equipment that might be possible but I am not sure this system would be particularly useful or cost effective in Irish circumstances.  As it is operated in certain continental countries, smog alerts generally related to pollution from sulphur dioxide rather than smoke. The essential difference at this time is that our big problem is smoke.  Deputy Brady referred to the possibility of a problem arising at Moneypoint so far as sulphur dioxide is concerned.  As I said, our immediate problem deals with the smoke element of pollution, and this must be handled immediately.  As I see it, our problem has been, and will continue to be, with smoke rather than sulphur dioxide.</P>
    <P>Smog alerts in continental Europe are nearly always directed to individual major sources of sulphur emissions.  Closing down large emitters for a few days does settle the matter, or requiring them to use low sulphur fuels is a way of alleviating the sulphur levels fairly quickly, but smoke problems in Dublin arise from the hundreds of thousands of ordinary domestic fireplaces burning ordinary types of <Col N="3029" /> fuel.  Generally speaking, the smog alerts referred to by Deputy Colley are not relevant now as far as Dublin is concerned, and hopefully never will be.  As I said, our problem is smoke emissions from domestic fires but there are possibilities that smokeless fuels, new appliances and new technology will go a long way in the immediate future to deal with that matter and, hopefully, without recourse to the legislation we are talking about now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is equipment available that will measure the density of smog caused by suspended particles either of coal dust or dust from other materials which are burned.  I am not speaking specifically of suplhur dioxide because there is equipment for that.  In the Atmospheric Pollution Control Unit Aston Quay, there is information available about a special unit, a very sophisticated piece of equipment, costing £20,000.  This would cover the entire city of Dublin.  With this equipment it is possible to measure the suspended particles which cause smog due to the burning of bituminous coal.  Sulphur dioxide is another poisonous element.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that the main problem in Dublin is smog but that can be monitored with modern equipment and with the setting up of a smog alert system.  It would be most desirable if this were done because it would enable people, particularly in densely populated areas, to turn to alternative types of fuel &mdash;electric fires, bottled gas or some other fuel &mdash; at certain times when temperature inversions cause problems.  The atmospheric control section of Dublin Corporation are anxious that such a system should be tried.  I am not so sure about the local authority as a whole but the people I spoke to assured me that equipment was available and could be used.  I seem to be again referring to the EC but funding is available for environment oriented projects and given that this is the year of the environment, we should use every possible opportunity through the EC to purchase the best equipment we possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3030" /> I take Deputy Colley's point that a smog alert system should also be set up in Dublin county as it is impossible to divorce it from the city in terms of air pollution.  It cannot be controlled but, for a start, the Minister should direct both authorities to instigate a smog alert system for the capital.  If it is done in regard to other pollutants &mdash; counts can be done in relation to humidity and pollen &mdash; there is no reason for not introducing it for smog levels in the city.  It would perhaps create consciousness among the public of what this is all about.</P>
    <P>Environmental studies should be part of the school curriculum because the extension of the present pollution, most regrettably, is found in third level educational colleges.  One merely has to go to Belfield to see the appalling pollution on the campus by third level students who should know better.  It is a disgrace.  The educational process should start at kindergarten level, to try to install in the minds of those who will be controlling the country in the future, a consciousness of the need for preserving our environment. We must do this by showing our will rather than by just passing legislation. Legislation which has been passed in regard to environmental issues has not been enforced and I have grave doubts as to whether this legislation will be enforced either.  I have said that a few times but I repeat it with a purpose, that is, I hope the Minister's office will ensure that this legislation will not gather dust &mdash; if I may use that phrase &mdash; as other legislation has been allowed to do.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to set a smog alert system in train for the winter as part of a management plan.  My reason for stating the need for an air quality management plan for Dublin is not necessarily that it is not needed to enforce the legislation; it is twofold.  It would highlight the problem, I do not like to say it would embarrass the authorities into doing something about it, but they should be directed to instigate a management plan and to put down on paper the extent of the problem on environmental and health grounds.  They could then set about their recommendations to do something <Col N="3031" /> about it.  I hope that that would include the creation of a smokeless zone for Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the Minister's reply to me about the smog alert.  I meant to refer to a smoke alert and not a smog alert.  I realise that Dublin does not have a problem in regard to smog unlike continental countries and America.  Smoke &mdash; and smog &mdash; are caused by climatic conditions which often occur in Dublin in winter.  On many occasions there is no movement of air and, as we are surrounded by mountains, the smoke stays there.  I appeal once more to the Minister to consider a smoke alert system which would be very important for a number of people who suffer from diseases or conditions which are exacerbated by excessive smoke in winter.  If such a system was in place they could avoid infection after infection by staying indoors when smoke is particularly bad.  It would also encourage people, as Deputy Brady said, to use alternative forms of fuel.  After all, people cut down on usage if there is a water shortage and they would do the same in regard to fuel if they thought their efforts would help to ease pollution. People react to crises when they are told about them but, if they are not told, they cannot help.  Many Dublin people would realise the difficulties especially if a member of their family is an asthmatic or has a bronchial condition.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Brady's view on the air quality management plan.  What is the point in having it in the Bill if it is irrelevant?  I understand that it is not necessary to have an air quality management plan to bring other provisions in the Bill into place but public life has been sadly lacking in planning over the years and this is an instance when we could bring some cohesiveness to bear on the management of air pollution.  Just because it has not been brought into being in regard to water pollution does not mean that we cannot go about this in a better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Deputy Brady's point that if <Col N="3032" /> the Minister directs local authorities to prepare an air quality management plan it will alert them to the fact that he is serious about the implementation of the Bill.  It will mean that they will look at the whole picture instead of going about it in a piecemeal fashion, perhaps concentrating on high sulphur producing appliances next winter and on something else the following year.  We should encourage local authorities to do so, especially those whose areas have large scale problems at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the air quality management plan which, together with water quality management plans and county development plans, are part of the whole co-ordinated approach to the planning of our environment.  We await some sort of planning in relation to waste management although that will take a little time.  However, that would tie it all up very neatly and tidily; at least we would have the legislation to do anything that needs to be done in relation to planning and controlling our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Brady and Deputy Colley are worth underlining.  Is legislation itself good enough if we are not serious about enforcement?  I am a little concerned about the Minister's reply in relation to the air quality management plan before us today.  In effect, the only areas I think should immediately be asked to produce an air quality management plan are Dublin and greater Dublin.  I would hope that that is where the attention will be directed immediately. In theory, problems can arise anywhere, particularly in the larger urban areas.  I would hate the excuse that has been there for the last ten years with the water quality management plan, for example, to be used by local authorities if they should be producing these air quality management plans.  Has the Minister any specific enabling powers, or any powers to provide adequate finance to local authorities to insist that they implement an air quality management plan if he deem it necessary?  The grants are there to help householders and others to convert from <Col N="3033" /> one type of appliance or fuel to another but quite frankly, with the perilous state of many a local authority at the moment, they have used, with some justification, the excuse &mdash; and the very reasonable one &mdash; that they have neither the staff not the resources to take on board any more legislation that we may pass in this House.  In the past ten years there have been six or seven pieces of legislation passed here that have direct implications for the financial resources of local authorities but the authorities have not been given any additional resources to implement such legislation.  Will there be an out now in relation to air quality management plans because of the lack of finance in local authorities?  I hope that will not be a reason for our not having our air quality management plans.</P>
    <P>Let me ask your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, while I am on my feet.  I must leave now so I shall not see this legislation out to the end but as I was the person who brought it through the Seanad on all Stages during the last administration, I should like to compliment the Minister for his tremendous co-operation and the interesting and lively debate on Second Stage and the almost completed Committee Stage.  I found him very receptive to the views of Deputies on all sides of the House and I thank him for bearing with us.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill is perhaps a major tribute to the European year of the Environment.  I hope the passage of this Bill, will mean, too, that the European Commission will not pursue the action they initiated against Ireland in the European Court because of its tardiness in coming to heel on these very matters and that now that we are in a position to take on board the European directives as part of our own legislation all will be well with our environmental colleagues in Europe.  The very fact that they had to initiate action is, in itself, an indictment of our tardiness and that goes across all parties.  We should have seen to this matter long ago but for different reasons that was not possible.  As spokesperson for the moment on the environment on this side of the House I thank the Minister <Col N="3034" /> for his co-operation on this Bill.  I am afraid that a family bereavement takes me away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for her kind words of support. We can all agree in matters of this kind that there are no politics in it.  It is a question of doing the right thing for the community at large and if suggestions or amendments come forward which are reasonable, why should I not take them on board?  There is nothing confrontational in this legislation and for that reason I am happy to have the comments of all Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady mentioned equipment which he is aware of being available in so far as dealing with this type of pollution is concerned.  What he was referring to probably was the total suspended particulate system for measuring smoke, the system used in Germany and certain other countries; also the black smoke filters system which measures smoke concentrations and which is based on OECD standards.  Both of these measures are acceptable to the EC if one wants to measure the type of thing about which Deputy Brady was talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputies Colley and Doyle, management plans, to my way of thinking, are not at all irrelevant.  I regard them as an essential part of the legislation. They are important and local authorities can initiate those plans of their own accord.  I presume that a local authority like Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council who have to deal with this difficulty would initiate such plans. They can do this on their own, or I can direct them to do it.  I take it that there has been a fair amount of public support in those two corporate bodies for doing something to eliminate smoke in certain areas of this city and that they will be initiating such studies and plans.  I expect them to do so and if they do not I always have the fall back position where I can direct them to do so.  I hope it would not be necessary for the Minister to be dictating to local authorities that have a desperate problem within their own area or that they would seek to be directed by <Col N="3035" /> a Minister on all important areas of public health that deal with their own constituents.</P>
    <P>My attitude towards the plan was that it is not essential to have such a plan in place before you initiate a programme to deal with a problem that exists.</P>
    <P>It was in that regard that I raised the question about resources that would be available.  I should like to think that we would put whatever limited resources are available into adapting houses so that they would emit either as little as possible or no smoke.  I would also like to seek support, whether from my own resources or from EC sources, to help with research and development for the smokeless fuels or other types of fuel that Deputy Colley referred to.  That, in the long term, would relieve much of the pressure, whether by grant system or aid in any form she likes. It would resolve the situation and that is the way we would be heading.  It might happen that in the not too distant future there was no need for any of these special area control orders.  However, that can only be achieved by better use of existing smokeless fuels, better development of appliances and new technology and by putting a little research into the types of smokeless fuels and can come and will be coming on stream in the near future.  I give that only as my personal opinion. That is the direction in which the resources should be going.  It in no way suggests that the management plans would be irrelevant, or not necessary. They certainly will be, but in their own good time.</P>
    <P>The question about possible discussion with the meteorological service is interesting. To get a total overview of how emissions of smoke are moved from one area to another and of the whole question of transboundary pollution and the movement of SO 2 in the high atmosphere, it would be essential that discussions take place with the meteorological service so that one could establish quite clearly the areas of danger of a particular prevailing wind, particular atmospheric conditions, or whatever.  That is a fair comment and I take it on board.  Such a discussion <Col N="3036" /> should take place with a view to establishing the best means of assessing where pollution occurs and the reasons for it at a particular time.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I am not in the business of closing down streets of houses.  That is not on.  We should be looking at the matter in a different way.  We should be hoping to provide the means whereby the best use can be got from the available appliances, new technology and new types of fuels so that it would not be necessary to put people to a great deal of trouble.  I am quite sure that one could scare many domestic householders who would not be able to meet the demands of such an order unless one were given the option as to how to get around it and make a contribution.  That comes back to the educational process, I readily understand that.  So far as the preservation and protection of our environment is concerned, we must face up to the fact that we do not look after what is given to us free, gratis and for nothing.  We do not keep it in good condition.  We are not handing it on to those who come after us in the condition in which we found it.  This is one piece of legislation which is trying to control that, but so many others are already on the Statute Book and not being applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be sorry to know that in the past week I have been taken aback by the amount of litter and rusty old cars thrown around our scenic areas, in streams and watering places and other amenities throughout the country. I have issued a direction to the county councils that I want such litter got rid of. I have been very blunt in the matter. There is no need for this indiscriminate dumping.  People are responsible for it and so far as I am concerned they must be pursued with the full rigour of the law so as to clear the countryside of this poor attitude towards our wonderful environment which is recognised worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational process is vital if we are to approach this problem in a proper <Col N="3037" /> way.  Adults are watched by their children, so they will resist doing something which will offend them.  If children are brought up to understand that something is to be protected, preserved and looked after in a proper way they will not create pollution and will indicate to their parents, when they see pollution being created, not to do it.  It is very important that the civics and environmental studies on the old school curriculum should never be forgotten.  If I had my way I would have these subjects as a permanent feature on the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>In so far as giving extra money to local authorities is concerned I take Deputy Doyle's point.  In a strange way it might not always be necessary to provide extra resources to local authorities to implement a legislation like this.  At present there are almost 900 engineers and technicians of various grades working for the local authorities.  Many local authorities now have water laboratories and other types of laboratories.  When all that expertise is taken together it is not too much of a burden to put on the existing resources of local authorities to implement legislation which only means utilising the full strength of their existing technical services.  I do not think this would be too onerous on the local authorities. So far as I am concerned the legislation is there and they are going to have to implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>With the best will in the world I appreciate what the Minister has said about the hope and aspiration that we would not have to go down the road of directing control areas for smoke control. We would like to move in the direction of using smokeless fuels, proper fireplaces and so on.  Perhaps that is an altruistic motive but I think it is the right one to have.  Experience from other cities throughout Europe and in Belfast where there are smoke free zones has shown that the air is considerably better in those cities than it is in Dublin.  Smoke free zones were introduced in London during the mid and late fifties because people died as a result of the bad quality air.  The same obtains in other cities in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3038" /> It is impossible to expect that people will protect the environment.  Unfortunately this is not going to happen either for nationalistic motives, cost effectiveness or whatever other reason. People are going to pollute the environment be it in a manner to which the Minister referred through the leaving of wrecked cars around the countryside, littering or polluting the air and water.  The only way of counteracting this pollution is through direct law enforcement.  Given the examples of the air being cleared in other cities by creating smokeless zones, there is no other way forward.  If we hope that the vested interests who are providing and selling coal will conduct their business without any type of directive legislation then we are in a <i>status quo</i>.  We will be back to square one.  We will be told that we have nothing too much to worry about and that figures show that we are within EC levels.</P>
    <P>I hope that there will be some directive in relation to this before the year is out. I appeal to the Minister to place on his desk the measures and controls that are going to be set in train by the local authorities to correct the problem.  I know the local authorities are conscious of the problem being there.  However, being conscious of a problem is one thing but doing something about it is another.  The Minister for the Environment has the authority to direct the local authorities.  I see this as being part of the functions and responsibilities of the Minister.  I hope that local authorities would act in a manner in which we would all wish that they would act.  The local authority in Dublin acted perhaps against the best will and wishes of the vast majority of the citizens living in Dublin because of the decision they took on the Wood Quay site.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour this but if the Minister leaves this within the will of the local authorities to take action he could be sadly disappointed.  I would not wish that to be the case.</P>
    <P>From listening to his contributions on this debate I know that the Minister is firm in his resolve about this problem. Timely though it might be that smokeless <Col N="3039" /> fuels and special grates are becoming available we might fall into the trap of leaving this type of research to produce a cure to the problem.  Of course it will not produce a cure.  There is no question about this.  Action is being taken purely because of public consciousness from medical statements and by visual examination of the deterioration in our environment. This deterioration can now be seen if one looks down on the city from the Dublin Mountains.  Action is being sought by the people whose homes and property are deteriorating and depreciating as a direct result of the bad quality air in the city.</P>
    <P>In many cases offices are installing equipment to counteract the bad air in the city which is causing problems of tension, bad work posture and bad work ethics.  I appeal to the Minister to direct the local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister, with the best will in the world, is misreading the situation and a little cracking of the whip by taking this firm action in the context of this Bill would help enormously to set in train the results we wish.  The Minister should give them until the end of 1987, that is six months, to approve a plan for improvement or else declare a smokeless zone for Dublin. It has happened in other cities to great effect.  It would not impose hardship. People's health in the long term will be seriously damaged if the problem of pollution is not tackled.  Air quality is actually deteriorating and figures show it will get worse unless action is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the air quality management plan, it occurs to me that as the situation is deteriorating the least we can hope as a result of this Bill is that we hold pollution at its present level.  One of the benefits of drawing up an air quality management plan by a local authority would be that, for instance, further building which occurs, such as new housing estates, apartment buildings, new factories or industrial complexes, would have to be subject to this plan.  As I understand it, a plan would be drawn up and certain regulations would be made <Col N="3040" /> subsequent to that.  Without costing money, by requiring existing houses, flats or complexes to be converted, the least we can expect is that further building will not exacerbate the situation particularly in Dublin.  Encouragement should be given by way of regulations to builders to use other forms of heating than that which emits a lot of smoke.  We should consider using an air quality management plan to link up with planning, at least to hold air pollution at existing levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the commitment of the Minister and wish him well in his office.  As Deputy Brady suggested and as the Minister acknowledged in his last contribution, we have not alone a negative but an almost destructive attitude to our environment.  In that case there may be need for a plan.  The idea of a six months time limit within which local authorities would respond to the Minister is a good one and if the local authorities do not respond the Minister would have powers to compel them.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the health of our people and we know about bad health problems people in London suffered before the advent of smokeless zones there.  We are concerned to have a healthy nation without too much cost.  It would be cost-effective in the long term to have such regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has often talked about the value of tourism.  Our heritage is a great attraction to tourists.  We are now encountering a problem with our buildings and monuments which are being eroded and defaced because of pollution and the attempt to keep them clean is costing a huge amount of money.  Deputy Brady has already referred to the health and well-being of individuals working and living in those buildings.  Our heritage is being destroyed.  We are surrounded by faceless statues and monuments and soon we will have to put up plaques to remind us of the people they were meant to commemorate. Taking all these points into account, will the Minister seriously consider applying such statutory regulations or powers if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3041" /> I concur with Deputy Colley's suggestion that the minimum we can do is to introduce regulations that will allow no further deterioration to our environment, by prohibiting in new buildings the use of materials that cause pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brady, quite rightly, says that many other cities have taken the initiative in this, so why should we not do so.  That is the reason for the legislation before the House.  It is not being introduced to end up on the shelf. It is a matter for implementation.  If the local authorities cannot find it in their hearts to implement it, then executive power is given to me to take the initiative on their behalf if I have to, and I will.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy Brady where he says that control is only possible by law enforcement.  I would like to think there was another way.  Control by law is the last means of getting the desired result.  It would be a pity if we could not bring about the desired result through the educational process to which Deputy Brady referred or by developing the areas of research and development of new fuels or appliances.  In that way we might reach the targets we set ourselves without always having recourse to forcing people by law.  It is not the ideal way to do business and it is not the ideal way here. It always ends up by being done for a period, and then we slip back into the bad old ways.  If we have an educational process which brings people to recognise the right thing to do so that everybody pulls their weight in achieving the targets it will last and it will be less expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the implementation of this legislation, I will ask the local authorities what they propose to do.  Once the legislation is passed I will have an ongoing supervisory role.  Surely there will be enough dedicated local authority members to bring the matter up on a continuing basis, members who will press their executive to do something about it? If we fail to get the proper response, I have no doubt this will be the subject matter of some nice questions at the back end of this year when the smoke levels are rising again.  I do not expect these <Col N="3042" /> questions will be necessary because the local authorities involved are waiting to implement this legislation.  That is the message conveyed to me.  There is now a great public awareness of the value of a clean environment.  Nowadays it is talked about more often and there is great media coverage of the importance of a clean environment.  People are more aware of it.  There is great concern now among the people about the control of items and pollutants that are the cause of bad health in themselves and their families.  That is well and truly documented.  However people took it for granted and asked what we could do about it in the past, that is not so now.  People are not prepared to spend the rest of their lives coughing and having all kinds of illness brought down on them because of pollution when they recognise that there is a way of remedying it.  This is part of the remedy.</P>
    <P>People might think that the Minister should crack the whip and he will get a better response.  I did not have to crack the whip too hard.  Some of the people involved in the distribution of fuels in this city came in to see me recently.  I gave the opportunity on Second Stage for people to come and see me when I said that I was open to suggestions from all those who had an interest.  Not too many showed the interest but some of the big distributiors showed an interest, maybe because they had their own reasons, but it was not necessary for me to crack the whip at them.  They appreciated and supported the thrust of this legislation and all they were concerned they would at least make the point that we should try to identify the sources before the control area order was finally put in place.  That was reasonable because the coal distributors or whoever are not the only people in this city causing the serious emissions of smoke and SO 2.  Some very large industrial concerns are creating a very serious level of pollution in this city over and above the domestic users.  When I said that to the people who distribute these fuels, they more than readily gave their full support to trying to do something to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3043" /> Deputy Colley referred to applications made through local authorities for planning permission for new developments.  It is most proper that the technical officers would take notice of legislation like this in developing their schedule of conditions as applied to the developments for which they seek permission.  It is most proper that they do that and I expect that the authorities will do so.  We do not want to pass legislation to correct something later on if permission is granted on the other hand to elements who are going to increase the incidence further still.  I see it the other way round, that planning authorities would take due cognisance of the reason behind this and the need to correct what is already a crisis here in certain areas of the city.</P>
    <P>I take the point also in relation to the design of new housing.  It is much less expensive to have in place a suitable appliance in the domestic area from the point of view of design at the initial stages rather than a conversion later which invariably seeks support from the State, again by way of grant assistance.  There is a point to be taken there in regard to having this type of appliance available in any new local authority housing that we might be considering grant aiding or assisting by way of capital injection in the future.  I will bring that point to the notice of the powers that be in the design of those areas.</P>
    <P>At the first available opportunity, once this legislation is in place, we will be licensing new industrial plant that will be coming on stream.  Such plants will not be able to go into production without the licence, and I would expect that the licence will be gone into in some detail and will in effect give the overall control necessary to keep the emissions and the smoke levels at least at the level they are at now and lower by new measures to be taken subsequently, but certainly not increasing the levels that exist already. This legislation can go a long way towards that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes made a good point about the cost factor involved in all these things.  The control of emissions and the <Col N="3044" /> reduction of air pollution from smoke by putting money and resources into such areas must be preferable by far to subsequently having to put it into health services which are hyped up in their need for cash because we did not take the step first of controlling the basis for the type of illness that has been referred to.  Our health services might not cost quite so much if we had all the controls in place and spent some of the money in creating the environment in advance of the disease.</P>

      <P>Many new applications come in for industrial development which is grant assisted and aided by the State anyway, and these new controls are incorporated in the kind of plant they use.  The technical staff of the planning authorities would be mindful of that.  I see no difficulty there in so far as new plant is concerned.  We will be licensing those new plants anyway, so they cannot come into production unless they comply with the levels incorporated in the standards accepted by the authorities for their areas.  I see no conflict there.  We are going to make big strides in control in that respect.</P>

      <P>In relation to the air quality management plans, I do not believe that the planning authority in a local authority area would really take cognisance of standards set out for prevention of air pollution unless there is something that they can point to which indicates that for this area these are the standards that must prevail.  That is there.  I applaud the air quality management plan in this Bill.  If there is one in existence for a local authority then the planning authority can say, &ldquo;Pursuant to air quality management plan, section whatever, we refuse such planning permission on the basis that it does not comply&rdquo;.  I realise that with the best will in the world the planners and technical people will take into account certain things but they will not have the backing of a Bill or something like that in order to refuse planning permission.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the point of our not having planned enough in our society, I would prefer to see a structured plan adopted for an area that would deal with it properly and that it would be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is well made and I see the reason for it.  If I gave the impression that I was somehow minimising the need for these quality management plans I did not intend it that way.  I was putting it in context that it is not necessary to have that made and completed before you move to address the problems that already exist.  By all means have a control there.  When that control is in place the planning authority can put it into their schedules for the developments sought, but it will not stop the authorities from dealing with what <Col N="3046" /> Deputy Brady referred to as the crisis as he sees it now in an area in Dublin.  I see the whole thing going on in tandem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of this section a plan must contain objectives for the prevention or limitation of air pollution and for the preservation or the improvement of air quality.  Obviously there will be specific directions needed in regard to each area.  We are all aware from where the problem emanates in the capital city, the burning of bad fuels, non-swept chimneys and so on.  The kernel of the issue is law enforcement.  I am not in any way opposing the Minister when he says he will aspire to have local authorities bring about the requisite plans to improve air quality.  However, experience has shown that the only way forward in these respects is through direct law enforcement.  For example, people will not park their cars illegally because they will be fined for so doing.  Bearing human nature in mind it must be acknowledged that the law will be broken unless the penalty is severe and seen to be enforced.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to direct Dublin Corporation to bring forward a management plan for a smokeless zone for Dublin city by the end of this year. The Minister should let them come back to him with reasons that cannot be done, if that is contended.  It is being done in other cities.  There is no reason it cannot be done here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The special control area zone might constitute a very small area whereas an air quality management plan might be an entirely different matter or cover a larger area.  But, of course, they will run together or simultaneously.  For example, if one had a management plan in existence now one could base a special area control order on it.  While such management plan is being devised one could have a special control area zone.  I would expect a local authority to do so.  Of course once an Act is on the Statute Book one does not request a local authority &mdash; it is part of the law of the land &mdash; and <Col N="3047" /> they are supposed to comply with its provisions. I do not foresee any difficulty in that.  I think local authorities will comply with those provisions.</P>

      <P>This section has to do with emission limit values.  The provisions of this section will require, at the very least, that proper instruments are available for monitoring emission levels with regard to the control of pollution in given areas.  I am not so sure this equipment is available.  While I did not refer to a unit being available in the atmospheric pollution control section of Dublin Corporation it was pointed out to me there that they lack equipment for measuring other noxious gases in the atmosphere that contribute to air pollution, oxide being one.  There are other pollutants apart from sulphur dioxide and the smoke-suspended particles about which we spoke.  I should like assurance from the Minister that we have sufficient equipment to enable us carry out this task.  Unless we can monitor emission levels of poisionous gases and so on in parts of the capital city or elsewhere thoughout the country the provisions of this Bill will be inept.  It is important that we satisfy ourselves in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this, the Year of the Environment we might look to the EC, bearing in mind that we as a nation, are taking this year <Col N="3048" /> very seriously.  The provisions of this Bill will form an important part of our overall legislation.  We should point out that we are endeavouring to have these provisions implemented and ascertain whether we can be assisted by way of equipment needed urgently to monitor emission levels in various parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables the Minister to specify, by regulations, emission limit values.  An emission limit value is a concentration of a pollutant or pollutants in an emission from a plant and which during a specified period is not to be exceeded.  In contrast to air quality standards, emission limit values would represent a quantified control applying directly to the premises concerned.  Emission limit values have not yet been widely applied at EC level although the framework directive on combating air pollution from industrial plants allows for such standards.  A draft EC directive on reducing pollution from large combustion plants proposes Community emission limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and dust.  Clearly the power to set emission limit values may be required in the future to implement the relevant EC provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this section provide that different emission limit values may be set for different areas, different circumstances or different periods.  Emission limit values could be used to impart uniformity to the licensing system operated by local authorities.  They could also be used to replace controls now applicable under the Alkali, etc.  Works Regulation Act, 1906 in relation to certain industrial premises.  It is possible to have special stack monitoring equipment placed on these big emitters.  I would expect that, in the licensing of industrial plant, as far as emissions are concerned, it would be a requirement of the licence to have such stack monitoring equipment put in place.  I understand it is reasonably expensive.  But, if one is to get a proper reading and control, these are the kinds of requirements that will be applicable to <Col N="3049" /> the type of licence that will be granted to such major industrial concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the provisions of this section are concerned more with mointoring the source of pollution in the course of manufacture of some product.  I would be more concerned about emissions from a plant, because it is there one would determine the source of the pollution.  In some cases agricultural pollution can be a direct result of pollution in the air, causing damage to cattle or surrounding farmland, resulting from pollutants from a given chemical plant.  In the past Ireland was viewed by some European countries as lacking in the area of effective controls, as being easy to site industries in that might not be sited in other continental countries. We have lacked the regulations to cope with this problem.  Without naming firms that have been brought to court, in some cases unjustifiably but in others justifiably, my concern is that we have the proper equipment to enable us stand over the measurement of emissions from plants of this kind.  It is very difficult to measure particular chemicals that become enmeshed with others in the air but it can be done.  It does not necessitate outrageously expensive equipment and such equipment is available.  I want the Minister and his Department to be satisfied that we have the requisite equipment to carry out that task.</P>

In reply to Deputy Brady, this section is in contrast to section 50.  It dealt with the atmosphere in general whereas section 51 deals with matters called point sources, that is industrial emissions from particular plants and developments.  A case raised here earlier was Moneypoint.  There has been a lot of talk about the emission of SO 2 from that source.  There are stack monitors at Moneypoint and that gives the exact monitoring control which is required.  We are talking about the limits which are applicable to particular production processes.

      <P>I am inclined to believe the subject of emissions from vehicles should be dealt with under section 51. Section 53 deals specifically with the type of fuel which may be sold or used and also with the make-up of such fuel.  What I am concerned about are the buses and lorries that belch out fumes; they may be using fuel which may be all right but the condition of the vehicles causes the emission.  It does not seem that is dealt with under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  Section 51 deals with stationary plant.  The Deputy <Col N="3051" /> is talking about mobile sources.  They are dealt with under section 53.  It is important that they be segregated in order to have the right balance in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>My point concerns stationary plant and is about the burning of scrap in the centre of the city.  I expect this section will deal with the burning of lead which is a very deadly metal when it is burned.  As is known, lead pollution stays in the body and is an insidious poison.  It is never removed from the body.  Children are very susceptible to poisoning from lead and expectant mothers are prone to serious damage as a result of lead pollution.</P>
      <P>There is a hotch-potch kind of plant in the Ranelagh-Rathmines area which has been engaged in the open smelting of lead for many years now.  It is well known by anyone living in Dublin.  They have flouted the law.  They have no planning permission and yet they have been able to slip through the net of existing by-laws and avoid prosecution.  McGovern's scrapyard has caused immense problems and worry to people living in the area.</P>
      <P>It is practically impossible to monitor lead pollution.  You depend on the dust levels which settle in the surrounding areas and these can be washed away by the rain or with a bucket of water.  People can see the lead deposit on their window panes.  They have to close their windows even in this lovely warm weather which we are experiencing.  Will this section control such unscrupulous plants which carry out smelting in confined areas, whether it be flatland or residential areas?  They should either have to close their plant or relocate it elsewhere.  Will the legislation cover plant of that kind and not just the seeking of planning permission for new premises and new plant? Will it include those plants already in existence?</P>

      <P>In my part of county Dublin there was a battery burning operation for which a lot of air pollution arose. I am concerned that we take the steps necessary to allow us to deal with such <Col N="3052" /> abuses.  Following the enactment of this Bill will local authorities have personnel who are trained in the operation, reading and understanding of monitoring equipment? In such a technical area there will be a need for such personnel.  Does the Minister envisage some form of briefing, seminars and educational process in this regard?  It is very difficult for local authorities to have this type of technical expertise.  How do we envisage that this will be made available?  The onus should be on the operators to provide the equipment for the local authorities to check and monitor the functioning of an operation by way of read-outs, levels of safety and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Brady is adequately catered for in section 58 of the Bill.  He referred to smelting in very confined areas.  I hope that kind of activity is not taking place. It is certainly not taking place in the first location mentioned by the Deputy but whether it has been transferred to some other area I am not sure.  I see no hiatus between the introduction of this legislation and the 1985 regulations.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lawlor that there is need for specialised training for certain technicians or engineers of local authorities in order to deal properly with the monitoring equipment.  That would certainly be necessary.  The local authorities would either have to allow some of their technicians to get involved in a training process or they would have to contract for it to the IIRS or some other specialist body who deals with those matters.  I do not see any difficulty there.  There are almost 900 engineers working for local authorities and out of that, particularly in the numbers employed in the local authorities close to the city, there are bound to be a few who have a special interest in this matter and who would be more than happy to avail themselves of specialist training to deal with the equipment. I do not see this as a problem but specialists are needed in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very welcome section.  When this legislation was being framed I was concerned that it might not include the question of the regulation of the lead or the benzene content of petrol or the sulphur content of gas or other fuels.  This is critically important because we in Ireland are dragging our heels so far as the introduction of lead-free petrol is concerned.  It should be at least available as a choice but unfortunately it is not readily available.  I realise the commercial implications of the need to produce in the southern region petrol that has a higher lead content than would be desired.  I know the Minister has plans to phase out petrol with a lead content but the damage is being done.  We should set a date, say, the end of the year, to make it mandatory on garages to provide at least a choice between lead-free petrol and petrol with lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the vehicles coming into the country can be easily adapted to cope with lead-free petrol.  There is talk about the higher cost of lead-free petrol but I have grave doubts about that.  The charging for fuels, certainly in the Republic of Ireland, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of cuts as that can be made quickly in the cost of petrol.  The cost of fuel in this country is inordinately high.  Oil companies in particular, and who in the past have made vast profits from selling petrol, should realise the health and environmental implications of continuing to sell petrol with a lead content.  It is a little like cigarette smoking in a sense.  It is mandatory for those engaged in the sale of cigarettes to put a health warning on their product.  The very same should apply with regard to the sale of petrol and products that have a lead content. For example, many paints have a lead content, petrol has a lead content and even some cosmetics have lead content but products with a high lead content <Col N="3054" /> that is injurious to people's health should carry health warnings as should petrol with lead content.  In a confined space where there is a very high traffic count, fumes from petrol with a lead content can be very injurious to the health of the people living in that area.</P>
    <P>In areas of Dublin, particularly around the city quay area, the emissions of lead from cars in dense traffic were monitored and the lead pollution was found to be way above acceptable world health standards. It is disgraceful, given the medical evidence available to us at present, that this practice is allowed to continue.  It is outrageous that we in Ireland permit this to happen.  A changeover to lead-free petrol should be immediately set in train.</P>
    <P>In Australia, a vast open area, it is mandatory that a particular device which controls the emission of the quality of exhaust fumes going into the atmosphere is fitted to the exhaust of motor cars.  The Minister should investigate the possibility of introducing a similar device here.  This would be an ideal opportunity, when speaking about pollution from moving sources, for the Minister to investigate the possiblity of directing the manufacturers of vehicles to attach this device to exhausts.  It would not be an expensive item.  We cannot look constantly to the Government to provide money such as this to equip vehicles with these devices. The commercial firms involved should provide them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor stated that people with static plants should have the equipment on hand to read out the levels of pollution to the authorities when they arrive.  After all, if the VAT man arrives to a business you have to have the figures for him so why should the levels of air pollution not be available to the Department of the Environment?  That is a very good point and should be followed on.  The Minister would have an opportunity of investigating this possibility for motor cars and the result would be tremendous.</P>
    <P>In Tokyo, for example, it is mandatory to have cars fitted with gaseous recovery devices which reduce greatly the pollution from moving vehicles.  As a start, <Col N="3055" /> with all the evidence available to the Minister, a demand should be made for lead-free petrol in this country.  I remember 1982 when I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment the regulation had come in that we were going to reduce the lead in petrol within a year.  Now, five years later, our petrol is still leaded and this lead should be eliminated immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals mainly with emissions from stationary sources. Section 53 which concerns the regulation of fuel, however includes power to control fuel for mechanically propelled vehicles.  We already have made regulations under the European Communities Acts to implement EC standards on the lead content of petrol and the sulphur content of gas oil or diesel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, enables the Minister to make regulations in relation to the use of vehicles. The 1963 Regulations on the Construction, Equipment and Use of Mechanically Propelled Vehicle include provisions on emissions from vehicles. However, it should be noted that neither in Ireland nor in many other parts of the motorised world have road traffic controls by themselves been especially effective in achieving environmental objectives such as better air qualities. Consequently, at EC level and within other international environmental bodies, the emphasis is now on vehicle emission controls which will not principally depend on driver behaviour.  Limitation of vehicle emissions is now being approached primarily through controls on fuel inputs and on vehicle design and I am convinced that this is the most appropriate approach.  Section 53 will provide for environmental regulation of all vehicle fuels.  Measures are being negotiated at EC level to require cleaner vehicle engine technologies which, in our case, would be implemented through the type approval system.  I feel therefore that when all the current measures are fully implemented there will be an ample legislative base from which to control <Col N="3056" /> emissions and that further amendment of this Bill will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I am particularly keen to promote unleaded petrol.  This has been a gradual development in some EC countries.  It is an interesting point that all leaded petrol in Ireland observes the limit of 0.15 grammes of lead per litre.  That is the lowest level to which it is physically possible to reduce leaded petrol.  You cannot do better.  It is encumbent on us to have a reasonable network of filling stations selling unleaded petrol and to have our lead content reduced to 0.15 grammes by 1989, but we have already done that.  We have done a lot better than some of our neighbours.  We have met the deadline long before 1989.  The only other deadline we have to reach in 1989 is that we must have a reasonable spread of forecourts selling unleaded petrol.  I would like to see this spread develop on the major national primary routes and near the ports because many tourists drive cars which can only use unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>It is in our own best interest to take this step and it will be forced on us anyway by the improved technology of vehicle development.  I believe that in not too many years only vehicles which use unleaded petrol will be available.  We are dependent on vehicles which have been developed in the EC but our European partners are very conscious of the environment, particularly the Scandinavians who have very high standards and have made great strides in the development of technology for engine development.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are meeting the EC requirement so far as the lowest possible level of lead in petrol can be achieved&mdash; 0.15 grammes of lead per litre.  We have reached this target in advance of the time schedule and I am satisfied that it will be possible to buy unleaded petrol throughout the country.</P>

Having looked at this section, at section 51 and at the statutory instrument I referred to earlier, there seems to be a loophole where the emissions from vehicles already in existence, for instance, buses and lorries are not covered.  I appreciate that new vehicles will take into account the desirability of having very low emissions of noxious substances but at the moment we do not control the vehicles which are already on the road and I do not see anything in this Bill which will provide for these vehicles.</P>

I ask the Minister to address this problem in the context of this Bill because I do not see how it can be dealt with under this section which deals with the fuels in a car and regulations about the sale and distribution of those fuels, but there are no regulations dealing with combustion. I know this is a difficult area to deal with. What can we do?  Are we to take cars off the streets?  Who will do this?  Vehicles using unleaded petrol are one of the greatest pollutants in our cities at the moment.</P>

      <P>Recognising that the Minister prefers to encourage rather than crack the whip and adding to what Deputy Colley said about the difficulty and the cost of getting people to change over to vehicles using unleaded fuel, may I suggest that one way would be to actively encourage the sale of vehicles which have been converted to non-leaded petrol, plus selling unleaded petrol at a lower rate?  To encourage people to have <Col N="3058" /> their engines converted to use unleaded petrol &mdash; I do not know if this would be very expensive &mdash; and to buy new vehicles which would use unleaded petrol only, would it be possible to reduce the Government tax?  I know the collection of taxes is a very sensitive issue but this might encourage people to change to unleaded petrol in their old or new vehicles.</P>

      <P>Could our refinery be brought into this discussion?  There could be a weighted advantage that the 30 per cent of the fuel they provide to the multinationals should be lead free.  If necessary perhaps we could force the oil companies to take more lead-free products, maybe at a financial gain.  It is generally accepted that lead-free petrol will be the order of the day in future.  It is all to do with Government and their determination to make the oil companies bring it forward.  If the product is made available, the Government must do something to ensure that it is used.  If our own refinery does not produce lead-free petrol we are contradictory in our intent in that regard.</P>

      <P>Interestingly, all stations sell low-lead petrol but only three of them sell unleaded petrol.

      <P>They are supposed to have it done when they go for the annual check.  Of course, the following day it could be as bad again.  However, if the check indicates that there is a fault it is attended to.  We are awaiting the obsolescence of existing vehicle stock and for new technology to be brought in.  We cannot do much about that because we do not manufacture the new technology but we can control the type of petrol going into existing cars.  An interesting <Col N="3059" /> statistic is that about one-third of all motor cars running in Ireland could use unleaded petrol.  They are cars of a far eastern design and their technology in engine development is more advanced than that of other countries.  Other cars could not run on this petrol even if it was available.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lawlor raised an interesting point in regard to the Whitegate refinery. It has not the capacity at present to produce unleaded petrol as it does not have a cracking unit installed but I understand that they are actively considering the need which will exist in a short time to provide unleaded petrol.  Despite the fact that it is an old plant it is possible to have certain modifications carried out which will enable the refinery to produce unleaded petrol.  As we move towards 1989 and more forecourts are providing unleaded petrol, cars coming in from abroad will only work on this kind of petrol.  Obviously, whether we have to import it or if it is made in Whitegate, we will have to provide it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a point earlier on to which the Minister omitted to refer. I said that there were devices available which can be fitted to cars, including those not of the most modern manufacture, which comply with the regulations in the Far East to which the Minister referred.  These devices go a very long way towards bringing them within EC regulations and dramatically improve the control of exhaust emissions. Encouragement could be given to vehicle owners to fit these devices.  The Minister said that there were regulations under the Traffic Acts which control emissions and he also said that licences would not be issued unless vehicles complied with them.  Does the Minister know the number of prosecutions which have been issued for a breach of regulations of this kind in Dublin city?  I could not get any facts or figures from local authorities when I inquired but perhaps this information is now available.  The Minister said that 1,500 gallons of fuel were wasted in one traffic jam.  One must also consider the number of hours lost by people trying to get to work.  In Switzerland and America, for example, you must turn your engine off at traffic lights if the signal is red.  That cuts down an immense amount of pollution from moving vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings in so far as appliances for lessening emissions from vehicles is concerned, the kind of appliance to which <Col N="3061" /> Deputy Brady referred is a catalytic converter. To fit a heavy vehicle with such a device would cost from £500 to £700 and I do not have to say what that would cost for one million vehicles.  They can only run on unleaded petrol which, unfortunately, is not yet available.  Which should come first?  I do not think that such devices are feasible.  Other types of appliances have been tried.  I saw one tried on a car a few years ago which reduced emissions and achieved better economy from the point of view of petrol used.  However, it did not take off and was not a success for some reason.  It did not succeed in Europe, either.  A company I was aware of were interested in developing the appliance, but it failed in its intent.</P>
      <P>I regret the figure for the number of prosecutions under the Road Traffic Acts is not available to me.  It is not broken down in the Garda Commissioner's report but is included with a whole range of other offences which are regarded as not being of major consequence.  In effect, it is not realistic to talk about converters at this stage because of the cost impact on the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning permission would <Col N="3062" /> have been granted for certain pieces of plant from which there would be serious emissions.  This legislation deals with the licensing of such plants.  This goes beyond the planning process in so far as it is an advance on it.  It is stated specifically that many planning permissions embody conditions regarding emissions of air pollutants and where an existing plant comes within the licensing system of this Bill it is essential that the licence conditions alone prevail.  I see this as an advance on what the Deputy has been referring to on this and the previous occasion.</P>

      <P>Under section 56 (1) are the local authorities going to open to financial expense?  It is mentioned that &ldquo;any conditions attached to that permission shall, in so far as they relate in any way to air pollution, cease to have effect&rdquo;.  We then come to the licensing, which the Minister quite rightly identified as a much better procedure.  In the transition and with the issuing of the licences and the likely financial burden, will we find our courts clogged up with companies legally doing battle on the basis that they were granted permission with conditions that dealt with this issue?  Can we make it retrospective that the licensing will not expose local authorities to compensation claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation cannot be retrospective; that would not be right. I have never believed in retrospective legislation.  This is the new order of <Col N="3063" /> things, the new legislative process that will apply henceforth.  I take it that in due course if a management plan is prepared &mdash; or even if it is not &mdash; if the area control order is put in place and certain encouragements are put on those who are the sources of the pollution, so be it. We cannot impose anything from this legislation on something which has taken place before this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions cease to have effect; therefore, we are retrospectively dealing with planning permissions granted with conditions.  Can the said company endeavour to take a case against the local authority if we insist on licensing, when the authority granted permission with conditions which were supposed to deal with the issue of pollution which we know is not effectively being dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any conflict.  They would not be falling foul of the Planning Act under which they got permission.  They would be falling foul of this legislation if a licence situation had applied to them because of this legislative process.  Only in those circumstances could they be found liable to do anything, so they would not need to have recourse to a court.  I do not see any conflict there. Has the Deputy a particular case in point he would like to put?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present planning permissions, pollution is taking place, even though there are conditions under which we hoped pollution would not take place.  If that company must take out a licence and incur capital cost in equipment to qualify for a licence and there is a financial burdern involved, because the local authority granted them permission will they be able to argue the case <i>visà-vis</i> exposure to that financial cost in complying with the requirement to obtain a licence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning Acts only give rights under the Planning Acts.  They do not give rights to do things other than those laid down in the schedule of conditions. This is a new legislative process entirely and will be applied to plants after they have been licensed.  It will not create a difficulty for those people about whom the Deputy is concerned.  I can well see that once a plant is licensed it must be expected to comply with the regulations as laid down in the new process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned in case the companies have recourse to the local authority who originally granted them permission.  It says under section 56 (1) that, &ldquo;those conditions will cease to have effect&rdquo;.  If in a Bill passing through this House we are taking conditions out of an existing planning permission, will we be exposing the local authority to costs? Tragically for this country and the taxpayer we have found when our courts begin interpreting the words of the Houses of the Oireachtas it can end up very costly.  The courts have been finding far too often against the common good. I am concerned in case Dublin County Council find themselves being brought to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point the Deputy is getting at.  This is a new legislative process starting as and when it becomes law.  If a particular plant gets a licence to control the emissions under this legislation and if that requires the plant operator to instal new emission control systems or whatever, he will just have to do it.  This Bill becomes law on a particular date and on that day it applies to the licence granted.  There is no question of any problem for the local authority which originally granted the permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.  This is a short Bill.  I would like to remind the House that two weeks ago I raised on the Order of Business the national concern for the preservation of the remaining oak woods at Coolattin in County Wicklow. On that occasion I reminded the Taoiseach that he had shown his concern by visiting the area and seeing for himself the destruction that had taken place there and the probable continuation of that destruction if action was not taken urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to my request for Government time to debate the Labour Bill, the Taoiseach gave assurances to the House that actions he was considering would meet the needs of the occasion.  I pointed out to the Taoiseach that there was a need for urgent action by the Government to preserve one of the last areas of oak woodlands in the country.  The appropriate action which I suggested on that occasion was legislation which is embodied in the short Bill which I have just proposed and which is in the name of the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring.  The Taoiseach assured the House that the Government, the appropriate Department and Wicklow County Council were actively investigating the problem. He was confident that the initiatives <Col N="3066" /> which he had taken would be adequate to ensure that the woodlands would be preserved.  What has been done by him up to now is far from adequate.  It is now more urgent than ever that this House act in relation to these woodlands.  I proposed this Bill in an effort to put in place the only adequate response to the situation.</P>
    <P>It might be useful to look back briefly at how this problem has developed.  The history of the Fitzwilliam estate is a familiar one.  It is a pattern that has occurred throughout Ireland down through the centuries.  This Anglo-Norman family received large tracts of land after the Norman invasion.  Most of County Wicklow was granted to them and parts of the city of Dublin bear their name today. Everybody is familiar with the name Fitzwilliam.</P>
    <P>For centuries they farmed the land in County Wicklow.  They collected ground rents.  They were the ground landlords of many of the towns and villages in Wicklow. That procedure continued right up to the fifties.  They carried on extensive cultivation of forestry.  The oak forests which they owned were the raw material which went into many constructions in Great Britain.  Most notable of these constructions are the House of Commons and St. Paul's Cathedral.  The oak trees were used also in the building and construction of many of the merchant and fighting ships during the dominance of Britain of the seas around the world.</P>
    <P>In latter decades the cultivation and commercial operation of the estate by comparison with operations of other estates of that class was very well managed. The husbandry of the estate ensured that planting and replanting was done on both a highly aesthetic and commercially sound basis so that by the thirties and forties the Fitzwilliam estate was a noted area of national beauty and high amenity.</P>

      <P>My interest in Coolattin did not start with the last general election; it started long before that and I intend to let the Deputy know that and to answer some of the stuff he is responsible for putting in some of the national dailies.  In any event I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to continue with my remarks.  I am giving the background to those both in the House and outside who are interested in wishing to know how this situation arose.  It takes in the terms of not just one Government but several Governments since the sixties.</P>
      <P>As a result of family bereavements and death duties the estate was brought to a crisis point in the sixties and seventies.  It was known that surviving members of the family were no longer anxious to continue to live on and operate the estate which by that time had been considerably reduced in size down to 3,000 acres which mainly consisted of farmland and woodlands. There was considerable local interest in the sale of the estate during the seventies.  It was considered that local as well as national interests would be best served if the estate was acquired by the Land Commission and the property divided among those who would meet the regulations and conditions for that division. It was also considered that the preservation of the woodlands for amenity purposes would be of great benefit to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When County Wicklow was a threeseat constituency it almost always produced one Fine Gael one Fianna Fáil and one Labour representative.  At that time <Col N="3068" /> all representatives made the usual representations to various Ministers.  We led deputations and made written representations at that time.  Unfortunately that opportunity was lost and the property was sold on 15 August 1977 to Brendan Cadogan and Mr. Patrick Tatten. That section of the estate which interests us here today, namely the woodlands, was sold for £300,000 to those same gentlemen. Subsequently the Land Commission bought 370 acres of the estate for £800,000 approximately.  The area of woodland which Messrs.  Tatten and Cadogan bought was bought for £300,000 at the time and it is there that the real mistake was made.  Money was not particularly tight then, though I suppose it is tight at any stage for a Government. It was sad that on that occasion when the opportunity arose for the Land Commission, it was not availed of.  The felling of mature oaks commenced shortly after that sale and there was not a great deal of shock and concern at the time.  As a TD for Wicklow and as a member of Wicklow County Council I put down a motion on 16 January 1978 asking that a tree preservation order be placed on all woods in that area.  That was considered by the council.  They asked for an investigation by An Foras Forbartha.  That examination took some time, as it generally does on those occasions and later on in that year on 31 October 1978 I signed 30 tree preservation orders for the whole area of the woods comprising the Coolattin estate in the possession of Messrs.  Cadogan and Tatten.  I can look back to 1978 as an individual who made the best attempt with the legislation available to preserve the woodlands that comprised the estate of Coolattin.  I am sorry that the legislation which was available to us then is the same today and under it nothing can be done to prevent the continuing destruction of the woodlands.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House of what was involved.  The main woodlands are called Brow Wood, consisting of 6.7 hectares, Mill Wood consisting of four hectares, Quills Wood another six hectares, <Col N="3069" /> Drumgall Wood, consisting of 4.75 hectares and Tomnafinnogue Wood consisting of 66.5 hectares.  Almost the entire area of these woods, that is Brow Wood, Mill Wood, Quills Wood, Drumgall Wood and Shuttles Wood have disappeared. All that remains now is gaping holes in the landscape.  Some planting has taken place but since the area consisted of mature oak timber, the type of planting that has replaced it, mainly of quick growing timber, will not replace the majestic oaks which were there.  It would take at least 100 years to rehabilitate the area.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for the Environment I altered the regulations in regard to CPOs or tree preservation orders from a simple consent to one where the applicant would have full planning permission, with all the checks and balances that that entails before a felling could take place.  The public would then be able to intervene and raise objections as under any other planning application.  This at least slowed up the process of felling and made applications for further planning permissions and felling permissions much slower.  I am well aware from a period in office as Minister for the Environment and later as Minister for Forestry that legislation is totally inadequate to both these areas.  Certainly it is not adequate to stop the destruction of our heritage in the form of woodlands.  Individuals and groups of concerned people such as the Coolattin Woods Action Committee have demanded action from politicians and they deserve a response.  The last remaining woodland, the largest one, Tomnafinnogue Wood consisting of 66.5 hectares is now undoubtedly threatened. On 26 March 1987 an application for the selective felling of this wood was delivered to Wicklow County Council.  On 19 May the county manager made an order for the selective felling and extraction of trees on the 66.5 hectares of that wood subject to certain conditions.  I have a copy of the grant of consent which was then given to the owners now called Bridgefarm Company Ltd. run by Mr. Shanley and Mr. Tatten.  It says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3070" /> In pursuance of the powers conferred upon them by the above mentioned Acts, and T.P.O. No. 3282/78, and in relation to the application received by the Council on the 26th day of March, 1987 (reference No. in register 2963/87) Wicklow County Council have by order dated 19th May, 1987 granted a consent for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Selective felling and extraction of trees on 66.50 hectares at Tomnafinnogue, Ballykelly, Ballyraheen and Coolattin Park Townland, Shillelagh</P>

    <P>The county manager in Wicklow, under the powers granted to him by the Planning Acts has endeavoured to reduce the amount of felling in this area and to have the felling done in such a way that bands of trees about 15 metres deep would remain to blot out and cover up the areas that were cleared and will stop the visual problem that would arise on having a clear felling system.  But the problem about that is that a wood comprising of 2,300 trees, mainly oak is covered by this planning application over a period which has been set down in the schedule to the commission.  Over the next ten years there will only be 700 mature trees left.  That is where the concern of so many people voiced in letters to the county council and by organisations and public representatives from all sides has been brought to bear not only on the county council but on the Government.  I was delighted to see the interest of the Taoiseach &mdash; I was sorry he could not have remained for the debate &mdash; in coming to Wicklow and seeing the position there for himself.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not remain because of certain hypocrisy on the part of the man who signed orders for the extraction of those woods.  This is a potted variation of history.  The Deputy has ignored that.</P>

      <P>I signed no order whatsoever for the abstraction.  Under the Acts as stated, under the legislation which is there at the moment nothing else could have been done during that time. I am prepared to listen quietly to Deputy Roche telling me how it can be done, though I have a solution I am prepared to put forward.  There is a certain tetchiness about the Deputy's approach because he feels that something that has been put forward here today might solve a problem in Wicklow.  He should be generous enough to acknowledge that some of us are trying to do something about it, rather than taking advantage of it, as he has done with some of his friends in <i>The Irish Times</i> or elsewhere, to condemn me or anybody else.  My party at least have endeavoured to do something about the problem in putting forward a solution here tonight.  We will listen to what the Minister has to say about our proposal.  I hope he can respond positively.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's visit to Wicklow and his interest in it, but up to now the Government's response to this problem has been to propose a special amenity area order for Tomnafinnogue Wood.  Deputy Roche, like me, is a member of Wicklow County Council and he receives the same correspondence that I receive from the council.  In a letter dated 13 May to the Chairman and each member of Wicklow County Council the acting county secretary, Mr. Ultan McCabe, said, and I quote it because it is important judging from what has been said from the Government benches in this debate without waiting for the opportunity perhaps to say it in their own time:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Re application for consent to fell trees covered by Tree Preservation Order in Tomnafinnogue Wood.  Particulars of the applications made for consent to fell the above trees have already been circulated to members of the Council but since then a considerable number of objections have been received (copies of which are enclosed for your information).  In addition, in the meantime, a draft <Col N="3072" /> Tomnafinnogue Wood Special Amenity Area Order has been drafted in the Department of the Environment and a copy of this document together with a map of the area to which it relates is also attached, herewith, for your information.</P>
    <P>Section 42 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provides that when it appears to the planning authority that by reason of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  its outstanding natural beauty,</P>
    <P>(b)  its special recreational value, or</P>
    <P>(c)  a need for nature conservation, an area should be declared under this section to be an area of special amenity, they may by order do so and the order may state the objective of the planning authority in relation to the preservation or enhancement of the character or special features of the area including objectives for the prevention or limitation of development in the area.</P>
    <P>The making of an Order under this section is a reserved function.  The procedures for making such an order are as follows; Planning Authorities are required to give public notice in newspapers circulated in the area indicating where a copy of the Order can be seen during office hours and giving a period of not less than a month for objections. The Order has to be confirmed by the Minister for the Environment and if there are objections a local public enquiry must be held.  When the Order is confirmed it has to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for ratification.  The matter has been placed on the agenda for consideration having regard to the considerable public interest in the application for consent to fell the wood.</P>
    <P>It was agreed at a previous meeting that the entire matter of Tomafinnogue Wood would be brought back before the members of the Council prior to the Manager taking a decision.  In this regard it has been recommended to the Manager that consent should be granted subject to conditions requiring replanting with oak for the application <Col N="3073" /> in which it is proposed to leave five bands of trees across the contours of the wood in mitigation of the detrimental effect felling would have on the amenity of the area.  The other applications which are for clear felling of the same site are recommended for refusal.  The decisions in relation to these four applications should not involve the Council in any compensation claim.  The latest date for the Manager to take a decision is the 22nd May, 1987, and in the meantime, all the options will continue to be examined particularly those that don't give rise to compensation.  It will be noted that the decision will have to be made long before a Special Amenity Area Order could be made.  Nonetheless, it is considered appropriate that the members should consider the proposal to make a Special Amenity Area Order having regard to all the circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>Now follows the final and most important paragraph:</P>
    <P>The specific legal advice available to the Council is that even if the Special Amenity Area Orders were in force before the applications have to be decided the Council would still be liable for compensation.</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the problem.  Under the 1963 Act as it stands compensation can be claimed and since this is a national problem, not one for Wicklow County Council, it would appear that all we have seen as a result of the involvement by the Government is transference of the responsibility for compensation from central Government to the local authority. The acting county secretary makes that abundantly clear in his letter to the members of the council.</P>
    <P>At our recent meeting to deal with estimates we had our service charges increased by 100 per cent to £100 and the commercial rate increased by 9 per cent. Wicklow County Council have large overdrafts and when the Fianna Fáil Party rushed through the estimates &mdash; Deputy Roche was there and he knows &mdash; some members of that party were not <Col N="3074" /> satisfied with the decision taken.  Had they not been so hasty they would have had a better result in the estimates on behalf of their constituents.  This council cannot pay compensation to Mr. Tatten, to Bridgefarm or to whoever now are owners under the name of that company or to anybody else.  Therefore, a transfer from the Department of the Environment, as the matter is that Department's responsibility, to the local authority is not the answer to this problem.  This is a national problem that requires a response which would cover the whole country and not just one area where there is now undoubtedly a very serious problem for the environment.</P>
    <P>That is why we in the Labour Party put down this Bill for consideration over six weeks ago.  That is why we asked the Government for time to consider it.  We hope there will be a positive response.</P>
    <P>The principal provision of our planning board which is directed to the protection and preservation of trees is section 45 of the 1963 Act.  Under that section planning authorities have the power to make tree preservation orders which prevent the cutting down of trees unless the local authority give consent.  However, where a local authority refuse to give consent to the cutting down of trees a person who has suffered damage as a result can claim compensation in respect of that damage. Generally speaking where trees comprising woodlands are concerned local authorities can avoid paying compensation only by allowing the felling of trees without conditions or by attaching conditions relating to the replanting.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of our Bill will remove this loophole by excluding a right to compensation where a tree preservation order declares that trees comprising woodlands are of special amenity or recreational value, of special interest, of outstanding natural beauty or are part of or comprise any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest.  There will be a right of appeal to the planning board and a right to compensation but only in certain circumstances which are set out in the Bill.  Basically there would <Col N="3075" /> be no right to compensation if the planning board decide that the trees or woodlands may not be extracted for reasons relating to amenity value, special interest, natural beauty or age of the trees in question, or if it is in the best interests of the management of the environment that they be preserved.</P>
    <P>In answer to questions about the woods recently the Taoiseach said he was examining ways of protecting them.  I believe that the provisions of this Bill would meet that objective.  I look forward to the co-operation of the Government in securing its urgent passage.</P>
    <P>We do not insist that we have a monopoly of wisdom in this matter.  There may very well be other Deputies on all sides of the House with suggestions for its improvement.  We shall take on board any such suggestions.  Of course the best way to co-operate is to agree to its Second Reading and to make appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.  I have heard it suggested that the Government may oppose the Bill on the grounds of its being unconstitutional.  I find that difficult to understand and accept.  In drafting this Bill we sought legal advice from the Labour lawyers group and were satisfied that it is not unconstitutional.  If it were found to be unconstitutional then it would raise a serious question about the Planning Act of 1963 since its provisions were followed faithfully in the drafting of this Bill.  Even if there are some legal or technical problems of which we are not aware, I hope the Minister will respond in a positive, rational way, by introducing whatever amendments his legal advisers tell him are necessary, when I can assure him that he will find us very constructive in attitude.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we take action now.  If we do not we shall lose one of the oldest and finest oak woods in all of Europe. This Bill constitutes our response to a particular problem.  We have examined the answer the Government have advanced over the past few weeks.  We are aware that the county manager has now given consent for the felling of trees, with conditions, covering a period of ten <Col N="3076" /> years.  That consent will mean that 2,300 trees standing at present will be reduced to 700 when the felling programme has been completed over the ten-year period. That does not constitute an adequate response to the problem.  That is why we, on this side of the House, and my party in particular, have brought this Bill before the House as a matter of urgency. We are told by experts it is not unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I know that money is scarce and that the compensatory provisions of the 1963 Planning Act may mean that some compensation would arise had we not introduced this Bill.  We are asking the Government to take this Bill on board and, if they foresee problems, to amend or improve it.  We are not asking that they simply say this evening: &ldquo;Your Bill is not good enough, it is unconstitutional&rdquo;, or give some other reason. We must have Government co-operation in this matter because no other response will save the Coolattin Woods.  Since becoming a Member of this House for the Wicklow constituency I have initiated proposals on many occasions in an endeavour to save the Coolattin Woods. Nevertheless, I do not mind endeavouring to save what remains at this late hour in the hope that we will have the co-operation of the whole House, rather than any criticism of me &mdash; a member of Wicklow County Council since 1969 &mdash; pursuing relevant legislative action.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept the serious problem we have in County Wicklow, which is acknowledged not only here but beyond this country.  Deputies, members of Wicklow County Council, will be aware of the number of letters and objections that have flowed into their offices in the knowledge that these woods might be totally or partially destroyed in ensuing years.  There have been objections raised by groups like An Óige, the ICA, Bord Fáilte, other individuals, university lecturers, graduates, students, people representing all walks of life, I am seeking the co-operation and generosity of this House and the Government in meeting the needs of this situation.  If we cannot have that united&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend and extend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and, according to its long title, is intended to make provision, in the interests of the common good, for the better preservation and protection of trees and woodlands of special recreational or amenity value, or of outstanding natural beauty.  I am sure that all of us in this House would wish, if it were possible to do so, to support a Bill which would achieve these broad objectives. However, the House must consider the individual provisions of the Bill, and their effects, before deciding whether it can adopt the approach proposed, I propose, therefore, before setting out the Government's attitude to the Bill, to spell out my understanding of the specific provisions it contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill would amend section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, by adding a new paragraph to subsection (2).  While it appears to me that some words have been omitted from the proposed new paragraph, the intention is quite clear, that is, that no compensation will be payable where a consent to fell <Col N="3078" /> woodland trees is refused, or granted subject to conditions, under a tree preservation order which declares that the trees are of special amenity or recreational value, of special interest, of outstanding natural beauty, or are part of or comprise any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest.  In other words, section 2 would, in many cases, abolish the right to compensation which exists under present law when a person can show that he has suffered damage in consequence of a refusal of consent, or a conditional consent, to fell trees which are comprised in woodlands.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is a fairly straightforward provision.  It proposes to insert a new section in the 1963 Act so as to require planning authorities to publish, in a daily newspaper and in a local newspaper, notice of every decision made by them on an application for consent to the felling of trees to which a tree preservation order relates.</P>
    <P>The main objective of section 4 is to provide for an appeal to An Bord Pleanála by any interested person against a decision by a planning authority on an application for consent to the felling of trees to which a tree preservation order relates.  The section goes on to specify criteria which must be taken into account by the board in dealing with such an appeal and it spells out the procedural provisions which would apply.  In addition, the section would expressly authorise the board to attach any conditions they think proper to their decision and, in particular, to attach to their decision all or any of the conditions listed in section 4 (7).  These include conditions for regulating the development or use of adjoining or adjacent land which is under the control of the applicant for the consent, conditions for requiring the planting of trees or the carrying out of landscaping, conditions for requiring the provision of open spaces or the carrying out of works such as the provision of roads, car parks, sewers, drains or the like, and so on.  Under the section, the power to attach conditions of this kind would apply only to An Bord Pleanála.  The planning authority which would, of course, continue <Col N="3079" /> to be required to deal with all applications in the first instance, would have no corresponding powers.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the compensation provisions which would apply where decisions are made by An Bord Pleanála on appeals to it under section 4.  It provides, in subsection (1) that if a felling consent is refused by the board or granted subject to conditions, any person whose interest in the land is reduced will be entitled to be paid by the planning authority, by way of compensation the amount of the reduction in value together with compensation for any damage suffered by him in a trade or business carried out on the relevant lands.  This formula for assessing compensation appears to be based on section 55 of the 1963 Act, which deals with cases where permission for development is refused or granted subject to conditions, rather than on the formula provided for in section 45 (2) of the 1963 Act which at present applies in relation to tree felling consents.  However, subsection (2) of section 5 goes on to provide that no compensation will be payable in respect of a decision made by the board where the reasons for the decision fall within one or more of the six following paragraphs.  The effect would be that no compensation would be payable where An Bord Pleanála decided that all or any of the following situations applied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  that the trees concerned, whether or not comprised in woodlands, are of special amenity value or special interest,</P>
    <P>(2)  that the trees or woodlands are of outstanding natural beauty or importance, which it is in the interests of the common good to conserve,</P>
    <P>(3)  that the trees or woodlands are part of, or comprise, any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest,</P>
    <P>(4)  that the application for consent to fell trees or woodlands is premature, having regard to the age and state of <Col N="3080" /> maturity of the trees or any surrounding, adjoining or adjacent trees or woodlands,</P>
    <P>(5)  that having regard to the type, nature and age of the trees or woodlands, and the extent, state or condition of such trees or woodlands throughout the State, the trees or woodlands to which the application relates constitute a unique and special feature of the natural environment which, in the national interest, ought to be conserved for the common good, or</P>
    <P>(6)  that having regard to the extent to which trees or woodlands in the vicinity have already been cut down, it is in the best interests of the proper management, protection and preservation of the environment of the area that the trees or woodlands to which the application relates should not be felled.</P>
    <P>In all or any of the circumstances which I have just described, no compensation would be payable under section 5 where the decision to refuse felling consent, or to attach conditions to such a consent, was made by An Bord Pleanála.  Planning authorities themselves would, however, still be open to claims for compensation where the decision was made at local level and not appealed.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the essential provisions of the Bill as I see them.  I fully appreciate the reasons why a Bill of this kind should be contemplated and moved at the present time.  Ireland possesses a unique inheritance of scenic, ecological and environmental resources.  It is vital that this heritage should be preserved for the benefit of this and succeeding generations.  Moreover, our natural heritage is one of the main foundations on which our tourist industry is based and it must be protected for this reason.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written in recent times about the decline of our broadleaved woodlands which today cover only a very small proportion of the land area of our country.  In addition to their commercial significance, these <Col N="3081" /> woodlands make an enormous contribution to the landscape quality of our countryside.  They are an essential element in many of our areas of outstanding natural beauty, they provide valuable shelter in the countryside and play an important part in nature conservation. There is growing awareness that many of our remaining broadleaved woodlands are vulnerable and tree preservation orders have been made by local authorities to protect them, in a number of cases.  The House is aware, however, of the difficulties which exist in achieving preservation objectives of this kind.  This is unfortunate, in view of the importance of preserving the amenity of our countryside and the significance of trees and woodlands for amenity and recreation generally.  The fact that there has been very little private planting of broadleaved trees in recent years adds to the importance of preserving, as far as possible, existing trees and woodlands of this kind. For these reasons, I find myself very much in sympathy with the general objectives of the present Bill.  However, as I said at the outset, we must examine the effects of the individual provisions of the Bill before deciding whether it can have the support of this House.</P>
    <P>Any proposals to amend the law in relation to the compensation provisions of the Planning Acts must inevitably, be considered against the background of the provisions in the Constitution relating to property rights.  The provisions in question are to be found in Article 40, paragraph (3) and in Article 43 of the constitution.  These Articles have given rise to a significant body of case law in recent years and their interpretation and application in particular kinds of situations is a matter of great complexity.</P>
    <P>I have sought the advice of the Attorney General on the question of whether the provisions of the Bill are consistent with the relevant Articles of the Constitution.  I have to tell the House that the Attorney General has advised that the Bill would not withstand a challenge on constitutional grounds.  In his view, legislation which would amend the <Col N="3082" /> Planning Acts so as to abolish compensation in the event of a refusal of consent to fell woodland trees would be found unconstitutional.  In view of this advice, I have no option but to oppose the present Bill because, as the House is aware, Article 15, paragraph 4 of the Constitution, provides that the Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is, in any respect, repugnant to the Constitution or any provision of it.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which has arisen for planning authorities because of the compensation provisions which at present apply in relation to consents for tree felling are paralleled by other problems which arise where permission for development is refused, or granted subject to conditions.  As the House is aware, large compensation claims can be made against planning authorities, from time to time and while the total amount paid out by way of compensation is still relatively small, there is no doubt but that the freedom of action of the planning authorities is constrained by reason of the compensation liabilities which can be incurred.  For these reasons, the Government accept that there is a need for a general review of the compensation provisions of the Planning Acts and we intend that this review will be carried out as quickly as possible.  Some proposals in this regard have already been included in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and these, together with other possible approaches, are being studied by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  The objective will be to bring forward as soon as possible a package of proposals which will strengthen, as much as possible, the position of planning authorities in dealing with planning applications generally.  I can assure the House that the desirability of reinforcing the position of planning authorities in dealing with applications for tree felling consents will be given special attention in the course of the review and that all possible approaches to the problem which exists at present will be fully explored.</P>
    <P>I accept, also, that there is a need for a review of other aspects of the law in <Col N="3083" /> relation to the preservation of trees and woodlands.  However, it is important that the provisions of the Planning Acts and those of the Forestry Acts should be considered together with a view to devising the best possible combination of legislative and administrative measures for dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I intend to establish a special working group, with representation from the Departments and offices concerned, to make recommendations on the legislative, administrative and organisational issues which arise in relation to the better protection of trees and woodlands.  The group will need to consider how best responsibility for the protection and preservation of woodlands can be allocated as between the local planning authorities and the State and to consider what changes may need to be made to take account of the fact that the Government propose to assign responsibility for forestry development to a separate semi-State body.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill which deal with the procedures relating to the treatment of applications for tree felling consent at local level and on appeal.  I should perhaps first explain that in the normal way the felling of a tree does not constitute development within the meaning of the Planning Acts and does not, therefore, require planning permission.  However, section 45 of the 1963 Act authorises planning authorities to make a tree preservation order if it appears to them to be expedient, in the interests of amenity, to make provision for tree preservation. The making of a tree preservation order has the effect of bringing tree felling within the controls exercisable under the Planning Acts.  In effect, a tree covered by such an order may not be felled without the consent of the planning authority.</P>
    <P>Each individual tree preservation order is required to apply, in relation to any consent under the order and any application for such consent, provisions of Part IV of the 1963 Act which relate to applications for permission to develop land.  In the past, it was left very much <Col N="3084" /> to the individual planning authorities to decide for themselves which provisions of Part IV they should apply in making tree preservation orders.  However, the situation is now very different in that my Department, in January 1986, issued to all planning authorities a document containing detailed advice and guidelines in relation to the making of tree preservation orders, together with a new model tree preservation order.</P>
    <P>This new order provides for the application of all of the relevant provisions which apply in relation to planning applications generally, including the provision for the making of submissions by interested parties to the local planning authority, the notification to such persons of the planning authority decision and the making of appeals to An Bord Pleanála by any person, whether the applicant for the consent or a third party.  The guidelines themselves reminded local authorities that a right of appeal is fundamental to the whole planning control system and they recommended that this should be provided for in every future tree preservation order.</P>
    <P>It was recommended also that the provision for appeals should cover third parties as well as the applicant for consent, since the basic principles underpinning the planning control system require that the position of such parties should be fully protected.  In line with this, the model tree preservation order now makes provision for applicants for consent to publish notice of their intention to do so, and provides also for the notification of consent decisions to any third party who has made representations at local level.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the guidelines which now exist in relation to the making of tree preservation orders, and taking account of the new form of model order, I believe that sections 3 and 4 of the proposed Bill are quite unnecessary.  The objective of these sections, with which I have no quarrel, can be achieved more effectively by the making of tree preservation orders which are consistent with the new model which is now being widely used for the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>I realise that there may be a problem <Col N="3085" /> in relation to earlier tree preservation orders which lack provision for third party involvement and for appeals to An Bord Pleanála.  However, it is open to local planning authorities to revoke or vary a tree preservation order by a subsequent order and so take care of any such defects.  I intend to bring this matter to the attention of the planning authorities and I will request them to consider the need, in particular cases, for the replacement of existing orders by new orders drafted in accordance with the up-to-date model.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to become engaged in discussion of the details of particular cases in which the felling of trees is at issue.  Decisions have still to be made by public authorities in relation to a number of these cases and I do not wish that any remarks of mine in this House should prejudice the outcome.  I think it is appropriate, however, that I should set out for the record the position concerning the woodlands at Coolattin about which so much public concern has been in evidence in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of March, five applications for consent to fell trees in the area known as Tomnafinnogue Wood were submitted to Wicklow County Council. The council decided on 19 May to refuse consent to four of the five applications and, in granting consent in the fifth case, they decided to attach a range of conditions aimed at preserving visual amenity and securing a satisfactory replanting programme.  In particular, the council decided that felling should be carried out over a period of not less than ten years, with felling and extraction of trees in any year being confined to sectors of the wood not exceeding seven hectares in area. Other conditions required the owners of the woodland to retain all existing immature trees, to preserve special belts of trees 15 metres wide, and to replant the entire area with oak trees, with each sector being replanted before felling on the next sector commences.  In addition, the council required that a bond should <Col N="3086" /> be lodged with them to ensure compliance with the tree felling and tree planting and maintenance conditions.</P>
    <P>By a unanimous decision of Wicklow County Council, a special amenity order has been made in relation to the Tomnafinnogue Wood because of its outstanding natural beauty and by reason of the need for nature conservation.  Notice of the making of this order is being placed in the local papers and a period of not less than one month will be allowed for objections to be made to the order before it is submitted to me for confirmation.  If objections are duly made and are not withdrawn, a public local inquiry will be held and the objections will be considered before a decision on confirmation of the order is made.  I can assure the House that when the special amenity area order is submitted to me by the county council, I will ensure that it is processed expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the Wicklow County Council decision does not, in itself, entitle the owners of the woodlands at Coolattin to fell the trees.  A felling licence is still required from the Minister for Energy and it would, of course, be premature at this stage to speculate on what the outcome of such an application might be.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I would be very pleased if it were possible for me to support this Bill.  However, for the reasons I have indicated and arising mainly from the unconstitutionality of some of the provisions in the Bill, I am obliged to oppose the motion for a Second Reading. I would ask the House to recognise the determination of the Government to press on with their own consideration of the options for dealing with tree preservation and to bring forward proposals for legislative and other changes designed to improve the situation.  I appreciate there is genuine concern in the House in relation to this issue and I can assure Deputies there will be no avoidable delay in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that damage has taken place in Coolattin.  I have been down there and what has taken place is a <Col N="3087" /> crying shame.  Coolattin Woods has been decimated over the past number of years. It is regrettable that the mover of the legislation this evening did not get his courage up a little earlier to deal with this matter.  It is a pity the Deputy who is so vocal now was not so vocal over the last few years.  What we heard from him this evening was a monologue of self-justification. Saying he did what he could is hardly factual.  What was preventing him or the Government he was representing introducing the legislation which he finds so accommodating now?  The unfortunate thing is that the Deputy moving the legislation this evening made no defence of it because he knows it will not stand up.  That makes me suspicious of his motives in producing this flawed legislation at this time.  I can only conclude that his intention in introducing it tonight is less than politically honourable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not let this opportunity pass without speaking on this very important issue.  I welcome this debate and the attempt to introduce legislation which, as usual, is too late.  We never seem to realise just what is happening until the harm is done.  I have been elected to this House for a few years and one of the first causes of frustration to me was the length of time it takes to introduce legislation dealing with social, economic and environmental destruction. Again and again we come up against the closed door of the 1937 Constitution. It slams in our faces with a deathly knell because every time we seek to introduce reform in the areas I have mentioned we are told the Constitution does not allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said tonight and I thank Deputy Kavanagh for introducing legislation to preserve our trees.  We must do all we can to preserve our heritage and to protect the rights of our people without being sued by developers, by tree fellers or by &ldquo;scammers&rdquo; of the worst kind who take over part of our heritage and then blackmail us to get compensation while being protected under the Constitution.  This is outrageous and an insult to all who seek to work for the common good.  I was reminded of how careful we must be of our heritage when Deputy Kavanagh <Col N="3089" /> briefly outlined the history of Coolattin Woods.  He told us of the care and attention paid to growing those trees.  It is only right that we remember that our heritage comes from all traditions.  Our heritage of the large estates which were carefully husbanded, with good landscaping, woodlands and good farming is a responsibility which we must carry on. We must take care of our heritage for future generations.</P>
    <P>The devastation of those trees has been a heartbreak for all who heard about it this evening.  During the last Administration I attempted to have legislation introduced for the protection of trees. Coolattin Woods was only on the horizon at that time.  I believed this was a matter of great urgency and common interest and that we should have been able to strengthen legislation in this area but we ran into an impasse because the Department of Fisheries and Forestry had some powers and the local authorities and the Department of the Environment had others but they did not insist on the preservation of trees.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Bill is not accepted, I hope the working group will be set up very soon.  Locking the stable door after the horse has bolted is futile, but it may be possible to recapture the horse. However in this case we are flogging a dead horse because 200 year old trees have been felled and they cannot be replaced.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not preserve these woodlands.  I would like to put a few questions to the House.  How was the compensation introduced into the 1963 Act without some kind of balance which would not have allowed the kind of rip-off I have already described?  What is the constitutional and most urgent way we can deal with that?</P>
    <P>I have offered the other side of the House a few minutes of the time left to me, but in order to get an answer to my constitutional question, I will give three or four minutes to Deputy McDowell, who has informed me he can give a constitutional interpretation to my query.  In giving him this time, I ask him to take into <Col N="3090" /> consideration the fact that I am curtailing my speech to allow Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that she is moving outside her rights in distributing her time. There is a practice that if a Deputy wishes to share the 30 minutes to which they are entitled with another Deputy, they can seek the permission of the House to so do.  If the House agrees, it may be accepted.  However, we will have to get the agreement of the House.  That, I presume, will arise, when you have concluded your contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly observe the ruling of the Chair.  After a severe storm last year the chainsaw massacre took on a whole new meaning.  We did not have qualified people attached to local authorities to test damaged trees and many were felled which need not have been.  They were seen as dangerous but when the deadly act had taken place it was discovered that far too many had been felled.  The Minister and the working party should ensure that there are skilled qualified staff attached to local authorities on a regional basis which would ensure that a full-scale examination is carried out before trees are earmarked for destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I abhor the fact that we give planning permission to housing and other developers for tree felling.  I am reminded vividly of this when a whole community made an effort to save Dorney Woods, Shankhill.  Too late, the residents discovered that the implementation of the planning permission for the erection of houses entailed the felling of many mature trees.  Another problem arose in relation to trees which had preservation orders because when houses were built if those trees were within a certain distance of a house they could be deemed dangerous and the resident could demand that they be felled.  We have enough land for <Col N="3091" /> housing development without using the few remaining woodland areas and green belts.</P>
    <P>We need a new Constitution to deal with many issues and particularly this one.  It is obscene that developers can singlemindedly set out to take over part of our heritage and then blackmail an already fundless authority to pay them huge compensation at the taxpayers' expense.  That is not in the spirit of the Republic or the Constitution.  Observing the rules of the House, is it possible also to give some of my time to the Minister, Deputy Smith?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice given to successive Governments as to the import of the constitutional provisions which <Col N="3092" /> deal with private property is unduly restrictive.  A number of distinguished commentators, some of them Members of the House &mdash; in particular Deputy Kelly &mdash; have commented on the constitutional implications of the private property Articles of the Constitution. They have pointed out on a number of occasions that they are very restrictively interpreted, especially by the Government and their Ministers, on advice from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>There is no general right to do anything you like with your property, irrespective of the social consequences.  Even a superficial reading of the Constitution would not allow anyone to believe that that is the case.  The Supreme Court recently dealt with the question of compensation paid under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 to people who were refused compensation. Mr. Justice McCarthy questioned whether the present arrangements for payment of compensation are themselves constitutional because they are so ridiculous and so generous to people who are refused permission to exercise their property rights in an anti-social manner. The Minister and his advisers should look again at the Constitution with a critical eye and attempt to bring forward legislation which pushes the known limits as decided by judicial decisions one step further and which brings the Constitution into conformity with the views of ordinary people about the rights and duties of private property.  Mindful of this, in the City Hall in which you on occasion appear, there is a statute to Drummond on the base of which there is an inscription which says that property has its duties as well as its rights.  Article 43 (2) of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of urgency this House should tackle the 1963 Act, reverse its whole thrust and make it an exception rather <Col N="3093" /> than a rule that compensation is available. It should recognise the fact that planning control is now in civilised, socialised society, a necessary part of property rights and a necessary duty of property owners.  We should finally bite the bullet in this regard and say that people who buy land with 200-year old trees on it, which are part of our national heritage, have no more right to fell such trees than they have to pull down round towers.  We should say that their rights are those which are reconcilable with the common good and this House, as the legislative organ of the State, should set about what the Constitution requires it to do, to reconcile naked victorian property rights as understood in the principles of <i>laissez-faire</i> with the social and common good.</P>
    <P>I am by no means a left-wing ideologue but we have had very bad advice in this House over the years.  I know because I was in another party and through the then Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, I heard very conservative advice given on this topic.  I implore the Government to go to the Attorney General, to get a new charter in relation to property rights and their being understood in this House, to push through socially minded legislation in relation to property and to refer that legislation to the Supreme Court to have it tested.  We are far too afraid of the attitude of the Supreme Court in this matter.  If Mr. Justice McCarthy's utterances are anything to go by those fears are entirely groundless.  Therefore, I implore the House to take a more courageous view on the property issue and not to regard the Constitution which is quite liberally drafted and, as Deputy Kelly has said, is indistinguishable from the Constitution of Yugoslavia, as so restrictive as to wipe out any possibility of socially progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I thank my colleagues for affording me this opportunity to say a few brief words this evening on the matter before the House.  I welcome the slightly belated conversion of the Labour Party to the necessity to <Col N="3094" /> deal with this problem a problem which, as the House is aware, has resulted from the recent developments in Coolattin Woods, County Wicklow.  The House will be aware that Wicklow County Council recently granted permission, subject to conditions, to Bridge Farm to fell trees in that wood and in Tomnafinnogue Wood.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fact that the county council have already taken a decision there are further stages in this development. First and foremost, it will be necessary for Bridge Farm to obtain a felling licence from the Department of Energy. It is no secret that the Government have been concerned about the developments which have taken place in relation to Coolattin Wood.  Almost five-sixths of that woodland has been felled in, what one might consider, one fell swoop.  We have now reached the final chapter and I can tell the House that this morning I received in the Department a notice of intention by Bridge Farm Company Limited to seek a felling licence.  I can also tell the House that late this afternoon I issued a prohibition order on that notice and this will prohibit any further felling of trees in Tomnafinnogue.  We now await the submission of an application for a felling licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the position to make this decision because during a random visit to that wood in early May it was brought to my notice that the conditions which applied to the earlier licences had not been complied with.  On receipt of that information I instructed officials of my Department to carry out an exhaustive and comprehensive inspection of the woods which had been clear felled and recently replanted.  My fears were justified as the inspection demonstrated beyond all shadow of doubt and to my satisfaction that the mortality rate of the saplings or new plants is of such an order as to make it very easy for me to put a prohibition order on the present notice which is before me.  The mortality rate of new plants in the clear felled area is of the order of 30 per cent.  In some of the oakwood species it is over 40 per cent but on average in both the conifer and broad <Col N="3095" /> leaf species, particularly oakwoods, it is over 30 per cent.  An acceptable level of mortality would be between 10 and 15 per cent but a mortality rate in the order of 30 per cent is totally unacceptable. Although I cannot claim to have any technical expertise in this matter I am strongly of the view that if you clear fell, particularly in relation to the replanting of oakwood species, it is very necessary for the young crop to have shelter and be protected from frost and heavy rainfalls. The growing and maturing older trees compete for unwanted vegetation which allows the young trees to develop.</P>
    <P>I take the point which was made in relation to a more common good approach to our Constitution and legislation generally but that is down the road somewhat and I have to deal with this problem today.  From this unfortunate chapter in our history we should develop a national strategy for broad leaf species. I am determined that my Department will gradually increase the percentage of broad leaf species planted each year and, also that the grant structure should encourage small private plantations to plant broad leaf species.  That is a long term aim and my mandate is for commercial forestry but I respect, understand and share the concern of those who express the need to carry on to future generations our heritage, our wildlife habitats etc.  Therefore, it is possible to pursue a vigorous, commercial policy without lessening the prospect of increased planting of broad leaf species and without lessening the protection of young, semi-mature woodland areas.</P>
    <P>We should begin to inform everybody concerned that a national strategy is being developed in relation to broad leaf species but that development must then be carried through to its logical conclusion, to the point of felling.  So far as I am aware, in most European countries there is no such thing as clear felling of broad leaf species.  Felling is carried out in a sensitive and structured way which allows for the integration and development of the new crop.  That is the kind of approach we should adopt and put in <Col N="3096" /> place with the proper legislative framework and backup it would require.  It should be possible to put that kind of policy in place without the necessity for a large number of amendments to existing legislation.  In that context, the Government will face up to whatever tasks are ahead of them to ensure that that aim is met.  I am satisfied that every conceivable step will be taken to ensure that Toomnafinnogue Wood which is of great scientific importance will not have the same fate as its sisters and brothers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £167,339,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>My Department have a critical role to play not only in keeping open the lines of communication between employers, trade unions and Government at national level but also in devising ways that will lead to greater co-operation in the workplace, to the benefit of all concerned. A consensus is never delivered neatly packaged for everyone to admire, it has to be built up and maintained.  That takes a lot of effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's plan for growth and economic recovery aims to create an environment for economic growth and investment.  We believe that this will <Col N="3097" /> require commitment from all sectors of the community.  We have set about involving representatives of the social partners and the various sectoral groups in discussions on the action which has to be taken.</P>
    <P>It is useful at this initial stage, in the joint approach to national recovery, to have an opportunity to review the current activities of my Department and to invite Deputies to consider its working practice in the broadest perspective.  Since I came into office, I am more than ever convinced of the need for realism in our approach to industrial relations.  I am also intent on steering through a practical and straightforward series of legislative measures. In deciding how to shape these measures, I believe that it is necessary to acknowledge the limitations of legislation on its own.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear since I came into office that I wish to see a greater reliance on sensible employment practices at local level.  My task as Minister for Labour is to encourage the representatives of both sides of industry to look to the adequacy of the industrial relations arrangements at local level, the scope for greater employee involvement, the efficiency of work methods and the overall adaptability of both work organisation and the workforce to technological change and change in the external business environment.</P>
    <P>I have had a preliminary exchange of views with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and separately with the Federated Union of Employers which provided an opportunity to cover the contentious subject of industrial relations reform.  I hope over the next few months to see what agreement I can get from the social partners in this area before proceeding with necessary legislation.  I do not believe that legislation can of itself produce a formula for good industrial relations.  Any practitioner knows full well that legal intervention can prove to be a very clumsy instrument in a trade dispute.  Industrial relations is fundamentally about human relations at the workplace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3098" /> The number of days lost through industrial action in 1986 is estimated at 315,500.  As a record of strike activity this is not as high as in recent years, but it leaves no room for complacency.  Preliminary estimates put the number of strikes last year at 100.  You would have to go back to 1967 to find a year when there was a lower number of strikes.</P>
    <P>The number of unofficial strikes in 1986 fell to an estimated 38.  This reflects a continuing decline in this form of industrial action.  It is clear that a continuation of these trends will improve the way our performance is viewed by those who are likely to be taking critical investment decisions in this country in the near future.</P>
    <P>The general reaction to the settlement of the ESB dispute showed that most people want us to tackle the serious problems we face.  There is a real danger that pointless confrontation involving strike action, particularly in the provision of public services, will cause real hardship for the disadvantaged in our community. Industrial disruption at this stage could also threaten the recovery in tourism and put at risk the substantial rise in overall industrial output which is expected.  We need to rely more on basic industrial relations skills and to see more effort on the part of management and workers devoted to working out problems through negotiation.</P>
    <P>A considerable debate has got off the ground within the European Community and in other bodies such as OECD on the subject of labour market flexibility. Central to the debate is the question of how responsive the regulations, institutions and practices in the labour market are to changing conditions.  The range of topics covered is substantial and varied, including working time, training, payment systems, dismissal procedures and systems of communication between employers and workers.</P>
    <P>With such an open field for debate, it is not surprising to find that the issue of labour market flexibility means different things to different people: one person's business flexibility can look like a threat <Col N="3099" /> to someone else's job security.  The current concern about how firms adapt internally and externally to the business environment is no flash in the pan.  The debate is likely to become even more alive with the progressive removal of trade barriers in the European market.</P>
    <P>The debate in this country has tended to focus on one single aspect: the extent to which worker protection legislation and particularly the Unfair Dismissals Act constitutes a disincentive to employers to hire workers.  From time to time economic commentators have put up the argument that this legislation prevents employment creation and others may fear that it could have this effect.</P>
    <P>A survey commissioned by my Department and carried out by the ESRI suggested that the scale of these alleged effects is not significant.  What is not generally known &mdash; and certainly not highlighted by those who call for the dismantling of protective legislation &mdash; is that the regulation of working time, and of conditions of employment, collective dismissal, etc. in this country is generally less onerous than in other EC member states.  This was recently acknowledged in a comparative study by the European Management Forum.  While the last 12 years has seen fairly extensive &mdash; by our standards &mdash; legal intervention in employment we have also seen considerable reliance on securing improvements in conditions through collective agreement.  Many of the basic entitlements in our conditions of employment legislation have been improved upon by collective bargaining.  As a result, the possibility of making adjustments to the organisation of work and production is much less likely to run up against administrative barriers in Ireland than in other continental countries.</P>
    <P>The removal of the ban on night work for women is a practical example of how we have replaced a blanket prohibition with a permissive provision.  We did so to improve equality of opportunity between men and women; to free industrialists from restrictions on how they make use of their manpower and machinery: and <Col N="3100" /> because it is necessary to check from time to time whether protections introduced on social grounds are still relevant to current conditions.</P>
    <P>Government Departments have a responsibility to explain the law and to inform people of legislative changes. People who are running businesses want a clear statement of what the law requires them to do in any given situation.  My Department receive 45,000 queries on average each year from employers and employees concerning entitlements in such areas as redundancy, holidays, unfair dismissals, maternity leave and minimum notice.  In all of these contacts, I know that officials of my Department make every effort to explain the legal position and to give practical advice.</P>
    <P>I propose to publish a single comprehensive guide to the provisions of legislation in these areas.  It should help to make the subject easier to understand and should be helpful to many workers and employers particularly in small businesses.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that my approach will be to select a number of practical and sensible measures which will safeguard the welfare of workers without raising obstacles to flexibility or the expansion of jobs.  This approach has already met with an initial welcome from both sides of industry on the grounds that I had put forward a practical working agenda.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Dáil of my immediate legislative priorities &mdash; first, the Safety and Health (Offshore Installations) Bill has been reintroduced and is now being taken through its Committee Stage.  Second, I intend to press forward in this session with the new legislation required to streamline the operation of the manpower services.  Third, I have already referred to the question of industrial relations reform and I intend to reactivate proposals for legislation on worker participation at sub-board levels in State enterprises.  Fourth, there are the proposals to effect the major reform of the legislation on safety and health at work which I hope will be ready for introduction towards the end of the year.  The first three of these are proposals which <Col N="3101" /> should, with the co-operation of this House, be advanced to enactment in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Bill, 1986, was passed in the Dáil on 12 May. It will provide a new framework for the safety and protection of workers on offshore installations engaged in exploration for or exploitation of minerals in the territorial waters of the State and in designated areas outside those waters.</P>
    <P>Regulations to be made under the Bill will deal with specific aspects of workers safety.  When enacted, the legislation will be administered and enforced by the industrial inspectorate of my Department. The Bill met with broad support across the House.  There may be differences on points of detail which will be looked into on Committee Stage but I am satisfied that the broad thrust of the Bill is correct.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Offshore Bill, Deputies expressed their eagerness to see progress in bringing forward the more wide-ranging reform package put forward by the Commission on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work. Four years have passed since the Commission completed their report.  I am anxious to harness the broad consensus in favour of a comprehensive overhaul of our safety and health system.  I have asked my Department to give priority to the completion of their work on the drafting of a framework Bill which will extend legislative protection to all employers, employees and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the contribution of the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health has been particularly helpful in progressing the complex task of shaping legislation to reflect the findings of the Barrington Commission.  They are also looking at the transitional arrangements which will be necessary to make the change over to the new system.  I am under no illusions about the kind of follow-up action required and in particular the need to radically reorganise available resources in order to sustain training education and information at all <Col N="3102" /> levels.  The availability of resources is a crucial consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any point in enacting model legislation or establishing new bodies if they are then left without the resources or the capacity to discharge their intended functions.  The Barrington Commission recognised that the changes they proposed would require to be implemented on a phased basis. I look forward to receiving the interim board's advice regarding the priority areas to be tackled.</P>
    <P>As regards the reactivation of legislative proposals on worker participation at sub-board levels in State enterprises, I see this as an area where legislation should avoid trying to regulate in detail how decisions are made but should provide a framework within which joint labour-management consensus can be achieved on the type of arrangements best suited to specific circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have not neglected the need to make progress in other areas of protective legislation. I believe that Members of this House are entitled to know the outcome of reviews undertaken by my Department. Progress has been made with the review of legislative provisions in three important areas: individual dismissals &mdash; involving the review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977; employment equality &mdash; looking at the means of streamlining and extending the provisions of the Equality Acts 1974 and 1977; payment of wages &mdash; looking at the provisions on cashless pay and workers' entitlements in the context of the Payment of Wages Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have asked my Department to prepare a discussion document on the issues arising in these areas.  The discussion document will explore a variety of options for amendment of these Acts, and it is my intention to seek the views of all interested parties on the proposals. It is my intention that the discussion document as I promised in the House recently will be published by September. I hope to deal in further detail with Manpower policy developments including new legislation.  I would like to <Col N="3103" /> comment briefly on three other immediate legislative concerns.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that unemployment reflects our economy's failure to adjust to the circumstances and opportunities of today.  The measures we are taking in the fight against unemployment draw on three underlying objectives.</P>
    <P>First, is the fact that unemployment represents, in terms of both its social and economic cost, a burden which we cannot continue to bear.  Determined and concerted action is required, using every means at our disposal, in order to tackle the problem.  What we are trying to do after all is to get everybody in this country working again.  A successful programme of national recovery will ultimately depend on a spirit of enterprise, on the understanding and support of the community as a whole, on the responsiveness of the administrative machinery, and especially on the efforts of employers and trade unions at local level.</P>
    <P>Second, is the Government's intention to secure a more effective return on the resources of the manpower agencies.  The decision to launch the Jobsearch programme for 150,000 unemployed persons has involved a major reorientation of the activity of the manpower agencies this year.  It shows this Government's readiness to take immediate action to co-ordinate the roles of different agencies in order to provide practical help to those looking for work.</P>
    <P>Third, it is imperative that we take immediate action to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment before it can become part of the everyday world of individuals and whole communities.  We have to develop measures which will provide individuals with a means of escape from the downward spiral in which the unemployed can get caught.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme combines for the first time resources and the field activities of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour and its associated manpower agencies. These services have been brought together in a combined operation in order to provide help and encouragement to <Col N="3104" /> those who are unemployed and in particular the long-term unemployed.  The programme has three main elements: every person in the target group of 150,000, about 60 per cent of the total registered unemployed, is being offered one-to-one counselling interviews; approximately 40,000 opportunities are being made available this year on Manpower schemes and programmes, including the normal job vacancies referred to the National Manpower Service by employers; an additional 12,000 persons will be given places this year on the special Jobsearch training courses which AnCO has put in place from the beginning of this month.</P>
    <P>The task of interviewing all those who are being contacted under the Jobsearch programme falls to the National Manpower Service.  This involves a very challenging extension to the role it has taken on over the years of identifying, classifying and placing unemployed persons on a range of special employment and training schemes.</P>
    <P>A primary purpose of the counselling interview is to make contact with the unemployed people particularly the long term unemployed who have lost the motivation for work.  Every effort must be made to ensure that they know about the services which are available to them and how to go about using them.  It is to help them to assess their own needs and to make decisions about the opportunities available to them.  The programme is a very practical example of how flexible and cost-effective measures can be developed to combat long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Research into unemployment undertaken at European level has confirmed the evidence of Irish case studies which have highlighted the variety of factors which are concealed in standard indicators of age and duration of time on the live register.  Any public representative with experience in dealing with constituents' problems at local level will appreciate as readily as a placement officer that the interests and capabilities of the unemployed are as widely divergent as those of the majority who are <Col N="3105" /> fortunate to have jobs.  That is why the response to the problem of long-term unemployment must consist of a very practical and flexible range of measures.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme has been attacked quite irresponsibly in this House by some who allege that it represents a return to the workhouse.  They should wake up to reality.  The last Government either failed to get very similar ideas off the drawing board or consigned them to the graveyard of task forces.</P>
    <P>A system which identifies the needs of long-term unemployment people through interviews and provides programmes to meet them has nothing to do with bullying or compulsion.  The response from among the staff involved and those availing of schemes already shows that the exercise is worthwhile and certainly not divisive or unfair.</P>
    <P>I am more than ever convinced that we are going in the right direction.  We are, after all, building on the successful record of schemes like the social employment scheme, the employment incentive scheme and programmes like enterprise and teamwork.</P>
    <P>When we came to look at how these schemes could be combined as part of a programme of direct action to assist the long-term unemployed, we recognised that there was a gap in the existing array of programmes.  What was missing was an initiative to fill the gap between the initial assessment stage and the actual placement of an unemployed person on an appropriate course or programme. What was needed was more extensive counselling for persons who were not sure about what to do next.  Many may even have lost the confidence to take an active interest in looking for work.  That is how the Jobsearch training courses came into being.</P>
    <P>The special Jobsearch training courses will cater for 12,000 participants.  They consist of four weeks intensive training in the skills of job seeking.  The courses cover such areas as: the work situation and the changing world of work, local job opportunities, assessment of personal skills and strengths, motivation, self expression, communication skills, self <Col N="3106" /> confidence, job seeking methods, job applications, CVs, letter writing, telephone inquiries, newspaper scanning and keeping a job.  Trainees are provided with telephone, typing and photocopying facilities as well as sources of information on the general job scene.</P>
    <P>The Government's readiness to take direct action called for a very rapid response from the Department of Labour and the manpower agencies involving a significant re-allocation of resources.  I have been impressed by the energy and commitment shown in the way they sprang into action.</P>
    <P>The response of all the staff involved confirms my own view that there is a very strong desire within the public service generally to ensure that resources are used effectively and that the long term unemployed, in particular, are given every encouragement to make full use of the range of training and temporary employment opportunities now available.</P>
    <P>This Government have shown that, even in the short term, they are prepared to seek an effective return on resources by identifying clear cut objectives and definite targets.  We had no intention of deferring direct action of this kind until the outcome of the kind of institutional changes proposed by the last Government in their White Paper.  That was like putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>The funds originally provided for the social employment scheme would have limited average participation in the scheme to about 7,900 persons this year. The Government decided to increase participation in the scheme by 1,500 persons this year.  I have always been a strong advocate of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The support it received in the budget and the part it has to play in the nation-wide Jobsearch programme show that it is regarded as an effective means of assisting unemployed workers to regain a foothold in the labour market.  The 1987 allocation has been boosted by £3 million to £43.5 million as a result of the budget increase.</P>
    <P>There has been a great demand for the scheme since its introduction in 1985 and <Col N="3107" /> this has necessitated the introduction of regional participation quotas again this year.  This will make for a better distribution of projects.  It will also mean that priority attention is given to local levels of unemployment and to the need to locate projects in the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Since the budget new recruits are paid a standard wage of £60 in the case of single participants or £85 per week if they have an adult dependant.  Participants can take part in additional paid employment outside the two and half days per week during which they are engaged on the scheme.  There are currently more than 2,000 projects in operation around the country.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern among some voluntary bodies at delays which have been experienced in the processing of claims for payment of grant instalments. I am satisfied that significant inroads are being made into the arrears problem and extra staff have been allocated within the Department to expedite the processing of the outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>The enterprise scheme has been helping unemployed people become self-employed by giving them a weekly payment in lieu of unemployment payments. Greater emphasis is now being placed on applicant suitability and on project viability.</P>
    <P>Only worthwhile projects will be accepted and under the new guidelines the National Manpower Service must operate a degree of selectivity when approving projects.</P>
    <P>There has inevitably been a slowdown in the rate of recruitment under this scheme but I am very optimistic that the projects now approved will offer better prospects and permanent employment not only for the promoters but for others in the future.</P>
    <P>Of the 800 applicants which have been approved this year 36 per cent were long term unemployed.  The scheme has provided an opening for many unemployed persons who have not attained a high level of formal education.  This is demonstrated by the fact that more than 50 <Col N="3108" /> per cent of participants have educational achievements below leaving certificate level.  Over 19 per cent of participants are under 25 years of age and 13 per cent are women.  The majority of projects are involved in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>The funds allocated for the scheme this year will mean that we can help about 80 people a week become enterpreneurs provided they come up with worthwhile projects.  This could mean about 2,000 new small businesses between now and the end of the year with the help of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme encourages employers to take on extra workers by giving them generous wage grants.  Last year employers notified about 10,000 recruitments under the scheme to the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>Teamwork provides grants to community and voluntary bodies for the temporary employment of young unemployed people at a realistic wage on projects of value to the community.  The scheme is aimed primarily at those unemployed for six months or more.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £5.4 million has been provided for this scheme in 1987.  This will mean that over 1,800 young people will secure temporary employment this year.</P>
    <P>As a specific response to the problem of youth unemployment, Teamwork provides a very cost-effective return on the annual Exchequer allocation.  When savings in unemployment payments, returns to the State by way of PRSI and PAYE and European Social Fund assistance are taken into account, the net cost of the scheme to the Exchequer is about 30 per cent of the gross cost.  This is a small price to pay for a scheme which offers young people a wide variety of experience on community based projects.</P>
    <P>The public debate on the Single European Act has heightened awareness of the significance of the European Social Fund.  Unfortunately, the budget of the Social Fund was not increased adequately to meet the demands of Spain and Portugal when those countries joined the <Col N="3109" /> Community in 1986, and the continuing high levels of unemployment in the Community have resulted in increased demand for assistance from other member states.  Because of the increased competition for limited funds, the European Commission has been applying stricter criteria for the approval of applications for ESF assistance.  Priority is being given to training programmes which lead directly to employment and to programmes for persons who are more than 12 months unemployed.  The introduction of these stricter rules and criteria may mean that certain Irish programmes which have been assisted by the ESF in the past may not qualify in the future.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has outlined its proposals for making a success of the Single Act &mdash; the so called &ldquo;Delors Package&rdquo;&mdash; and discussion on the package within the Council is still at a very preliminary stage.  Many aspects of the package require clarification and I expect that the ultimate negotiations in the Council will be prolonged and difficult.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Chair for my being told only such a short time ago about the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of very positive elements in the Commission's proposals, for example, measures to assist the less developed regions to catch up with the rest of the community, a proposal to double the resources of the Structural Funds by 1992 and to promote economic growth.  It is the Government's objective <Col N="3110" />&mdash; and one which I know is shared by all parties in this House &mdash; to translate these proposals into positive action through the forthcoming negotiations in the Council.</P>
    <P>Government policy on training is one of the most important means of mobilising the forces for change which are vital to national recovery.  In view of the rapidly changing nature of technology across most industrial sectors, Government policy needs to be geared towards more selectivity in intervention through training. This is in line with the Government's policy for supporting enterprise in trade and industry generally.  We need an emphasis on training that will have maximum impact on the economy and we need to keep equipment up to date specifically in relation to new technology. The development of selectivity in grant allocation will need to be built on the close working relations established between bodies like AnCO and the IDA. Resources will need to be directed towards firms employing, or needing to employ, people with business management, marketing and technical skills particularly those producing high value-added and technology advanced goods and services.</P>
    <P>AnCO's allocation for this year has been held at broadly the same expenditure as in the 1986 estimates although efficiency savings have been made through a reduction in overheads costs. AnCO's activity levels for 1987 are stated in man years and have been targetted to achieve a total of 14,195 man years.</P>
    <P>AnCO is playing a key role in the Jobsearch programme and will have allocated places to 14,200 people referred to them for places on specific employable skills, skills foundation and building on experience and community youth training programmes.  AnCO's concentration on training unemployed people will assist them in securing identified job opportunities in both the manufacturing and service sectors at all occupational levels.</P>
    <P>In addition to activity on these mainline courses, AnCO will also provide Jobsearch courses for an additional 12,000 people this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3111" /> In 1987 it is anticipated that over 7,300 persons will be trained by CERT.</P>
    <P>Management training, education and development is, at present, carried out across industry, educational institutions, training agencies and the Irish Management Institute.  Funding from the Exchequer to these bodies has developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis rather than as part of an integrated policy on state finance for management education and training.  It is probably fair to say that it should be possible to get a better return on the existing Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>Against this background we advanced the idea before we entered Government of establishing a national committee to co-ordinate the present management training effort.  I intend to establish this committee in the near future.  The major purpose of the committee will be to examine what is at present being done in the field of management education and training; what needs to be done and how to bridge the gap between needs and resources.  This will include spelling out the contribution which can be made by various bodies.  The membership of the committee will be drawn from the users of management education and training programmes and the providers of such programmes.  The committee will report to me.</P>
    <P>In the last year the Youth Employment Agency continued to develop their job creation role, particularly through community and co-operative support.  Both the Social Guarantee and COMTEC completed their first year of implementation.</P>
    <P>The promotion and development of the community enterprise programme will be continued in the current year.  It is undoubtedly our most significant labour market intervention in the interests of promoting local employment initiatives. Last year £2 million was approved for investment in 250 projects.</P>
    <P>Development plans for 1987 include an expansion of the specialist employment subsidy schemes such as STEP, Marketplace, the European Orientation Programme and the Financial Graduates <Col N="3112" /> Programme.  These provide employment opportunities for certain categories of specially trained young people and encourage companies to improve their expertise in key business areas.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency are charged with responsibility for co-ordinating the delivery of the social guarantee.  The guarantee involves a significant level of targeting of programmes at young people who leave school without qualification.  This has called for unprecedented levels of co-operation within the school system and between the schools and the Manpower agencies. Over 3,000 young persons were placed under the guarantee in 1986.  School returns indicate a demand for over 4,000 places this year.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the National Employment and Training Authority Bill was introduced in the Dáil in November 1986 and was designed to give effect to certain major proposals contained in the White Paper on Manpower Policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his reading speed.  In the event that political fortune does not smile on him there must be other career opportunities open to him with that kind of performance.</P>
      <P>We have just heard the Minister deliver his first Estimate speech and my reaction is a certain disappointment at the lack of imagination in his presentation. There was no evidence there of any fresh thinking being brought to bear, of any broom sweeping clean.  The overwhelming impression one gets is of a Minister who sees his role as essentially reactive.  The Minister is confident and hard-working but he sees no great opportunities in policy innovation.  I suspect the Department are already singing his praises and that they see him as well and truly House-trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather striking that much of the <Col N="3113" /> legislation that was held had been contemplated and in some instances published before the change of administration.  That was so in the area of Manpower policy where the NETA Bill had already been before the Dáil on Second Stage.  It is true, too, in the area of health and safety where work giving effect to the Barrington Commission report was well advanced and where a number of draft Bills had been prepared. It is true in industrial relations reform where the Minister sees himself building on the work initiated by Deputy Quinn who launched the process of consultation with the social partners.  One has mixed emotions about that.  On the one hand one must feel a certain sense of satisfaction that it represents to some extent a vote of confidence in the outgoing administration. It is an endorsement of their work.  On the other hand, there has to be a sense of real disappointment among the public that the change of administration and of Minister brought with it no fresh thinking.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, debates on the Estimate for the Department of Labour have focused predominantly on the question of employment and unemployment and I do not suppose this will be any great exception.  Nowhere is that paucity of fresh thinking more evident than in the area of unemployment.  In the run-up to the election high levels of unemployment were central to the Fianna Fáil campaign and in those circumstances one might have expected to see a vigorous assault in the early days even if subsequently they were to run out of steam.  We have not seen even that initial vigour.  The principal opportunity available to any Government in any year, the budget, was squandered on this occasion.  The budget did nothing for job creation.  Income tax increased for many workers with the decision to chop mortgage interest tax relief thus reducing workers' take-home pay and increasing the cost of job creation. In the next couple of weeks in the House we will be debating the withholding tax on professional fees, a proposal which if implemented in its present form will result in the loss of hundreds of <Col N="3114" /> jobs particularly in engineering, architecture and other professions.  Last week we debated health and the Government's failure to address fundamental questions of administrative reform or even to ask themselves whether we really need eight health boards.  That means they are forced back on the EC option of shedding frontline workers, those who deliver the health services.</P>
    <P>I make these passing references only because all of those matters serve to make the task of the Minister for Labour and his Department more difficult.  I said that the debate in the Department of Labour has traditionally featured prominently the question of employment.  That is in some ways unfair because the role of the Minister for Labour is relatively limited since he finds himself, in the main, operating on the supply side.  Question about the nature of work and the distribution of work which are now so central to the debate are very much within his domain.  I would have expected him to have something of greater substance to say on the subject than we heard in his Estimate speech.</P>
    <P>For example, what proposals have the Government to advance job-sharing?  Do they adhere to the view, widespread in Europe, that a reduction in working hours would contribute to the solution of our problems?  The previous Government identified an anomaly when in many sectors of the economy the working of organised, systematic overtime was the norm at a time of spiralling unemployment. The legislative response was perhaps not the happiest and I would be the first to concede that, but one would have wished to see greater interest in this area than was found in the Minister's speech.  If one looks at the Estimate of the Department of Labour one finds that by far the largest share of that Estimate is earmarked for manpower training.  That area has grown considerably in recent years and has properly been receiving enhanced resources. It received some attention from Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition because the only area for which we ever received proposals for expenditure cuts was this one when the then spokesman <Col N="3115" /> on Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, time after time &mdash; I suspect to the embarrassment of his party colleagues &mdash; proposed that our expenditure on training should be reduced because he saw it as wasteful.  He reached his pinnacle when he suggested that one way in which we could usefully cut down would be to exclude women from participation in vocational courses.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen that increase in allocations to Manpower training but as the various agencies involved have grown and as the resources available to them have increased there has been a view that there has been a certain blurring of the roles of Manpower, AnCO, CERT, the YEA and so on.  Consequent on that is a widely held view that there is a need to bring much greater clarity of purpose and much greater co-ordination to the work of the various bodies.  For much of the time I spent in the Department of Labour my preoccupation was to try to achieve that co-ordination between the Department of Labour and the various satellite agencies and, equally important, co-ordination between the Department of Labour family and the education family.  I am disappointed that this area seems to have been afforded a lesser priority in the work of the present Government.</P>
    <P>For example, the high level liaison committee between Education and Labour are no more and that is a retrograde step.  Within the administration nobody was appointed with specific responsibility to oversee the co-ordination of education and training.  While symbolic, that perhaps was a sign of the way the wind was blowing and that is regrettable.  If we are to get value for the taxpayer' money it is absolutely essential that the world of education and the world of labour work hand-in-hand.  At the moment the education world is reeling from the effects of cuts across that whole area but impinging with particular severity on the VEC sector.  Throughout that area, but particularly in the VEC sector, expertise is available that would be of invaluable assistance to many of the <Col N="3116" /> activities that are now conducted by AnCO in the main but also by CERT and by Manpower.  I am sure that is so when it comes to running &ldquo;start your own business&rdquo; courses and organising many of the vocational courses in traditional crafts, in the secretarial area or whatever.</P>
    <P>In my time in the Department of Labour I was very anxious to ensure a situation in which the educational world would enjoy a first option when any of the Manpower agencies found it necessary to resort to outside expertise.  It is fair to say that it was accepted without any great enthusiasm.  I suppose that is human nature because its effect would have been somewhat to reduce the freedom of action of the various Manpower agencies. It seems to me that, at a time of even greater economic stringency, it makes even greater sense.  I urge the Minister to take that proposal on board enthusiastically, to insist to the agencies under his control that no resort should be had to outside expertise, whether they be management consultants, external trainers or whoever, until there has been a thorough trawl throughout the educational world, to ascertain that the expertise sought is not already available within the State sector.  Many VECs at present struggling to come to terms with cuts, wondering how they will survive within their budgets, wondering what cuts to implement, what services should be discontinued, have open to them the opportunity to gain extra resources by providing a back-up service in these areas.  All that is required is that the Minister's will be seen and that it be implemented as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated more than once in this House &mdash; again in the course of his Estimate speech &mdash; his intention of reintroducing the NETA Bill.  I welcome that proposal.  Notwithstanding the fact that that Bill was introduced in the lifetime of the last Government it would be wrong to suggest that simply amalgamating, mashing together, all of the agencies represents a panacea for all our difficulties.  It seems to me that one large agency can be just as directionist as any multiplicity of bodies.  What is of crucial <Col N="3117" /> importance here &mdash; and there was some recognition of this in the Minister's remarks &mdash; is the capacity of the Department of Labour to exercise a central policy-making role.  I see that the Minister nods in agreement with me.  I do not know whether the Department he heads has that capacity.  In the past certainly its lack of capacity meant that agencies took unto themselves policy-making functions and, to a certain extent, went off and did their own thing.</P>
    <P>In an effort to respond to that difficulty there has been an attempt to poach people from agencies, to second people on a temporary basis from the planning or policy units of some of the semi-State agencies in association with the Department.  That is not an adequate response.  It is not fair to the people involved.  It puts them in an invidious position.  If the will of the Department and of the agency from which they have been seconded are running in opposite directions they are placed in a most anomalous position.  That is not the answer.  If the Minister is serious about saying that the Department must regain the initiative then he must ensure a boosting of the planning unit within the Department.  In the present day and age that means he will have to bite the bullet and accept that that means suppressing posts elsewhere.  That is what the Minister will have to face up to if the Department of Labour are to move back centre stage.  It really is quite ridiculous to suggest &mdash; without an organisation chart before me I cannot say whether this is accurate &mdash; that half an assistant principal, or whoever, is to direct an agency as diverse as AnCO, for example, or perhaps it is a full assistant principal at this stage.  That is the order of magnitude of the resources available to the Minister. This was brought home very clearly in the life of the last Government when there was some discussion on the whole question of curriculum reform.  It was really quite striking to see the divergence of resources available to the Department of Education, the Department charged with such reform and those available to <Col N="3118" /> AnCO who were the people making submissions on that subject.  If the Minister wants to get back into the saddle he must accept that it means taking unto himself the resources to make his views clear and that other things may have to suffer as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am falling into the same trap as the Minister but perhaps I am not adjusting as well as did the Minister. With regard to NETA, I welcome the Minister's decision on CERT which has been one of the real success stories, given their high placement rates.  It would have been very unfortunate indeed if a desire to be consistent had resulted in CERT losing their autonomy.  I congratulate the Minister on having taken that decision.</P>
      <P>The Estimates require that, with less resources, the agencies under the Minister's control will do more.  That is true, for example, with regard to AnCO.  It is quite proper that the Minister should be seen to be striving for greater productivity. But it is very important that that greater productivity not be at the expense of quality.  It would be very unfortunate if, in order to meet the targets set for them, any of the agencies were to do it by running shorter courses, simply sandwiching people in and out in order that they could say at the end of the year that they got so many people through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that I see some evidence of that willingness to sacrifice quality for quantity in a number of decisions taken by this Government.  That is to be seen in the decisions on the social employment scheme, in the decision to cut the allowance paid to new participants to £60 per week.  It is to be seen also in the Teamwork scheme where a decision was taken to cut the rate from £70 to £60.  I find those decisions mean and pennypinching.  Both of those schemes, the social employment scheme and Teamwork scheme have been considerable successes.  I take a certain <Col N="3119" /> parental interest in the success of the Teamwork scheme.  I would have thought that what we should have been about was improving the quality of experience of the participants rather than engaging in this sort of exercise.  One of the disappointments with regard to the social employment scheme has been that it is not national and there have been difficulties encountered in a number of parts of the country in securing trade union agreement.  That has been the case in Dublin city.  The Minister for Labour who, for the next few weeks at least doubles as Lord Mayor, is in a unique position to overcome those difficulties.  I urge him to use his good offices in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at some length of the Jobsearch programme.  He referred to people suggesting that we were returning to the workhouse.  I do not know to whom he was attributing those remarks. Certainly it was not to me because we have indicated that: yes, there are things of merit in this proposal; yes, this is worthwhile, so far as it addresses the long term unemployed, a group who are losing motivation.  If it has the side effect of identifying people who are irregularly on the register then we have no quarrel with that.  I have major problems with the way the scheme is operating in practice. Already there have been cases reported to me, for example, of people who have been laid off because of a seasonal downturn, people who were employed in secretarial positions told by their employers that they will be taken on again in the busy time of the year, the autumn.  They are let go for the intervening few months and have been told to report to learn how to be secretaries, how to use typewriters when they had been earning their living for God knows how many years doing just that, their secretarial skills being well up to the standard of those instructing them.  That is happening in the Baldoyle AnCO Training Centre.</P>
    <P>There are question marks about the way in which the Jobsearch programme is operating in relation to married women.  I know the scheme is still at teething stage but there is some evidence to the effect <Col N="3120" /> that married women are being unfairly discriminated against.  That is a source of some concern.  If the scheme is to work the Minister must expect the support of his colleagues.  I am not at all convinced that he is getting that support.  I had intended to speak about the difference in morale between the various agencies and to point out that there are some difficulties in that area within the Manpower service.  I do not think their role in relation to the Jobsearch programme is helping them.  For example, in the north Dublin area, the area with which I am most familiar, there is the peculiar position in which official there are coming under pressure from some of the Minister's colleagues &mdash; including the Minister for Social Welfare who holds responsibilities in this area &mdash; to exempt people from being called forward for a scheme he is meant to be implementing. If that sort of nonsense goes on the Minister cannot seriously expect support.</P>

      <P>I should also like to express my thanks to the Minister for Labour who has afforded me opportunities for research and so on in his Department.  It is worthwhile looking at the role the Department of Labour play in this day and age.  I have a slightly different emphasis on it to Deputy Birmingham. It is playing a pivotal role and has been doing so for a number of years. However, the Department was not designed with that in mind but has emerged like that over the years.  It was set up with a much smaller role in mind.  With the growth in unemployment and the change in emphasis towards central pay bargaining, the increase in training and work experience programmes and the introduction and implementation of <Col N="3121" /> equality legislation the role of the Department has changed considerably. These changes involve changes in attitude in the Department and must also involve changes in the attitude of Ministers.  That has not happened.  Either we do not believe we have the problems which exist in unemployment and so on or we have not got around to looking at them in such a radical way as to turn what we are doing on its head.</P>
      <P>What review is there of the Department's activities on a regular basis?  I know there is a certain amount of review in that one tinkers around with the schemes which were introduced in the previous year.  One looks at them to see if they are operating, how many people availed of them and how much money was spent on them.  The problem is that if a scheme is not working there is not the will to chop it.  If a scheme on which millions of pounds have been spent over a number of years is seen not to be as effective as it was thought to be there is an unwillingness to implement a different scheme or divert the funds, as the PDs would say, into some form of tax relief which would encourage real job creation rather than framing schemes <i>ad nauseam.</i> For this a degree of leadership is required which has not been present in the last number of years in the Department.  I am still waiting to see it in this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the move to amalgamate the various agencies which was proposed in the Bill introduced by the previous Government.  This is a step in the right direction but it must go a lot further.  Real reduction in administrative costs must be achieved.  The amount of money which is poured into administration particularly in AnCO is an absolute scandal when there is no doubt that there is a doubling up of schemes between the various agencies. The Minister is quoted in newspaper report as saying he does not envisage a reduction in the number of staff involved in these agencies which are to be amalgamated. Perhaps I have not read the report correctly but that is how it appears to me.  If we are to make any improvement in the allocation of our resources so that they contribute to job creation, then <Col N="3122" /> we must start by rationalising what we are doing and see that we do it to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme seems to have been downgraded.  There were problems with that scheme. Employers felt they were getting a hand-out. They employed a person to work in their firm and got a hand-out to pay for that person.  The scheme did not produce long term jobs and should have been cut long before now.  I would link the work experience programme with that and say it comes within that category and should be looked at in that way.  Before anyone jumps up and asks if I agree with certain schemes being made available for people who are in need of work experience, let me say that I do.  They are necessary but only in so far as they work.  As far as I can see, this scheme is not producing the result we want, that is, long-term jobs.  It gives young people the idea that they cannot aspire to anything more than a three months or six months work programme. The danger is that we may create a structure of long term dependency. There is a notion that the Department of Labour, AnCO or the Youth Employment Agency will provide some kind of scheme for young people.  That is demoralising for young people and leads nowhere.</P>
    <P>We must take a radical look at whether we continue to spend the millions of pounds we are spending on these kind of schemes and whether that is the right way to create long term employment.  I do not believe this is necessarily so.  There is room for a different view and for diverting some of the funds into different areas which would create long term employment. There is also the danger of creating a parallel labour force which would consist of workers who are uninsured and operate on a half-weekly basis.  What we are saying to people who are employed for two or three days a week is go away, earn what you can and we will turn a blind eye on you.  We are incorporating the black economy into the structure of society.  The black economy has reached the kind of proportion which threatens <Col N="3123" /> the tax structure of the State and the structure of Government.</P>
    <P>AnCO was set up in the sixties primarily to train apprentices but, like the Department, their role has changed.  It has changed in a kind of lurching way. AnCO have found themselves the recipient of millions of pounds through the EC Social Fund and have looked for ways in which to spend the money.  That has almost clouded the issue of how we should spend these funds, who we should be training and for what.  A certain amount of research has gone into this but the inertia remains.  Because the schemes have been in existence for a number of years they are being maintained and a real hard look at them is not being taken. Because 55 per cent of the cost of these schemes, that is the operational as opposed to the administrative cost, has been borne by the European Social Fund for 25 year olds, AnCO have directed their attention to a great extent to the under 25 year olds.  There is now to be seen and acknowledged a demographic shift.  There is no doubt that in a number of years the trend will be that those in the age group 25 to 40 years will make up the great majority of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The planning to take account of this is vital.  AnCO are being almost pressured into aiming at the younger age group and do not foresee the real problems.  There is another aspect to this.  Even those who are now unemployed and in the 25 to 40 age group may be, and often are, in the group who have been less well educated. About 90 per cent of people who finish school at present go as far as leaving cert and that means they have a much higher education than many people who left school 15 or 20 years ago.  They are the people who have been displaced by various industries which have closed down, by automation and so on.  They are the people who will not be able to become employed once more or who will find it very difficult to become employed.</P>
    <P>What have AnCO done about this shift?  Should we approach the EC ourselves? The Minister, in his speech, said <Col N="3124" /> that because the rules are tightening up in regard to the Social Fund we may find that a number of schemes will cease to exist as they will no longer be run under the auspices of the Social Fund.  Perhaps we should lead the way.  We should be saying that these are our problems.  They may not be the problems in Europe but they are the problems we face.  We do not have structural unemployment; we have quite a different problem.  We have people who are displaced from their jobs and young people, who are in the majority unemployed.  We should lead the way in Europe and say that the Social Fund should be designated to cater for those people.</P>
    <P>With the growth in unemployment towards the end of the seventies the shift in policy in AnCO away from training for industrial purposes and more towards back-to-work training schemes was quite different from what it started out to be. Priority must be given to training those who are weak.  I am concerned that the weak are being ignored to a large extent by AnCO and that even if the economy picks up they will not get jobs.  They are the one third of the unemployed who will not get attention in that way.  In relation to the Jobsearch programme, 150,000 people are supposed to be interviewed before the end of the year.  I doubt that very much because the figures given up to 8 May indicate that we are well short of that target.</P>
    <P>One of the problems I have been encountering is that of illiterate workers who received notification from the National Manpower Service to turn up for interview.  If they do not turn up they have a problem as their assistance may be cut off.  I imagine that a great number of those on long term unemployment assistance are in the less well educated bracket and that quite a number of them are illiterate.  One type of worker could have left school in his early teens, could have worked for 15 or 20 years on the building sites and would not have needed his reading and writing skills very much. When he loses his job on the buildings he is then left unemployed for a number of years.  Perhaps some of the Jobsearch <Col N="3125" /> schemes should be aimed at catering for those kinds of workers in particular. Courses will be run in relation to the Jobsearch scheme and I ask the Minister to provide some kind of course for illiterate workers who make up quite a substantial minority of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>One third of the unemployed are long term unemployed and a good number of the other two thirds move on and off the live register all the time.  The one third are the ones who need intensive attention but they are not getting it at present. They are becoming institutionalised in their unemployment.  They are the people who should be targeted from now on. The two thirds of the unemployed who move on and off the live register will get jobs eventually but perhaps not in the long term.  Even it they attend training schemes or experience programmes they tend to find jobs but there is still the one third who do not find jobs and for whom the AnCO schemes are not tailored. They are the people to whom we should be paying attention.  We should know exactly what kind of people are long term unemployed and do not move on and off the live register.  They are the people for whom AnCO should be catering.</P>
    <P>The Government should use AnCO as an instrument to fight unemployment but they are not doing so.  There is a bias towards AnCO producing figures for job placements.  Naturally they will try to attract people who will be placed easily but that is copping out of their responsibility. The Government have a responsibility to those who are long term unemployed.  They should do everything they can to make it more attractive for employers to take them on.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a question about the enterprise allowance scheme.  In the document, &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;, the allocation to the enterprise allowance scheme was shown to be reduced by £1.5 million or about 16 per cent.  The Department of Labour's annual report for 1986 indicated that the amount for enterprise allowance scheme was £11.2 million but in the Estimates the figure appears to have been only about £9 million.  I would like to know from where <Col N="3126" /> the figure of £11.2 million came.  If it is the real figure is there a very real decrease in the amount provided for this scheme?  In the document accompanying the budget there is allowance for a reduction of £1.5 million but it now appears that the reduction will be £2.5 million or 26 per cent.  This is disgraceful because the enterprise allowance scheme encourages people to be enterprising and not to look for jobs from other people.  We have no jobs and people are not offering jobs to other people.  We must encourage enterprise and encourage people to take as much control as they can.  In that light I ask the Minister to review this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of updating the equality legislation.  I believe it is already prepared and I would encourage the Minister to introduce it as soon as possible. The same applies to the safety, health and welfare at work legislation, particularly because many women in employment are not covered by legislation dealing with safety at work.</P>
    <P>My last comment will be on trade union reform legislation.  The Minister mentioned the ESB strike and said people were happy at the outcome.  I was not.  It was a strike which was totally unnecessary and pointed out the need for trade union reform.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to consider this: what curtailment, if any, of the rights of workers in the public utilities &mdash; monopolies &mdash; and which the Government have a final responsibility to maintain do he and the Government consider is necessary?  It is not good enough to rely on our present trade union legislation which is old and out of date and does not take into account the kind of society we have today.  This is well worth looking at. I believe there would be a lot of support around the country for some curtailment, not no strike clauses but some curtailment, to be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Like previous speakers I thank the Minister for the courtesy he has extended to me by keeping me informed of the happenings within his Department in recent weeks. <Col N="3127" /> There are a few points to which I would like to refer before I deal specifically with the Estimate.  Deputy Colley mentioned the curtailment of the activities of the unions in the public utilities and State sectors.  As a former State employee for 30 years I want to ask the Deputy if she, as a lawyer, thinks that those employed in the State sector should have conditions which are not as favourable as those in the private sector.  Like every other employee, State employees have a constitutional right and that point must be borne in mind when this legislation is being prepared.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change of heart by Deputy Birmingham when he advocated that State agencies should be used rather than private consultants when carrying out research work.  That is a significant change in the attitude of the Fine Gael Party, but I do not go along with his remarks in welcoming CERT.  I will reserve comment until we find out what the Minister has in mind as regards the streamlining of CERT and the other agencies.</P>
      <P>We have to bear in mind what Jobsearch really is and its roots.  Originally this came from the United States and is based on the assumption that jobs really exist and that if a person gets off his rump and goes out to look and learn, he will find a job.  That is far removed from reality.  There are approximately 250,000 people unemployed, and the Minister said he hoped that 40,000 of those who go through the Jobsearch process will secure employment.  What will happen to the other 210,000 people?  We can criticise AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and all other State agencies charged with the responsibility of providing jobs, but that will not solve the problem.  We have to be honest with ourselves. I realise I represent a minority in this House but unless there is a fundamental change in society, we will not see these unemployment figures reduced significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry has received as many incentives as possible.  The State has been very generous to industry but they did <Col N="3128" /> not deliver the jobs.  In 1977 when money was lavished on the private sector they failed to provide jobs and since then I have not seen anything which will lead me to believe that there will be an improvement in the situation if job creation is left in private hands.</P>
    <P>The State employee is fair game for everybody.  It is now undignified to work for the State.  I would like people in this House to bear in mind the effect this is having on State employees.  We are demoralising them and they cannot give their best performance because of these continued attacks which should stop forthwith.</P>
    <P>There are certain points in the Minister's speech about which I am very concerned, such as worker participation where he is offering positions at sub-board level.  This is a retreat from the position we took when we gave people representation at full board level.  I am concerned about what is in mind for the proposed venture between Imperial Chemical Industries and NET.  Up to now there were four worker directors on the board of NET, but that is being reduced simply because our new partners are not prepared to accept worker directors.  I do not believe we should take this kind of dictatorial attitude from any potential partner.  Will this organisation be with us when we run out of natural gas?  At present we are bending over backwards to accommodate them.  These comments may be far removed from the Labour Estimate but I am concerned about the position of the NET worker directors who are threatened with the loss of their places on the board of that organisation.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Social Fund.  Would the Minister give some consideration to diverting some of those funds to the health area thereby preserving some of the jobs which are at present threatened?  Is it possible to divert some of this money not to create jobs but to preserve jobs, which is equally important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the black economy.  The black economy does not only concern those at the bottom of the pile.  This is a national malaise and goes <Col N="3129" /> right across the board.  There are consultants in every field who are availing of it.  Deputy Colley said we were encouraging the black economy by giving people three days on and three days off.  It is worth bearing in mind that those who employ these people are not in that bracket.  It is usually people who can afford to go through the proper channels who are the real culprits.</P>
    <P>There are a few items in the Estimate about which I am concerned, such as grants for trade union Education and Advisory Services.  There has been a 1 per cent increase this year for this subhead, but there was a massive 38 per cent increase for the Irish Management Institute.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why it is all right to be miserly with the trade unions but lavish with the Irish Management Institute.  There is a 2 per cent increase to the College of Industrial Relations.  I do not believe we can maintain these services unless a bigger increase is granted.</P>
    <P>The major problem confronting the Department is unemployment, and from what I have seen in the Estimate, I am not encouraged.  In 1987 there are 249,000 on the live register.  This is a raw statistic which does not take into account the stress and strain placed on families. Employing people on short-term schemes gives them a purpose in life and relieves some of the psychological strain they were placed under due to unemployment. That was quite an achievement as it gave them dignity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

      <P>They must go on to something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The private sector are getting all the support and are expected to provide the jobs but they are not doing so.  I do not see anything in the Estimate which will lead to the elimination of the problem.  Subhead G shows an increase of 32 per cent of the budget for research into the Manpower service.  Will the Minister give some details on this item because unemployment statistics have been examined in minute detail?  There is a monthly Government publication on <Col N="3130" /> the live register, a NESC report on unemployment and a White Paper on Manpower Policy.  The Government Information Service produces a document which gives a comprehensive breakdown of employment statistics in terms of numbers of the population in and out of work.  There has also been a number of publications from the Youth Employment Agency and a useful publication on the long-term unemployed.  In addition, there are a whole host of publications from the EC and the OECD.  I should like to ask the Minister, therefore, where the budgetary increase of 32 per cent is for the Manpower service when, the same time, there is a drop of 26 per cent in the budget for the enterprise allowance scheme.  This has been a very successful scheme up to now and it is regrettable that the Minister has curtailed it.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Estimate indicates a drop of 19 per cent for An Comhairle Oiliúna and an increase of 38 per cent in grants for training under the Irish Management Institute.  Subhead P also shows a serious drop of 35 per cent for the employment incentive schemes.  The enterprise allowance and the employment incentive scheme have been the real success of this Department.  They were introduced by my colleague Deputy Quinn, and the Labour Party have every reason to be justifiably proud of them.  It is with regret that I see there is a cutback in these areas.  I hope it does not have any political undertones.  In view of the magnitude of the problems facing us at present, the stark absence of viable industries and the ongoing need for training of workers, I should like the Minister to explain the cutbacks to which I referred and to tell the House how he can justify such a reduction in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of the Coalition Government a number of initiatives were taken by the Department of Labour and the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, did an extremely good job despite scepticism expressed that it was a half-hearted venture. Derogatory comments were made across the floor of the House when the schemes were introduced.  This time last year we provided 10,000 jobs under the <Col N="3131" /> social employment scheme and it is regrettable it will not be continued.  There is ample evidence that viable work was done in this area.  In view of the success of some of these schemes and the big demand for them, I wish to express condemnation that the social employment scheme in particular has been whittled down by the Department while, at the same time, no advances have been made in the creation of long-term employment.</P>
    <P>The promised jobs in the food and technology industries are not likely to materialise especially as no additional funding has been provided in these areas. The reason we do not have any jobs in the food area is because we squandered the one opportunity we had in this regard. Erin Foods are part of the folklore of this country.  The main plank of every political party was that jobs should be provided from agri-based industries.  Erin Foods went into partnership with Heinz. Heinz prospered but Erin Foods perished. We are likely to face the same situation in NET.  The technology in Erin Foods was very advanced but we squandered it to get the marketing expertise of Heinz which, however, did not materialise. We were innocents abroad and we paid the price.  Any chance we had of securing jobs in the agri-based industries has vanished.</P>
    <P>Apart from attempting to whittle down the success of the social employment scheme, the Minister has behaved in a miserly way in reducing the take-home pay of participants in this scheme from £70 to £60, which is regrettable.  There were protests in the past in relation to taking a shilling off the old age pensioners and this is in the same category as it affects the most disadvantaged in the community.  Criticism was levelled at the previous Government for the reduction in the Christmas bonus and perhaps to a degree it was justified although good reasons were given at the time.  When the Labour Party introduced this scheme they did not suggest that £70 was an adequate weekly wage but for the present administration, with all their pre-election proclamations on poverty, to take away <Col N="3132" /> £10 from an already deprived group, is nothing short of criminal.  It reduces an already meagre income.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues on which I should like the Minister to comment, namely, training, health and safety at work, equity issues and progressive legislation on labour law.  I should also like the Minister to outline a proposal by his Department for his projections in relation to the workforce, problems in relation to the world of work and the training and education of workers to adapt to new technology industries. The advent of new technology has reduced the workforce, with serious implications for society.  I should also like to refer to those who, in the past, did non-skilled jobs.  New technology has made it difficult for such people to be retained in employment.  They could very well be permanently unemployed unless some action is taken.  It is high time we acknowledged that the world of work cannot be separated from the fabric of society. There must be a budgetary and legislative recognition that when there is a problem in the workforce there is a problem for society as a whole.  How does the Minister propose to meet the needs of the new technological era?  The Department of Education should ensure that school children and those currently unemployed are adequately trained and helped to find suitable employment in future.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate his plans for cohesion between all the training bodies.  I will also be interested to hear the Minister's plan for the introduction of regulations from the health and safety of workers to protect them from some of the most serious consequences of contamination from modern chemicals, exposure to radiation, VDUs and on on.  Ireland lags behind Europe in the implementation of the more progressive legislation and I should like the Minister to state his intentions in this regard.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the Bill in relation to health and safety on offshore installations last week and I look forward to its enactment. <Col N="3133" /> With regard to women in the workforce, I note the budget for the Employment Equality Agency is up by 10 per cent on last year.  I welcome this but there has not been enough development in the area of equality in the workforce.  Twelve years after the first equality directive, Irishwomen still earn only 68 per cent of the average industrial wage.  That is scandalous.  Despite the initiatives taken by a Labour Minister last year with the provision of a crèche in the Department of Labour the development of child care facilities has not been adequate.</P>
    <P>Women are still denied access to work outside the home because there are not sufficient facilities or reasonably priced child care operations.  It must be said that in this rapidly developing technological age if a woman opts out of the mainstream workforce to rear her children in the home she faces additional problems in trying to get back into the workforce.  Therefore, these difficulties must be given special priority in the Department of Labour and I would welcome any initiatives by the Minister in the equality area.  I would add that while employment is a major problem for all in society lack of skills and low wages are particular problems for women in Ireland and it is now long past the time when they should be seriously tackled.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to comment on his proposals for labour legislation particularly in the area of trade disputes. When in Opposition Deputy Ahern made some worrying statements about the need for new legislation in regard to the right of workers to strike and he made some damaging proposals in regard to secret ballots and strike action.  I am now even more worried having listened to Deputy Colley who has taken it a step or two further.  I would like the Minister to refer to these issues and assure the House that he will not be undertaking any new legislation without full consultation with the ICTU and that there will be no diminution of workers' rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>Although advocating better industrial relations, the Minister has cut the budget for trade union amalgamations and has <Col N="3134" /> increased the grant for trade union education by only 1 per cent less than inflation to which I have already referred, which in effect represents a cut in real terms.  I condemn both of these cutbacks. I might point out to the Minister that good industrial relations depend largely on a highly conscious management and work force.  Perhaps he would tell the House if the grant to the IMI provides training for management towards good industrial relations because as the Minister will be aware in terms of their handling of industrial disputes Irish management sadly lag behind the other OECD countries.  I would be grateful if the Minister would provide more detail on the issues raised by me and if he will outline his plans for job creation in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be as brief as possible as my colleague, Deputy Brennan, also wants to contribute.  The Minister dealt with the allocation to his Department, Department of Labour involvement in labour relations, marketing flexibility, the law, equality legislation and worker participation.  A previous speaker referred to leadership and I think that the Minister in the short space of time he has been in office has provided leadership and given people a little bit of hope.  Problems do exist in the Department of Labour and the Minister is prepared to sort these out and streamline the Department so that it will be of more benefit to the public than it has been up to now.  I commend the Minister for his handling of the ESB dispute which shows that he is prepared to consult with people in order to seek agreement with them rather than to seek confrontation. As a former trade union official, I believe that the trade unions have a very important role to play and I would prefer the Minister to consult and seek agreement with the unions rather than seeking confrontation with them during his period in office.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I agree that the trade unions have a very important role to play and it is important that they are not bullied. <Col N="3135" /> The biggest challenge facing the Minister at present is the one of unemployment. Politicians who were elected to this House for the first time in recent years were elected on the basis that they would do something about unemployment. Unfortunately, during the past few weeks the problem has got worse and no one seems to have either the imagination or the ability to do anything about it.  At present, there are 250,000 people unemployed many of whom are young people who have never had the opporunity of a job.  My own constituency has the highest unemployment rate in the country and contains young people in their mid-twenties, some married with a family, who have never had a job.  This puts an enormous strain on the family they are trying to rear and is certainly not good for themselves.  The loss of dignity, the frustration which is felt and the lowering of living standards which results from unemployment must be a source of concern to us all.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Jobsearch programme.  People have tended to be very critical of this programme but I feel it should be given a chance.  I know of many people who have been on unemployment assistance for quite some time and who have been contacted in regard to particular Jobsearch programmes.  They were pleased to know that at long last someone has recognised that they had problems and that they even existed. Those on long term unemployment assistance felt that they had been forgotten and that no one cared any more about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least, the Department are now prepared to try to find out if these people have a particular skill which would enable them to get a job.  It is important that they have been given this recognition and that there are people who are prepared to give them another chance.  Each person on the unemployment register lives in the hope that there will be another chance and that there is a possibility of getting a job.  It is for that reason that it is important that we as politicians and the public give this programme a chance.  We <Col N="3136" /> can all be critical of the programme but it deserves a chance and those on unemployment assistance deserve the opportunity of finding a job.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition I was very critical of the previous Government in regard to the Teamwork schemes.  The Teamwork scheme was a very good one but unfortunately the scheme which was to benefit those under 25 seemed to benefit only those in certain areas.  If there was a Minister or a Minister of State in a constituency that constituency availed of a Teamwork scheme far more than other constituencies where the need for a Teamwork scheme was greater.  I hope that will not happen when the Teamwork schemes gets under way again.  Teamwork schemes should be allocated on a fair basis to those counties who have many people under the age of 25 unemployed. Those young people should have the opportunity to avail of a year's work carrying out community projects within their own areas.  During the term of the previous Government there were only two Teamwork schemes in my own county even though numerous applications had been submitted.  The schemes were not allocated on a fair basis and I ask the Minister to ensure that when the Teamwork schemes are once more being allocated they will be allocated on the basis of unemployment trends.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is another very important scheme.  Without being biased, Wexford was the county which was chosen in which to run a pilot scheme.  This scheme proved to be very successful.  At one stage there were 400 people participating in the scheme but unfortunately this number has now decreased to between 120 and 130.  The Minister stated that there were a number of projects in the south-eastern region yet to be released.  There may be too much bureaucracy and red tape.  Rather than having to come to a central board in Dublin which seems to be the norm, decisions should be taken at local level to decide the schemes that would go ahead, to be implemented as quickly as possible.  In county councils and urban councils much valuable community work <Col N="3137" /> was done but the only problem was a lack of supervision.  Because of their financial position and lack of manpower some of these councils were not able to provide adequate supervision.  The Minister should examine the question of more stringent supervision on the social employment schemes.  Perhaps an extra allowance would be paid to appoint a supervisor over the groups working on the schemes.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there be an amalgamation of the schemes.  At the moment there are so many different schemes that people are confused. People go to Manpower and AnCO; there is Teamwork and there are social employment schemes.  I welcome the Minister's efforts to tackle this problem. It is important not to have duplication of resources.  The person who wants to get a job or be employed on a scheme should be able to avail of the information in one area with regard to all the jobs available.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's decision in relation to CERT.  They are doing a magnificent job.  It is important that they be left to do that job and not be amalgamated or tied up in a manner not in their best interests.  In the Great Southern Hotel in Rosslare there are CERT schemes in operation which are proving worthwhile and successful.  They are ensuring that many young people are finding jobs in hotels and other areas of catering, food processing, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The black economy was mentioned.  This is one critical area seriously affecting legitimate firms and it must be tackled.  I do not go along with the view that the people who are working in the black economy are always wrong. Deputy O'Sullivan made a point about the employers.  This is an area that some Minister some day shortly will start looking at seriously.  There should be a serious view taken of those who employ people in the black economy knowing they are in receipt of unemployment assistance. <Col N="3138" /> Heavy fines should be imposed on them. The fine for a first offence should be increased for subsequent offences.  Many of those who are employing people who are in receipt of social assistance are well capable of employing them on a full time basis paying the full rate.  That system is not in the best interests of the country and certainly not in the interests of those who are trying to run a business on a fair and legitimate basis.  These people are going to the wall because they are not able to compete.  In the past couple of weeks I was talking to a plumber who has had to go out of business because when he gives quotations to prospective customers they get a quotation from somebody in the black economy which is accepted because it is cheaper.  This is causing serious problems.</P>
      <P>The other area on which I should like briefly to comment is work experience. This is a good scheme in its own right. However, employers are abusing it. Many employers take on young people for six months' work experience and a week before the time is up they say in many cases the person is not suitable, has not got the skills for the particular job and that person is let go.  The employer goes back to Manpower and takes on other young people and the same thing happens to them.  The Manpower offices have a critical role to play in detecting this.  Many good companies employ people on work experience and keep them on when their six months is up, but many abuse the system to a fine art.  At the end of the day the young people are the sufferers.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Manpower office people will be on the look-out for this type of abuse, will stamp it out and encourage companies to employ the young people on a permanent basis when work experience has been gained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his work in the Department in the very short time he has been there.  He has shown he is prepared to give leadership and to consult with the different sections in the wide range of the Department of Labour of which he is in charge.  If he continues on that road, the Department of Labour will <Col N="3139" /> become more streamlined and more relevant to the problems facing the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Browne for sharing some of his time with me.  I am going to speak very briefly and, in particular, about the social employment schemes. This is my first opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. He was a good Opposition spokesperson on Labour and is doing an excellent job since becoming Minister.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the social employment schemes when introduced by the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn.  I remember going to their launching at Summerhill College in Sligo.  We in Sligo and the unions agreed that people should be on the social employment schemes and had no difficulty in finding people to work on these schemes.  When one represents a rural area where people and, in particular, small farmers are drawing unemployment assistance, one finds these people crying out for a job.  The social employment schemes brought these people back to work, not five days a week but three days or three mornings a week. Their children saw them going out to work and this was the only employment available to them in a rural area.  That is why I support these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the schemes did not reach the projected level which was for 10,000 jobs, but 7,900 people are employed nation-wide last year.  I would have preferred if the full number had been employed and would be delighted if the Minister added another 10,000 jobs for this year.  Unfortunately, he decided to increase the number by only 1,500.  That is not enough.  We had people in long-term unemployment who, for the first time in years, were doing some work.  One could see the way the countryside had changed as a result of the social employment scheme.  People were once again cutting hedges.  As Deputy Browne said county councils did not have adequate money to maintain roads but this maintenance was carried out under the social employment <Col N="3140" /> scheme.  The countryside looked much better.  Motorists did not run the risk of tearing the mirrors off their cars while they were driving along roads because hedges had been cut and roads repaired.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to try to increase the numbers employed in the social employment scheme from 1,500 this year to at least 5,000.  I know that the social employment scheme does not give full time employment but it would give a much needed boost in an area of high unemployment sectors I represent.  One man who came to me recently had spent a year in the social employment scheme. He had now gone back on to unemployment assistance of £93 a week.  He was taking home in the region of £84 a week when he was employed on the social employment scheme.  He felt that even though he is now getting £9 a week extra he would prefer to have to get up in the mornings and go to work because the weeks are very long when one is at home doing nothing.  He felt much better when he was going to work.  I welcome the introduction of any scheme whether it is temporary or full time because people want to work.  I hope that the Jobsearch programme will encourage people to go to work.  Jobs have been created as a result of the Jobsearch programme and I hope they will continue to be created. Unemployed people need encouragement to go out and do courses.</P>
    <P>AnCO are doing an excellent job through their courses.  They run courses as an introduction to industry.  I fully support them.  I was in Sligo last Monday at the presentation of awards to the best AnCO apprentices.  It was wonderful to see the work AnCO are doing in their training centres around the country.  I know that these courses cost a lot of money and that much of this money comes from the social fund, but we should appeal to Ministers to try to get as much money as possible from these funds so that more employment can be created.</P>
    <P>Schools throughout the country and, in particular, in rural Ireland were not as well kept in the past as they are now. Unlike some bigger schools, many schools were unable to pay for a caretaker <Col N="3141" /> to look after the school.  The National Manpower Service employed people for one year to maintain schools, cutting the grass painting or doing other necessary work.  As a result of the social employment scheme schools in rural Ireland look much better now.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a good job and I hope he continues to do so.  Thirteen per cent or 15 per cent &mdash; I am not too sure which amount is correct &mdash; of the money in the social employment scheme comes from Europe.  The Minister should look for more money.  There is little difference between the money people would get on unemployment assistance and what the Minister will get in the grant from Europe.  It is much better to have people going out and doing something rather than staying at home and doing nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate before you came in, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we felt that if the spokesmen in the various parties had been allowed to divide the time we would perhaps have used it better because we were in a race against time earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the spokesmen for the parties, Deputy Birmingham, Deputy Colley, Deputy O'Sullivan and my colleagues Deputy Browne and Deputy Brennan for going to the trouble of staying back rather late to contribute to what we all consider an important Estimate.  We are not enamoured of being on at the time we were on tonight.  I did not get an opportunity to finish my prepared script earlier on.  If I could read the last page of it it <Col N="3142" /> might help with regard to some of the questions that were raised, particularly by Deputy Birmingham and Deputy Coley.  They were fair questions.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour, I have responsibility for the formulation and implementation of manpower policy. The central direction in policy formulation must come from Government through to the Minister for Labour.  I intend to ensure that the Department of Labour will be better equipped to advise me in relation to policy, that is, to see where manpower policy fits, now and in the future, in the framework of economic and social policy, including education and social welfare and to develop the best options in relation to objectives and strategies. This will enable me to determine the general objectives to be served by the new Authority and will involve laying down broad guidelines as to how the Authority will carry out their responsibilities. I intend furthermore, to bring about a qualitative change in the relationship which has obtained between the Department and the manpower authorities.</P>
    <P>For a long time the relationships between Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies seem to have been based on the view that efficiency required the minimum interference with the operations of these enterprises.  I am certainly not in favour of nit-picking controls. But neither do I condone the situation which has existed in the past where no real attention was given to criteria for the effectiveness of policies or to standard performance.  For the future, I expect the Department of Labour, as far as concerns manpower policy, to focus more on what the economy and our society need, not just on what the interests brought together in the new Authority would readily identify as being within their capacity to supply.  I will expect fundamental questioning of existing programmes, irrespective of the attraction of ESF resources or their low net Exchequer costs.  This work has already started and, with the right volume and quality of resources, I have no doubt that the Department will face <Col N="3143" /> up to the challenge and the opportunity presented by this new role.</P>
    <P>I look forward to discussing the details of that policy.  I hope that with the assistance of the spokesmen of the parties &mdash; which I have been promised and which I know from experience during the last two and a half months that I will get &mdash; we can get a manpower authority Bill through this House prior to the summer recess so that the important work, as Deputy Birmingham pointed out, of getting the organisation up and running and being efficient and effective and playing their proper role can be undertaken. Many points were raised by a number of people including me over the last three or four years.  It was I who forced the previous administration, by non-stop reference to the issue of the agencies, highlighting the duplication and overlapping, the contradictions, the lack of policy and direction, to implement the manpower policy, the first policy in 21 years.  It was not Deputy Quinn's fault, the blame lies with a lot of other people also.</P>
    <P>We had a debate where the House did not divide&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I got little thanks for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thanked the Deputy at the time and I thank him again now. The support for the legislation has enabled us to implement a manpower policy.  I need the assistance of Deputies to get on with it.  If the agencies come together many anomalies will be highlighted and a number of points made by Deputy Colley in her contribution will come to light and we can work on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Deputy Birmingham's point that nobody has changed the world in the last ten weeks.  However, the Deputy having been in the Department of Labour, in the Department of Education and in the Department of Foreign Affairs will know that while under our system Ministers change, the civil servants remain and that their valuable work remains from one administration to another.  That is the situation under our <Col N="3144" /> Constitution.  When you become a Minister you do not take your predecessor's files and burn them, especially when you see that a lot of the work was started by yourself many years ago.  I felt obliged to continue the work in endeavouring to bring some of the items of legislation to a final conclusion.  I know Deputies will agree with that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Manpower Authority, legislation will be circulated shortly.  The work of the Barrington Commission relates to a complex area and Deputy Birmingham suggested that perhaps this could go to a committee of the House.  This is very technical, legalistic and very important.  Deputy Colley referred to a number of aspects including the role of women and how they are covered by the Act.  It will be the end of the year, if not next year, when that legislation is ready.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations, I am taking up the position of the previous Minister. Deputy O'Sullivan will accept that the previous Minister did his utmost to produce a discussion document but it cannot be successful with the social partners unless it is amended.  By tradition, the Minister for Labour is the referee in these things and it is clear to me that neither the FUE nor the ICTU will accept that document without amendment. With the assistance of the Department I have been in preliminary discussions with all parties to try to progress.  I take the point made by all three spokespersons that it is necessary to have some success. I do not hold the view that we must amend the 1906 Act because it is 81 years old, but we need progress in the area.  I know we will have the support of all parties in the House in achieving progress but it has to be with the agreement of the social partners.</P>
    <P>I referred already to Jobsearch and to the management advisory body.  There is a lot of support for progress in that area and for trying to get one meaningful organisation involved in management rather than a conglomeration of organisations such as there are at present.</P>
    <P>In relation to equality legislation, substantial work has been done in the <Col N="3145" /> Department on that.  In reply to a question recently I said that rather than bringing in legislation, because there had been a number of European law cases which would change things, the Department would review what was there and all that had happened recently and would bring forward a proper package.  That will be available into 1988.</P>
    <P>We all know the story of the Offshore Bill which has been in circulation for 20 years.  Hopefully I will be the Minister who will finally conclude that legislation. I announced tonight that the findings of reviews undertaken on legislation relating to dismissals, employment equality and payment of wages would be issued within the Department and that we would have a broadly based reasoned discussion prior to bringing in legislation.</P>
    <P>The general understanding in this House on Labour policy in the last few years is that while the Department of Labour are within reason involved in job creation as are every other Government Department, jobs will be created by the performance of Government mainly in the economic areas.  The drive for job creation should come from the Department of the Marine, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture and Food and so on. The Department of Labour has a role but they cannot create great numbers of jobs. The agencies were set up initially to provide training schemes so that industry would get experienced people.  There was a great demand for trained people for the growing industries.  The role of the agencies under the Department of Labour is now different and I accept Deputy Colley's point that the Department has changed from what was envisaged at the outset.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham referred to co-operation with the Department of Education. It is my intention to bring the co-operation that existed at Minister of State level &mdash; and I know the Deputy did a lot of work in that area &mdash; to ministerial level and to continue that work perhaps on a higher plane than before.  A point was made that the Department do not have <Col N="3146" /> the personnel to deal with all the problems. The Department face a continual battle for resources.  I know the Deputy will be aware of the difficulties.  I will continue the battle hopefully with as much or more success than the Deputy and his colleagues had.</P>
    <P>In relation to the SES, I told Deputy Spring recently when he accused me of not supporting the SES that I spoke not only in this House but on several occasions around the country in support of the SES.  I always thought it a good idea.  I supported the environmental works scheme from the time I came into this House in 1977.  It is always difficult for people to get sustainable and gainful long term employment.  There is always a necessity, particularly in these difficult economic times, to have environmental works or social employment type schemes.  In discussions with our partners in Brussels we highlight continually the benefit of the many resources we can get and we try to get whatever resources are necessary.  However, Deputies will appreciate that anything being negotiated now is for next year and thereafter. The overall view on the Social Fund is that while discussions are taking place now any financial benefits arising there-from will not come for at least 18 months.</P>
    <P>The quotas are now introduced for every region and that should help to ensure a better national spread for the projects.  As I have said several times at the city council, I regret that the position about Dublin ever came about.  The matter is being pursued through contracts with the unions and the monitoring committee. We must acknowledge that there are difficulties.  They are to be regretted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister optimistic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been involved in these discussions for two years.  I cannot say that I know the latest position on the monitoring committee but it would be hard to achieve change because people have taken certain stances.  At city council level we have endeavoured to get a change of attitude on the basis that the <Col N="3147" /> same unions who allow the schemes to work in other local authority areas are blocking them within the corporation.  I could never understand the rationale of that and I have said so in Opposition, as leader of the majority group on the council, as Lord Mayor of the city and chairman of the council and I say it again now as Minister.  However, we continue to pursue it in the hope of a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>I can inform Deputy Colley that all schemes are being reviewed now within the Department with the assistance of the ESRI and that a new management and review system is being developed covering all the operations of the Departments in an effort to keep the matter up to date. That is in line with what I said here today.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made about criticisms of some of the schemes.  If Deputies at any time come across points such as how the schemes are unfairly used or if they see contradictions or ambiguities I would be very glad to hear from them because I do not consider myself to be the sole knowledge holder of all that happens in each region.  In Opposition I was able to give useful information which I picked up from my colleagues throughout the country.  I would be very glad to get opinions, views, reviews or suggestions about improvements from any Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The health area already benefits from the Social Fund to the maximum extent allowed by the rules of the fund and £18.55 million was given through the ESF for disabled people in 1986.  Prolonged debates go on in this regard and great work is done by the officials who operate in this area and who achieve phenomenal success for this country.  The work of the ESF is co-ordinated through the Department for which I have the honour to be Minister.  Those officials do an outstanding job within the guidelines in getting money for a number of areas and a debt of gratitude is due to <Col N="3148" /> them for the exercise of their expertise since we joined the EC.</P>
      <P>With regard to worker participation, the reason I emphasised in my speech the sub-board aspect of new legislation is that that is the main new feature of the legislation. In the legislation which was previously before the House and which I hope to bring back to the House again, a number of worker directors were to be appointed to boards at full level, but the new feature is the fairly lengthy list of people who we have in a number of agencies at sub-board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a device to give workers full participation in the running of a company with representation at sub-board level.  At least that is the feeling among some of the worker directors in some of the companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation can be brought back for full debate.  A great deal is to be gained by having a sub-board level.  As the Deputy knows, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among worker directors with the role they have at present, as some of them have told both of us in the not too distant past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation which the previous Minister issued and which I am reviewing and will bring back in some form, amended perhaps, extends the number of worker directors at full board level but it focuses for the first time on the sub-board level which is supported, though not in all cases, by the worker directors and the ICTU.  However, there is a reluctance in some organisations even to have an input at sub-board level.  If there be directors at full board and at sub-board level and if there is not agreement and goodwill the chances of any kind of success or real progress in avoiding the difficulties we would all like to avoid are small.  There is no point in bringing in worker directors at either full or sub-board level if that will not help to alleviate the difficulties.  The matter <Col N="3149" /> requires a delicate balance in handling. It requires agreements between management and unions.  That is the whole ethos of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Regarding the other point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan I intend, along with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to meet the NET workers.  Deputy Reynolds and I expect that the Government will give them assurances about consultation, maintenance and forms of worker participation in any future venture.  The discussion will be ongoing so I will keep the Deputy informed about what happens.</P>
      <P>The matter of Teamwork was raised by Deputy Browne.  The Department have some funds for this area.  Therefore, if Deputies wisht to put forward projects I will be glad to look at the applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally on the social employment scheme, the decrease from £70 to £60 does not apply to any of the present participants. It applies to new participants. The increase in the provisional budget from 7,900 to 9,400 participants, an increase of 1,500 was achieved by getting extra funds through reducing the amount by £10.  The majority of people who avail of the SES are single and that is the attraction from the start.  The maximum they can get in unemployment assistance is £36 but if they are living at home many of them would get £13, £14, or £16, so this scheme is considerably attractive to them.  As emphasised in this debate and by the representations which I get within the Department, there is a huge demand for this scheme and if the amount was £40 or £50 the demand would still be huge.  My only regret is that it is not possible within the resources we have to take on far more people but the reduction has no effect at all on interest in the <Col N="3150" /> scheme so far as new applicants are concerned. As Deputy Brennan pointed out, interest in the scheme has not wanted; it is still strongly supported.</P>
    <P>I was asked how the figures operate in relation to the regions.  For example, the east region has a quota of 2,619, the south east 1,024, the south west 1,299, the mid-west 788, the west 930, the north west 891, the north east 671 and the midlands 678, giving a total of 8,900.  Those quotas are continuously reviewed, the monitoring committee ensuring that the quota is taken up in each area.  At an early stage some counties received a higher quota than they would have done had there been a take-up on a national basis.  That caused some difficulties.  The monitoring committee have endeavoured to spread the quotas as fairly as possible ensuring that the relevant resources are used to best advantage.  I can assure Deputy Browne that it is done on the basis of a fair rationale, with no desire to jeopardise the whole thing.  While I might be sorely tempted to do that, bearing in mind the unemployment level obtaining in my constituency, I can assure Deputies that it is based on an equitable distribution of the resources available within the Department.</P>
    <P>On the industrial relations scene a number of Deputies said we must endeavour to push forward, resolving some of the difficulties obtaining.  I do not want to answer any particular point in detail because that tends immediately to become the focus of discussion.  I am endeavouring in so far as I can to get the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to sit, hopefully around the one table, or alternatively, separate tables, in an effort to make progress on the ongoing discussions on industrial relations.  I can assure Deputies O'Sullivan and Colley that that is my wish.  Progress in this area is a matter of priority.  These discussions go back throughout the terms of office of probably all my predecessors, to that of our President, the then Minister for Labour in 1966, in an effort to make progress in this area.  There have been continuous discussions, reviews and very <Col N="3151" /> little legislation.  To focus on any one area perhaps is not the most useful exercise. I would rather ascertain the extent of agreement that can be reached and effect legislative changes where such would be useful and beneficial.  I am on record as having specified areas where such could be useful.</P>
    <P>I have said on a number of occasions since assuming office that our concept of having 10,000 cases annually referred to third parties for arbitration is not something that is healthy or augurs well for industrial relations.  It would be much better if management and unions &mdash; at ground floor or shop floor level &mdash; were able to resolve their grievances.  I do not know whether the answer lies in legislation. We must work towards ensuring that people talk and consult with each other in a civilised way in an effort to resolve their differences.  The point I made about the ESB dispute earlier was not that I was satisfied that it had occurred and had been resolved but rather that it had been brought to a conclusion quicker than might have been the case.  I am equally hopeful that the prospective dispute in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta will be averted by people having spent considerable hours this very day working toward a resolution in an orderly fashion, sensibly trying to resolve their difficulties rather than by way of conflict and harassment.  It should be remembered that ultimately people must sit down and resolve their problems, that reasoned debate or consultation constitutes a much better way than confrontation. Any work in which we engage, any amendments or changes we propose in the industrial relations field, should concentrate on persuading people to sensibly consider options rather than taking industrial action which affects the public at large and not only the parties in conflict.  That is the role I should like to play in that regard, to ensure the de-escalation of industrial disputes so that we improve the overall view of this country from that of one in which there are wildcat strikes and too many man days lost, with too much industrial dispute and <Col N="3152" /> conflict.  It should be remembered that we badly need investment.  I would ask Deputies to assist me in trying to achieve that aim, whether that be by way of amending legislation or whatever and leading to better industrial relations generally. We need strikes like we need a hole in the head, whether they be official or unofficial.  We all wish to have fewer man days lost through strikes and fewer unofficial strikes.  We want our economy viewed as one that can attract industrialists, one in which workers and management can co-operate in overcoming their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies and the spokespersons in particular for their contributions and co-operation.  I can assure them that I will keep them informed of our legislative programme.  I would ask their co-operation in having that legislation passed in the weeks leading up to the summer recess so that the important work of having such legislative provisions implemented can be effected during the recess.</P>

I should like to know on what that increase has been based.  I referred to the grants for trade union education at plus 1 per cent and the College of Industrial Relations at plus 2 per cent. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on those increases.</P>

There is a danger that one or other, or indeed both of the social partners, might take the view that if those discussions go on long enough, they will see him off stage.  That is not to suggest that his term of office will be short.

      <P>As regards Deputy O'Sullivan's point, the Department have used the money to the best advantage. The Deputy asked about trade union amalgamations and the money given to them by the Department. A substantial sum of money was paid recently when the Workers' Union of Ireland amalgamated with NATE.  The question of IPC has been under discussions and we have had informal discussions with those involved.  I will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the points made by Deputy Birmingham, I take his first point and would be extremely worried about it.  I will take his advice and try not to walk <Col N="3154" /> into the fatal trap.  It is always useful to have co-operation but particularly so because of our precarious Dáil position. As regards the points made about the social fund, we will use whatever opportunities we have, both formally and informally, to put forward our special case to our colleagues in Europe.  This is continually done at Departmental level.  Yesterday officials from my Department were in Brussels lobbying on this issue. We will take every opportunity to put forward this country's case during the summer.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Spanish Fishing Trawlers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important question.  It concerns not just the fishermen off the south-west coast but all fishermen.  Is the Minister for Fisheries aware of the tension which exists between our native fishing trawlers and British registered, Spanish owned fishing trawlers operating off the south-west coast? An incident occurred yesterday off the south-west coast.  A Spanish owned trawler, <i>Autumn Swallow,</i> fishing under a flag of convenience came within 30 feet of our own 18 foot Dunmore East trawler the <i>Gary Og</i>.  It was not only a ramming attempt but an attempt to cut the fishing trawler's gear.  This was a very serious incident and it was committed on lucrative fishing grounds off the south west coast.  It was not an isolated case.  Several other incidents have occurred in the past seven days in the same area.  A few days ago, giant Spanish fishing boats ganged up on a Castletownbere trawler and made life very unpleasant for the skipper.  If these pirates of the sea accost our fishermen and impede them in making a decent living we cannot stand idly by.  We must ensure ample protection is given to our fishing trawlers.  They are competing against all the odds.  They operate trawlers which are only half the size of the <Col N="3155" /> giant Spanish vessels operating under a flag of convenience.</P>
      <P>It is well know that these trawlers which are operated by Spanish concerns are trying to isolate an area 25 miles by ten miles off the south-west coast.  This action cannot be tolerated.  We must ensure that no barriers are put in the way of our fishermen.  It is bad enough to have Spanish trawlers coming within 12 miles of our coastline but if they put up barriers off our shores and prohibit our fishermen from making a living we cannot stand idly by.  It is bad enough for our fishermen to have to compete with their European counterparts when they do not have comparable boats.  Successive Governments must take the blame for the standard of these trawlers.</P>
      <P>The coral bank is one of the most lucrative fishing grounds in the world.  It contains a huge amount of hake which is a very valuable fish especially in the Spanish market and it is one of the dearest fish offered for sale on that market.  That is why the Spaniards are trying to keep our fishermen out of this area.  The Minister should do everything possible to make sure that our fishermen are given an equal opportunity to fish in these lucrative grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of what benefit to our economy are Spanish trawlers flying a flag of convenience? There is no evidence of them giving any great employment.  They got a special concession to establish a factory in Castletownbere.  We were told 150 people would be employed there but the factory is now on the point of closure. There is only a skeleton staff of 12 people there now.  If this is an example of the kind of return we can expect from them it is high time we renegotiated their terms with them.  We must ensure that whatever benefit accrues from their having a base here percolates into the economy.  I fail to see any great evidence of employment being created by their presence here.  I can assure the House and the Minister that practically all their stores and supplies are purchased in their home port of Vigo in the north of Spain.  The only thing, as far as I can ascertain, which <Col N="3156" /> they purchase in Castletownbere is ice for their lucrative catch of hake off the coral fishing grounds.  We cannot tolerate that any longer.</P>
    <P>It is also a well known fact that those people have no regard for the safety or the rights of legitimate fishermen.  The sooner they are stopped fishing in these areas the better because they are not of any great benefit to the fishing industry in this country.  Practically 95 per cent of their catch is landed in Vigo in Spain. The fish landed in Castletownbere is put into ice and taken by container traffic to Spain for the market there.  That fish is not even processed in this country and, therefore, those fishermen are of no benefit to the economy.  For that reason I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to ensure that our native fishermen are not impeded in seeking their rightful share of the catch of hake off the south-west coast and the north-west coast because very shortly our fishermen will be impeded in fishing off that coastline also.  I ask the Minister to take immediate steps to rectify the situation and to ensure that the lives of our fishermen are not endangered.</P>
    <P>About three or four weeks ago a Schull-based trawler was almost mowed down by a Spanish boat.  The Spanish fishermen adopted a bullying attitude towards our Irish fishing boats.  They do not want the Irish fishing boats operating off the south-west coast.  If they are not curbed in their activities, very serious incidents could occur in the not too distant future.  For that reason I ask the Minister to take every precaution possible, from tonight onwards, to ensure that our fishermen are not impeded in catching their rightful share of fish in the lucrative fishing grounds of the coral bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that Deputy Sheehan should come into the House when we are discussing this matter.  In my engineering capacity I played a key role in the design of the Eiranova plant in Castletownbere.  I thought at that stage that the joint venture partnership with the Spanish interests was a progressive step in the <Col N="3157" /> processing of fish in the Castletownbere and the Dinish Island area and as Deputy Sheehan said, would create some jobs in the added value area of fish processing which would be very welcome.  Therefore, it would be most unfortunate if this experiment in joint venture to bring value added fish processing onshore should be in any way impeded by the difficulties which have been outlined by Deputy Sheehan who is very close to the situation. These difficulties should not cloud the potential for further joint venture processing in the fish industry which we all agree has great potential.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is making great strides to endeavour to ensure that the wealth of the sea, the processing, the added value and the export potential of the fish processing industry is fully maximised. Therefore, the inflow of foreign investment to aid fish processing, which does not seem to have materialised in the Eiranova experiment in Castletownbere, should leave these vessels fishing our waters under a flag of convenience. Whatever the agreement was, a lot can be gleaned and learned from it.  If there are restrictions or modifications <i>vis-á-vis</i> the use of the Irish flag they should be inter-related to ensure we get the maximum potential we all believed would be the result of the Eiranova experiment. It is unfortunate that Deputy Sheehan informed the House that there is a conflict because in the fishing grounds there is probably adequate stocks for all concerned and fish exports could be maximised.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that the Eiranova plant is used to the maximum. It is a very fine, modern processing plant. I think it has been allowed deteriorate somewhat in recent years but it is still a very fine plant in a key location and in an area that needs onshore job creation.  I hope these temporary problems can be ironed out.  I have no doubt the Minister will make every effort to ensure that the difficulties and conflicts which have been mentioned tonight can be ironed out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish Deputies to confuse two <Col N="3158" /> separate and distinct issues.  The issue of Eiranova is separate from the issue which has been raised by Deputy Sheehan and I think the Deputy is fully aware of that. I share Deputy Sheehan's concern regarding these incidents and allegations of incidents in the south-west fishing grounds.  Unfortunately, these incidents have been a fairly regular feature of fishing activities in this area at this time of year for a number of years past and the Deputy is well aware of that.  As the Deputy said, these incidents are deplorable and dangerous and they certainly will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>When it was brought to our notice in mid-May &mdash; as the Deputy knows fishing activity in that area starts about the end of April and continues until the end of June &mdash; that there were allegations of horseplay and irregular activity in this area, the Minister of State in my Department issued a very firm statement and requested the Minister for Defence to arrange that the Naval Service would investigate the allegations of harassment of Irish fishing vessels.  As a result, the Navy visited the area and a number of reports were received from them following the instruction which we passed on to the Department of Defence, that we had allegations that this kind of activity was taking place there, that it was deplorable and regrettable and that the Navy should intervene.  As a result of Navy intervention it is my understanding that the incidents have now ceased and that peace has been restored.  However, we are keeping the situation very much under surveillance.  As I said, the Department of Defence and the Navy have visited the area, have made a number of boardings and have taken a number of statements and these matters will be followed up.</P>
      <P>The efforts we have made in that area have been acknowledged by the representatives of the fishermen.  I received a telex on 22 May from Mr. John Nolan, manager of the Castletownbere Fishermen's Co-Operative, on behalf of the fishermen in Castletownbere and the Irish fishermen in general.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3159" /> I wish to congratulate you on the excellent job the Navy has done over the last few weeks and on the number of arrests of foreign boats illegally fishing our waters.</P>
    <P>That telex was sent to congratulate the Department, the Naval Service, the Minister of State and myself for the very swift action we have taken in that area and to assure us of their co-operation in seeing that illegal fishing is stamped out.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify what is taking place there.  As the Deputy knows, a number of boats fish in this area &mdash; about 50 in all.  This is a lucrative fishing area where we have approximately 15 boats operating, some French boats, some United Kingdom boats and a number of boats of Spanish origin registered under the United Kingdom flag of convenience arrangement which the Deputy speaks about.  Their right to fish there is guaranteed as they are legitimately registered under the United Kingdom licensing arrangement.  They are legally and legitimately entitled to operate there.  Their quota is similar to ours and to that of other boats, but they are not entitled to behave in the manner about which we have had reports and every effort will be made by us to ensure that this will not continue.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, regulations and legislation were introduced here in 1983 by his own Minister in an endeavour to control operations in this locality and <Col N="3160" /> to control the flag of convenience arrangement.  As a result of that legislation up to 50 boats were prosecuted for breaches of the controls and regulations in 1985, 34 boats were prosecuted in 1986 and already this year 15 have been apprehended. We will continue to do this where we find breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Clashes, which are not a feature in this area but are taking place in many other areas, are deplorable and it is not in the interests of any of those involved to behave in this way.  At present I am examining the possibility of taking further legislative measures to prevent this type of unruly behaviour.  It is also my intention to raise this issue at the Council of Fisheries Ministers meeting in Brussels and through the European Community and to take it up with the ministers of member states involved to ensure that this kind of unruly behaviour is stamped out.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I share the Deputy's concern about this matter.  I thank him for the opportunity to put on record the fact that we deplore this type of activity and that no effort will be spared by us to see that it is stamped out. I will raise this matter with the Minister involved and at Community level at the very earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 May 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 20 together.  Satellite television services are being relayed on cable systems as an experiment and without charge to subscribers during the experimental period.  One purpose of the experiment is to enable cable companies to assess the demand for these services and obtain their subscribers' views on the question of possible payment for them if they are to become a permanent feature. Therefore, during this experimental period it is important that subscribers make their views known on these issues to their cable operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some satellite delivered services will be made available by the programme providers to cable operators without charge; others will not.  At this stage cable operators are fully aware of my preference that any additional charge that might be proposed should be levied on the basis that only those who want to receive the <Col N="2883" /> additional services will be required to pay.</P>
    <P>The results of market research to be undertaken by Cablelink, the main provider of cable television services, and with which my Department intend to be closely involved, will assist in determining subscribers' preferences in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 55, together.  It is generally accepted now by the experts that the effects of the Chernobyl disaster in Ireland were not serious.  The results of the Nuclear Energy Board's monitoring programme for radioactive contamination carried out since the disaster, as outlined in their recently published report &ldquo;Chernobyl Its Effects On Ireland&rdquo;, show that, although the levels of radioactivity were for a period higher than normal background levels, they were not hazardous to health. These conclusions are broadly in line with the results of independent studies carried out in Ireland.  Nevertheless, the disaster demonstrates the potentially serious and widespread effects which a nuclear accident involving a release of radioactivity can have.</P>
      <P>When the accident occurred the Government recognised that the NEB resources were very limited and that the board could not organise our national response to the emergency without considerable help from the universities, Government Departments and other semi-State bodies.  The board were granted additional staff and equipment and work is now proceeding towards the development of a new laboratory at Clonskeagh. I generally endorse the conclusions of the NEB report on Chernobyl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lessons learned include the need to have an integrated comprehensive environmental monitoring system in operation in order to quickly detect any increases in radioactive contamination, the need to respond quickly to any significant increase and the need to have better communication of information to the public.  These and other aspects will <Col N="2888" /> be incorporated into the national emergency plan which is at present at an advanced stage of preparation.  I will shortly be submitting the plan to Government for approval.</P>

      <P>Details of the proposed State board to develop the forestry industry are being worked out.  It is too early, therefore, to indicate the exact level of resources which will be available to it.  The legislation will, however, provide for the transfer from the Forest and Wildlife Service of the necessary resources such as lands, forestry, machinery and staff to enable it to carry out its commercial functions. The establishment of the new body will not affect private forest development. So far as Bord na Móna are concerned, the Government considered fully their interest in forestry and came to the conclusion that a separate State agency would more effectively achieve the objects set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  This new agency will have exclusive responsibility for public forestry.</P>

Included in this programme is the development by the ESB of small-scale hydroelectric generating facilities at ten proposed locations.  The sites in question are on Loughs Duff, Fadda, Coomaglaslaw, Garagarry, Tooreenbeg, Coomnacronia and the Glanmore River, all in County Kerry; Barley Lake in County Cork; the Bonet River in County Leitrim and the Devlin River in County <Col N="2890" /> Donegal.

      <P>It is difficult at this stage to be precise as to the employment potential of the programme but I am informed that the construction work required may involve up to 20 jobs per site.

Our projected dependence on coal is 24 per cent by the year 2000.

This policy must continue to safeguard our energy security.  Under our energy conservation programme, advice is given to industrial, commercial and domestic consumers on the efficient use of coal.  Future developments in coal usage must of course have regard to environmental considerations, but responsibility for these does not come within the domain of my Department.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Soviet authorities gave a detailed account of the accident at an IAEA meeting in Vienna in August 1986.  That report did not deal with effects outside the Soviet Union.  More recently in two separate press conferences held in Vienna in March and April 1987, the Soviet authorities indicated that a more accurate and up-to-date evaluation of the effects of Chernobyl would be reported shortly to the UN Scientific Committee on the effects of atomic radiation (UNSCEAR).  The committee will in turn be publishing a report in 1988 of the effects of the accident.</P>
      <P>Reports have been carried in the press of views attributed to the Soviet Union that the effects in Western Europe did not endanger the health of the population but it is clear from replies I have given to other questions that the Chernobyl accident caused widespread concern in Ireland and other Western European countries and gave rise to widespread precautionary measures in monitoring and controlling trade in foodstuffs.</P>

Due to inadequate accounting information the Revenue Commissioners were not in a position to compute profits for 1985 and 1986.

The Garda have found it difficult to identify the culprits, but in a recent case the conviction of a person for illegal felling of trees in the demesne was secured and legal proceedings are being instituted against four others.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, planning authorities are charged with the responsibility for the preservation of trees and woodlands in their areas on amenity grounds, Dublin County Council have recently made a tree preservation order in respect of approximately 2,200 trees at the Santry Demesne.  It is clear that no felling has been authorised by the occupiers; what is involved here is theft and vandalism. We would, nowever, expect the occupiers to take the normal precautions to protect the property from incursions of this kind.

    <P>The board reviewed this decision in 1985 and concluded that the project <Col N="2897" /> should continue to be deferred while being kept under ongoing review.  The position has not changed for the better since then so the decision still stands.</P>
    <P>The factory as planned in 1982 would have had a capacity to produce 150,000 tonnes of briquettes a year and the cost at 1983 prices was £25 million.  In the event of the project being proceeded with at a future date, the required production capacity and cost would have to be reassessed at that time.</P>

As I stated in reply to a question on 8 April 1987 concerning the <Col N="2898" /> replacement of the NEB by the National Radiological Protection Institute, I consider that it is timely to make such a change.  The functions of the new institute will be established within a legislative framework which will more appropriately reflect the present needs of the country in the field of radiation safety, radiation protection and monitoring.

      <P>I have considered the 21st Report of the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure. The contracts in question were negotiated to provide an outlet for the increasing volumes of thinnings arising from forest plantations, following the closure of the country's four main pulpwood processors. Because of the large investments involved, the location of these plants in Ireland could not have been secured without longterm guaranteed supply arrangements. The confidentiality of contractual arrangements, particularly on price, is standard practice in the State's commercial transactions particularly in situations where competing interests exist. It would appear that the price review provisions in these contracts represent the best deal which was achievable at the time they were negotiated.  I will be endeavouring to make the best possible use of these provisions in order to maximise the return from the sale of pulpwood to the two companies involved but I must have regard to all relevant factors involved.</P>

      <P>All the 9,000 farmers brought into charge in respect of farming profits, in 1980, were allowed to use the simplified accounts system of Form AG11.  A substantial number, however, did not avail of the option to use Form AG11.  Since 1980-81, all farmers including those in the £40-£50 RV range have been absorbed into the general body of chargeable framers and are not now distinguishable from other chargeable farmers.  Records are not maintained which would enable a breakdown to be given of the number of chargeable farmers in the £40-£50 RV range or of the number of farmers in that range using Form AG11.  A breakdown between farmers using the AG112 simplified accounts system and those submitting accounts on a different basis could be obtained only by means of a case by case examination of over 55,000 chargeable farmers and this would involve an undue expenditure of time and resources.</P>

    <P>The total amount of salaries of Senators during the period of the last Seanad was approximately £2.4 million.</P>
    <P>Maintenance costs directly attributable to the Seanad, i.e. secretarial assistants and other staff, amounted to approximately £680,000.  This figure does not include costs of services shared jointly between the Dáil and Seanad, e.g. the structural maintenance of the Leinster House complex is managed by the Office of Public Works as a single undertaking. It is not possible therefore to identify their costs attributable to the Seanad separately.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has not received an application for a repayment of tax for 1986-87 from the taxpayer.  The question of the taxpayer's entitlement to a refund of tax falls to be determined by way of a review of his liability for the relevant year.  If the taxpayer forwards the form P.60 given to him by his employer which shows pay and tax deducted for 1986/87, the inspector will be in a position to carry out the review and any refund found to be due will be made.</P>

      <P>On receipt of the required information her tax-free allowances will be amended and any overpayment of tax arising in the current year will be refunded by her employer on operation of the amended certificate of tax-free allowances.</P>

      <P>It has not yet been possible for the Office of Public Works to achieve the 3 per cent quota for employment of disabled persons which remains the target figure. Progress in this regard has been affected <Col N="2909" /> by curtailed level of recruitment over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Owing to the restricted level of finance available it has not so far been possible to fill the post for which the person (details supplied) applied.  The Deputy can be assured that the person involved received every consideration as, indeed, did all applicants for the post.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Question No. 165 of 11 March 1986 in which my predecessor indicated that due attention was being paid to the views expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I am satisfied that this continues to be the position.</P>
      <P>The offender's case is kept under regular review and was most recently discussed at a meeting at Cork prison on 24 February last attended by representatives of various disciplines within the prison.</P>
      <P>The offender is due for release, with remission, on 25 October 1988 and, while his case will continue to be kept under review, I am not prepared at this stage to authorize any form of early release.</P>

      <P>The question of the wearing of uniforms resembling the Garda uniform by personnel of other organisations has been raised by the Garda Representative Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a legal provision for the protection of the Garda uniform in section 15 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, which prohibits the wearing of any colourable imitation of that uniform.  It has been represented to me that this provision may be inadequate and the matter is at present the subject of consultations between my <Col N="2911" /> Department, the Attorney General's Office and the Garda authorities.  Pending the completion of these consultations, I am not in a position to say what action, if any, is likely to be taken.</P>

      <P>Education in places of custody is provided largely by local vocational education committees.  A tabular statement is attached which sets out details of the numbers of VEC teaching staff and the courses available in the institutions referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Other agencies which are also involved include the Open University (through which offenders can study up to degree level), the Sisters of Charity, the Arts Council and University College, Cork. In addition, in some of the institutions prison staff run physical education sessions.</P>
      <P>The nature of the accommodation available for education within the prison system varies from institution to institution. There are purpose-built education facilities in Cork prison, St. Patrick's Institution, Shanganagh Castle, the training unit and Arbour Hill prison.  It is expected that renovated and enlarged accommodation for education services will be made available at Loughan House and Limerick prison this year.  In addition, plans have been drawn up to replace a pre-fabricated building at Mountjoy women's prison with a larger, more suitable facility in the near future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the education service in prisons and other places of detention is being used for the purpose of general drug education, and in particular, for information on AIDS, given that a large proportion of offenders are in prison for drug offences; and if not, the plans, if any, he has to incorporate such information into the education service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The education service in the prisons is involved in providing information to offenders about drug abuse and AIDS.</P>
      <P>These issues often arise in the context of the social education element of home economics classes and are also dealt with on courses on health education which have become increasingly common in the institutions in recent years.  Occasionally, teachers also put on short courses on these issues.  Special material on AIDS has been developed by prison teachers geared to those with literacy problems and prison librarians have also disseminated information on the topic.  In addition, a teacher at Mountjoy prison, who was sponsored by my Department to attend the full time diploma in addiction studies course at TCD, is at present running a pilot course at the prison dealing with drug addiction.</P>
      <P>This, of course, is an area which needs to be kept under constant review and extensive arrangements are in place to help equip prison teachers to deal with these issues.  The Deputy will appreciate that providing information on these issues is not a matter for prison teachers alone.  For example, the probation and welfare service also have a role to play and, in the separation units at Mountjoy and St. Patrick's where offenders identified as HIV positive are accommodated, multi-disciplinary teams are in place (part of whose function it is to provide information to offenders).</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte intend to introduce, in the near future, revised regulations governing the registration of hotels.  Under these regulations, premises located in the Dublin and Cork metropolitan districts will be required to have 45 bedrooms in order to be considered for registration.  Outside these areas, the number of bedrooms required will be 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2919" /> The objective of the revised regulations is to ensure that premises are of an adequate standard and size to merit the title of hotel and to meet visitor expectation of what constitutes an hotel and the services that should be provided therein.</P>
    <P>The revised regulations will not apply to premises which are currently registered or hotels which have been registered at any time within the preceding three years.</P>

      <P>In order to determine her entitlement to invalidity pension it was necessary to refer the person concerned for examination by a medical referee. The medical referee has found that the person satisfies the medical conditions and she has now been awarded an invalidity pension with effect from 4 December 1986.</P>
      <P>A pension book payable from 18 June 1987 has been issued to the designated post office of payment.  Arrears in respect of the period from 4 December 1986 to 17 June 1987, less the amount of disability benefit paid during that period will be paid by payable order.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 8 December 1986, following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was incapable of work from 2 February 1987 only.  Accordingly, payment of benefit was restored from 2 February 1987 and all benefit payable has been issued to him.</P>
      <P>He was now been issued with a form on which to set out the grounds for appeal if he wished to have his case referred to an appeals officer for determination in respect of the period from 8 December 1986 to 31 January 1987.  His case will be reviewed on receipt of this form.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 11 November 1986.  Benefit was authorised from 14 November 1986, the fourth day of incapacity at the weekly rate of £36.75, the maximum rate payable to a woman with <Col N="2926" /> only 32 contributions paid in the 1984-85 governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>From 17 November 1986 in accordance with the equality legislation the claimant was entitled to claim an increase of 50 per cent of the normal rates in respect of her five child dependants as her husband is also being paid half-rate child dependant increases with his unemployment assistance.  Her weekly rate of disability benefit was therefore increased to £59.75. All benefit payable to the claimant has issued to 20 January 1987 after which date she was certified fit to resume work. Consequently no arrears of disability benefit appear to be outstanding to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 26 September 1985 to 15 June 1986.  Payment was disallowed from 16 June 1986 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the disallowance and an appeals officer decided on 2 March 1987 that she was incapable of work from 16 June 1986. Payment of disability benefit was restored from 9 March 1987 only, as it was necessary to ascertain the amount of unemployment benefit paid to the person concerned from 16 June 1986 to 8 March 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All arrears of benefit payable from 16 June 1986 to 8 March 1987, less the amount of unemployment benefit received by the claimant for that period, were issued on 22 May 1987.  Any delay in issuing these payments is regretted. Payment of disability benefit continued to issue to the person concerned until 2 May 1987, when benefit was again disallowed following an examination by a <Col N="2927" /> medical referee who considered her to be capable of work.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has appealed against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her examined by a different medical referee at an early date.  Her entitlement to further payment of disability benefit will be reviewed in the light of the medical referees report following this examination.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Department to refer claimants for medical examinations, as a control measure, for the purpose of obtaining a second medical opinion.  The person concerned first attended a medical examination on 2 November 1985.  The medical referee considered her to be incapable of work and recommended a review of her case in May 1986.  She was examined on 29 May 1986 and she was considered to be capable of work.  She appealed and in connection with her appeal she was again examined on 4 September 1986 by a different medical referee who also considered her to be capable of work.  She was examined on 9 April 1987 on the basis of a routine control examination as her previous examination was in September 1986.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was receiving disability benefit from February 1984 and payment was disallowed from 24 January 1985 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. His case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 24 January 1985 to 31 July 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate before <Col N="2928" /> him.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and may only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>He continued to submit medical evidence and his claim was further disallowed from 1 August 1985.  He was invited to appeal against this further disallowance but did not do so.</P>
      <P>The person concerned had also been in receipt from 26 March 1982 of disablement benefit, under the occupational injuries scheme, which can be paid with disability benefit or unemployment payments. He was examined, in connection with the disablement benefit claim by a medical referee of the Department on 26 June 1986 who expressed the opinion that the person concerned was incapable of work from that date.  Accordingly his entitlement to disability benefit should have been reinstated from 26 June 1986 but due to an administrative error, which is regretted, the necessary arrangements were not made to reactivate the disability benefit payments.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed and has been paid unemployment assistance from June 1986.  He is now being transferred to disability benefit and arrears of that benefit, less assistance paid to him, amounting to £202.82 have now issued.</P>

      <P>There has been no delay in allocating capital for housing loans in County Louth or in dealing with applications for draws from the Local Loans Fund.  The county council were notified of their capital allocation on 29 January 1987.  Applications for draws have been dealt with expeditiously and, in fact, the total amount drawn to date is slightly in excess of the approved monthly figure.</P>

      <P>An application for assistance under the teamwork scheme was submitted by the organisation &ldquo;Network for Jobs&rdquo; in April 1986.  Because of the restrictions on Teamwork funds at the time, it was not possible to consider this application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a meeting between representatives of the organisation and the Minister of State at my Department in May 1986 a further application was received from &ldquo;Network for Jobs&rdquo; in June 1986.  After consideration of the application by the Teamwork Monitoring Committee in June 1986 discussions took place between the sponsoring group and officials of my Department in July 1986. In the course of these discussions further information on the application, including data on the five separate projects encompassed by it, was requested.  This was received in August 1986.  From an examination of the five proposals it appeared that four of these were essentially commercial in character and would not, therefore be eligible for consideration under Teamwork.  Further evidence of the commercial nature of these four projects was evidenced by the fact that they were approved for planning grants under <Col N="2977" /> the youth employment agency's community enterprise programme.  This programme is designed to assist projects which may be sustainable on a commercial basis.  The applicants were notified accordingly on 10 September 1986. The fifth application submitted was examined but it did not meet the criteria for Teamwork and the applicants were notified accordingly on 17 September 1986.</P>
    <P>A complaint about my Department's handling of the case was made to the Ombudsman on behalf of &ldquo;Network for Jobs&rdquo;.  The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint and the group was informed of the decision by letter dated 11 May 1987.</P>

    <P>The estimated expenditure on the major projects in the period up to 1991 will depend on several factors, including the amount of capital funding that is likely to be available in these years and the rate of progress that can be achieved in the building and equipping work associated with the projects.

      <P>There has been no cut-back in the service by the health board but it has been operating below full strength for the past few months due to resignations and sick leave.
