      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was speaking about the house building programme under the Fianna Fáil Government.  I said that the number of houses built each year had dropped substantially. That was denied by Deputy P. Lenihan but I have figures here today to prove it.  Ten years ago the local authority in County Westmeath built as many as 255 houses in the one year.  That number dropped to five in <Col N="1768" /> 1961, to 15 in 1962 and to 11 last year.  It is no wonder there is a housing shortage in that county, when house building dropped from a record figure of 255 ten years ago to 11 last year.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about the city of Dublin, so let us look at the figures. We all know that during the past year houses have been falling down on the people, many of whom have been killed.  Those people lost their lives because they were not provided with proper houses to live in.  Away back in 1956, as many as 1,311 houses were built in the one year.  In 1957, 1,564 houses were completed.  Then the number started to drop, drop, drop.  In 1959 the number was 460; in 1960 it was 505; in 1961, 277; and in 1962, 392. In 1963 there was a slight improvement and the figure went up to 643, but it is still only a little more than one-third of the number being built in what we are told were the disastrous years of the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>We were told here&mdash;I have heard various Fianna Fáil Minister repeating it and also Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash; that there were 1,500 or 1,600 houses vacant in Dublin when the inter-Party Government were in office.  If any of those Ministers or Deputies will look up <i>Housing: Progress and Prospects,</i> laid before each House of the Oireachtas in November, 1964, by the Minister for Local Government, they will see that information is completely wrong, completely misleading.  Let us take the years of the inter-Party Government. In 1955 there were 639 vacant houses in Dublin.  In 1956 there were 794 vacant houses.  Now let us take the glorious years when Fianna Fáil were in power.  In 1958 there were 1,294 vacant houses in the city of Dublin.</P>

That is a figure they have been attributing to us.  The figures they have been quoting here in the House time after time are the figures attributable to the period when they themselves were in power.</P>

      <P>By 1960, there were 1,605 vacant houses in the city of Dublin, double the number for 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we wish to deal with the building of houses throughout the country, we can look at page 38 of the same document and there we find that in 1954 13,527 houses were built by local authorities.  In 1955 there were 12,590 and in 1956, there were 12,260.  Now the rot set in with the change of Government and the figures dropped, but the plans, let us remember, had been laid by the previous Government, the contracts had been made and therefore they could not drop very substantially. In 1957, 10,814 houses were built; in 1958, the Fianna Fáil Government were in office and the figures dropped to 7,069.  The decline continued to 5,961 in 1959 and in 1960, the figure was 6,031.  The figure has increased in the last year and has gone <Col N="1770" /> up to 9,900, but it is still 3,000 less than it was in 1955 and 1956, the disastrous years about which we hear so much from the Fianna Fáil benches. It is plainly because of the Government's inaction that we have this housing shortage in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words now about the increase of threepence a gallon on petrol.  This is an increase of approximately five per cent and this tax is bound to cause hardship to certain sections of our community.  It will affect the small shopkeeper in his deliveries, as it will affect the cost of deliveries of milk and other foodstuffs. It will also increase the cost of our exports at a time when it is vital that costs be kept as low as possible, because if our costs continue to increase as they are increasing, there is a danger that we may price many of our commodities out of the export market.  The Minister should keep an eye on this aspect of things.  What is needed is a period of stability and stable prices so that we can get a foothold in as many markets as possible and hold our position in those markets.  If we do price ourselves out of those markets it will be a bad day for the country and for each and every one of us.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that many workers have to travel long distances to their work and they, too, are going to be affected by this increase in petrol prices.  A car is essential for those people as it is essential for farmers, for other business people, for manufacturers and for industrialists.  They are all going to be affected by this increased tax on petrol and on diesel oil.</P>
    <P>As far as the farmers are concerned, this Budget is a betrayal.  The National Farmers Association called it a great betrayal.  The farmers' reaction to this Budget is one of disappointment.  The farmers are not against the well justified increase which was given to old age pensioners, nor can it be claimed that the farmers are unwilling to share with other consumers the burden of indirect taxation.  I think their disappointment comes from a failure to use the Budget this year to help level out the burdens on rural incomes.  The <Col N="1771" /> Minister for Agriculture this year promised to do that but there is nothing in the Budget to do it.  The farmers, especially the small farmers, and their labourers, are the hardest working and the worst paid section of the community. The small farmer works for seven days a week for 12 to 14 hours a day and in many cases his wife and children are working and slaving along with him, trying to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>As we know, both in terms of output and prices, 1964 was a fairly good year for those engaged in agriculture.  The average income of those working on the land increased from £6 per week to £7 a week.  Yet in the same year industrial incomes increased from an average of £9 5s. to £10 8s.  I think it is agreed that the same degree of price increases for the farmer cannot be expected in the present year.  The majority of farmers are agreed that such things as wool and potatoes are likely to be down while costs will show a considerable rise.  For these reasons many people thought that the farmers' claims would be met in this Budget. These expectations were encouraged by official statements by the Minister for Agriculture in this House when he said that urban and rural incomes should be brought into line.  The greatest disappointment of all was caused by failure to provide compensation for this year's 16 per cent increase in rates.  Judged by any standards the rates are an inequitable form of direct taxation and they are particularly so when one considers the level of farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>The farmers have been in the forefront in many of our difficulties, national, social and economic, and they are entitled to a fair crack of the whip which they are not getting in this Budget.  The Minister received a deputation from the NFA before the Budget and they put certain proposals before him in regard to how incomes should be brought into line with those of other sections of the community. They proposed an increase of twopence on the basic price of milk and suggested that this year's increase of £1.1 million in rates on agricultural land and farm <Col N="1772" /> buildings be absorbed by the Exchequer. They asked for an increase of 6/- in the price of wheat and an extra 2/6 on barley.  They did not get any of these things; yet we can remember the outcry in this House over ten years ago when the price of wheat was reduced.  The cost of production has increased over 60 per cent since then; wages have also increased and the farmers are still not getting for their wheat the price they were getting in 1954.</P>
    <P>The NFA pointed out to the Minister for Agriculture that if the increases they recommended were given they would raise the weekly income by 9/-. They pointed out that the balance required of £1 a week could be made up by increased production stimulated by increased grants as put forward in the recent review of agriculture.  The deputation also asked that machinery be found to assist horticultural production and intensive labour crops where costs had recently shown a dramatic increase.  None of these things has been done in the Budget and, therefore, it is very disappointing to farmers.  The fantastic rise of £3.85 million in costs this year would leave the farmers £2 million worse off than in 1964 unless the Government intervened in the Budget.  They did not do so.  The big factor contributing to increased costs in 1965 is the wage increase, which will set the farmers back £1.25 million for hired labour, and a jump of £1.1 million in the rates on agricultural lands and farm building.</P>
    <P>No farmer in Ireland would begrudge that increase to farm labourers who, in fact, are worth much more. Farmers should be put in the position that they themselves can earn a decent return for their labour and pay their labourers decent wages.  They are entitled to it and unless they get it nobody can expect them to stay on the land and rear families, working long hours on inadequate wages.  It is no wonder they leave the land and take up any other employment they can get.</P>
    <P>The Budget does nothing to improve the conditions of farmers; in fact, it worsens their conditions.  It does nothing to help them to further increase production which is so necessary at <Col N="1773" /> present.  The best way of showing the necessity to tackle agricultural problems vigorously is in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  Last year we exported £217.5 million worth of goods and agriculture accounted for £131.5 million.  Of that, £101 million was purchased by Britain and Northern Ireland. Cattle, which were so much decried in the past, yielded £66 million, while meat preparations and other items brought £34.5 million.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to do something now to increase agricultural production. There are some dark signs on the horizon this year for agriculture.  The wheat acreage fell by 31,000 acres or 9 per cent, oats by 21,000 or 6 per cent; potatoes by 4,000 acres and beet by 8 per cent compared with 1963, despite the fact that we had an order for 10,000 tons of sugar from America. If this trend continues it will be very bad for the country and it would look very bad if we had to start importing potatoes and increase wheat imports. It is very doubtful if the cattle exports of last year can be maintained.  It is generally agreed they cannot be maintained this year.  The signs now are not very encouraging.  We find that there is a drop of 76,000 in the number of cattle exported between 1st January and April 20th this year compared with last year.  Turning that into £ s. d., there is a drop of £6.5 million.  If that trend continues for the whole year it will mean exports may be down anything from £15 million to £20 million or £25 million which would certainly be bad for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more money devoted in the Budget to marketing.  It is agreed that our marketing system is antediluvian.  Certain boards have been set up by the Government and they are doing very good work at present.  We give the Government and the managers full credit for that but I believe that all reforms and developments in future will depend very largely on agriculture.  Our main source of national income is the land and the people who live on it.  We have 12 million acres of fertile, arable land and, as we have very little underground wealth such as coal, steel or ores, the prosperity of every man, woman and <Col N="1774" /> child in towns and cities depends in the last analysis on what the farmers and their labourers can get from the land and export profitably.  Nobody can deny that.</P>
    <P>Because of that position, back in the past Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, and Deputy Morrissey, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, went to England to negotiate the Cattle Trade Agreement of 1948.  I think that nobody can deny that it is because of that Agreement that the farmers here are getting, and have got for the past 16 or 17 years, good prices for their cattle because, after the negotiation of that Agreement, the price we got for our cattle was the price the British farmer got for his cattle and every time the British farmers organisation negotiated an increase in the price of their stock we automatically got a similar increase.  Many Fianna Fáil supporters say that is not true but we all know that from 1939 to 1945 Britain was involved in a world war: her ships were being sunk, and food was rationed.</P>

      <P>It is scarcely relevant to expansion of production now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, it is due to that Agreement that the farmers are getting the increased price that they are getting for their cattle today.  It will be a disaster for this country if the Government allow themselves to be persuaded that the fundamental importance of the agricultural industry is no longer an economic fact.  If they are not prepared to do anything, as they are not in the Budget, many people will be led to believe that that is what the Government think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion of industrial exports is a matter of great satisfaction to everybody in this country but it is folly <Col N="1775" /> to ignore the fact that as industrial exports expand so do imports of raw material, whereas, in the case of agricultural exports almost the whole value represents net gain in our balance of payments position.  There is approximately £1,000 million of our national wealth invested in our land and the stock and buildings upon it, not to speak of the 350,000 families who get their living in the agricultural industry. The most urgent task confronting our country is the restoration of the profit-earning capacity of this industry which employs more capital and people, directly and indirectly, than all the rest of our economic activity taken as a whole.</P>
    <P>Despite that, there is nothing in the Budget to do anything for the farmers to help them to attain the increased production which is so necessary and so vital at the present time.  In order to achieve increased production it is urgently necessary to bring within the reach of the farmers of Ireland the most up-to-date technical advice which we can provide and which in our opinion should be made available without delay by way of adequate agricultural advisory services which should be designed to provide at least one agricultural adviser for every 1,000 farmers.</P>
    <P>In order to develop new markets we must first expand production.  Without that we cannot secure markets.  In order to get production we must demonstrate to the farmers from whom we seek the increased production that they will be given a fair return for their labours.  Unfortunately, it is not promised to them in this Budget. Despite the fact that their costs are increasing due to increased rates, increased labour costs, they are not promised a fair return for the extra work that we want them all to do and would like to see them all doing.</P>
    <P>We all realise that there is in the world today a shortage of protein foodstuffs, notably meat, and there is no country better fitted to produce it than Ireland.  We have the rainfall, the land, the grass&mdash;no matter what may have been said about it in the past&mdash;<Col N="1776" /> and our farmers should be helped by better technical and marketing services to produce it.</P>
    <P>The campaign for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, which we initiated, should be and must be pressed forward to its conclusion and at the same time progeny testing of our livestock to improve its quality must be continued along the lines being pursued at present but in respect of which relatively little progress seems to have been made in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute, which we inaugurated, constitutes the indispensable foundation on which an adequate national agricultural advisory service must be built.  We have the farmers, the land, the climate and the technical skill to be able to double the agricultural output of this country.  All that is now required is to bring these things together by effective co-operation and by proper marketing methods to ensure that the full exploitation of our land will earn a profit not only for the farmers who must undertake the work but for the nation of which the farmers constitute so large and so important a part.  I am sorry, as I have said, that there is not more in the Budget to help those people to obtain the increased production which is so necessary at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal in this debate in regard to employment.  I should like to give a quotation from the Taoiseach in which he expressed his view as to what the functions of a Government should be.  He was speaking in Dáil Éireann, as reported at column 1144, volume 161 of the Official Report for 14th May, 1957. He was then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues have no doubt in our minds that we became the Government because the people expected us to work determinedly and intelligently to bring about a situation in which employment would expand, in which the twin problems of unemployment and emigration would be vigorously tackled.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask how have they <Col N="1777" /> worked determinedly and intelligently since then?  Despite what we may hear on the radio or see in the press, despite the rosy pictures that are being painted by Fianna Fáil propaganda, there are fewer persons in productive employment now than there were in 1956 and in 1957.  There are still over 58,000 persons unemployed and emigration is continuing to increase.  Last year it was reckoned to be running at a figure between 27,000 and 28,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to know is that how Fianna Fáil kept their promise?  Instead of bringing about a situation in which employment would expand, they are such magicians that they have reduced the number of persons employed. Since that statement was made over 300,000 of the cream of our youth, boys and girls, have left the land of their birth.  So, instead of the 100,000 new jobs that were promised in the past, there are fewer persons employed in Ireland today.  The Government should remember that if we had not got the safety valve of emigration to England there would be over 350,000 persons unemployed in this country today.  I do not think any Government should be proud of that.  We remember the slogans, &ldquo;Wives put your husbands to work&rdquo; but, unfortunately, when these slogans were being used at the church gates and from the platforms the wives did not think they were going to put their husbands to work in Birmingham, Coventry, London and other cities abroad.  That is what has happened.  The proper yardstick by which to judge any Government is the number of Irish boys and girls, men and women, families, living at home and earning a decent living in their own country.</P>
    <P>Statistics as such, I suppose, represent deadly dull reading matter but when they are related to persons driven from the land of Ireland they spring to life as vital elements in human existence. There are now 300,000 fewer persons on the land of Ireland today than there were 30 years ago.  We all agree that it is to the land of Ireland we must look for the revival necessary for the survival of Ireland as an independent economic entity.  The <Col N="1778" /> situation revealed by the latest figures of manpower on the land is so disastrous that one is left wondering if there will be any economic survival at all in the future.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask what is in the Budget to help to keep the people on the land.  It is pointless to argue that young people born into the atmosphere of Irish farming and succeeding generations of farmers on their native soil suddenly develop a wanderlust and, overnight, as it were, turn their backs on their homes, on their kinsfolk and on their way of life.  There must be some reason for their leaving.  Unfortunately, there are good economic reasons why they cannot stay.  These people have been lost to Ireland because they could see little prospect of a decent standard of living and a future on the land from which they sprang, despite all we have been told has been done over the years.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land of 300,000 in 30 years is an indictment of the policy that has masqueraded as land settlement in this country.  The tragedy of the great exodus is to be found not so much in the stunning total but, perhaps, in the permanent loss of the basic agricultural knowledge and training which emigrants had gained.  Through the lack of progressive economic planning policy our primary exports from the land have not been the products of the land but the people who were destined to live and work on the land of Ireland and to develop that land.</P>
    <P>The statistics show the Government to be guilty of inaction.  Time was when maladministration, natural to the foreign occupation of this country, could be blamed for a national illness in which wealth accumulated and men decayed.  That is not the case today for we have had native Government for 40 years.  Today the decay represented in the flight from the land is chronic and the blame must rest squarely on the shoulders of this Government.  When he was Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Smith, a colleague of the Minister for Finance and a member of the Cabinet, realised this situation and having the inside information and knowing that he could not change the <Col N="1779" /> Government and that he could not get justice for the small farmer&mdash;and said that&mdash;he resigned from the Government in protest.</P>

      <P>In 1953 the farmers, who represent 35 per cent of the people of this country, received 29.4 per cent of the national income; in 1958 they received 25 per cent of the national income; in 1959 they received 24 per cent; and in 1961 they received 21.3 per cent.  They are receiving only something around the same figure to-day, 21 per cent of the national income. It is very unfair that 35 per cent of the people are receiving roughly only one-fifth of the national income despite the fact that they are responsible for over 70 per cent of our exports. They are entitled to more than they are getting in this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often hear the Constitution and the 1916 Proclamation quoted in this House.  The 1916 Proclamation guarantees equal rights and equal opportunity to all citizens and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation, to cherish all the people of the nation equally.  The 1916 Proclamation does not apply as far as the farmers and the agricultural labourers are concerned, especially those living in the west of Ireland.  For a long number of years the policy of this Government has been to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  There is no denying the fact that the people of the west are clearing off the land because they cannot live on it due to the policy of this Government who are <Col N="1781" /> certainly not cherishing all the children of our country equally.  The people of the west cannot afford the kind of progress that Fianna Fáil propose for the next decade.  The small farmers cannot live on promises alone.</P>
    <P>Let it be remembered that alone among the nations of the world we have a decreasing population.  If there is a more distressing fact in Irish life today than the flight from the land it is Fianna Fáil's acceptance of it as a normal, natural, necessary solution for many of their problems.  Does anyone who sees the thousands of our people leaving the land every year&mdash;and I am not leaving it; I am still on it&mdash;have to be an expert before he realises there is something wrong somewhere?  Does anyone who sees abandoned farmsteads all over the country not have to agree that the Government's land policy is wrong?  Even under British rule and in the bad old days we were told about, those people and their fathers before them lived on those farms.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote very briefly from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 15th February, 1965.  At a meeting in Foxford, Most Rev. Dr. Fergus, Bishop of Achonry, said that &ldquo;the issue at stake is the survival&mdash;or, if you wish, the extinction&mdash;of the small farm community of the west&rdquo;.  His Lordship spoke at length, but I do not propose to quote extensively.  We are, I think, quite entitled to ask what is there in this Budget to keep the small farmers in the west on the land?</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not make some reference to something we all know is happening throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I refer to the credit squeeze and the failure of building societies to advance loans to those who want to build their own houses.  The Minister could have dealt with that and I hope that, when he comes to conclude the debate, he will make some reference to it.</P>

      <P>After 44 years of native government, many people now <Col N="1782" /> are inclined to ask themselves was it worth it all.  Have the dreams and the aspirations of those who sacrificed everything come true?  I fear the answer must be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, then the blame must rest squarely on the present Government.  They have been in power for over 37 years.  They claim they have set many records.  We know they have.  They have set some of which they cannot be proud.  They have set others for which they are not to blame.  To-day we have a record Budget before us, despite the fact that when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition in 1951, they promised to reduce taxation if they were returned to office. They got into office first in 1932 by promising to reduce taxation by £2 million.  They said we could not afford to live like a mighty empire and, if they were returned to power, they would reduce taxation by £2 million.</P>
      <P>This year, record rates of almost £30 million are being collected, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil got into power on one occasion&mdash;they must remember it&mdash;by promising complete derating of agricultural land.  When they made that promise the average rate was 6/- in the pound.  Today it is in the region of £3 in the pound.  We have a record national debt of over £600 million.  I am not quarrelling with that.  The money is well spent and there is nothing wrong in it but, when another Government in 1951 borrowed to build houses and hospitals, Fianna Fáil went up and down the length and breadth of the country saying the country was bankrupt and telling the people to put the Government out.  They alleged the Government had borrowed too much money.  Now there is nothing wrong when the debt is double what it was in 1951.</P>
      <P>We have a record adverse trade balance.  There seems to be nothing wrong with that when it happens under Fianna Fáil.  When there was an adverse trade balance under the inter-Party Government, we had nothing but wailing and screeching from Fianna Fáil on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a record low population. We have a record number of people who emigrated from the country in the <Col N="1783" /> past six or seven years.  We have a record high cost of living despite the promises made by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about constructive opposition.  That is always the cry when Fine Gael are in Opposition. Since the foundation of this State, we, as a Party, have always been constructive. We have never stood for obstructive methods at any time.  We have always stood for constructive work, fair play, co-operation and justice for all our people.  I do not think there are many Fianna Fáil Ministers who are married to any or all of these; certainly they need no dispensation for they are far removed from all.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1961 when the Government were planning to enter the Common Market.  I remember the instructions we got not to obstruct the Government in any way in their efforts at that time.  We did that.  I remember afterwards the thanks we got.  The then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, was ridiculed and told that we were not an effective Opposition. Fianna Fáil should show by action and not by words that they stand for fair play, justice and constructive government.</P>
    <P>In this Budget they are not spending their own money.  They are spending the taxpayers' money.  Talking about constructive criticism and constructive work, last year the Department of External Affairs published a booklet, <i>Facts about Ireland.</i> There was nothing constructive about that because men like O'Higgins, Collins and Griffith, the architects of this State, were never mentioned.</P>

      <P>If, as a result of all the money that is being spent, we were getting justice, then I think we would not have many complaints.  If, as a result of the vast outlay of public money and the growing burden of taxation, we were in a position to say that emigration had ceased, as we would all like to see it cease, that unemployment had been substantially reduced and the number of people working greatly increased, we would have grounds for satisfaction.  Unfortunately that is far from being true.</P>
      <P>If public representatives all work together and give of their best in the field of public life and private endeavour, we will never be able to make this country rich and powerful in the popularly accepted sense, as rich and powerful as America and England, but we can reasonably hope to make it one of the best countries in which to live and rear a Christian family.  That is the fundamental objective of the Fine Gael Party, a Party to which I am proud to belong.  I have faith in the future of our country and of our people and hope that, if we do our part by hard work and constant endeavour, our objectives can be realised and charity will enable us to challenge falsehoods and champion truth, with out permitting hatred or encouraging acrimony; these are the guiding principles of our Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated in no uncertain fashion that he is becoming uneasy at the length of this debate.  I can assure him I am well aware that all aspects of this Budget have been fairly well covered in the debate and that, naturally, he may be feeling tired.  It is a good thing for Deputies to discuss the Budget proposals in the detailed manner they are doing so this year.  It is to be welcomed that Deputies from all sides, whether on the Front Bench or on the back bench, are expressing their views on these vital questions.  I have no doubt that the Minister, even though he has expressed himself rather tired listening to the debate, welcomes that situation as much as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Quotations are different.  I do not like them myself.  I shall not go over the ground already adequately covered by previous speakers.  The first reason I decided to speak in this debate was to get more information about status increases.  For some months past we have been reading a good deal about them.  We are told that the average status increase has been in the neighbourhood of 18 per cent and that in the case of some higher executive officers and other professional people, it has varied from 16 to 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a believer in promoting the type of class-conscious society we apparently have been promoting, particularly within the past 12 months. Everybody has a status.  It is not just because you happen to be enjoying a big salary that you qualify for a status increase.  The man out in the wind and weather, working on the land, on the roads or building houses is playing just as much a part in the development of our country.  This matter of status increases has created a good deal of uneasiness among ordinary workers.  I would not be voicing the opinion of <Col N="1786" /> the Labour Party if I did not say we have always believed that people with special professional qualifications should be adequately remunerated for their work.  By reason of these special qualifications, they are playing a big part in the development of the nation and in advancing the incomes of its people.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we must be uniform in the application of any regulations relating to salaries and other matters concerning the public purse.  If one section secured a 12 per cent increase in salary and are able to get on average a further 18 per cent as a status increase, I believe other sections are just as much entitled to look for that increase.  The ordinary worker has, say, £8. 2. 6. per week to maintain himself and his family.  That is the figure a road worker has in Cork county, which is above the ordinary wage earned by an agricultural worker. If a person in the £2,000, £3,000 or over income group needs an increase of 18 per cent to maintain his status in society, I maintain much more so does the man earning from £350 to £450 per annum.  If the man with an income of £8 a week got a status increase, I maintain he should get more than 25/- a week.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we should confine status increases to special people.  I would ask the Minister to address himself to that question.  The people I have mentioned have got no relief in the Budget.  They are satisfied to make the contribution required for increased social welfare benefits, but it means they must pay more for cigarettes, tobacco and drink.  It is impossible for these people in the lower income group to live on present wage standards. There is no justification whatever in our present affluent society, as it is described by the Government, for asking a married man with a family to exist on £8 a week.  Even though farm workers' rates are higher in Dublin and Cork, it is extremely difficult for such workers to make ends meet because of the steady decline in the value of money.</P>
    <P>We are reaching the stage now where one shilling will be equivalent <Col N="1787" /> to what a penny was worth in 1933. So far as the provision of furniture or building a house is concerned, we have already reached that stage.  Thirty years ago you could get a good five-roomed house built for £200.  Today, that house would cost almost £3,000. That gives some idea of the decline in the value of money in that field.  If there is additional money in the public purse to be distributed to our people, it should be distributed to the sections who need it most.  The section who need it most are the ordinary workers. Small farmers working within the limitations of their holdings and the infertility of their land, particularly along the western and southern seaboard, find it difficult to live in a reasonable way.  The small shopkeepers are being pushed out of business by the supermarkets.  Some people may say supermarkets are a desirable asset to our country, but one thing is certain: they are crushing the small shopkeeper out of existence.</P>
    <P>We are told our economy expanded by £80 million last year.  If we have this money, the greater part of it should be channelled into the pockets of these people in the lower income group.  The agricultural worker or small farmer is playing a very important role at present.  Were it not for agricultural production and agricultural exports, the picture here would not be as bright as it is today.  We are tremendously fortunate that the prices for our agricultural exports, particularly cattle, are reasonably high on the export market. If you had a situation obtaining in Britain, which is our main buyer of farm produce, particularly cattle, where the prices were much lower than they are at the present time, you could appreciate the reaction that would have on the economy of the country. Therefore, the state of the economy is a highly significant factor.  The standard of wages of many of those who go out in the morning down the country to milk the cows, bring the milk to the creamery and look after the crops, according to statistics produced by farming organisations, is well below £10 weekly.  It is between £8 and £9 weekly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> I know how very difficult it is for the Government to devise legislation, enactments and regulations that will meet such a problem.  At the same time, as I mentioned at the outset, when there was so much money available, instead of starting at the top we should have commenced at the bottom and helped the lower paid workers.  I think I have made my position clear on that and I am hopeful the new Minister for Finance, in the course of his deliberations within the Government, will bear in mind the position of our rural workers, farm workers and others in the lower income group.  If our economy advances further, as we all hope it will, and if there are funds available for distribution by way of salary and wage increases, we should think of that section of the community more than some other sections.  While referring to that section of the community I am not reflecting on the other sections but it was surprising to note that the status increase granted to several people in this country is higher than the total annual income of those workers.  The status increase alone, in most cases, exceeded more than £400, which is a sum greater than that earned by many sections of our people.</P>
    <P>The second point I have to make deals with the question of social welfare benefits.  We all welcome, as the Labour Party clearly indicated by its vote in this House, the increased benefits for the old people, the disabled and those of our population who cannot obtain employment.  I stress here again, what I stressed on a number of occasions previously, the desirability of some co-ordination between different Departments in the State, particularly Departments which give a good deal of employment, such as the Minister's own Department, particularly the Special Employments Schemes Office, the Board of Works, the Department of Local Government, the Department of Lands and other Departments. There should be some interDepartmental committee which would devise means of providing employment for people in rural Ireland, particularly people who are occasionally unemployed. You may have a scheme promoted by a county council or by a <Col N="1789" /> Department and their work is closed down for several months.  The workers go on the unemployment benefit list, whereas some other Department may have useful employment for them. They could be asked to do some useful chores such as special drainage work, afforestation work, road repairs or give some other service instead of getting unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I believe that the majority of our workers, although I am only conversant with rural workers and do not know about the cities and towns, do not want to go near the labour exchange if they can avoid it.  They would prefer to work with the council, a private employer or a Department of State at the same remuneration they would get from unemployment benefit. In some cases the social welfare benefits are now higher than the local rates obtaining in councils and even in State Departments.  It is a very pleasing thing to find that a great number of our workers do not want to see the labour exchange.  They do not like having to go to the Garda Síochána station on Tuesday or Wednesday to sign for unemployment assistance. Instead, they want employment.</P>
    <P>We should establish some type of inter-Departmental committee to work in conjunction with the local authorities to try to find employment for such people when the particular scheme on which they are employed closes down.  I must say the number would be very small.  Any person who is physically capable and able to work, and where work is available, should be able to get it.  There is an obligation on every person to look for work and not be on the unemployed list.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that people have to work for survival.  On the other hand, there is an obligation on our workers and people to give reasonable service for the remuneration they receive.  There is an obligation on them to find employment if for some cause or other they are thrown out of employment on a temporary basis.  That position must obtain if the State is to survive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> I do not want to put one class against another in my remarks in this debate but I have in times gone by agitated for and advocated a reduction in the qualifying age for old age pensions from 70 to 65 years.  It will be appreciated that it is some 57 years since old age pensions were introduced in this country.  I think it was in the year 1908.  The then British Government felt that the appropriate qualifying age for such pensions was 70 years.  The pension at that time had, in its own way, as good a purchasing power as the pension obtaining today. The pension at that time was introduced for people within a certain income level.  The income level for qualifying for the maximum pension was somewhat similar to the income level which obtains today.</P>
    <P>We have made many advances in the past 57 years and we should all be thankful to world efforts for that.  I know we have gone through trying periods but I consider a case can be made for uniformity in regard to the retirement age for all pensions in this country.  There is no justification for asking our people to continue working up to the age of 70 years.  This reduction, in my opinion, should take place forthwith.  The British Government, who introduced the pension here, the Six Counties and other countries in Europe and throughout the world have reduced the qualifying age for pensions.</P>
    <P>What would be the disadvantages if we were to reduce the qualifying age in respect of the old age pension?  The Minister for Social Welfare told me in this House that it is all very fine to suggest giving the pension to people at 65 and to put ordinary men in this country, workers, farmers, road workers and many others in the same category as the other members of the population who qualify for pensions at the age of 65 but the question was where was the money to come from and how could we bring about a situation whereby we could pay pensions at the age of 65 years.  At that time, when the pension rate was, I think, 35/- weekly, the Minister said it would take £12 million to implement this proposal.  Where would the Deputy <Col N="1791" /> suggest the £12 million was to come from?  I assume that the Minister's figure is correct and that it would take £12 million to implement this proposal and, having regard to recent increases in pensions, we will say that it may now take £14 million to implement it.  We should go about finding it.  I think the net cost would be not more than 50 per cent of that figure because, once this money is paid out to the pensioners, taking into account every commodity they buy&mdash;their drink, cigarettes, tobacco, clothes, food, every commodity pensioners buy&mdash;their purchases are taxable and a good deal of that money is bound to find its way back to the Exchequer through taxation channels.  It would not be out of place to say that the actual paying of the pension would represent not more than 50 per cent of the gross cost.  If we assume that it would take £14 million to pay this pension at 65 years, it is reasonable to say that the net cost to the Exchequer would be half that sum, £7 million.</P>
    <P>I am mindful also of the many advantages that would accrue from such a position.  First of all, it would give justice and fair play to those people who work in the wind and the rain and all kinds of weather in the fields and on the roads and even to the shop assistant and the smaller shopkeeper, and so on.  They are as much entitled to retire at 65 and to get their allowance from the State as are all the other classes of people who are getting it without difficulty at present.  We must have uniformity in our laws and legislation. We feel very strongly that it is unfair that certain people should get pensions at 65&mdash;more luck to them: we agree that they are entitled to them at that age&mdash;while others do not qualify.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have had an unemployment and emigration problem in this country down through the years and it is still with us.  If pensions were paid at 65 instead of 70, it would mean that workers would retire five years earlier and their jobs would be available for other men and women, thus offsetting a good deal of the emigration and unemployment problem. <Col N="1792" /> That would be a very big advantage.</P>
    <P>Secondly, farmers, particularly our farmers on the western and southern seaboards and, indeed, in all parts of the country, would assign their holding to members of their families five years earlier than at present.  The emphasis is now on youth and youth, if I may so use that term, would take over five years earlier than at present. That would be a very good thing.  It would help to solve the problem to which the Taoiseach referred yesterday and to which I have referred on a number of occasions and of which everybody is quite conscious.  I refer to the problem of late marriages in rural Ireland and in particular to the problem of the large percentage of our people in rural Ireland who are not married at all.  In years gone by, I think that position to some extent could be traced to the fact that the old people held on to their farms and holdings until they had reached an advanced age and therefore did not give the young people an opportunity of taking over.</P>
    <P>If we implement this proposal to reduce the qualifying age for old age pensions, then, farmers in particular, would be encouraged to assign their farms or holdings earlier to a member of the family and in that way I believe the problem to which the Taoiseach referred yesterday would solve itself to a great extent.  The early marriage rate would increase and the percentage of our people who marry in rural Ireland would substantially improve.  We all feel that that is a situation that should be brought about. It is desirable from every point of view.  It is a problem that is pressing us very hard at the present time and I was very pleased, indeed, that the Taoiseach addressed himself specifically to it yesterday.</P>
    <P>Another advantage, of course, is that, despite what has happened in the past, there is not any great change in the expectancy of life so far as people who have reached middle age are concerned. I must be careful now about what I say in the presence of Deputy Hogan of Tipperary who is an expert on this question but the expectancy of <Col N="1793" /> life here for a person at the age of 40 is probably not more than 75 or 76. Then what have we?  When people reach 70, they move into the winter of their life.  After years of toil, they are not able to enjoy the pension to any extent.  With physical difficulties arising in many cases or ailments of one kind or another&mdash;pains, arthritis, and so on&mdash;they are not in a position to enjoy their rest.  That state of affairs would alter very much if the situation obtained in which pensions were paid at 65.  The people in question would then have an opportunity of enjoying a well-earned rest just as some others do at present.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Finance to press home this question of a reduction in the qualifying age for pension. He can rest assured that if proposals are brought into this House for such legislation&mdash;and such proposals would naturally require money to pay for them &mdash;he can depend on the support of the Labour Party.  We dislike imposing taxation on the drinker, the smoker, and so on, because we feel he is at present carrying an unfair share of our national burden, but, despite that belief, we voted for the implementation of the taxes because we felt that the other sections of the community were entitled to the increases they got.  I think I can speak on behalf of my colleagues in this Party when I say that the Minister may rest assured that if reasonable taxation proposals are brought before this House to find money to reduce the qualifying pension age from 70 to 65, he will find the Labour Party sympathetic. He will have the full support of this Party and I have no doubt that the Fine Gael members also believe in the justice of this claim, and I believe that if these proposals were brought before the House, they would find unanimous approval.</P>
    <P>With these few remarks, I wish to conclude and apologise to the Minister if I have kept him waiting too long.  He has a responsible task, and I wish him every success and good luck in his new post.  Undoubtedly a Minister for Finance does not get much rest.  He has to keep in mind all the time the many <Col N="1794" /> problems of State and is the controller of the public purse and holds a very responsible position.  I would put his position second to that of the Taoiseach and it is only right that, in so far as we can, we should be constructive and helpful in our remarks on public matters in this House.  I do wish the Minister for Finance a successful term of office.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy's speech is in marked contrast to that of Deputy L'Estrange.  One can admire and give credit to Deputy Murphy in so far as what he said here, whether we can agree with what he said or not, was constructive.</P>
      <P>We heard from Deputy L'Estrange this morning and last night an endless tirade of deprecations.  He deprecated the efforts of the Government back over the years and he indicated the burning desire that was inherent in the heart of the Fine Gael Party to be known as the &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo; of this country.  It seems strange to me that Fine Gael did not succeed in increasing their majority in the recent election. If what Deputy L'Estrange said is true of the Party and what they stood for, then it would be only fair to expect that the electorate would give a chance to the Party in order to see what Fine Gael could do with the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if one considers the approach of those two Deputies, one can see at a glance that Deputy Murphy is prepared to back up his sentiments by action, that is, the action of going into the lobby with the Fianna Fáil Party to levy the taxation necessary to meet the increases granted towards social welfare.  It is always very easy to stand up in the Opposition benches and decry the efforts of the Government, more especially in view of the fact that the Opposition always have the scope for escaping the responsibility of going through the gates into the lobby to vote extra taxation in aid of any given service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I make a few comments on the Budget, I should like to point out that Deputy L'Estrange this morning cast himself in the role of the defender of the farming community.  He said <Col N="1795" /> the farmers' condition was depressed, the farmers were leaving the land, and so on.  We submit and assert that, for our part, we are as a Government doing as much to help the farming community as our resources will permit in any given year.  We, by what we are doing, are making the moneys we are voting in this House available by way of aids and encouragement, so as to lead the farmer on to increased production, so as to ensure that he will have a higher standard of living and that he will have, for instance, better roads, better approach roads, better farm buildings, and a cleaner national herd.  We can claim credit for the great tuberculosis drive to wipe that disease out of our national herd and claim credit for pursuing that aim.  We can claim full credit as a Government for the increase in our cattle exports and for the upward trend in the price of cattle.</P>
    <P>We must relate these things to what we have done down the years.  It may be said of the Fianna Fáil Government that they were never backward in coming to the aid of the farmer, in so far as making an effort towards ridding the livestock of the nation of disease was concerned.  I should also like the Deputy to know, though he deprecated the efforts in regard to the production of wheat, beet and barley.  I do not first time Fine Gael spokesmen have deprecated efforts in regard to the price of wheat, beet and barley.  I do not want to go back to the past but I should like to say at this point that I remember being present in this House and hearing the erstwhile Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon, say that we were fools here to talk about producing wheat, hoping that wheat and beet would, as he said at that time, go up the spout.  So, we on this side of the House do not mind very much when we hear the false sentiments expressed on the far side as to what Fine Gael will do for the farmers regarding the production of wheat, beet or barley.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies on the Fine Gael benches to the fact that if we examine Table II of the Budget Statement, we shall see <Col N="1796" /> where current expenditure on economic services, for instance, has increased by 10.6 per cent over 1964-65.  That is the forecast of the Budget.  In the case of agriculture, a further £400,000 must be provided for higher quality milk.  I am merely going over part of the Minister's statement to reaffirm the point I am trying to establish, that the remarks of Deputy L'Estrange were completely out of accord with the facts. He must know that the price of milk was increased and that also an extra bonus was provided for the production of higher grade milk.  He must also have some advertence to the fact that the price of barley and wheat were also increased, and that current estimated expenditure on agriculture this year is roughly £33.7 million, or £3.6 million more than was actually expended last year.  It can, therefore, be said that we are making headway in the field of farming.  Not merely are we making headway, but we are holding our own in competition with some leading European countries in a very difficult market.  For that reason we welcome any aid which can be provided towards helping members of the farming community to help themselves.</P>
    <P>This Budget has been described as a Budget designed to help those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  That is a proper description of it.  The Minister indicated in his Budget Statement that all social advances must, of necessity, spring from economic advances.  I think it can be submitted that herein lies the success of the Fianna Fáil Party: whatever success Fianna Fáil have had in the recent election, and in previous elections, was due to the fact that the people recognised that we would face up to the position in a realistic fashion, that we did not go parading around the platforms of the country promising enormous benefits and saying that, at the same time, we would be in a position to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>I listened to some of the speeches made by Fine Gael speakers especially during the recent election campaign.  I was nearly driven back to my childhood, to the time when I used to hang up my sock and expect that in the <Col N="1797" /> morning Santa Claus would have put something in it.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Ryan and others on the opposite benches promising greater benefits, better housing, lower rates, less taxation and increased social benefits.  A few months ago we witnessed the spectacle of Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon, who were traditionally of the right, coming to open loggerheads with Deputy Costello, Deputy Ryan, and others who were supposed to be going to the left.  We witnessed a sort of collision.  Fine Gael were taken short by the election and inside a period of three weeks, we saw literally flung at the head of the electorate what was said to be an advanced social programme, but which I believe to be an ill-thought-out programme in our circumstances which could not be achieved without increased taxation.  I think it can be said that was the fundamental weakness in that programme. The people were not misled.  They did not believe the Fine Gael Party that those things could be accomplished in our circumstances and with our income.</P>
      <P>Politics has been described as one of the great sciences and at the same time, the dirtiest of games.  In that context we can level at the head of the Fine Gael Party the charge that on one side they were aiming at pursuing a great science and on the other side, were stooping to the dirtiest of games. Fortunately we came back to power, and we came back in the knowledge that we had outlived those promises and secured the votes of the electorate by stating the facts.  We did not come back under any cloud.  Therefore, there is no need for Deputy L'Estrange or Deputy O'Higgins who tried to refight the election in this debate on the floor of the House, to suffer from any inferiority complex because they came back in Opposition, where they should be, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to note in the Minister's first Budget Statement his intention to make provision for the Department <Col N="1798" /> of Finance to play a more important role.  We all know the Department of Finance is one of the most important Departments in the State. That being so, it is only natural that the activities of that Department should play a part in the activities of every Department.  We also welcome the fact that the Minister said that in the future his Department should not be regarded as an enemy by other Departments, but should be regarded in the role of an adviser.  The Minister indicated in his Budget Statement that the service and advice of his Department should always be readily available if sought by any other Department of State.</P>
    <P>We all welcome that fact, and in welcoming it, we should recognise that we are making advances on both the economic and the social fronts.  The economists would have us believe that life begins and ends on the economic front.  The philosophers, on the other hand, would say that is not so.  Our philosophy is that we should have a little of both, and when we make some advance on the economic front, we should always be in a position, and willing, to share that advance on the social side.  For that reason, even if sometimes we find it hard to get the money&mdash;we are always faced with the naked need to levy the taxes necessary to meet whatever charges we impose on the community&mdash;I do not think it can be said we failed in our duties in that respect this time.</P>
    <P>To come back to the point I was trying to make regarding the Department of Finance, as I said, we were all glad the Minister made the announcement he did make.  Some of us who have been here for a while should like to see a review.  At any rate, one could advocate the proposition that a review should be carried out, via the Department of Finance, ranging over the whole of roughly 49 Votes which we administer, to see if some improvements could be made in the services and at the same time some economies effected.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the modern make-up of the State we are all inclined to accumulate what is known <Col N="1799" /> as a big paper build-up and we can foresee an exercise of that sort arising in the future.  One could therefore advocate that now and in the future this Department should examine all aspects of the workings of the various Departments with a view to avoiding the big paper build-up at a loss of real work.  That examination would entail a good deal of work.  It would entail a lot of time but, at the same time, I think it would be worthwhile. That is why I welcome the fact that the Minister indicated his Department would be prepared in the future to do that.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few other points.  Health was mentioned in this debate and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party made some reference to the Select Committee on Health Services and urged the Minister for Health to make some improvements in the health services.  I should like to say that despite the fact that the efforts of the Select Committee were, shall we say, under a cloud, or that the Select Committee were under a cloud, that Committee worked hard and if we did not find agreement in the end, I do not think it can be said that fault can be found with the efforts of the former Minister for Health or indeed his Department.</P>
    <P>We held upwards of 50 meetings and heard evidence from a number of witnesses, all people who were interested and highly competent in health matters.  If we did not find agreement in the end, no fault can be found with the manner in which the members of the Select Committee worked.  Possibly, because it was a Select Committee, composed of members of the various Parties, it could be said they were a highly political Committee.  It was rather a pity that Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, who was acting in the role of spokesman for the Fine Gael Party, withdrew from that body because, looking back on the lot of valuable evidence that was assembled, which I assume will be published in the form of a report later on, one could say that the withdrawal of Deputy O'Higgins and the Labour <Col N="1800" /> Party was a shortsighted move.  It would have been much better had Deputy O'Higgins and the members of the Labour Party, who felt strongly about health matters, written a minority report if they disagreed with the opinions of the majority of the members of the Select Committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to deprecate the Deputy's efforts but it could be said with fairness that if Deputy T.F. O'Higgins had wanted to do something constructive to amend whatever weaknesses he thought were present in the health services, he could have done it in a different way.  A more dignified way would have been to have given his opinions in a minority report.  Of course he was in too big a hurry at the time because he wanted to get out to the hustings in order to misrepresent the work of the Select Committee and there is not any doubt that he and his colleagues did their best to misrepresent the aims and objects of the members of the Committee.  I shall conclude by saying that, taking all in all, having regard to the farming year, having regard to the advance we made in industrial exports, having regard to the advance we were able to make on the social side&mdash;that covers the three big Departments of Education, Health, Social Welfare&mdash;the present situation indicates very strikingly the desire of the Government to press ahead with their aim to improve educational standards, to go on with the idea of better health services and coupled with it the desire to come more and more to the aid of those in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we all subscribe to that view or not, I shall wind up by saying what I said at the start.  We all <Col N="1801" /> appreciate the approach of the Labour Party in this regard.  Whatever criticism the various Deputies from the Labour benches may have to offer, they were prepared, at any rate, to walk into the lobbies and vote the moneys necessary to support the social welfare sections and that indicates that they are prepared to say: &ldquo;We do not agree fully with the Government or with the aims of Fianna Fáil but we shall go part of the way to support that Party in providing the moneys necessary to carry out the good work embodied in this Budget.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter has again endeavoured to propagate the fiction that there was a serious difference of opinion or controversy in the Fine Gael Party on matters of policy. This of course is an entire fiction. I defy Fianna Fáil to point to any occasion on which there was the least amount of acrimony in public or in private in the Fine Gael Party when we were discussing, for 18 months and not just for the purposes of an election campaign, the programme we were proposing for a just society.  Of course, they cannot do it but they and others in the country who are not concerned with the truth have always tried to develop this fiction. They will find, as the years follow this year, that the Fine Gael programme which is already acceptable to the people will be implemented by a Fine Gael Government.  The fact that within three weeks we were not able to convince the people that we had both the means to implement our programme as well as the right programme is no reflection on the worth of the policy we would like to see adopted.  Time alone will justify us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard from Deputy Carter, and throughout this debate, a number of interesting instances of a definite difference of opinion in the Fianna Fáil ranks.  We had the Minister for Finance advocating a tax on petrol and we had several members of Fianna Fáil supporting that tax.  Deputy Carter praised the Labour Party because they too support the tax but yesterday Deputy de Valera said he was differing between taxes on <Col N="1802" /> non-essentials, such as drink, tobacco and cigarettes, and a tax on petrol. He said petrol was a different thing : it was material to industry and it would contribute to costs in industry depending upon whether it went up, and must, therefore, contribute to the cost of articles produced by such an industry.  Here we have the Fianna Fáil Party in disagreement; yet Deputy de Valera and others like him voted for the tax although there were several other items which could have been taxed and which would have yielded a greater revenue than the tax on petrol.  Of course it is no difficulty to Fianna Fáil to do that and of course they will get away with it, but it is interesting that that Party in the relatively short debate on the Budget can show disagreement on this vital matter and yet when the whip cracks they go into the Lobby and vote for it.</P>
    <P>It might seem rather trite for me to remark that most of the people in this city who support families, most men who work for their living to support themselves, their wives and families, are unable to absent themselves from their employment because their employers will not give them permission to do so.  Or, if they are self-employed, they are unable to absent themselves during the working day without causing loss or inconvenience to customers and serious loss and inconvenience to themselves.  It may seem strange that this should need to be said but it needs to be said to answer criticism that has twice been voiced in this House within the last month, criticism of members of the Dublin Corporation who represent the majority of workers in this city who are unable to get away in the middle of the working day and who are unable to attend meetings because a certain group of politicians insist upon having them in the middle of the day.  The Dublin County Council can meet at six o'clock in the evening to facilitate people who are unable to get away during the middle of the day but a group in Dublin Corporation refused to allow this.</P>
    <P>It might seem probable that in a democracy the majority of the people should be heard and therefore it seems <Col N="1803" /> proper that meetings should be held at a time when the people who represent the majority of the working people can be heard.  A number of professional politicians are engaged by employers who permit them to absent themselves from work without loss.  Some of them are trade union officials and as such, are encouraged to attend meetings in the middle of the working day, but as I have said, I suppose 95 per cent of the people of this city who earn their living are unable to absent themselves without the permission of their employers, or even if they get permission, without serious pecuniary loss.</P>
    <P>This is why several committee meetings held in private by the Dublin Corporation have not got a full attendance and I do not think they are ever going to have a full attendance as long as a number of unscrupulous people serve their own interests and refuse to give audience to the vast majority of the people of this city who work for their living and who have a moral duty before God and man to support their wives and families.  If they seek to take petty advantage of that in public debate, I will be only too glad to have this scandal in the Dublin Corporation brought into the open so that when there is a local election, the people will see that a sufficient number of people are elected to ensure that these committee meetings are held at a time of day when the spokesmen for the ordinary people who earn their living honestly can be heard.</P>
    <P>Having said that in regard to the allegation about attendances at the committee, may I point out that Deputy Dowling earlier referred to a recent meeting of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation which he said was called to deal with the rents and the fuel costs in the proposed new housing development at Ballymun.  The fact is that the meeting in question was called to consider only the installation of the heating system in Ballymun and the subsequent costs that would then fall on the tenant.  It was not called to consider the rents.  No information as to the rents has been given by the Minister and we would not have had any <Col N="1804" /> costings in regard to heating, were it not for the fact that Fine Gael members had been pressing for months past for this information.  When some information was supplied at a committee meeting, the committee was adjourned because the members expressed dissatisfaction with the information that had been given.</P>
    <P>What some people want the ordinary working people to do is neglect their wives and families and responsibilities and run the risk as one member of the Corporation did, because of his neglect of his professional duties, of becoming a bankrupt and a convict.  That is the kind of thing some people want the public of this city to believe is the way in which the affairs of the city should be run.  However, we believe that there is a serious need to reform the whole committee arrangements of the Dublin Corporation and also that there is no need to have years and years of talk, comment and argument in order to get essential things done.</P>
    <P>If there is a problem to be tackled, there are two ways of tackling it.  One is to do what is necessary and the other is to refer it to a committee, let a committee talk about it and talk it out, let a good idea die in committee. If committee meetings and talk could build houses, there would be no housing crisis in Dublin at present but we are led to believe here that if some people attended committee meetings, all would be well.  We are watching what is happening.</P>

      <P>When the Housing Committee was meeting over the past seven years, it just met and talked.  There was never a shortage of talk or meetings and during all those years what happened ?  When we were building houses, we were not interested in talking and committees: we were interested in building and we built, in our last year of office, for Dublin Corporation 1,564 houses.  But the committees kept on meeting twice a month and the talk continued and the Government changed and 1,021 houses were built in the following year.  The committees <Col N="1805" /> kept on meeting and the talk went on and we dropped to 460 houses in the next year.  The committees still kept on meeting and the talking continued and there was a great rise in the following year to 505 houses, still only one-third of the number built when the work was being done.  Yet there was great talk about the increase that year which was really a reduction to 505. In 1961, the figure went down to 277 and the committees still continued to meet and the talk went on.  In 1962 the figure was 392 and there was a great celebration when in 1963 it went to 643.  The committees went on meeting and the talk went on and we got 786 houses built in 1964, still less than half what was being achieved in the year 1956-57, our last year of office, and the year in which we were abused and criticised because a sufficient number of houses were not being built.</P>
      <P>We might have reason to wonder if some people should attend committee meetings so that they would know all the facts and we might argue that if they attended meetings they would not be reckless in what they said and would be more accurate in their information. Yet we find in the course of this debate it was stated that the reason for the drop in the number of houses built was that 1,600 houses became vacant in the last year of the inter-Party Government, 1956-57.  One would imagine that somebody who boasted so much about attending committee meetings would recite the facts but that was not done because in the year 1956-57 the number of vacancies was 794.  In the following year it was 986; in 1958, 1,294; in 1959, 1,393 and it was not until the year of grace 1960, when Fianna Fáil were back in office, that the figure of 1,600 to which Deputy Dowling referred was reached.  It took them three years to multiply the vacancy rate to more than double what it was when we left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all very interesting and shows us what some people learn at some of these so-called committee meetings.  We had Deputy Moore talking about the drop in the number of houses built when Fine Gael were <Col N="1806" /> in power and, as I say, instead of a drop, the number of houses built increased because in the year ended 31st March, 1956, only 1,311 houses were built by Dublin Corporation and in the following year we built 1,654, an increased because in the year ended houses in our last year of office. Deputy Moore described that as a drop in the number of houses being built.  He then admitted, and one must applaud a man when he confessed something to the disadvantage of his Party, that there was a drop over the following two years until the great revival came about.</P>
    <P>We find, of course, Deputy Moore is quite wrong, that the drop, while it continued to 1960, became worse in 1961 and still worse in the next year and that we are still building fewer houses so that instead of a drop for a period of two years to which Deputy Moore confessed it was not a venial sin of neglect but a mortal sin of neglect that now leaves 10,000 families representing 40,000 people without a home to call their own and most of them with no prospect of having a home of their own within the next two years.  These are the realities.  We are blamed by the cloister commentators and by the refined people in our community because we blame Fianna Fáil for this.  I cannot understand the functioning of democracy if in its operation one side only may take credit and the other side is not allowed to apply or apportion the blame.  That is a negation of democracy but even if it were to be accepted that this was an inevitable course of events over which Fianna Fáil had no control it could be said, perhaps, it would be unfair to blame them.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find in their programme of so-called expansion, their First Programme published in 1958 an assertion on the very front page that there was going to be a falling-off in social investment such as housing and schools because the demand for them had been met.  That is what they said and one credits them with believing what they said and with trying to achieve what they set out to achieve.  One has only to produce their <Col N="1807" /> own White Paper, Housing Programme and Prospects, to prove the figures I have given to this House rather than the casually, inaccurately or irresponsibly produced figures which are wrong.  There is an endeavour to give a certain authority to these wrong figures by suggesting that the spokesman who is giving them is a member of a particularly important and useful committee. The actual results are there for the 10,000 families to endure and that is what matters.</P>
    <P>What is done in the midst of all this absolutely unnecessary housing crisis? We have spent, within the past year, £20,000 on maintaining a disused army barracks at South Circular Road, Dublin to house some 30 to 40 homeless families.  But what do we find some members of this great housing committee doing to justify this?  We find them engaging in propaganda suggesting that these families are problem families and are there through their own maladministration, because they are impossible families for whom one cannot do anything, because they are difficult families.  What is the truth? The truth is that most of the fathers of the families in Griffith Barracks are in good employment and the only reason they cannot get any accommodation is that the private renters of property or rooms will not have children in flats. Again and again evictions take place in this city for no reason other than that young married couples have a child born to them and where such young couples are unable to get accommodation in their parents' houses they have no alternative, unless they have four children, but to take the road to Griffith Barracks and stay there until such time as the Corporation reach a position where they begin to house families of mother and father and three children, a situation which is shortly about to be reached.</P>

      <P>This is the type of propaganda that is being made.  Deputy Moore and others are giving the impression that these 800 are going to be housed this month when they know <Col N="1808" /> very well they are not going to be housed for several months to come. Many of these families will find little comfort in 1965 when they have still not got the accommodation that was going to be given to them &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; for several months past.  This is what happens when you butcher the housing programme.  This is what happens when you abandon your social obligation to provide houses.</P>
      <P>One accepts that this society of ours has long since acknowledged its duty to feed and clothe people.  The sad thing is that while we in Fine Gael thought we had convinced the people of the need to pay the price of housing our people, as a result of which we were spending one-third of our annual national resources on housing, the Fianna Fáil Party succeeded in convincing the people that housing could wait, that housing was not essential. They convinced the people in 1958 and since then that the housing needs of the country had been met.  The result is that the housing output in Dublin dropped from 1,600 local authority houses to 270 and throughout the length and breadth of the country a similar situation developed where there was a drop from 4,700 local authority houses to 1,600 local authority houses per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the dangers of attending committees and of not thinking, not doing your own homework, is that you do not realise what is happening outside your own parish.  To this day there are many devoted and dedicated members of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee and other bodies in Dublin who are not aware that their own experience has been repeated throughout the length and breadth of the country and who think that the situation in Dublin is one that is peculiar to Dublin and because of Dublin circumstances. These people are not even aware that the Government, in the 1958 programme of so-called expansion, cut down on housing in a way that local authorities were discouraged to build houses.  These people do not appreciate that there are a hundred and one ways of killing a dog besides choking him with butter and that oftentimes the <Col N="1809" /> policy is dictated, not by direct representations by a Minister through county councils or <i>vice versa</i> but rather by the faceless officials in the Department of Finance and the Department of Local Government and others who slow down the machine in a thousand and one ways or who offer advice in as many ways to convince the local representatives that they ought to be cutting down on various forms of expenditure.</P>
    <P>It gives us absolutely no joy or pleasure whatsoever to be reciting these sad facts but they are there and they have to be faced.  One wonders what exactly the Government are doing to face them.  Compared with seven years ago the cost of building today is about twice what it was then but we have not doubled the amount of money which we are spending on housing. The second programme of so-called expansion last year set a target for building and yet the figure was underspent to the tune of £1¼ million, and in this coming year the figure which is allocated for housing takes into account that £1¼ million which was not spent last year and, if you take that into account, you find that the amount of additional money to be provided this year to meet the crushing housing situation is only, in fact, about £3 million and this, with the increased cost of building, is barely adequate to maintain the present inadequate pace and certainly a long way off the figure which the Government in their own estimate say is necessary, that is, a figure of 12,000 to 13,000 houses per year.  We are certain they are not going to reach it if we do not provide a lot more money than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his Budget Statement, mentioned that talks were to take place between the Central Bank and the other banks with a view to seeing if better credit arrangements and facilities could be made available for productive purposes.  One hopes that these talks have already taken place with good effect or that they will in the near future but it seems to us equally important that there should be sufficient credit available for housing purposes.  We are convinced that <Col N="1810" /> food, clothing and housing are absolutely essentials for human beings and we do not think that there is any financial consideration which can justify the restriction of credit for housing purposes.  We are sorry that the Minister has not used the Budget to divert money from other forms of spending and investment into essential needs such as housing.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister in reply to a question of mine said that the hire purchase debt was over £41 million. That is a tremendous figure.  I do not know whether the Minister has any breakdown of that £41 million, how much of it is spent on luxury items and so on, how much is spent on industrial machinery.  Perhaps I will endeavour to see if this information is available on another occasion.  It is perhaps reasonable to expect that most of that is in respect of non-essentials and it might be desirable in a situation such as we have at the present time to require larger deposits to be paid on hire purchase goods.  It would be a form of stimulating saving and even if this were done to only a small degree, even requiring only a very small deposit, it might make available for more productive and more useful purposes and to answer social needs some of the money that is at present being spent on unnecessary consumer goods.</P>
    <P>Our criticism in Fine Gael of this Budget is that the Minister has not used the various techniques available to him to channel whatever money is available into more desirable forms of expenditure.  I do not know whether the Minister has any information on this point but, if he has, I should like him to inform the House whether there have been substantial withdrawals from building societies in recent times.  My information is that a considerable amount of money has been withdrawn from the funds of some of our building societies for reinvestment in Britain where some local authorities at present are offering as much as eight to ten per cent.  If that trend is one of the reasons for the present terrible restrictions in our building societies, I think it is desirable that the Minister should take immediate and effective steps to <Col N="1811" /> curtail that flow of money from the housing needs of our own people to answer what may be important housing needs elsewhere.  We ought to attend to our own needs at home first.</P>
    <P>It is true that most hire purchase firms and most finance houses who are engaging in the enticement of money for consumer purposes offer a higher rate of interest than building societies and, again, a great deal of money which could be going in to answer the very important social need of housing may be driven towards those unnecessary places and we would like to see the Minister taking steps to ensure that building societies are no longer restricted in the way in which they are.  The present indications are that there is not going to be any relaxation of credit for building societies for several months to come. If that happens, apart from the fact that several thousand of our own people will not be able to set up home, our builders and persons employed in the building trade may run into a great deal of trouble.  All this ought to be avoided and any steps the Minister and the Government may take to meet the financial needs of the building industry here in producing houses will receive every encouragement and sympathy from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education intervened in this debate to speak about the great effort which he and his Government were making towards educational expansion.  I might be prepared to accept a great deal of what he said if the Minister would answer a very simple question I addressed to his predecessor in February last and which I addressed to him last week. I asked the Minister if he would state the number of national school classes in Dublin city and county with more than 50 children on the roll.  It seems to be a perfectly simple question, a perfectly innocent question, an information-seeking question, and one might expect a Minister, if he had nothing to hide, would answer it and would answer it openly.</P>
    <P>The Minister, instead of answering my question this week, referred me to a reply given on 17th February <Col N="1812" /> last to a similar question which I addressed to his predecessor.  On that occasion the Minister's predecessor told me there was a number of such classes but he was not prepared to give the information.  Why is the Minister not prepared to give the information?  I believe it is because there is a large number of these classes, notwithstanding the specific undertaking given by the Minister last year that there would be no classes in national schools in Dublin with more than 50 pupils on the rolls at the beginning of the school year in September, 1964.</P>
    <P>Here we find twice in the following academic year a Minister refusing to tell us whether there are classes with more than 50 pupils and, if so, how many.  The reason is that there are several classes in Dublin national schools with more than 50 on the rolls.  Last year the Minister and his Government sought credit for the decision that there was to be a reduction to 50.  They clapped themselves on the back and got a certain amount of applause for it from parents and school authorities, but the fact is that they have not fulfilled their promise and they will not tell Dáil Éireann and the country how many classes are still over the figure of 50.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister to state this week what steps will be taken this year to ensure that there will be no classes with more than 50 children on the rolls of Dublin city schools after the summer vacation.  The Minister combined the two questions and referred me to the answer which he gave on 17th February last.</P>
    <P>One can appreciate that there might be pockets of difficulty in particular suburbs where a bulge, as it is called, in the population may have occurred. In modern housing estates which are built at one time the likelihood is that out of 300 houses, there may be young married couples going into 275 of them.  It is inevitable, therefore, that there will be a population bulge in that locality for the following ten or 20 years.  However, if Deputies ask the Minister for Education how many classes are over the figure of 50, he <Col N="1813" /> ought to be manly enough to tell Dáil Éireann and he also ought to be manly enough to tell Dáil Éireann what steps will be taken to meet the problem in 1965.  It may well be the Minister does not intend to provide any more accommodation for schools in Dublin in 1965.  If that is so, the people of Dublin are entitled to know it.  It is not the last time I will mention this matter.  I shall certainly be provoked to mention it every time the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education talk about increasing educational facilities, if at the same time they refuse to disclose any information about the size of national school classes in this city.</P>
    <P>Whatever credit may be given or taken for an improvement in educational facilities, the fact is that we are providing scholarships for post-primary education for only about one in every 24 of our boys and girls leaving the national school.  That is certainly an inadequate figure and we cannot hope to provide the necessary skilled and trained operatives for an expanding economy if we do not provide better educational opportunities for our children.  One in 24 compares very badly indeed with the figures for other even reasonably advanced economies. We must go a great deal further in this regard and we must hope there will be a substantial improvement in years to come.</P>
    <P>I thought there would be an end to talk about the Select Committee on Health Services.  As one may have suspected from my opening remarks, I have no great faith in committees of any kind, and when the proposal of the then Minister for Health was before this House to establish that Select Committee, I spoke against it.  I said it was only a fraud and intended only to deceive the people into believing something was being done about health.  I also said that members of the House who were unfortunate enough to accept appointment to it would become the stooges of the Minister for Health.  I do not mind mentioning that when I was twice asked to represent my Party on that Committee, at the beginning and later on when <Col N="1814" /> another member resigned, I declined on both occasions because I was convinced from the very outset that the Committee was meant only to deceive and that it would never achieve anything. It gives me little satisfaction to say now: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, although I am entitled to say it.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that the social needs of our people should become the plaything of politics.  Instead of the Government leading the people as they ought to do, they set up committees to postpone necessary social reform.  That is precisely what the purpose of that Select Committee was.  It achieved its purpose magnificently.  The Minister for Health deserves credit for achieving what he set out to achieve, that is to prevent any health reform in this country.  Not only did he succeed in keeping his dead hand on health reform while he was there but he has also apparently obliged the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Cabinet not to provide any improvement in health services this year.  To do so would have been to throw out Deputy MacEntee with the dishwater and that would have been an unpleasant experience for him and the Party. Rather than let him down entirely, they decided that the people who are looking for improved health services can wait until such time as it is no longer politically embarrassing for Fianna Fáil to do so.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity in every Finance Bill for the Minister for Finance to do something to assist one sector of the community, and I am very disappointed that this year the Minister has not chosen to do it.  For the past few years, we on this side of the House have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill asking that income tax allowances be given to people who expend more than a certain minimum figure every year on medical expenses. We have provided in our amendment, which we shall table again this year, that the allowance will be paid only to people who are unable to insure with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in respect of a particular illness or infirmity from which they suffer. This is something which would not <Col N="1815" /> cost a great deal but which would be of immense relief to people who are suffering from chronic diseases and ailments of one kind or another.  Any person who is suffering from a chronic disease will not be accepted by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board because he is an obviously bad risk. Such a person has no free command over a portion of his income.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  I am simply censuring the Minister for not bringing in a reform which I think he ought to have brought in.  My point is that if income tax is based on any principle, it is on the principle that it it is a tax on income that a person is free to expend perhaps on things which might not be entirely necessary.</P>
      <P>The preservation of human life and the relief of human suffering are essential.  A person who has to spend five, ten, 15 or 20 per cent of income on the maintenance of life, or to relieve pain, should not be taxed in respect of that portion of the income. There are other countries, including Australia, where income tax allowances are available for certifiable expenses in the case of ill-health and we would like to see the Minister bring that system into operation here.  It might also provide the Minister with an income from another source.  I do not know whether this has occurred to him, but it might result in disclosing the incomes of other people if the Revenue Commissioners were to have certified to them the medical expenses of people who are ill.</P>
      <P>The question of prices is one which cannot be divorced from taxes, as we have so clearly seen in the past, and as we have seen over the past week.  I tabled a question last Monday to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the price of drink.  This was followed on Tuesday by an announcement from the Minister that he was going to hold an inquiry into the recent increase.  This is just another instance of Fine Gael Government from the Opposition Benches.</P>

      <P>What is interesting is that the Minister's inquiry is related only to the retail trade.  We wonder why he has stopped short of investigating the profits of the brewers and distillers. The first people to take advantage of the increases in tax on these commodities in order to increase their own prices were the brewers and distillers. They having tempted the retail trade, the retailers promptly followed suit.  It is undesirable that where important and essential taxes are imposed these should be used by manufacturers or distributors to increase their own profits.  One understands the various stresses and strains everyone has to face today in meeting rising costs but it is undesirable, we think, that every time a tax is imposed for social purposes certain people should use that occasion to siphon off an increase of personal gain to themselves.</P>
      <P>This is, of course, a common pattern in society, not alone here but throughout the world.  It helps to emphasise that increases in Government expenditure inevitably lead to increases in other costs, not merely because the Government are drawing more money out of the economy but because they tempt people to increase their own profit margins.  One can only hope the proposed inquiry will not be prolonged. What has happened in recent years is that inquiries have laboured so long over their particular task that, by the time a report is furnished, events justify the increase anyway.  The result is that people are becoming frightened of the general trend in prices and we do not think that is something that should be allowed to continue indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are disappointed that the Minister is still adopting a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude in relation to prices.  We do not think the answer is the severe type of emergency control which might be justified in war time, but, in times of economic and financial forecasting, we think it is important to forecast the field within which prices might be expected or allowed to rise.  Where we <Col N="1817" /> find fault with the Minister and the Government is that they have not made any forecasts of the field, or the scope, or even prophesied which prices might be expected to rise.  Neither have they sought to ensure that reduced costings will reduce the prices of goods.  NIEC emphasised this in their comments upon the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion:</i> they said that it is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...by using some part of the annual increase in productivity to reduce prices and thus to make possible an expansion in sales and open up new employment opportunities. If the full benefits of rising productivity accrue directly to the factors of production rather than indirectly by way of lower prices, there is not likely to be a sufficiently large improvement in competitiveness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government, by running away from the price factor in the economy, are in fact impairing our economy, the efficiency of the economy and the employment opportunities of the economy.  We think this attitude&mdash;doing nothing about price increases until they occur&mdash;is not sufficiently advanced for the second half of the twentieth century and it will ultimately negative all efforts made for a planned advance in our economy.  Unless the Minister tackles this matter, we shall continue to have a succession of economic slumps and booms, with a perpetual trend towards inflation.</P>
    <P>We are surprised, too, that the Minister has not used this Budget to bring back the nation on to the targets set for 1970.  We do not accept that the targets set in the Second Programme are sufficient.  We think they are both inadequate and defeatist and, even if they are achieved, we shall still be well behind, and going further behind all the time, other countries in Europe with whom we hope to be associated economically and socially by 1970. We frequently forget, I think, that if we become a member of the European Economic Community, we will be obliged to maintain social services of a standard similar to those operated by these countries and, if we have not boosted our own economy and <Col N="1818" /> resources to the point necessary to pay for these social services, we shall be in dire trouble by 1970.  Our excuse to date for not having better social services is that the country cannot afford them.  By 1970, we will be on the horns of a dilemma because we will be obliged to maintain social standards with an economy, which, according to our own theories, will not be in a position to support them. What the outcome will be I dread to think.</P>
    <P>We find in the first year of the Second Programme capital expenditure on industry is short by at least £2½ million.  The anticipated expenditure last year was to be £9,160,000 and we are short of that figure by £2½ million.  That is a very big figure in one year.  Now we are being driven into a period of increasing restriction in credit and one is frightened to think what the next year will hold unless there is a substantial improvement in credit.</P>
    <P>We find also that in the provision of hospitals the target of £2,900,000 was not reached; we spent only £1,800,000; we were off course in our hospital programme for last year. Notwithstanding that, we are going to provide only an additional £1,700,000 this year and, of that sum, £1,100,000 represents the deficit on last year. This year, therefore, we are providing only a little over £500,000 for improvement in our hospitals and that at a time when all building costs have multiplied.</P>
    <P>Our housing expenditure last year was also short of the target by £1¼ million.  If that figure is applied to this year, when one deducts that, one finds that we are again well off target.</P>
    <P>Again, in industrial employment, we are below the figure which the conservative <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> asked as the minimum necessary.  In emigration we are more than double what the Second Programme thought the country would be in a position to suffer. There were a number of techniques available to the Minister in this Budget, but he has not availed of them to put the country back on the right course.  The result of that may well be that we will be well off the <Col N="1819" /> economic and financial boom the Second Programme promises in 1970.</P>
    <P>Some people praise the Minister because the Budget gave relief to the less fortunate sections of the community and did not do anything else. We in Fine Gael do not think the Budget deserves credit for anything except for providing a certain amount of improvement for a limited number of social welfare beneficiaries.  We are certainly not the ones to praise the Minister for doing nothing else.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest things in our economic life is our undeveloped labour force.  The Taoiseach in his address, the Minister in his Budget Statement and other Government spokesmen spoke about their new manpower policy and their proposals to train people who may become redundant by reason of rationalisation, modernisation and the impact of free trade.  We do not think that is going far enough.  A chronic seven per cent of our people are unemployed.  There is something wrong if our society does not provide the necessary training for as many of those people as possible. We do not think we should have to wait for people to become redundant. We ought to be providing training immediately for as many of the current 50,000 employed as can benefit by it. There are a number of industries which require highly skilled operatives.  In a labour force as large as 50,000, there are certainly some people who could acquire the necessary skills now.  Such people, while acquiring those skills, should be given the same form of redundancy and stand-down pay as the Government are at present contemplating for people who may become redundant through the rationalisation of industry.</P>
    <P>If we do not do this, we are neglecting one of our most substantial resources.  One thing we are not short of in this country is manpower, but it is sad that our manpower has not been properly used in the past.  There is no prospect of its being properly utilised until such time as the employment exchanges are taken from the control of the Department of Social Welfare and given to some more dynamic agency, such as the Department of <Col N="1820" /> Industry and Commerce.  The Department of Social Welfare is geared to provide assistance for people in need, to try to relieve human suffering and make good inadequate incomes.  A Department always concerned with such activity is not the kind of Department to instil the kind of training, hope and skill which ought to be given to our unemployed people to enable them to become qualified for employment in the more sophisticated industries we are likely to have in the future.  During the course of the debate on Industry and Commerce, the transfer of employment exchanges to any other Department was not envisaged.  I cannot see how the Minister for Finance and the Government can hope to achieve any worthwhile manpower retraining programme unless they shift the employment exchanges into the hands of some new agency.</P>
    <P>In this country we cannot divorce our comments on economic matters from industrial relations.  We are concerned about the fact that this Christian country of ours has as yet been unable to develop a really proper Christian approach to the problem of industrial relations.  This is a vital matter.  How people work will control how they live.  Whether people are happy in their employment will govern their output.  Whether people receive adequate remuneration or not, will govern the claims made on the public purse for the redistribution of the national income.</P>
    <P>This whole problem of industrial relations will have to be tackled in a realistic way if we are to achieve the target set for ourselves.  Central European countries, particularly Germany, have an average annual loss of working hours because of industrial disputes of about .4 of one per cent for every one thousand days.  We here have a figure at the best of times of from 40 to 50 days per 1,000 days, and in some cases of 150 to 200 days.  The figure for Germany is repeated in Sweden and a number of other northern countries.  We will have to tackle the problem of industrial relations more courageously and in a more Christian way than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> We do not minimise the difficulties facing the Government and all others involved in this.  We can only hope that the coming together of management and employees in the various councils established for the purpose of considering our position in the future may convince these people it is just as important to have good industrial relations as it is to rationalise and modernise industry.  We have been successful to a degree in bringing a number of foreign investors and industrialists here.  I can see Government propaganda leaflets mentioning that we have a good labour force and good labour relations here.  It is not entirely true when you make a comparison with the position in Germany and Sweden.  Industrialists coming to this country must be very saddened to find the situation is far from what they were led to believe it to be.  Let us hope there will be an improvement in that field.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is one relating to the proposal in the Budget to apply income tax to income from property other than rents.  At the time the financial proposals were before the House I asked the Minister for some more information on that aspect of it.  It is a rather technical point and I can appreciate the Minister was not able to give me any explanatory information at the time. However, I would be grateful if he would do it as soon as possible.  One of the aspects he did refer to can certainly be understood, that is, where, instead of charging a rent on a property, an effort is made to capitalise the rent figure and charge that as a premium at the commencement of a lease.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is intended that this should go any further, nor am I aware of how the Revenue Commissioners propose to assess the difference between what you might call a legitimate fine and a fine which is put on in substitution for a rent.  Are we to understand that every time a person receives a fine for any of his property, that fine is to be treated as income in respect of that year?  If that be so, it opens up the most appalling consequences. <Col N="1822" /> The financial proposals as set out, and from what the Minister gave us to believe, would indicate that if a person sold an ordinary house in any year, the price received by that person for the house would be subject to income tax.  I do not know whether the person would be given a remission of the tax in the event of purchasing another private dwelling.  But it certainly gives us cause for considerable alarm that this particular tax should be under consideration.  We will want to know a great deal more about it before we can give it general approval.</P>
    <P>There is a need to put a tax on some forms of speculative capital gains which have been made here on house property.  It is undesirable that one should impose any form of capital gains tax on private dwellings where, because of depreciation in the value of money or an increase in the cost of building or for other causes, the price of houses may increase, but where speculators enter into the property market and seek to make gains and profit out of municipal developments and where they seek to make profit out of the increasing complexity of modern traffic conditions, it is open to the Minister to collect tax.  He would have been justified in doing so because many of the gains which have been made in property in this city for a long time have arisen out of social matters and also development by local authorities for the public service.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that a person can in one year purchase a large tract of virgin land, far removed from any service, and, therefore, next to worthless for housing or development purposes, and within a decade sell that property at immense profit because social and economic demands in a nearby city or town will have reached out to that property.  The local authority of that city or town will, in the meantime, have provided various services adjacent to that property.  The result of that type of development has been that many people have made tremendous profits although they have done nothing to earn the profit for themselves.  I wonder whether this particular section in the Finance Bill is <Col N="1823" /> intended to have the effect of getting at some of the profits which are earned under such circumstances?</P>
    <P>We consider that a tax of that kind would be justified and would not be any real hardship on the people who have to pay it.  If the tax is related to profits which have been made available without any effort, would it be considered any real hardship to collect it? I know of one property&mdash;I have mentioned this before&mdash;which consisted of seven or eight houses.  The first house was sold for about £2,500 and the last one was sold for something like £17,000 in a matter of two or three years.  The site is now available for sale again and the price sought is in the region of £250,000, although nothing has been done with the property in the meantime.  There has been nothing done to demolish it.  I suppose somebody will pay that price for it.  It seems extraordinary that a person could make that profit while we do not try to get some of the profit for the public generally.</P>
    <P>Such profits are only made by people who have immense resources themselves.  These profits are not available to the ordinary man.  They are profits which can be made by large combines and very few of them are of Irish origin.  I should like to see the Minister taking steps to acquire some of this money for the benefit of the public purse.  This would also, to some extent, assist the State to acquire money for municipal and social developments.</P>
    <P>The usual reply from the Minister for Finance regarding proposals made by the Opposition for spending money is to ask where the money is to come from.  I have indicated two ways where tax can be collected.  I am disappointed the Minister has not done anything about this.  We are also disappointed that the Budget has done nothing to get the national economic rocket back on the target for 1970. We do not think the Micawber-like attitude they have adopted of hoping that something is bound to turn up is any good.  Our economy is such that under the stresses and strains <Col N="1824" /> of modern times that is not likely to happen.  We hope the Government will not have any reason to regret not taking steps in the 1965 Budget to do these necessary things.</P>

      <P>Now that the Budget debate has entered well into its second week and that most of the points arising out of it have already been debated at length by previous speakers, and points of view have been expressed by all Parties in this House, there is very little one can add at this stage.  Therefore, I shall not take the Minister to task for any failures in regard to the Budget.</P>
      <P>My first reaction, on hearing the Minister's proposals for increases in benefits to social welfare recipients, was that a very genuine effort was being made to narrow the gap between the financial means of these unfortunate people and the means which they needed to meet the high cost of living today.  The Minister for Social Welfare, during the course of his contribution to this debate, used percentages largely.  According to what he told us, while the cost of living had increased by only 7.2 per cent, they would still be living in February, 1965, the recipients of social welfare payments were now about to receive increases varying from 13.5 per cent to over 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe we should deal in percentages at all when speaking about these unfortunate people.  Indeed, if their means were increased by 100 per cent, they would still only be living in very frugal comfort.  In fact, I personally feel there is over-emphasis on percentages in our society today.  I know this is something which I cannot lay at the Minister's feet but I fail to see the justice in assuming that £1 a week extra is ample compensation for a man with £8 or less a week.  Those who receive larger remuneration get progressively larger increases.  As I say, this is something for which the Minister is not responsible and I cannot lay it at his feet.  I feel, however, it is not just that big discrepancies should exist in these increases.  A man with £8 a week is in a relatively worse position with all the adjustments that have been <Col N="1825" /> made.  The only consolation he has is that things could be worse.</P>
    <P>Despite the lip service paid over very many years to the concept of equal pay for equal work, nothing constructive has been done to bring about this situation.  I know this is a matter more for arbitration than for the Minister for Finance.  Looking through the Estimates for the various Departments, one can see very ample evidence of the fact that there is one rate of pay for a man and a lesser rate of pay for a woman doing the same work.  This applies only to single men and women. I know married men are entitled to bigger pay because of the responsibilities they carry.</P>
    <P>I now want to return to the Budget proposals.  We in the Labour Party agree with the Minister in his effort to increase taxation in order to give increased benefits to the unfortunate recipients of social welfare allowances. We did not anticipate that the amount demanded from the public would in one case be at least 100 per cent more than that demanded by the Minister by way of taxation.  I am very glad the Minister is to investigate this colossal increase, I hope, with a view to eliminating it from the point of view of the public.</P>
    <P>We feel, also, that no case can be made for the introduction of a new means test of £26 per annum in respect of some recipients of old age non-contributory pensions.  I think only 40,000 need to be catered for, should this means test not be applied.  If the Minister had looked around for other sources from which taxation could be obtained without causing any undue hardship on the community, he could very easily have found them.  I have in mind a particular field of entertainment which could well have afforded increased taxation to pay increased benefits to those people.</P>
    <P>The fact that the increases mentioned will not come into operation immediately and have no retrospective effect has been laboured at length in this debate.  Apart from the injustice involved, there is the vital point that the cost of living will have increased <Col N="1826" /> further before those people get their benefits.  I think it has a psychological effect on them, that, year after year, they have to wait for three to nine months for whatever increases may be awarded to them while other better-off sections of the community are paid increases retrospective to the date of their claim.  The only excuse the Minister gave for this course of action was that it is in accordance with custom. We all know that many customs have had to be abandoned from time to time in the interests of progress and justice.  This is one custom which should come under the hammer of the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I hope it will come under the hammer of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>It has been the custom all down the years to carry out exhaustive inquiries into means and matters relating to people who apply for non-contributory pensions and other social welfare benefits and allowances.  If the same exhaustive inquiries were made into the <i>bona fides</i> of those people who are applying for huge State grants to set up industries here, one feels that there would be less misdirection of public funds than there has been to date.  I am not saying that very many non-national companies have not been a real asset to our community but there are some who object completely to trade union organisation among their employees.  They seem to be obsessed with the idea of obtaining cheap labour in this country.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to give grants to people to set up industry here with a view to increasing our exports but unless such industries provide employment for our people with decent wages and conditions, they will not help to solve our greatest national problem which is emigration.  It seems to be particularly difficult for small Irish concerns to acquire small sums to start little industries.  I have in mind in particular voluntary organisations which seek help to carry on their work. There is an organisation in Cork of which I am sure the Minister is well aware which is doing its best to rehabilitate long-term mental hospital patients and to fit them to take their <Col N="1827" /> place in industry.  That organisation is operating solely with the assistance of voluntary funds.  In an attempt to expand the little industry they have established, in which they have woodwork classes, hand-knitting and other little handicrafts, they applied to various Departments of State for assistance: I cannot say whether they would come under the heading of Health, Education or Industry.  However, they have failed to get assistance from the State.  Without such assistance, these people cannot hope to expand their field of activity or to break the back of the huge problem they have so gallantly tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance told us of increased automation within the Civil Service and said it will result in increased efficiency and progress.  We are all interested in increased efficiency and progress but we should like to be sure that these machines which replace labour in the Civil Service will not prove more expensive to maintain than the labour they replace.  We should also like to feel that our boys and girls leaving school who will not now obtain employment in the Civil Service because the work they would otherwise be engaged upon will now be done by machines, which I am sure will be imported, will be able to find other avenues of employment at home before we over-indulge in automation in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education had some heartening news for us during the course of his speech in this debate. He told us that from 1966 onwards we shall have an increase of 50 per cent in the output of national teachers from St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin.  This, we presume, is aimed at reducing the number of pupils per class.  Due to the shortsighted policy up to now of erecting national schools throughout the country based on the number of teachers already teaching in the area rather than on any prospect of reducing the size of classes, the Minister will now have to begin right away to build extra rooms to many of our national schools before he can hope to provide <Col N="1828" /> employment for the extra number of teachers he envisages during the coming years.</P>
    <P>There is little else I have to say except to tell the Minister that, with all its defects, we feel the Budget has been an attempt to give a fairer share of the national income to the weaker sections of our community.  So long as he continues along this road, he will have the fullest support of the people sitting on these benches.</P>

      <P>I intend to be brief. This Budget cannot be described as good or bad but when ever did we see people in this country pleased with any Budget?  I should like to know if we are to have supplementary Budgets before this year is out and if we shall have the position that increases will be sought by various Departments, as has happened in the past when, for instance, in the case of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, money was filched from the people.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very interested in the price of drink.  That is all right, but first things first.  It is not by drink alone that we live.  You can live it up, possibly, but there are thousands of people in this country and many old age pensioners whose staple diet is bread, butter and tea.  It is a wonder to me that the Minister, any time he saw an increase in the price of food, did not step in, as he has done in this case of drink.</P>

      <P>The results were not so good: we have seen it over the years.  Recently, we saw the result of the price of bread going up and every other day we see that the price of something or other goes up.  It is a case of something to be put on, one way or another, and the public pay through the nose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many thousands of our old age pensioners will be disappointed.  They <Col N="1829" /> were led to believe by banner headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i> that there would be 10/- for all old age pensioners&mdash;but there was a snag.  Nobody would get the 10/- unless he or she was down on his or her uppers.  We shall now have a horde of inspectors roaming the countryside and there will be many who will find that their pension will be lessened by much more than they will get.</P>
    <P>I do not see much in this Budget to help a very important aspect of our life&mdash;house building.  The Budget does not hold much encouragement towards off-setting the increases that have been put on the ordinary house builder, especially where young couples are concerned.  These are people who would build their own houses, take responsibility on themselves, have a stake in the country and stay put.  I should like to see the Minister directing some of that money towards encouraging these people.</P>
    <P>I said I would be brief so I should just like to wish the Minister well in his new post.  He was always very approachable and he has my sympathy in the gigantic task he has before him. Any decent person will wish him well because he is working in the interests of the country.  Finance is the kernel of all and I wish the Minister every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start off by picking out the last remark and thanking Deputy Coogan and the other Deputies on his side of the House who have wished me well in my new office?  Limited though their wishes were, I nevertheless very much appreciate them.</P>
      <P>I think, in general, the Budget has been accepted throughout the country as a good one, and, indeed, in the House amongst all Parties.  Any dissension there was has I think been generated mainly by the rival claims of Fine Gael and Labour as to which of those two Parties was responsible for the increased social welfare benefits. I do not know whether these claims have since been resolved as I have not heard anything in the last two days about it except in the concluding statement of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> The increase provided this year was, I suggest, perfectly consistent with Fianna Fáil social welfare policy since they first came into Government, as is evidenced by the fact that Fianna Fáil have been responsible for every single aspect of social welfare legislation that has been passed in this country.  It is significant in this respect that when in the first inter-Party Government efforts were made to introduce a comprehensive social welfare scheme, and there was then a Labour Minister for Social Welfare as indeed there was in the second Coalition Government, that scheme was thwarted within the ranks of the inter-Party Government itself, as a result of a certain reactionary element within the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>I have said the increases given in social welfare benefits this year are consistent with Fianna Fáil policy, not only with Fianna Fáil policy but with Fianna Fáil actions down through the years and more particularly since 1959 since when each year the Fianna Fáil Budget included an increase for social welfare benefit recipients.  There were a number of years when 2/6 was given by way of increase to old age pensioners.  It is remarkable, in these circumstances, that both Fine Gael and Labour should claim that it was their activities that stimulated the Fianna Fáil Government to give what are regarded as more satisfactory increases in this year.  What I find most difficult of all to comprehend is the allegation that the increases were introduced in the shadow of a general election.  That would be understandable if the general election were to take place after the introduction of a Budget in which increases were given. But, when a Budget succeeds a general election, and is produced within a month of a general election, it is difficult to understand the suggestion that it was in the shadow of that general election the social welfare increases were introduced.</P>
    <P>It would be far more politically advantageous for a Government to delay whatever increases it could afford to pay until near or succeeding an election, whereas, in fact, we have done it the other way round.  That, I <Col N="1831" /> think, is another earnest of the regard Fianna Fáil have for the needs of social welfare recipients, and their regard also for the capacity of our people to pay for any increases that were given.</P>
    <P>However, social welfare benefits are not the be-all and the end-all of social welfare policy.  As I mentioned in my Budget speech, there are other aspects of social legislation and social policy we must take into account.  These include housing, health services, education, training, and so on.  These are being examined by various teams and groups.  Reports have been received on some of them and when these reports have been properly studied and action on them co-ordinated and priorities given, then we will have a proper scheme for social legislation and we shall be in a position to see what our capacity is, what our needs are and how we can give effect to these needs in their proper order of priority.</P>
    <P>Some questions were addressed to me about the social welfare benefits in particular.  I do not wish to go into them in any great detail because there will be a better opportunity subsequently for discussing these details.  I think I was asked in particular for a breakdown of the amounts involved in the increased expenditure this year. I do not even want to go into details on all that because it would delay the House too long.  Repetition of the figures a number of times would not serve any useful purpose.  Of the increases, the old age non-contributory pensions will cost £1.586 million extra this year.  If we add to that the other non-contributory classes&mdash;unemployment assistance recipients, small-holders under the amendment of the unemployment assistance scheme and widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions&mdash;these four together amount to £2.376 million.  If we add to that the contributory classes&mdash;old age pensions, widows' pensions, unemployment and disability benefit&mdash;we add a further £1.324 million.  In the full year the non-contributory old age pension increases will cost £2.4 million and the total assistance classes increases will be £3.094 million.  As I have said <Col N="1832" /> in the Budget speech, the total this year for the increases will be £3.22 million and in a full year will amount to £5.768 million.</P>
    <P>Another particular question was addressed to me in this respect by I think, Deputy Lindsay.  He asked whether rights of maintenance, whether covenanted or otherwise, would affect the payment of the maximum pensions to old age pensioners living with their relatives on farms and other places.  I am told that these rights of residence are taken into account.  Generally only a nominal figure of 1/- or 2/- is assessed in respect of these rights of maintenance and support.  Therefore, I think we can take it that people who enjoy these rights of residence, maintenance and support will not be affected, unless of course they have some other source of income.  Therefore, they should enjoy the full benefit of the 10/- a week increase.</P>
    <P>Naturally it was suggested that this 10/- a week increase should be applied all round without any means test.  First of all, it is just as well to remember that I did say at the outset and in the course of my Budget speech&mdash;and I made no attempt to hide the fact&mdash;that only those whose incomes are £26 a year or less will qualify for the full 10/- a week increase.  That represents about 70,000 of the total recipients of old age pensions, which exceeds about 100,000 or 110,000, I think.  Therefore, the vast majority of them will get the full increase.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked what it would cost if the £26 means test were abolished.  I believe in a full year it would cost about £¾ million which is a sizeable sum, and which it would require considerable extra taxation to meet.  I think we have gone a long distance in providing this 10/- increase, and bringing the old age pension up to 47/6 for a person who has no other means, or limited means, and to 5/- per week for all others, which is double the highest increase ever given.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to any general remarks, I should like to refer in particular to the allegation, by Deputy Sweetman, repeated by Deputy Dillon, <Col N="1833" /> to the effect that Ministers had come in here and given false information in their Estimates, and Estimate speeches, as to the amount of capital money required for the running of their Departments.  The Deputy referred in particular to the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The suggestion was that this was a shocking breach of parliamentary privilege, and a shocking blow to parliamentary debate and democracy generally.  The fact is that this is usual in any year in which estimates are made early on, and if closer estimates are possible as a result of delayed publication of certain statutory or Government documents, those closer estimates are given.</P>
    <P>To prove that there was no attempt at non-disclosure of any reductions, the figures to which I refer were published in the &ldquo;Capital Budget&rdquo; which accompanied the pre-budgetary documents generally issued.  At page 4, paragraph 7, I stated clearly:</P>
    <P>Since the Estimates Volume was published, the actual detailed figures for last year's capital expenditure became available and it was possible, in the light of these figures and other up-to-date information, to arrive at closer estimates of the amounts needed to carry out this year's programme.  The relevant amendments of the figures published in the Volume are indicated in Table 6 which sets out the Voted Capital Services in detail.</P>
    <P>There is a detailed statement of the reductions provided for in Table 6.  It is obvious that in framing the capital Budget the best available figures must be used, and it has always been the practice to modify, if necessary, in the Budget statement, the provisions previously suggested in the Estimates Volume.  This is, in fact, the first time a budgetary revision has been made in capital items, and I made these revisions because I was convinced of the need for the greatest possible accuracy in assessing our financial requirements.</P>
    <P>It was possible in this instance too, <Col N="1834" /> because the Budget was introduced later than it would normally have been introduced, by reason of the intervention of the general election.  In any event, the total cost of the programme has now reached a record level, and it may prove to be in excess of domestic resources.  It is necessary for national planning and financing that our overall programme should have a realistic figure.  I do not like to remind Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon of past attempts at not revealing the true picture, but I would ask them to remember the time of Doctor Browne's departure from the Cabinet when he told us he was deliberately asked to depress his estimates for the sake of their presentation. There was no attempt at non-disclosure by me.  It was all fully set out in the &ldquo;Capital Budget&rdquo;&mdash;not only that but it was fully itemised as well.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by a number of speakers that this Budget had nothing for this or that, that it had nothing for housing or education.  I know well that I did not spell out in my Budget speech the details of each component part of the programme we have set ourselves to achieve.  The Budget must be expected to be a general review of our economic progress, and to be critical of any aspect of our economy, and of any sphere of activity or policy which is not measuring up to what we projected for it, or not producing the desired results.  It also makes suggestions as to how these activities and other activities which appear to be going well might be even better.</P>
    <P>I was very careful in my Budget statement to advert in particular to all of these aspects of our economy.  The Budget itself must, of necessity, include provision for every item of revenue and capital expenditure.  Obviously it would be impossible to cover every one of those items even in a general way in the course of the Budget statement. However, as a result of the repetition of these allegations it is necessary for me, I think, to indicate how the Budget deals not only with social welfare increases but also with other aspects of our economy, such as the necessity for increased output <Col N="1835" /> in agriculture and industry, and every sphere of economic activity.</P>
    <P>Let me take agriculture first.  In the 1964 Budget, specific provision was made for the expenditure of £4.5 million for extra aids to agriculture, including additional relief on rates, the provision of an extra 2d per gallon of milk and also a minimum price for pigs.  Since the 1964 Budget, a number of increases were decided on by the Government for agricultural produce, or by way of direct aids to farmers.  I did not spell them out in this Budget because they were already announced, but I had to provide for them in the overall moneys I had to get through the Budget.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of 3/- per barrel of wheat, and the estimated total value to the farmers of that increase is £300,000 this year.  There was also an increase of £5 per barrel in the price of feeding barley, an estimated total value to farmers of £1,200,000.  The premium of 1d per gallon on quality milk is estimated to total £400,000 this year in value to farmers.  An increase of 5/3 a ton for sugar beet is estimated to bring in a further £200,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all these increases were things that must be provided for in the Budget but some of them were.  Apart from and in addition to them, an increase must be given to pig producers to compensate them for the increase in the price of feeding barley and this increase will come into effect next autumn. This will involve the Exchequer in an extra liability for export subsidy and in a full year this additional liability will amount to about £450,000.</P>
    <P>Therefore, all these items alone go to show that it is not in any way true to allege there is nothing in this Budget for agriculture.  There is plenty in it for agriculture, especially when added to what was provided last year.  I shall deal in slightly more detail with milk. Apart from 1d. per gallon for quality milk, the Exchequer is already paying 4d. a gallon subsidy on all creamery milk, in addition to meeting two-thirds <Col N="1836" /> of the losses on exports of dairy produce. The value to farmers of creamery milk production is expected to increase by £3.5 million, or ten per cent, in 1965 to a total figure of £40 million. The Exchequer is directly providing more than £10 million this year as against approximately £8 million last year.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask Deputies who complain about the lack of Budget provision for agriculture to examine these figures. I ask the NFA also to examine them to find to what extent their allegation of the &ldquo;great betrayal&rdquo; is true.  Deputy Clinton suggested that I angered the farmers by suggesting that the total aids to farmers amounted to £52 million approximately.  I should like to refer him to my Budget Statement in this respect.  I did not use the words &ldquo;total aids&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Minister used it in his Budget Statement. I was referring to his broadcast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The television broadcast was largely off the cuff and it could be that I used the word &ldquo;aid&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; or listeners may have been confused.  The fact is that total expenditure, both current and capital, relating to agriculture in 1965-66 is estimated at £52 million as against actual expenditure of £49.6 million last year.  This £49.6 million was £6 million in excess of what was provided last year in the Budget.  In other words, the outturn for 1964-65 exceeded the Budget provisions by more than £6 million and a further £2½ million is being provided this year.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from what is being provided by way of aids, capital and otherwise, we must have a look at what the projections are for increased farmers' income in the current year. The projections made by the Department of Finance in this connection indicate an increase of at least £12 million in farmers' incomes in 1965, after meeting increased costs and expenses. This projection is based on an increase of three per cent in the volume of agricultural output and five per cent in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase of £12 million, or 8½ <Col N="1837" /> per cent, is in line with the expected increase in total national income&mdash;the ratio of increases for farmers compared with people in other occupations. But then, when account is taken of the continued decline which, unfortunately, is with us, in the numbers engaged in agriculture, the present estimated increase will be even higher per capita. So much for the assistance to the ordinary productive activities of farmers.</P>
    <P>We come to another complaint aired by Deputies.  We heard on many occasions, not only here during the debate but outside, that nothing was done by way of relief of farmers' rates. Some Deputies said the rates on land keep mounting and also that the amount of money to be met by local authorities keeps mounting.  Let us examine these two allegations in relation to what is provided in the Budget but again not spelled out in the Budget Statement, though covered in the overall expenditure.  The additional reliefs last year and in 1962 will keep the net rates of agricultural land during 1965-66 at less than the level, or at least at approximately the same level as in 1958-59.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that gross rates on agricultural land have not increased. They have in fact increased by £7 million since 1958-59 but this increase has been borne entirely by the Exchequer and this year a considerable increase in Exchequer expenditure had to be provided as well.  In fact the Exchequer will bear about 63 per cent of increases in rates on agricultural land this year. The Agricultural Grant will be £12.5 million in 1965-66 which is £1.3 million higher than last year.  Again, where is the truth in the allegation that nothing was being done for the relief of farmers' rates?  The allegation again was made because I did not spell it out in my Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>Farmers' rates are just one aspect of the whole problem of local taxation.  I mentioned at the start the suggestion that the sums to be met by local authorities keep mounting.  The position is that more than half the current expenditure of local authorities is financed by the Central Government as compared with a contribution of one-third from the rates.  Rates, in proportion to gross national product, <Col N="1838" /> have declined from 3.4 per cent in 1938-39 to 2.8 per cent in 1964-65, Since 1939, rates have increased fourfold. Nobody will deny that, but over the same period State grants to local authorities have increased eightfold.</P>
    <P>While there is truth in the suggestion that rates are mounting, that they are costing more to local authorities and more to the Exchequer, net rates payable by farmers are not mounting. More money is provided this year than last year for rates relief to farmers and the Exchequer is bearing a considerably bigger proportion now than in 1938-39 in relief of local authorities generally.</P>
    <P>Another complaint, which was made in the course of the debate and repeated so often that I am sure Deputies have become tired of it, was that made by some Dublin Deputies concerning the number of houses built or vacated or vacant since 1957.  In the current year the sum of £19.58 million is being provided for housing. This is £4¼ millions more than last year's expenditure.  This compares very favourably with the increases given to other items in the capital programme. This provision, of course, does not take into account expenditure on related activities such as sanitary and other services for which, in addition to the £4¼ million, there will be another £4.24 million.  As well as that, there is another £4 million provided for in the current supply services for housing and related facilities.  I deny, as completely unfounded, the suggestion that housing is being neglected and that no proper future provision is being made for housing.  It was estimated that last year over 9,000 dwellings were constructed and that over 13,000 were reconstructed or modernised despite the prolonged strike in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In the present year it is hoped to increase this figure significantly and about 10,000 new dwellings will be completed and about 16,000 will be reconstructed or modernised.  This is in line with the kind of targets we have set ourselves.  On the other hand, it is important&mdash;important though housing is&mdash;that we should not place an <Col N="1839" /> undue stress or strain on the physical resources of the building industry.  The tentative target of seven per cent per year in the average growth rate set for the building industry in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was discussed in detail with all the interests concerned, that is the trade unions and the proprietary interests in the building industry, and the conclusion was that while this target was attainable it would nevertheless place a great strain on the industry not only in terms of capital but in terms of manpower requirements.  Therefore, no matter how much we desire to expand our housing in any particular year there are physical limiting factors that money cannot get over, the manpower requirements being particularly important in this respect.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the alleged restriction of capital for private building and asked me whether the Government propose to take any action in relation to the building societies.  The Minister for Local Government was asked in the Dáil last week about this and in reply to a Parliamentary Question he indicated that he was arranging for a discussion with the building societies in the very near future.  I understand that the meeting will take place in a matter of days and at that he will endeavour to find out what the position really is and see what remedy can be applied. I think it would be better to leave further discussions on the attitude of the building societies in relation to the output of houses to the result of that meeting.</P>
    <P>I was going to deal very briefly with schools&mdash;and I hope I will do so reasonably objectively&mdash;but Deputy Ryan stimulated me into dealing with the matter at greater length than otherwise I might have done.  While he was speaking he probably forgot that I spent two years in the Department of Education and I know a little about school building and a little about the record of school building that I inherited from the second inter-Party Government.  There are a lot of aspects in connection with school building and with the size of classes in schools about which I saw little or nothing <Col N="1840" /> being done when I came into this Department.  There seemed to be no proper provision for increasing training facilities.  The school building rate was just ticking over and not even keeping pace with the incoming tide, so to speak, and the rate of old school buildings falling into disuse was far in excess of the number of new schools being provided.  I immediately took steps on these three fronts.  First of all I started an expanded training college.  I enabled disqualified teachers to be recognised as qualified and I doubled in that two years the rate of school building. This progress has been kept up under my successor, who is my successor in two Ministries.  These figures will give some indication of the position.  The target at that time was about 50 schools a year; last year the target was 100 new schools and 50 major enlargements.  In fact, this target was exceeded with 108 new schools, and 93 major extensions were completed. We know that even this is not sufficient in order to meet the demands for new schools and in particular to meet the demand for reducing the number of pupils in classes in Dublin schools and in some of the other big centres.</P>
    <P>Deputies who will have read the Capital Budget will note that in paragraph three it is stated that experiments are being made in the erection of national schools by more advanced building methods and these are intended not only to increase output but reduce costs.  If these are successful they should contribute very significantly towards the overtaking of arrears in the national school building programme.  The total capital provided this year is increased by £1.26 millions, from £3.7 millions in 1964/65 to £4.98 millions in the current year.  This represents an increase of over one-third of the provision for last year and is a substantial increase in relation to the public capital programme as a whole.</P>
    <P>Again, another allegation was made that this Budget did nothing for industry, nothing about increasing employment and that no new incentives were created.  Of course this is completely false and again attributable, <Col N="1841" /> perhaps, to my not dealing with the matter sufficiently in my Budget Statement. The Budget not only provided for a continuance of the existing far-reaching and costly industrial incentives but extends them in very important respects.  The export reliefs, which provide the maximum assistance possible by offering 100 per cent exemption from tax on profits deriving from exports, are to be extended for a further period and so also are the mining reliefs&mdash;these are certain reliefs on profits earned by mining&mdash;and also the period during which the double initial allowance may be claimed for plant, machinery and industrial buildings. In addition to the extensions of current reliefs, the provisions for industry generally include two new incentive reliefs&mdash;which will be provided for in the Finance Bill&mdash;the writing off of capital expenditure by traders on scientific research in one year instead of over five years as at present and relief from stamp duties in the case of the amalgamation of companies.  As the House is aware the Government have been encouraging firms in industry, particularly those engaged in the same type of business, to amalgamate and where in order to do so it has been found necessary for one company to buy out another.  Without this relief considerable stamp duties would have to be paid.  This relief is now going to be afforded to the considerable advantage of our rationalisation and adaptation endeavours in the industrial field. I should remind Deputies too, that I have had to provide on the capital side £1.5 million for the development grants which were directly attributable to the necessity to help our industrial exports to the British market to overcome the effects of the levy of 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to a reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a Dáil Question on 27th April, in which it was stated that an inter-departmental committee on administrative arrangements for implementing manpower policy has recently presented its Report to the Government. The committee has made certain recommendations in regard to the supply and training of personnel for industrial employment and in regard to the control, function and scope of employment exchanges.  These recommendations are under examination. Copies of the committee's Report will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and published at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the introduction of the &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; system it was arranged that, on the sale of any property, the vendor would be charged to tax under Schedule A for the period from the commencement of the relevant financial year to the date of sale and the purchaser would be charged for the period from the date of purchase to the end of that financial year.  This arrangement removed the necessity to make provision in the apportionment account for tax on property.  A consequential part of the arrangement was that ground rent, where payable in full, should be apportioned by reference to the gross amount and, where payable under deduction of tax, should be apportioned by reference to the net amount.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have had discussions with the Incorporated Law Society in this matter and it is understood that the Society will publish a statement on the arrangement in the next issue of its Gazette.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Overlapping Benefits Regulations, 1953, a widow in receipt of a widow's contributory pension who qualifies for disability benefit is paid half the appropriate personal rate of disability benefit; if her pension is non-contributory, the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of the pension and can range from half of the appropriate personal rate of disability benefit to as much as the full rate plus appropriate adjustments in respect of any dependent children.</P>
      <P>It is a general principle of a comprehensive scheme of insurance against sickness, unemployment and widowhood that only one of those benefits should be payable to any one person at any time.  As a special concession provision was made in the regulations I have mentioned for payment of disability or unemployment benefit at a reduced rate to widows in insurable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The Gardaí operate four radar meters in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and one in each of the 18 Garda Divisions outside Dublin.  The number will be nearly doubled within the next month.  In addition, 60 Garda cars and 12 Garda motorcycles are fitted with precision radar speedometers suitable for use in speed limit enforcement; 29 other vehicles are being fitted with them at the moment and all new vehicles obtained for the Force will be fitted with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How effective the enforcement of the <Col N="1859" /> speed limits is is a matter of opinion. It is the view, generally, of the Garda authorities and, I think, of the majority of people who take an interest in these things and who are reasonably competent to assess speed, that the standard of compliance with speed limits is fairly good, by which I mean that such evasion as takes place seldom involves gross disregard for the limits.  On the other hand, there are over 900 prosecutions per month, on the average, for breaches of the speed limits, not to mention more than 1,000 cautions each month, on average, for very minor cases.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Local Government has already announced his intention to review the limits in certain cases and I think we may reasonably hope that this review will have a beneficial effect on the general standard of compliance with the limits.</P>

      <P>Full-time male <Col N="1860" /> night telephonists are conditioned to a working week of 46 hours gross which, exclusive of meal intervals, is 40 hours net.  A time allowance of one-seventh is made for all attendances between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.  It is not proposed to reduce the working week.  The scales of pay are in the form of a tabular statement which with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not clear what precisely <Col N="1861" /> the Deputy means by the phrase &ldquo;Hospitals Commission Agreement&rdquo;. In the ordinary course of its business, the Commission negotiates many agreements and settlements each year in relation to the remuneration, etc. of the staff of voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>It should be understood that the functions of the Commission relate only to those voluntary hospitals which participate in the scheme of deficit recoupment from the Hospitals Trust Fund, whereas St. Kevin's Hospital is a local authority institution administered by the Dublin Health Authority.

      <P>The reference to the need for a relation of the person in respect of whom a registration is made to attend in person at the local medical dispensary is misleading.  For instance, the majority of births occurring in Dublin take place in the major maternity hospitals and these hospitals register the births occurring in them, unless the parents opt otherwise. Similarly, deaths occurring in hospitals are normally registered by the hospital authority.</P>
      <P>The whole procedure for the registration of births and deaths is under examination in connection with a review of the entire legislative code governing such registrations.  I am unable to say at this stage when the examination will be completed.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply given on the 11th February, 1965 by my predecessor as Minister in which he dealt with the functions of the Dublin Health Authority in the matter of out-patient specialist services.  I understand that an appointments system, such as the Deputy envisages, operates in a number of the Dublin hospitals.  In others, it was found that a rigid appointments system did not eliminate inconvenience to patients and the rigid appointments system was abandoned.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has evidence that the system operating in particular hospitals occasions abnormal inconvenience to Health Act patients, I would suggest that the information should be made available to the Dublin Health Authority with a view to their examining the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt, and I hope adequately and effectively, with the suggestions that the Budget did not provide anything or sufficient for a number of major economic activities such as agriculture, education, housing, and so on.  I should now like to come to other points made.  While I do not expect to be able to cover every point made in the course of the debate I shall try to deal at least with the more important ones.  While Deputy Ryan is still here perhaps I could say to him that there is one part of his speech with which I agree and that was his reference to the fact that certain people acquire property and, because of the added value given to it by local authorities or other such bodies in providing for social needs or meeting the necessity for economic development, tremendous increases occur in the value of that property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did give that matter some thought before the Budget.  It is rather a complex one and I can assure the Deputy <Col N="1866" /> that I shall give it further thought during the course of the year to see what, if anything, can be done because I think it is important that where people, whom I should not like to characterise as &ldquo;parasites&rdquo; but who, for non-productive purposes certainly succeed in acquiring land and subsequently make inordinate profits on that land as a result of development by the local authority or because of some other public activity, some benefit should accrue to the local authority or to the Exchequer.  However, I shall leave it at that.  The Deputy knows the matter has been engaging my attention and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. F. O'Higgins suggested there was no comment in the Budget as to how we could achieve a faster, sustainable increase in employment. He mentioned, in particular, the four points in the NIEC Report.  What he said ignores what I said in Part I of the Budget speech in which I dealt at some length with the NIEC commentary and stressed the need for greater competitiveness as a means of assuring increased employment, particularly by means of production for export.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also referred to this matter, in particular, and I think Deputy Corish referred to it in a less direct way.  The NIEC, in fact, make these four points in their &ldquo;Comments on Department of Finance Review of Economic Progress in 1964 and Prospects for 1965&rdquo;.  They suggest we can achieve this greater employment and productivity&mdash;</P>
    <P>First, by laying greater emphasis on the establishment and expansion of employment-intensive growth industries, especially those employing workers with a higher level of skill, such as electronics and engineering.</P>
    <P>My more detailed comment on that is that our industrial grants legislation is sufficiently flexible, in my opinion, for the treatment of proposals for the establishment of these types of industry &mdash;that is, these employment-intensive growth industries and those other industries which are particularly desirable, such as the electronics industry. I believe the system is sufficiently <Col N="1867" /> flexible and adaptable to ensure greater inducement being offered to promoters of such industries.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, it is only in exceptional cases that the maximum grant payable is approved.  Desirable projects can therefore be attracted and assisted by approving the maximum grants available.  Advantage can, of course, be gained by this flexibility in securing the establishment and expansion of employment-intensive growth industries of the kind referred to by the NIEC.  It must be remembered, however, that the scope of Government action is limited by the numbers presenting themselves in response to these inducements which are, as I have often said, as attractive as any offered in any other country.  The scope of Government action is also limited by the effect of the promotional campaigns of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the NIEC were aware of what the Minister is now saying, yet still made that comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say now is, I think, relevant to the Deputy's interjection.  Deputy Cosgrave, in referring to the NIEC comments, remarked on the very considerable sum that has been expended in recent years on industrial grants and other inducements and suggested that the time had arrived when a more critical appraisal should be made of our grants system. I think the time has arrived.  Indeed, it arrived a couple of years ago and the Industrial Development Authority were instructed at the time by me to inquire into the effectiveness of the grants system.  When I say &ldquo;effectiveness&rdquo; I mean to inquire into whether we were getting full value for the type and amount of grants we were giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority commenced a review of some industries.  Naturally they were not expected to report on individual industries.  What was expected was a global report with emphasis, perhaps, on individual weakness or strength in some cases.  Unfortunately, that review was interrupted as a result of the establishment of the Committee on Industrial Organisation and the necessity to implement the recommendations of <Col N="1868" /> one of that body's first interim reports in connection with adaptation and rationalisation generally.  Since then there has been a formal review carried out and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will introduce in the very near future a new Industrial Grants Bill which will give effect to one part of the review.  I cannot comment on it now in any great detail because the Bill is not before the House, but I can say that one provision in the Bill will deal with the desirability of setting up industrial estates.  I do not want now to confuse this with a concentration of industrial activity in any one area.  In the past we have had some difficulty in inducing existing manufacturers producing worthwhile competitive goods and giving worthwhile employment to find more desirable premises, premises which would make for more efficiency. Even with the grants, some firms were deterred from taking on the extra expenditure involved.  At the same time we had inquiries about the possibility of building advance factories on certain sites, but the difficulty was that our grants system could not apply to such a form of industrial development.  The new Bill will, I think, deal with that aspect of the problem.  As well as that, there will be this more general review carried out.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion of the NIEC is that we can achieve this employment-intensive growth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>...by the speedy implementation of a manpower policy so that shortages of particular skills, or shortages of labour in particular areas, can be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in speeches before the election, both inside and outside the House, the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Administration Arrangements for Manpower Policy has been received.  It contains a series of recommendations designed to set up the administrative framework for the implementation of an integrated manpower policy.</P>
    <P>The Report, which will be published in a week or so, is at present under consideration by the Government and by the Departments concerned.  And the Government decision on the <Col N="1869" /> recommendations contained in the Report will be completed as soon as possible.  It is hoped then that a Bill relating to industrial training, incorporating the Committee's proposals, will be introduced at an early date.  As the House is aware, for the first time a Parliamentary Secretary has been appointed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the express function of dealing with this manpower policy and ensuring that the implementation of that policy will be expedited.</P>
    <P>In this connection Deputy Cosgrave made some mention of the means whereby re-training can be carried out. I have given some thought to this and have come down on the side that An Cheard Comhairle are, perhaps, the best vehicle through which this re-training can be done in association with the vocational schools.  As Deputies know, we have a big number of committees, councils and other such bodies dealing with the various parts of the implementation of our economic development programme.  I think we should do our best to avoid, where possible, any further proliferation of these organisations.  Even though the terms of reference of An Cheard Comhairle do not cover re-training as such&mdash;they are confined to making proper provision for training new apprentices&mdash;in my opinion, it would be better, although I do not know what the Government will decide, to extend the functions of An Cheard Comhairle to cover re-training, particularly since vocational education interests are represented on it and it is through the vocational system we can achieve a great part of this re-training.</P>
    <P>The third point made was that this progress could be made by raising public investment, to which the Report added:</P>
    <P>...though we recognise that in the light of the present high and buoyant demand, of pressure on resources in building and construction, and of the rapid increase in public investment in recent years, the scope for doing so at this stage may be limited.</P>
    <P>Since the Report has been published the Capital Budget figures for 1965-66 <Col N="1870" /> have also been published.  As the House is aware, this Budget provides for a total expenditure of £103.72 million.  This is an increase of £5.91 million over the amount provided in 1964-65.  In the sum provided last year there is the special expenditure, something in excess of £3 million, for the acquisition of the B. and I., which, though in new ownership, is not really a new asset.  Nevertheless, the money had to be provided.  If we exclude that, the provision in the Capital Budget this year exceeds the provision for last year by no less than £9.4 million, or an increase of more than ten per cent.  This figure is considerably greater than the projection in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Budget statement, the financing of this large programme will be difficult.  We do not expect to be able to rely on our own sources of investment, for example, national loans, to the extent perhaps of more than £42 million or £43 million. Therefore, we will have to look to other sources to find that money.  I am sure it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The fourth suggestion made by NIEC for achieving greater growth was:</P>
    <P>...by using some part of the annual increase in productivity to reduce prices and thus to make possible an expansion in sales and open up new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have been stressing that aspect of our development effort for many years as Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Report continued:</P>
    <P>If the full benefits of rising productivity accrue directly to the factors of production rather than indirectly by way of lower prices, there is not likely to be a sufficiently large improvement in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>What they have suggested is one of the fundamental facts of economic life.  It must be taken into account in any negotiations for wage settlements by employers and workers.  The key to raising the competitiveness of our goods, and thus to create more employment opportunities in industry, lies in <Col N="1871" /> the establishment of the proper relationship between the development of monetary incomes and greater productivity. We must make a choice between the level of incomes and the number of jobs we must have.  It is obvious we cannot have both at the very high level we would desire.  This key principle adumbrated by the NIEC is fully accepted by the Government.  The fact that it is proposed by the NIEC, in which there is a joint participation by representatives of employers and workers, makes it seem reasonable to look forward to the application of this principle in future wage negotiations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello took advantage of this debate to expound some of the contents of the Fine Gael policy statement <i>Towards a Just Society.</i> A peculiar thing about Fine Gael is that, if they see some worthwhile idea and adopt it, they seem to convince themselves it was their own idea; and anybody else who has the same idea is accused of borrowing it from Fine Gael.  This was particularly noticeable when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Time after time, coming in here with proposals for legislation dealing with industry or the Estimates for my Department, I was told by speaker after speaker from Fine Gael that it was they who conceived the idea of industrial grants.  This was continued notwithstanding that they were told repeatedly that the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, was only a pale follow-on of the original conception of industrial grants enshrined in the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  This assertion continued to be made right through the general election.  I was at least pleased to know that their present spokesman for industry and commerce in the course of this debate modified this claim in some respects&mdash; though not fully because they still seem to claim credit for the conception of industrial grants&mdash;that they were not known in this country until the Act of 1956.  Incidentally, it might interest Deputy Corish to know that Deputy Donegan claimed it was a Fine Gael Minister who introduced the Industrial Grants Act.  I think Deputy Corish will agree it was the late Deputy Norton who introduced it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with Deputy Declan Costello's assertion that I did a little more &ldquo;cogging&rdquo; in my Budget speech.  Deputy Costello did admit candidly that much of the policy document of Fine Gael was copied from the programmes of other countries in Europe and elsewhere and that they were proposing policies which were not new but which they felt might reasonably be applied in this country.  He said, in respect to incomes policy, if there is such in the Fine Gael document, that we now had come to copy some of their incomes policy by elaborating for the first time in the Budget a method of restraint.  He said I advocated that incomes, other than wages and salaries, would have to be watched.  Obviously, Deputy D. Costello read the Budget Statement much more closely than he read the White Paper, &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo;, which was published in 1963.  He said the reference to the level of profits at column 966 of my Budget Statement was the first time that profits as such were included as a matter requiring careful attention.  Of course, this allegation is quite wrong because the 1963 White Paper at page 8, paragraph 15 specifically stated and I quote:</P>
      <P>Profits, industrial and other, form a much smaller proportion of national income than do wages and salaries.  Higher profit distributions not associated with higher production or sales have, however, even if on a smaller scale, the same consequences as higher incomes not related to output.</P>
      <P>It is quite untrue to suggest that Fianna Fáil's only remedy for curbing prices and maintaining productivity was to request the workers, as such, to restrain their demand for higher wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D. Costello spoke at some length, and, indeed, with some force, about the Fine Gael policy.  I feel he made the same speech with equal force many times in the councils of Fine Gael before the policy document appeared.  Perhaps, he made it without the amount of success he would have <Col N="1873" /> desired but, in the course of his remarks, he took as an example of the shortcomings of programming as against planning certain spheres of capital expenditure in which he alleged there was a short fall in expenditure compared with the amount projected. Of course, that is quite untrue.  As I indicated in dealing with the capital programme, far from being short of our projection in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> it is ten per cent more than it was last year.  But I would like to ask Deputy Costello whether such a projection is more attainable whether it appeared in a document entitled &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; or &ldquo;Programme&rdquo;. I do not see for the life of me how anyone can suggest if a thing is called a plan rather than a programme that we can be assured of certain progress.  Of course, that is completely untrue.  Our country, and any country, will have to be realistic about targets which can be set.  There is no point in setting targets as high as some economists would have us do if we are to ignore the ways of attaining them.</P>
    <P>When we produced our <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> we set what are realistic targets.  Fine Gael feel they are not high enough.  We feel we can attain these targets and if we attain such targets, then I consider we will have done considerably well in the decade ending 1970.  Deputy D. Costello referred in particular to, and seemed to regard as ominous, my reference in the Budget statement to credit management.  This appears at column 965 of the Official Report of the 11th May when I said:</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, a prudent and reasonable aim of policy this year to avoid an increase in the balance of payments deficit over the 1964 figure. Indeed, some reduction would be acceptable if this proved compatible with a 4 per cent growth rate.  These must be our guiding lines in budgetary and credit management.</P>
    <P>Deputy D. Costello seemed to think from the statement about credit management that I was going to go much further than even Fine Gael were <Col N="1874" /> prepared to go in controlling the banks.  Deputy D. Costello's remarks were in reference to the dialogue between the Central Bank and the commercial banks.  I dealt with that matter in detail because I regard the availability of credit, the balance of payments and external reserves as being important.</P>
    <P>I have read a clatter of documents since I became Minister for Finance on these matters and I am not going to suggest that I can comprehend all of these.  I read the document, which was produced by the Central Bank, and in respect of which Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said £20 million, as stated by the Central Bank, was the maximum amount of deficit in the balance of payments that we should allow.  I am not accepting that.  That is not Government policy.  Last year there was a deficit of £31 million and that deficit was tolerable, for many reasons. It was tolerable, first of all because credit was readily available and it was available without undue resort to external reserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was about £16 million, a figure which would be desirable or reasonable.  I do not think we should panic about these figures once the other three factors are satisfactory. We have to face the fact that the £31 million deficit was more than offset by about £36 million inflow of capital from outside.  Deputy Hogan asked me to break down that figure and I will do so in a minute.  It was an unduly high figure.  Therefore, whilst we would have sufficient flow of capital in the year, nevertheless, we cannot rely on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other factors which will make us have regard to the necessity for not increasing this £31 million deficit in the balance of payments.  The banks, as I stated in my Budget statement, have been lending rather elaborately and, indeed, have been lending more than the amount they are getting in on their deposits.  Therefore, it seems they have had, either through themselves or through the Central Bank, to have resort to external reserves.  Our external reserves were increasing not spectacularly but steadily in the last <Col N="1875" /> few years.  They went up from something like £225 million to over £240 million.  There was a slight reduction this year which indicated that credit which was being advanced in one form or another, was being got to a small extent from our external reserves.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should keep our external reserves strong because it creates confidence in our country.  It creates confidence not only in our own investors in the country but in investors from outside.  As long as we can show we can manage our business and maintain our external reserves at a satisfactory level we are all right.</P>
    <P>We had an increase in the deficit in our balance of trade in the first three months of this year.  There was a £5.7 million increase in our imports and a like decrease in our exports. This could be attributable to a number of factors.  There was a falling-off in the number of cattle exported.  That was understandable having regard to the high level of cattle exports in the previous year.  There was also a falling-off in industrial exports which was attributable to the 15 per cent British surcharge on industrial goods entering Britain.  There was a psychological factor associated with the imposition of the 15 per cent surcharge due to the fact that it was to be reduced by one-third to operate from the end of April. It is only reasonable to expect that some exporters held off consignments for export in order to take advantage of that decrease, notwithstanding that we were assisting them to the extent of 40 per cent of the cost of the levy.</P>
    <P>Taking all these factors into account, I think it is only reasonable that we should watch these three indicators of our economic situation&mdash;the amount of credit, external reserves and the current balance of payments. Taken together, it is only right that we should keep an eye on it and, therefore, I am glad that the Central Bank and the commercial banks are getting together to ensure that the extension of credit on a too-liberal scale will not have a bad effect on our balance of payments position.  At the same time, if the banks have to restrict <Col N="1876" /> credit because the deposits are not high enough, I would encourage them to ensure to the utmost possible extent that there would be no restriction of credit for productive purposes and they are being so encouraged.  If there must be a restriction, that restriction ought not to be applied to productive purposes and less essential or purely personal purposes should take their place in the queue so as to ensure that the important national objective is achieved, that is, the continued steady progress of production and employment in line with our Second Programme.</P>
    <P>It is always a great temptation for Deputies opposite to encourage expenditure on the one hand and reduced taxation on the other hand.  For that reason, I found it very difficult to understand the speech by Deputy J. A. Costello who I think had his tongue in his cheek and came in with a bit of devilment in his eye when he spoke here the other day.</P>
    <P>I found it difficult to understand Deputy Sweetman who castigated me for failing to reduce income tax and suggested certain reductions.  It is not very consistent, of course, with the Leftist programme as contained in <i>Towards A Just Society.</i> He made specific propositions about a reduction in income tax.  He said that income tax allowances had not been increased this year.  Of course, increases in the personal allowance apply to all taxpayers, not only to white-collar workers with whom, apparently, the Deputy was particularly concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman sought to make a case for increasing the married allowance by £124 and the single allowance by £60.  The cost of such an increase in the married allowance would, in a full year, be in the region of £4 million and the increase he suggested in the single allowance would cost over £5 million in a full year.  Therefore, such reliefs would have to be financed either by increasing the rates of direct or indirect taxation.  The reliefs he advocated would still affect workers' pay immediately by reducing their take-home packets as a result of PAYE, or by raising indirect taxes.  Some idea of the amount of these indirect taxes can <Col N="1877" /> be got from the measures I have found it necessary to take in order to raise £5½ million for the social welfare and other benefits this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. A. Costello referred to the right of appeal from special commissioners to the circuit court.  I should have thought that existed in all cases: he appeared to suggest it did not.  In any event, I propose to have a look at this to ascertain the position and we can discuss it in more detail on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. A. Costello referred also to death duties.  I do not mind admitting here and now that I had a lot of sympathy with the suggestion that death duties ought to be abolished and it would make for a tremendous increase of capital and the coming of rich people into our country, therefore, making for greater employment.  However, I have had some time in the past three weeks to think about death duties.  They were originally imposed for the benefit of the greater number and in order to avoid as far as possible the accumulation of vast wealth in the hands of some individuals.  The Government's White Paper <i>Direct Taxation</i> contains what I think were very reasonable comments on death duties arrived at following the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation. On page 23 of the White Paper, under the heading <i>The Justification for Death Duties,</i> there is paragraph No. 70, which reads:</P>
    <P>Taxation may take many forms but, if the financial status or wealth of the taxpayer is to be taken adequately into account, there must be taxes on income and on capital, as indeed there are in most countries. Death duties, and stamp duties to a limited extent, are the means adopted in this country for taxing capital.</P>
    <P>What I think is very important is the final paragraph on page 24, paragraph 75, which reads:</P>
    <P>As a means of raising revenue the existing system has the advantage of being of long standing, well tried and known.  If the revenue of £3 million approximately from death duties were surrendered, an equivalent <Col N="1878" /> amount would have to be made good from some new tax which might be regarded as less equitable.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is £3.2 million this year, up to the end of March last.</P>
    <P>Another paragraph deals with what would happen in other countries in the case of the abolition of death duties: they would immediately gain, to our disadvantage, by reason of our double taxation arrangements with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. A. Costello also dealt with the fragmentation of farms which death duties bring about.  The ordinary small farm, to which he was particularly referring, would hardly be assessed for death duty purposes at more than £5,000 and, of course, the majority of our farms, as a result, are not liable to death duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going a good bit of the way in order to relieve the situation in that respect.  All farms are regarded as real estate for the purpose of death duties even though, in strictly legal jargon, they might be regarded as personalty.  Furthermore, there is a provision whereby these duties can be paid in eight yearly or sixteen half-yearly instalments.  Therefore, I suggest that Deputy J. A. Costello must have had his tongue in his cheek in making some of his suggestions about reduced taxation.</P>
      <P>I have dealt in some detail with most of the points raised and I do not wish to delay the House longer.  We have in this Budget not only a good social welfare Budget but, from the fact that we have made provision for increased expenditure on agriculture, industry, housing and other forms of productive effort, a good economic development Budget as well and, please God, with the assistance we have been offered from the other side of the House and the co-operation we can expect to get from the country, we can have greater developments, greater progress and perhaps even a better Budget next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies will, I think, be aware that this Bill replaces the Extradition Bill, 1963, which lapsed on the dissolution of the last Dáil.  After the Second Stage was agreed to, the Committee Stage was passed on the understanding that the Bill would be recommitted to consider some Opposition amendments which were to be tabled. Subsequently, it became necessary to await the outcome of litigation, in Britain as well as here, as to the validity of the present arrangements for the reciprocal enforcement of criminal warrants between Britain and ourselves.  As a result of the outcome of this litigation and of further consideration of the Bill, there are a number of changes in the Bill which Deputies have before them now as compared with the 1963 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the general principle of having an up-to-date extradition law was agreed to in the last Dáil and is no doubt still generally acceptable I do not think I need spend much time in a detailed review of the various provisions of the Bill, particularly as an Explanatory Memorandum has been circulated with it and as we shall have an opportunity on the Committee Stage of going into particular points in detail.  However, I think it right to draw to the attention of Deputies that Part II of the Bill, which provides for extradition generally&mdash; that is, otherwise than to Northern Ireland and Britain&mdash;is based almost <Col N="1880" /> entirely on the terms of the European Convention of Extradition, which was prepared under the auspices of the Council of Europe.  This Convention came into force in 1960 and so far has been ratified by six members of the Council, namely, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Turkey. The enactment of the Bill will enable the Convention to be ratified by this country and for us then to have reciprocal extradition arrangements with these countries after the making of a formal Government order under section 8 applying the provisions of Part II of the Bill to them.  As regards other countries, we may either enter into separate and formal extradition agreements with them or have informal extradition arrangements provided the Government are satisfied that reciprocal extradition facilities will be available from the countries concerned. In the latter cases the Government order applying Part II to these countries may be made subject to such conditions, exceptions and qualifications as may be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>The European Convention was drafted in accordance with principles which involve a departure from the existing law of extradition as set out in the Extradition Act, 1870. Probably the main departure is that the Convention does not require the requesting State to submit <i>prima facie</i> evidence against the person claimed. Under the 1870 Act a <i>prima facie</i> case was obligatory in every case.  This <i>prima facie</i> requirement is a feature of the extradition of the common law countries.  On the other hand, these countries do not generally object to the extradition of their nationals once such evidence is forthcoming.  In the European civil law countries, extradition may be allowed on evidence that a person is wanted for prosecution or punishment under an order of a competent authority of the requesting country; but, again speaking generally, these countries will not allow their nationals to be extradited and prefer to try them at home for the offence committed abroad.</P>
    <P>Insistence on the doctrine of the <i>prima facie</i> case rests to some extent on the suspicion of inadequacy of <Col N="1881" /> proceedings under other systems of law.  If this ground were fully accepted there would be no extradition at all and no concerted action among States for the suppression of crime.  It is axiomatic that before we make an extradition agreement with any particular country we must satisfy ourselves that the legal system and judicial institutions of that country are such as to ensure that the extradited person will get a fair trial. If we are not satisfied on this point we should not make an extradition agreement at all.  We must accept that the legal systems of the other Council of Europe member countries are satisfactory.  Certainly the nationals of those countries are quite satisfied with their criminal procedures and, as a general rule, it will be nationals of these countries that we will be extraditing.  These nationals cannot complain that they will not get a fair trial for an ordinary criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily the act for which extradition is requested will not be an offence here, though it must be an act which, if committed here, would be an offence.  Accordingly, our society has not been injured by the alleged criminal act and the law which is to be enforced as a consequence of extradition is that of the requesting State. As the particular act for which extradition is sought is not punishable here, all that we should want to know is that the charge is such as to call for concerted repressive action, for co-operation in having the alleged offender brought before a court in the requesting country for the purposes of having a fair trial.</P>
    <P>It is true that the surrender of a person for prosecution will, if he is subsequently adjudged not guilty, involve him in hardship; but this does not seem a reason why the requested State should insist on substituting its preliminary criminal procedure, which is often quite different in character from that of the requesting State.  It is a hardship on anyone, whether extradited or not and whether <i>prima facie</i> evidence is available or not, to be accused and to be subsequently found &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo;.  In most legal <Col N="1882" /> systems an accused person has legal redress in cases of malicious prosecution and in many countries he may be given his costs if a case is brought against him which should clearly not have been brought at all.  These cases are, however, quite exceptional.  The fact that an accused is discharged usually does not mean that he should not have been charged at all, but that the prosecution have not discharged the burden of proof.</P>
    <P>Apart from the feeling of suspicion that other systems of criminal procedure are in some way inadequate, another ground for urging the continuation of the system of requiring <i>prima facie</i> evidence is based on the protection of the individual against oppression.  It must be remembered that the Bill provides adequate safeguards against oppression by prohibiting extradition for political offences. Moreover, this prohibition extends to cases where there are substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition, even where it appears to relate to an ordinary criminal offence, has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
    <P>However, there may be particular cases where it would be desirable to allow the Government to provide, in the interests of having full reciprocity and where an extradition agreement may allow for the extradition of our nationals, that the relevant extradition arrangement should require the requesting country to produce to us sufficient evidence of the commission of the offence by the person claimed. Provision to this effect has been made in section 22.</P>
    <P>As regards the extradition of nationals, which is not specifically prohibited under the present law, the Bill provides for such a prohibition in the absence of any provision to the contrary in the extradition agreement.  Here again the Bill allows the Government room to negotiate with countries with differing policies in this respect.  If the law of some countries does not allow them to <Col N="1883" /> extradite their nationals the Government will no doubt include a similar prohibition on the extradition of our nationals in the relevant arrangement. It would be undesirable, however, that an Irish citizen who has committed a grave offence abroad and is exempt from extradition under such an arrangement should go unpunished. Section 38 provides accordingly that at the request of the country in which the offence was committed the Attorney General may direct proceedings in respect of the offence to be taken in our courts.  Where, on the other hand, a country is prepared to allow extradition of its nationals, we shall be free to allow reciprocity in this respect also.</P>
    <P>Another departure from the principles of the 1870 Act is that extraditable offences are not being specifically listed.  Instead, an extraditable offence is being defined by reference to the maximum penalty which may be imposed for it under the law of the two countries concerned or, where the person has already been sentenced, by the actual penalty imposed.  The advantage of having a list of extradition crimes is that extradition can be confined to specified serious crimes, such as murder, manslaughter, robbery with violence, etc., but in practice, as in the 1870 Act, some crimes are specified in general terms which would permit extradition for what possibly might be trivial offences (for example, obtaining money or goods by false pretences).  The disadvantage is that fresh legislation must be enacted whenever it becomes necessary to add to the list of extraditable crimes. Difficulties may arise, too, owing to the lack of uniformity in the definition of crimes under different systems of criminal law.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the balance of advantage seems to lie in the solution adopted in the European Convention. Accordingly section 10 of the Bill provides that an offence to be extraditable must be punishable under the law of both countries to the extradition arrangement by a maximum of at least one year's imprisonment or, if there has been a conviction and sentence, <Col N="1884" /> where imprisonment for a period of at least four months or a more severe penalty, such as the death penalty, has been imposed.  It may be noted that these limits are minimum limits.  A particular extradition arrangement could provide, for example, that extradition would be allowed only for offences carrying a maximum penalty of at least two years or even five years.</P>
    <P>These are, I think, the main features of the Part of the Bill dealing with extradition generally.  I now turn to Part III of the Bill which authorises for the first time the execution of Northern Ireland warrants in the State, as well as the continuance, with amendments, of the arrangements for executing British warrants which operated up to last year.  Under the former procedure, which was based on the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act of 1851, the enforcement of British and Irish warrants, when fully endorsed, was entirely automatic with no provision for judicial review, apart of course from habeas corpus proceedings. The 1963 Bill introduced a number of safeguards into that procedure by providing for restrictions on the enforcement of warrants in political, revenue and purely military cases and for each arrested person to be given an opportunity of consulting a solicitor if he desired to do so. Since that Bill was last before the House, however, the Petty Sessions Act procedure was declared invalid by the British House of Lords in a case which concerned a man named Hammond who was arrested in England on a warrant issued here. Subsequently, in July, 1964, the British authorities, as a temporary measure, restored the enforceability of our warrants by Order in Council. Since then they have, in consultation with us, introduced a Bill putting the enforcement of our warrants in Britain and Northern Ireland on a basis which is on the general lines of that contained in Part III of this Bill.  The British Bill has been passed by their House of Lords and has had a Second Reading in their House of Commons.</P>
    <P>On our side, too, there was litigation which resulted in the Supreme Court <Col N="1885" /> declaring, in July, 1964, that section 29 of the Petty Sessions Act was unconstitutional in so far as it enabled a person to be removed from the jurisdiction without having an opportunity of applying for habeas corpus.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all these developments, Part III of the 1963 Bill has been extensively revised and a number of additional safeguards introduced.  It is now provided that a person who has been arrested under a British or Northern Ireland warrant must be brought before a justice or the District Court or a peace commissioner.  The justice may then remand the prisoner in custody or on bail for delivery into the custody of the British or Northern Ireland police.  The prisoner may not be removed from the State, except with his consent, for a minimum of 15 days after such an order is made or while any application to the High Court or the Minister for Justice for his release is pending.  The object of this provision is, of course, to ensure that the person concerned has an adequate opportunity for considering whether he desires to exercise his constitutional rights.  However, an obligation is being placed on the Court to tell him of the existence of these safeguards at the time it makes the order.</P>
    <P>A further important and new safeguard, which is contained in section 47, requires that the District Court shall not make an order for the removal of a person from the State if it appears that the offence specified in the warrant does not correspond with an offence which under the law of the State is an indictable offence or is punishable on summary conviction by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least six months.  If the court is so satisfied it must discharge the prisoner.</P>
    <P>A new provision in section 49 deals with provisional warrants.  Before now there has been no provision, such as there is in Part II, for the arrest of a person in a case of urgency where the warrant has not arrived, but this section now provides that the district justice may issue a provisional warrant on the sworn information of a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the <Col N="1886" /> rank of inspector, that he has reason to believe that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of a person accused or convicted of an indictable offence, but that the warrant is not yet in his possession, and that he has received a request made on the ground of urgency for the arrest of that person. The section goes on to provide that such a warrant will be valid for only five days and that a person arrested under it must be brought before the District Court which may remand him either in custody or on bail for a period of not more than three days.</P>
    <P>Another departure from the 1851 Act procedure is contained in section 52 where provision is made for releasing on bail a person in respect of whom an order for his handing over has been made, on condition that he will present himself at a named Garda Station at the time mentioned in a notice in writing to be served on him by the Gardaí and which will, of course, be related to the time the Gardaí expect the British or Northern Ireland escort to arrive.  If he does not present himself at the time stated a warrant may be issued for his arrest.</P>
    <P>The other safeguards included in Part III of the 1963 Bill have been maintained.  For example, there is a prohibition on the surrender to Britain or Northern Ireland of persons accused of political, revenue or purely military offences or in cases where there are substantial reasons for believing that the persons concerned will, if surrendered, be prosecuted for political or purely military offences.  Warrants relating to imprisonment in default of the payment of a fine will not be enforced; nor will warrants for summary offences, unless the alleged offenders have had an opportunity of attending voluntarily at the relevant British or Northern Ireland court.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Part III is on the general lines of the British Bill on this subject, which is well on its way to the statute book.  I very gladly place on record my appreciation of the very valuable help we received from the British and Northern authorities during the consultations on both Bills, all of which augurs well for the extension of this co-operation in the <Col N="1887" /> criminal field to other aspects of mutual assistance in such matters as the enforcement of maintenance orders and the enforcement of judgments in civil cases.  I shall press ahead with these other matters, of which some preliminary examination has already taken place, as soon as this Bill has become law.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to express the hope that the Bill will commend itself to the House as a practical, non-controversial measure which represents a considerable step forward in co-operation in the administration of justice.  If there are any particular aspects that Deputies would like to have clarified at this stage I shall endeavour to deal with them when replying but I will, in any event, give very careful consideration between now and Committee Stage to any suggestions that may be made in the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has mentioned, this Bill is largely of an non-controversial nature.  It is getting its second introduction in the House because, generally speaking, we discussed the provisions of the Bill when discussing the 1963 Bill.  So far as the extradition procedure and provisions are concerned, the Bill is almost entirely based on the provisions of the European Convention on Extradition. When discussing the previous Bill, I paid a tribute, which I should now like to repeat, to the Minister's officials for the manner in which the Bill has been drafted showing very clearly how the various Articles of the European Convention are brought into our legislation. Again, generally speaking, in this Bill the draftsmen have endeavoured to use the precise phrases used in the European Convention.  I think that is all to the good.  It makes the Bill very easy to read and in conjunction with the Convention very easy to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point on which I am not clear in regard to the Bill or the Minister's remarks, that is, the link up between Part II and Part III.  The general provisions in respect to extradition in the Bill do not so far as I can <Col N="1888" /> see preclude extradition treaties or agreements being made with Great Britain, for example.  It is provided in Part III that the provision applies only to Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Wales and Scotland.  I should like to be clear in my mind as to whether the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that you cannot have an extradition agreement with Great Britain or Northern Ireland and if the procedure in relation to Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man is to be governed by the procedure of backing of the warrants without any formal extradition agreement.  If that is so, it possibly answers some of the queries I have in mind, but it does not seem to be clear from the Bill.  It is good that we should have formal extradition agreements with other countries.  We do not want to shelter anybody else's criminals and I am quite sure they do not want to shelter ours.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the Bill is that in conjunction with, I hope, many other countries&mdash;I think there are about 40 countries with which England has extradition treaties&mdash;provided we adhere to the European Convention in the future, we shall be in a position to enter into these formal arrangements. As the Minister pointed out, these provisions will not apply in cases of political, revenue or military offences.</P>
    <P>In connection with military offences, I am a little puzzled as to why the Minister adopted the phraseology of his predecessor.  Instead of referring to military offences, he referred to purely military offences.  I do not know if there is any important distinction.  The Minister's predecessor was queried on that when the last Bill was going through the House and I notice the Minister's introductory remarks have gone back to the phraseology of &ldquo;purely military offences&rdquo;.  There is no such phrase in the Bill.  There is no definition in the Bill of &ldquo;purely military&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;military&rdquo;. Let me say I did not raise the point last time.  One of my colleagues did.  I noted it then but did not think it was of very great importance but I wonder, now that I hear the phrase repeated <Col N="1889" /> today, if there is not some considerable significance to be attached to it.  I should like the Minister to explain it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the point raised in the course of discussion of the last Bill, that is, the question of requiring the requesting country to show that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists when the requesting country are seeking to extradite a person.  The position is that the Anglo-American code dealing with the extradition does require that when a country seeks to extradite a person from another country, they should show that a <i>prima facie</i> case exists against the person they want to extradite.</P>
    <P>The continental system of extradition does not contain any such requirement and it was urged, when the last Bill was before the House &mdash; the appeal came from these benches and, I think, was reasonably sympathetically received by the Minister&mdash;that if there was anything we could do to preserve the requirement of having a <i>prima facie</i> case made out, if a request were made to us, we should do it.  It seems to me that there is a substantial improvement in section 22 of the Bill in that direction.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but it seems to me that under that section it will not now be possible to negotiate with other countries who subscribe to the European Convention in order to contain in the extradition provisions some requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case must be presented to us when a request is made.  If I am right in reading section 22 in that way, then I think it is a considerable improvement as against the Bill when last presented to us.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Bill also that the requesting country can only proceed against a person for the offence in respect of which he is extradited except in certain circumstances dealt with in section 39.  As far as that is concerned, I do not know whether there is any way in which the country, taking this country as being the country to which a request for extradition is made, can get any guarantee or assurance that that will be the position, <Col N="1890" /> that the only proceeding to be taken will be for the particular offence for which the person is being extradited.  As the Minister has pointed out, and I think he is correct in this, we have to take some things on faith and deal with countries as with individuals. Living would become quite impossible if we were not in a position where we could rely on the assurances and good faith of other countries.  It seems to me that while we cannot get any absolute guarantee in the matter, it is one of those things we must take on faith and if we have doubts with regard to the other country, the proper thing is not to make any extradition agreement with it.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this&mdash;it was in the last Bill as it is in this one&mdash; about which I am not entirely happy. It is the provision dealing with extradition for political offences.  It seems to me that under this Bill the sole arbiter of what is or is not a political offence will be the Minister.  We have our own peculiar difficulties in this country.  I do not think it is necessary to underscore them in any way.  Other countries probably have their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The question of defining what is a political offence and of deciding on it is one which should be taken by the Government rather than by an individual Minister.  I am quite sure the Minister for Justice is prepared to shoulder the responsibility, if it is put on him, and I know we have a system of collective responsibility, but under the Bill as it stands, it is open to the Minister for Justice, whoever he may be, to give his own ruling, to make up his own mind without consultation with the Government or anyone else. It would be preferable that the question of deciding what is a political offence or whether an offence is a political offence should be for the Government rather than the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to our own particular difficulties&mdash;this relates principally to Part III rather than to the general extradition provisions&mdash;if it were possible to define in advance, to some extent at any rate, what would be regarded as a political or military offence <Col N="1891" />&mdash;let us even take the Minister's expression &ldquo;purely military&rdquo;&mdash;it might be better.  We should try to clear the air.</P>
    <P>We have entered into discussions with people in the north and they have been welcomed, north and south.  They are not entirely new or novel because a certain amount of practical co-operation has been going on over the years, but to the extent that there is a new spirit and a new atmosphere there, I think it would be of assistance if we were to make it quite clear that any offences committed by our citizens in an unauthorised or illegal way, offences connected with violence or armed offences or sorties across the Border, would not be sheltered by us on the basis that those are political offences. It would be all to the good and would clear the air a lot and foster a spirit of friendship and goodwill, north and south.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am conscious of the fact that under the Bill it is not necessary for us, or for any country to whom a request for extradition is made, to extradite one's own nationals and that that will not, in most cases, be altered under this Bill.  It is quite simply set out in the European Convention in Article 6 that contracting parties shall have the right to refuse extradition of its nationals.  The provision has been included in the Bill that &ldquo;unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide,&rdquo; and it seems to me that deliberately the door is kept open that we may, if we wish, make provision that we will extradite our own nationals.  The Minister has indicated that that is going to be dependent on whether or not similar facilities are given by countries with whom we have these extradition agreements. However, I simply want to leave the thought with the Minister at this stage.  I think it would do nothing but good that there should be some firm and clear pronouncement from the Minister and the Government on this subject.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out&mdash; and again this follows exactly the terms of the European Convention&mdash;<Col N="1892" /> it is not now proposed to list what are to be regarded as extraditable offences. Instead, they are defined by category, but provision does exist in the Bill, and certainly exists in the European Convention, for States to compile a list, if they wish, of offences which will be regarded as extraditable or, on the other hand, to compile a list of offences which will not be regarded as extraditable. In those cases there is an obligation on the country to deposit the list with, I think, the Secretary General. A number of offences are set out as being non-extraditable.  The principal ones, as I have mentioned and as the Minister has mentioned, are political offences, offences connected with revenue, or military offences.  There are other ones listed in sections 15 to 20 of the Bill, all of which follow the European Convention very closely.  I do not think any of them are cases to which anyone in the House would take exception.</P>
    <P>With regard to some slight alterations made in the Bill, I should like to ask the Minister to give the reasons for them.  I have already dealt with section 22 and the Minister has indicated to me that my reasoning as to why this amendment is made is correct.  I notice in section 43 which appears in Part III that while under the previous Bill, it was provided, although not in precisely the same lay-out, that the backing of warrants would apply to indictable offences or offences punishable on summary conviction to a maximum period of three months, that has now been extended to six months.  I should like to know the reason for that, whether any representations were made either by us or to us in that connection.  I think I am correct in saying also that while it was set out in the 1963 Bill that the operation of the Bill was retrospective in this section, that is not there now.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion I should like to make to the Minister in connection with section 37, which requires a witness to some of the documents that have to be forwarded in connection with extradition proceedings.  All that is required is that they be authenticated by the oath of some witness or <Col N="1893" /> by the seal of some Minister of State. It seems to me that that is leaving it a little loose and that some official person, such as a consular official or embassy official, should be required to act as a witness.  However, that is a matter that can be dealt with on Committee.  As I said, this Bill is non-controversial. It is worth having it enacted.  If the previous Bill had been enacted, it might have obviated a certain amount of difficulty, both for us and our neighbours across the sea.</P>
    <P>I am not a French scholar and my final query to the Minister is in connection with Article 2 of the Convention. I do not know whether I have misread this or not.  Article 2 deals with extraditable offences and sets out that extradition should be granted in respect of offences punishable in the requested or requesting countries by deprivation of liberty, or under a deportation order, for a maximum period of at least one year or by a more severe penalty.  It seems to me that what is intended there is not a maximum period of one year but a minimum period of one year and it seems to me also that that is the way we have construed it in the Bill.  In setting out the category of offences which are to be extraditable offences, we have read that clearly as meaning a minimum period of one year rather than a maximum.  The reason I ask is that I am only able to read the English translation.  Possibly the Minister may be able to read the French and assist the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy O'Higgins struck me in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; and it appeared that it should be &ldquo;minimum&rdquo;.  Everybody has agreed that the need to ensure that this country will not be a haven for thugs is very obvious and must be, in so far as we can help to make it, a matter of international agreement.  To that extent certainly this Bill is entirely uncontroversial. A thought which occurs to me regarding the whole question of extradition, looking back over events of the past 12 months or so and thinking of what occurred in our courts, runs along the lines that we <Col N="1894" /> seem to have been operating for a long time in a sphere of illegality in the matter of extradition.  It must have been so for quite a number of years that certain extraditory action of one kind or another by the authorities here did not have the sanction of the Constitution.  If that can happen over long periods it makes one concerned, to say the least of it, that the agencies of the State should permit such a situation to continue until eventually it was exposed by a citizen of the State resorting to his ordinary right of taking action in the courts.</P>
      <P>The question of a political offence troubles me for reasons which I think are somewhat different from those given by Deputy O'Higgins.  I have searched through the Bill for any definition of what constitutes a political offence and I have also examined the European Convention on Extradition seeking enlightenment on this point and the only reference I can find that could be remotely described as a definition of a political offence is in Article 3, section I, which states:</P>
      <P>Extradition shall not be granted if the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the requested Party as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
      <P>In other words, the nearest you get to a definition there is that the Government of the country in which the person sought is residing or hiding will have the right to determine whether, in fact, the person is a political offender or not.  That is a very loose kind of definition and one which I think is open to all sorts of interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different countries have different ideas regarding what constitutes a political offence.  In this country it is not unusual for the Government of the day, whatever it might be, to consider that any action or thought in opposition is a political offence.  It is not followed up, of course, to the extent of being punished except where it is related to acts of violence.  But I have known in my own lifetime a situation where political offenders were <Col N="1895" /> arraigned before a specially constituted court which was called a special criminal court although the offences were purely political, and people were sentenced and described as criminals although their offences were political. This question of the definition of a political offence is one upon which there should be some clarity.  We should have moved by now far beyond the position which was occupied by the Governments here over the years. I remember how they sought to degrade&mdash;each Government in turn&mdash;the activities of the Opposition by describing them as criminal activities, as in some parts they may have been on occasions on every side, but which to a large extent were definitely not criminal and which also in very many cases, although described as criminal, were definitely of a political nature.</P>
    <P>This is related to the purely domestic situation but it can be relevant to events which are liable to occur in Europe generally when our relations with other Governments, when there is a change of Government in other countries, can put us into a position where we may find ourselves having to determine whether a person who is resident here is or is not guilty of a political offence in another country. It is very hard for people living here to make an objective or any kind of considered judgment in such a situation. How are we to judge really whether or not a person who has fled here from a European country where a Government is not to his liking and where he may be sought by a Government on what they allege to be criminal grounds, has a genuine case for claiming asylum on political grounds here? How are we to determine such a case without having some definition before us as to what constitutes generally a political offence?</P>
    <P>As far as the suggestion made by Deputy O'Higgins is concerned in relation to the spirit of ecumenism which seeks to pervade the atmosphere <i>vis-á-vis</i> North and South at the moment, I should tread warily, as one who has no sympathy with those people who adopt violence in the solution of any problem but at the same time as one who must <Col N="1896" /> have regard to the political facts of life and who knows that prejudices and animosities die hard.  They should be let die gently; like old soldiers, they should just fade away.  Let us not make haste too speedily in this matter so far as our neighbours and friends in the North are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill, generally, is very necessary in relation to the ordinary arrangements that one country must make with another and the Minister has done well to take so much of the terminology of the European Convention on Extradition and embrace it in the Bill so as to put us in this matter as far as possible on all-fours with the majority of other countries in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to deal purely with the question of political offences because, apart from that, I think the whole Bill is beyond criticism, certainly in its general principles. We should not be too self-conscious on this point of political offences because it is a problem which affects other countries also.  I remember being in Paris at the height of the political crisis over General de Gaulle's policy for the evacuation of Algeria. At that time, particularly at night, the city was crammed with heavily-armed gendarmes and even troops.  I remember seeing the base of the Eiffel Tower entirely cordoned off by a number of troops which appeared to me to be about battalion strength but I did not regard it as healthy to walk around counting them for too long.</P>
      <P>At that time in Paris it was not uncommon for explosions to take place in certain parts of the city when people, ostensibly for political reasons, threw explosive or incendiary bombs into shops and even restaurants and places of entertainment.  In a situation like that what is our position to be if a man is found to have taken life in another country and to have taken it illegally and has taken sanctuary here claiming that he killed for political reasons?  It appears to place the Minister in an extremely difficult situation indeed.</P>
      <P>In section 3, the definition section, there is one phrase which does not help very much.  It states on page 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" />&ldquo;political offence&rdquo; does not include the taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of his family.</P>
    <P>That would mean, if we revert to the French illustration, that the assassination or attempted assassination of the President or a member of his family would be an extraditable offence on the face of it but the taking of the life of the Minister for External Affairs would not on the face of it be an extraditable offence if the offender could say that he killed a Minister of the French Government for purely political reasons and that therefore he should continue to have the benefit of sanctuary in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the European Convention has been strictly followed and that therefore it is not only difficult but probably most unwise for us to vary the phrasing of Part II of the Bill.  I think the Minister has been very wise in following the Convention word for word or as nearly as possible but I would hope that this matter of political offences would be clarified with other parties to the European Convention at an early date.</P>
    <P>We in this country have a record of acts of violence committed for political reasons but we should try to look back over the whole conception of what actions should be regarded as purely political.  I know, like Deputy Michael O'Higgins, that the word &ldquo;purely&rdquo; does not come into this any more than it comes into military offences but I believe this whole conception of political offences is really based on the feeling that no man should be prosecuted for his political opinions. His actions in furtherance of his political opinions may well be criminal and to my mind should be punished as such if they are fully criminal actions but the advocacy of certain political theories, while it may be most undesirable in his own country, is something that we would not be prepared to regard as sufficient grounds for extradition from this country.</P>
    <P>In section 11, subsection (2), in reference to political offences, it is set out as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The same rule shall apply if there are substantial grounds for believing <Col N="1898" /> that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.</P>
    <P>That is surely the basis for our whole Convention.  We do not wish to help a government to prosecute one of its own citizens purely because he has the wrong political beliefs in the eyes of his own government.  We do not want him to be prosecuted on account of his political opinions.  But, supposing a man, because of his political opinions, or claiming that it is for that reason, breaks into a bank to steal money or breaks into a post office to steal money or cuts down telegraph poles to disrupt communications or lays explosives or indulges in incendiary activities ostensibly for political reasons and all those acts are virtually criminal and would have to be accepted as such, that is going to place the Minister in a very difficult situation.  I sincerely hope that the situation will not arise but I do hope that the Minister will keep closely in touch with his fellow Ministers in the other European countries and any other country with which we may negotiate for extradition rights, to try to see whether we can get some greater clarity on this issue.  Far too many criminal acts which are completely anti-social, which may endanger life, sometimes are sheltered on the grounds of being political offences.  I would hope that our reference to a political offence would be purely as set out in section 11, subsection (2), the question of being prosecuted on account of political opinion.  I know we cannot go that far yet but I would hope that the Minister would use his best endeavours to have that point clarified as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a constructive debate on this measure. Certain points have been raised which require clarification.  We will go into these technical details to a greater extent on Committee stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of political offence, raised by all three speakers, I feel that <Col N="1899" /> it is much better to leave this very sensitive matter open rather than seek at this stage when legislating for many years ahead to tie down or pin down an exact definition which may not have relevance to future circumstances and that on this occasion the phrase &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; itself, subject as it is to the ultimate interpretation here, in our circumstances, by the High Court, is the best way to meet it and, indeed, this was the view also of the other countries which subscribed to the European Convention.  It is significant that they also decided unanimously not to come down on the side of a specific detailed definition and left the definition in Article 3 as an open one, as we have left it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should point out, in case there is any wrong impression, that there is a concurrent jurisdiction residing in the High Court as well as in the Minister for Justice to decide whether an offence is an excepted offence, that is, an offence of a political, military or revenue character and the procedure in this respect is fairly well tied in in the Bill for the benefit of the person who may be arrested.  An arrested person here must be brought before a district court.  Unless he agrees he must be held here for 15 days.  In that period of 15 days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Both ourselves and the British thought that eight or any similar period might in certain circumstances be prejudicial to the person committing the offence and we decided to give greater latitude to ensure that the principle of personal freedom was completely there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We feel that it is more desirable, having regard to personal freedom.  Within this 15 day period, the person arrested has two courses of action open to him.  Under the Part II procedure, he can raise in the district court, where he must <Col N="1900" /> be brought forthwith, the question of his offence being an excepted offence. He can then apply either to the Minister for Justice for a decision or to the High Court.  He may go either way.  If he does go to the High Court, the matter will be decided there in accordance with the circumstances of the time and merits of his case and the interpretation by the Court as to whether it is a political, military or revenue offence.  If he has elected to go to the Minister for Justice first, the Minister may make his decision for or against the person arrested. If it is made by him against the person arrested, the person arrested has still got the ultimate right of <i>habeas corpus</i> which is enshrined in Article 40 of our Constitution, the right to apply against the Minister's decision to the High Court to have himself released on the basis that his offence is an excepted offence, that is, a political, military or revenue offence.</P>
      <P>I think in that procedure we have outlined a series of safeguards with the ultimate absolute safeguard of the <i>habeas corpus</i> right under Article 40 for the person arrested to go to the authority of the Court for a decision as to whether or not his arrest is in accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Act.  This gives full protection&mdash;a matter which concerned Deputy Dunne in particular&mdash;to the person arrested in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised a point in regard to the difference between Parts II and III and as to whether they were tied in together.  There is this distinction, that extradition in the technical sense relates only to Part II. It is only in relation to Part II that we shall have an extradition arrangement which can be made with the countries which have subscribed to the European Convention or can be made with other countries as well. Our arrangement with Great Britain is not extradition in the technical sense but we shall have a mutual enforcement of warrants in each of the two countries.  We feel that is a more practical way of dealing with it having regard to the close relationship between the two islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is made also that I <Col N="1901" /> referred in the text to purely military offences.  The reason for that is that we wanted to make it quite plain that the military offences excepted from this Bill are not offences which are military and civil; in other words the only excepted offence is an offence which is a military offence but not an offence against the civil code.  Desertion is the obvious example.  That is a purely military offence whereas the assaulting of an officer by a soldier or of any soldier by any other soldier is an offence against the civil code and will not be excepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins is right in his interpretation of section 22 in regard to the introduction of the <i>prima facie</i> principle. That is necessary in any extradition arrangement.  It was not there under the Bill as it stood.  It is there to enable us to introduce a <i>prima facie</i> or any other reservation in regard to proof supporting a warrant in any arrangement we may make on an extradition basis with any other country.  Therefore, it is open to us to ask in any extradition arrangement we may have with any country other than Britain that some evidence be produced along with the actual warrant before we allow extradition.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins queried the raising of the period from three months to six months under section 43.  This again was a matter which arose in discussions with the British.  We felt the three months would be related to more trivial offences and that it might be fairer to the person arrested to make it six months.  That is in the British legislation as well.  Deputy O'Higgins raised one point about which I think he is mistaken, that is the question of retrospection under section 3(2) which reads:</P>
    <P>This Act applies, except where otherwise provided, in relation to an offence whether committed or alleged to have been committed before or after the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>So the Bill is retrospective.</P>

      <P>I did not pursue this with the Minister because I understood him to agree with me when I mentioned this matter.  I am not pressing this but representations were made to me that it should be retrospective only to, say, the introduction of either this Bill or the previous Bill.  The Minister might consider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall consider that but it is important to have a retrospective element in the Bill.  Otherwise criminals who have made a haven for themselves here in Ireland over the past few months or who may do so between now and the passing of the Bill would be exempted.  However, I shall consider what Deputy O'Higgins has said as to the degree of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any other matter has been raised.  The main theme, as I stated initially, was the theme in regard to political offences and that is a highly delicate and highly sensitive subject.  It is much better to leave an open definition and, having provided the full safeguards of the courts, to leave it to their discretion and good sense in the circumstances at the time to interpret whether or not an offence is political.  The Bill, particularly in relation to Part III, having regard to our proximity to Northern Ireland and Great Britain, is an urgent one, in that we cannot continue to be, as we have been since the Quinn case last July, a haven for criminals who seek to avoid apprehension in Britain by coming here.  Obviously that situation could not continue between our two countries. The British Government have <Col N="1903" /> brought their measure to the Second Stage in the House of Commons, having passed the House of Lords, and it is important that we move at the same time in order that we may have a satisfactory mutual arrangement in regard to enforcing warrants.</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect, the Bill itself is a comprehensive measure which brings up-to-date rather varied and detailed extradition legislation in many statutes over the last century.  Therefore, when this Bill is enacted it will be a basic comprehensive measure which will be the root of all our extradition measures not alone in regard to Britain and Northern Ireland and the countries subscribing to the European Convention but in regard to whatever other countries with which we wish to make extradition arrangements, eventuating, I suppose, in the long run in complete extradition arrangements with every civilised country.  This is the basic enactment in that respect.  It is an important enactment, therefore, and I feel certain the House will give its approval to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill shows that it is concerned with the abatement of public service pensions where the pensioner is re-employed in the public service.  The Bill deals only with pensions which are subject to abatement by statutory provision. Thus it deals with civil servants' pensions which are governed by the Superannuation Acts, with pensions under the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts, and with the pensions of members of some semi-State Boards, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and the President.  Where provisions for abatement in pension schemes can be amended by regulation or otherwise without recourse to legislation, they are not dealt with in this Bill, but it is <Col N="1904" /> intended that when the Bill has been enacted, these provisions will then be dealt with by way of statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>At present the normal abatement provision ensures that, when a public service pensioner is re-employed anywhere in the public service, his pension is reduced by any sum by which the total of his annual salary on re-employment plus his pension exceeds the annual salary which he had on retirement from the position in respect of which his pension was awarded. However, if the pensioner's services are sufficiently valuable to enable him to secure employment outside the public service, his pension is not abated.  I am of the opinion that, if the pensioner can similarly obtain employment in a sector of the public service other than that from which he retired, this constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence that his services are valuable and competitive and that he should be paid in full for the job as though he had secured employment outside the public service. Abatement of the pension which had accrued to him for his previous service effectively reduces the full pay for the job.  On the other hand, where a pensioner is re-employed in the same service as that in which he spent his career, it may not be because his services meet the above conditions.  For example, many civil service pensioners are re-employed on the grounds of hardship and it would not be appropriate to pay pension in addition to salary in such cases.  In these cases it is a condition of re-employment that payment of the pension will not commence until the re-employment ends. The Bill, accordingly, provides that where a public service pensioner is re-employed in any employment other than that from which he retired, even though this employment is in the public service, his pension will not be abated, but where he is re-employed in the same service as that from which he retired, his pension will continue to be subject to abatement, but of a milder kind.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes one exception to the principle that abatement should continue to apply to re-employment in the <Col N="1905" /> same service.  This is where it is in the public interest to re-employ the pensioner in that service.  Stringent conditions are prescribed by the Bill to ensure that this exception will be applied only in genuine instances where it is in the public interest to re-employ the pensioner and that it will not be exploited by persons desiring to secure both salary and pension at the same time in their own interest.</P>
    <P>Under the Conciliation and Arbitration Agreement made with the Civil Service Staff side, consultations took place in January last with representatives of the Staff Side of the General Council on the heads of the Bill which dealt with Civil Service pensions.  These representatives suggested a number of changes which were accepted.  The most important of these was that where a pension must continue to be abated under the Bill, abatement should take place, not by reference to the salary on retirement from the pensionable position, but by reference to the salary currently payable in respect of that position.  The acceptance of this suggestion will remove the anomaly whereby a person might receive a salary increase while re-employed only to find that his pension was reduced by the same amount because, at present, the total of salary and pension cannot exceed salary on retirement from the pensionable post.  The present provision was held to be justified on the grounds that to abate a re-employed person's pension by reference to the current salary of the position from which he retired would be to treat him as though he had not retired at all. For instance, he would benefit from increases in the pay of his former grade, even if the increases were in respect of the introduction of higher duties or some other factor which did not affect him.  Neither provision is thus free from anomalies but I am satisfied that the proposed amendment, which will be an easement of the position of individuals, is the more desirable of the two.  Consideration of this amendment and the drafting of the necessary provisions, which are rather complex, delayed the circulation of the Bill to the present session.</P>
    <P>I have given some thought to the question of making the Bill retrospective. <Col N="1906" /> This point was raised by Deputy James Tully in the course of the debate on the Vote on Account on 16th February, 1965.  The Bill was introduced in the last Dáil in December, 1964, and as it was originally intended to have it enacted in the last session, I think it would be reasonable to make it retrospective to 1st January, 1965.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>

      <P>I am glad to learn from the Minister's remarks&mdash;I had a note here to refer to it myself&mdash; that it is proposed to make this Bill retrospective.  I am not certain that the retrospection goes back far enough. So far as I can gather, there is some disappointment at the terms of this measure on the part of certain categories and it may be that it will be possible to effect an amendment by amending, as the Minister has said, certain schemes.  One of the categories of persons affected by the abatement, who suffer a long-felt sense of grievance, as well as civil service personnel, is that of ex-Army officers. Under the 1937 Defence Forces Pensions Scheme certain provisions take effect which mean that an officer's pay and pension are reduced.  Article 15 reads:</P>
      <P>Where an officer in receipt of retired pay is appointed to any office the remuneration of which is payable out of public moneys whether provided by the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund or by means of poor rate or any other rate imposed by a local authority, the following provisions shall, while he is in receipt of such remuneration, have effect;</P>
      <P>(a) if the amount of such remuneration equals or exceeds the pay of such officer immediately prior to his retirement then such retired pay shall not be payable to such officer;</P>
      <P>(b) if the amount of such remuneration is less than the said pay then so much only of such retired pay as will, when added to such remuneration, not exceed the said pay shall be paid to such officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> The effect of that has operated very harshly in the case of retired Army officers.  Indeed, I believe it has had certain consequences to which it may be no harm to advert.  There is a general recognition that it is desirable to attract the highest quality of young men as officers.  This will not be possible if those who retire, and subsequently secure employment in State, semi-State or undertakings in which abatement applies, find that their pay is affected.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the position which has obtained up to this is most unsatisfactory, unfair and inequitable. I have before me certain cases I can give as examples.  I have the case of a retired Army Officer who is a teacher. The maximum he may receive by way of civil pay&mdash;that is, pay from Government sources and retired pay&mdash;is £1,040 per annum, the rate of his Army pay on retirement plus an increase of five per cent of retired pay granted in October, 1964, making a total of £1,062.  The increase in civil remuneration subsequent to 15th December, <Col N="1908" /> 1959, other than the five per cent I have already mentioned, did not affect the ceiling.  In effect, that means that from April of this year to April, 1966, this person's pension will be reduced by approximately £230 and any increases he might get as a teacher by way of increment or award will not be of any benefit until such time as the balance of his pension has been absorbed.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, and in many similar cases, the individual concerned contributes to a superannuation fund; five per cent of his pay as a teacher is deducted so that his effective pay is reduced by this percentage whenever he becomes entitled to an increment or a pay award.  This abatement clause deprives him, therefore, of the opportunity to avail of perquisites enjoyed by other secondary teachers, such as fees payable for correcting examination papers or supervising examinations.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 25th May, 1965.</P>

      <P>Grants totalling £2,300 were made to the Dublin County Council by the Department of Local Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, for drainage works <Col N="1865" /> on the Ballough River.  The Commissioners of Public Works could deal with the drainage of the river only by way of a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for the Bally-boghill catchment area in which it lies. That catchment has been noted for consideration in due course in the Intermediate Rivers Drainage Programme, but I cannot say when it may be reached in that programme.</P>
