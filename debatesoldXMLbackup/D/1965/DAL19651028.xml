      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 24a in the name of Deputy Ryan, is out of order as tending to impose a charge.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an amendment which, as the Ceann Comhairle says, has been rejected as it would impose a charge.  We felt architects should be induced to provide plans for a house that could be conveniently dismantled, transferred and re-erected on another site.  We felt there was a necessity for fresh thinking <Col N="629" /> on house planning, first, as the Minister is aiming to do, to reduce the cost and increase the speed at which houses may be provided.  As the Minister knows, there are many instances at present where temporary accommodation must be provided in order to provide suitable accommodation for families in dire distress and, in many instances, we have to provide caravans, which are both expensive and not always very suitable.  If it is possible to attract an architect or a firm to do some research into the provision of a house that could be erected quickly, and dismantled quickly when permanent accommodation has been provided in the particular area, that would be a valuable contribution, and it should not be eliminated from the scope of this section.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to further explain subsection (3):</P>
      <P>A grant may be paid under this Act (apart from this section) in respect of any further house erected with the approval of the Minister in accordance with plans and specifications that are the same as the plans and specifications of a house in respect of which a grant was made under this section or that differ from those plans and specifications only in respect of modifications approved of by the Minister, notwithstanding the fact that the house is not in compliance with any regulations made by the Minister for the purposes of the section under which the grant is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, I think, needs further clarification. Suppose some firm, as a result of fairly expensive and extensive research, produce the type of house for which the Minister is looking, they will get 50 per cent of the cost of that house.  If houses are subsequently built to that plan and specification, what does the Minister propose to give to these research people who designed the first house?  Could we have some indication for their guidance, something that will provide an incentive or an attraction, something by way of royalty subsequently?  Or is this confined entirely to local authority housing, in which case the Minister can say to local authorities that he will <Col N="630" /> give an extra grant of so much for any house built to this particular plan and specification?  I assume it is not intended to continue paying 50 per cent of the cost of all houses produced to this plan and specification.  We should, I think, know a good deal more about this.  As well as this 50 per cent grant, will the normal grants available also be payable?  There is some little confusion which the Minister might clear up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), it is stated that houses could be erected in accordance with the plans and specifications either with greater speed than if they were erected by conventional methods or at lower cost. I assume from that that it would be necessary to wait until the house was finished before any decision could be taken as to whether it qualified for the grant.  I cannot see any incentive there. In Ballymun, it is taking as long to build the houses as it ever did and the costs are not to any great extent much lower than they are by conventional methods.  I wonder if the Minister really means what he says in this subsection.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I assume only one house will be built and, so soon as it is built, it will no longer be an experimental type of house and will, therefore, no longer qualify for the higher grant.  Perhaps I have the wrong end of the stick, but my interpretation of the section is that, while it seems to say a great deal, in the last analysis, it does not offer anything which might mean we will have more houses or more than one type of better house erected.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section.  It represents a departure from the traditional methods.  Quite a number of private firms are interested in building this prototype house but, up to this, there has been no legislation to give them any encouragement, good, bad, or indifferent.  I have travelled in other countries in which a good deal of thought has been given to providing more houses per acre than have been provided by the traditional methods here.  I am not suggesting we should <Col N="631" /> aim at greater density but we want houses built quickly and this section will help us to do that.  The Minister can consider favourably under this section practical and constructive suggestions governing the erection of a particular type of house.  At the moment, unless a house is built to certain traditional specifications, there is no grant available for it.  It must be built of concrete, or bricks, or some such material before it will be considered for a grant.</P>
      <P>In other countries in which they have had housing problems, there has been a change in approach.  Having seen the houses built, I can say that they are very nice houses, built more cheaply than houses can be built by the traditional methods.  Another factor is the very high price of land; because of that, they are building more houses to the acre in other countries.  I do not suggest we should slavishly follow that pattern, but it might be possible in certain circumstances to build more houses to the acre and to put small families or aged people into them. That would help to solve our problem. I believe this section will go a long way towards helping us to find a satisfactory solution to our problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not mean anything more than it says.  For one approved prototype house, a grant of up to 50 per cent may be made.  With regard to continuing benefit to whomsoever is responsible in the first instance, that is something that cannot be covered here by legislation.  If there are certain features in the construction of the house, then the designer can patent those features.  The use of the patent subsequently would be a commercial matter between the designer and the user.  It is not the intention, as Deputy Tully seems to think, to aim solely at speed.  If we can get speed in erection so much the better; if we can get lower costs, so much the better.  These are the two features and each case can be considered on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If speed of erection were the guiding principle, one would, of course, have to wait until the house was completed to <Col N="632" /> find out how long it took.  The idea is that plans will be put before the Department. These plans will be examined.  On the case made and the information given, the Department will determine whether or not the house meets with the requirements governing speed of erection.  Admittedly, it may be that a grant will be given on the assurance that this speed will be attained but it could happen that the speed of erection would be disappointing. This is something we cannot determine absolutely in advance but on a preliminary technical examination of the entire proposal and before approving of the prototype, we would have a very good idea.  If the erection did not come up to the promises of the proposer, it could well be that that would be a condition that had not been fulfilled and therefore the grant would not necessarily be paid or paid in full.</P>
    <P>Likewise in regard to the cost, if we had been misled by the proposer and the cost was not kept within what was promised, it is again possible that this would be a condition on which the grant would be paid, and if it were not fulfilled, the grant need not necessarily be paid.  The House need not have any fears in this direction.  The only fear I have is that there will not be enough activity under this head.  It was to encourage activity in this direction that the provision was first introduced in this House some few years ago.  If we can get more activity in regard to proposals for prototype houses that will meet either the speed of erection factor or the lower cost factor, or both, so much the better.  That is what we are trying to encourage in this section.</P>
    <P>In so far as the question of demountable houses is concerned, this is a matter about which we are not entirely satisfied ourselves.  We are having another look at it and will report back to the House as to what we feel could be done in this regard.  We in the Department are examining this question of the demountable house which is a great need.  We would hope it would solve the problems in regard to elderly persons in isolated parts of the country, where a house might be needed only for a time and would be a waste thereafter if it could not be removed. <Col N="633" /> If on further examination we find that something in the section might encourage others outside to lend their aid and their thoughts to this matter, Deputies can take it we shall come back to the House to try to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister has already in mind this type of house that can be quickly erected, dismantled and re-erected.  I hope that when we come to the Report Stage, this section will be so amended as to include this if it is considered possible and desirable.</P>
      <P>One thing we have established which was not quite clear to everybody is that under this section there is only one prize, a prize of £1,000 or £1,500 maximum which can be paid only once to any firm or any architect to produce an acceptable prototype house. There is great need for research into what the Minister is looking for here and I do not believe that that is sufficient inducement to any firm to go seriously into research to produce the type of house we want.  If the Minister is really serious about this, he will make some provision when this type of house is produced, if it is shown and proved that the research put into this work has saved the State and the local authorities a considerable amount of money, to give further compensation or some reward to those who engaged in this work.  I do not think £1,000 or £1,500 will attract that sort of investigation and research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the reconstruction grants, as the Minister knows, it is now possible for small farmers to get a £450 State grant and a £450 supplementary grant from the local authority, that is, £900.  I would <Col N="634" /> say there are a large number of farmer's houses in the country capable of economic repair and reconstruction and what I am afraid will happen is that the inducement to demolish and rebuild will be such that many people will now decide to do that rather than keep their own houses standing and improve them.  There has been no increase in the reconstruction grant and many people will be attracted to the new house grants.  It is unwise policy for the Minister not to have stepped up the reconstruction grant as he has stepped up the new building grants so that people might not involve themselves, the State and the local authority in unnecessary expenditure.  The Minister should look again to see if he cannot improve grants which have been in existence for a considerable time, in order to avoid this very definite likelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the constituency which Deputy Clinton and I represent, we have quite a number of houses which are very old and in a bad state of repair.  In many cases an inspector visiting these houses will say that they are beyond reconstruction.  A number of the houses with which we are dealing are old mud-walled houses of a very poor type.  It is a wonderful thing to get this grant of £450.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not £450; it is £140.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the reconstruction grant but the grant for the building of the house which the Deputy mentioned and which is £900.  This is an encouragement to a man to build a good house. I agree that if it were possible to increase the reconstruction grants in certain cases, it would be a wise thing to do, but taking the long-term view, we know that with patching up an old house, you will never have a new house.  Therefore I should like to see the stress laid on building.  This is what we are up against in Dublin. People will ask: &ldquo;Why are you taking down this old house&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why are you bringing in a new planning scheme for North Dublin?&rdquo;  But in <Col N="635" /> 25 years time, these houses will be falling down.  We have a number of old patched-up houses on which a good deal of money has been spent but which are still old houses with no dampcourses and so on.</P>
      <P>As I said, I should like to see the stress being laid on building.  This would be better for all concerned.  We have made a liberal grant available already and whereas heretofore we took in only one section, those who are deriving their living completely from the land, we are now taking in another category, for whom I have been fighting for a long time, which includes road workers, office workers and people in various jobs in commerce. I think this is a great advance by the Minister and obviously a lot of thought went into this.  Over the years I have tried to get reconstruction grants for quite a number of people, just as Deputy Clinton and other Deputies have also tried, but the position is that people spend £500 or £600 on an old house, raising some of the money in the bank perhaps and getting £140 from the State and another £140 from the local authority, if they so wish, and even after all this, the unfortunate people still have an old house.  If we are to raise the standard of housing, I am all in favour of this liberal grant being given now. Even if a man is going to put a millstone around his neck for 20 years, or 30 years, or 40 years, it is a very liberal grant.  When I was young, if I had received £900 towards the building of a house, I would have been very happy and I would not have thought of reconstructing an old house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister.  I am in some doubt in regard to subsection (2) (b).  I notice that over the years in our legislation&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;farmers have been getting liberal grants of one kind or another, but one of the greatest sections of our people who have been neglected is the urban section.  One takes it for granted that urban dwellers are wealthier than the agricultural or pastoral type of person. <Col N="636" /> I should like the Minister to clear up this point for me, by telling me whether these other cases apply to urban dwellers and whether the farmers get two-thirds as against the urban dwellers' one-third.  I have gone through the Bill thoroughly and I cannot find any other section which proves or disproves this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Andrews' question, what is provided and what has obtained for some years, in relation to grants of say, £120 or £140, just to take those figures, in relation to the farmer is that if his job costs less than three times the maximum of the grant applicable to this particular case, which is related to the size of his house, then the question of two-thirds can arise.  If in fact the total of the job is greater than three times the maximum grant, then it does not really make any difference because he can only get one-third and not exceed £140, whichever is the lesser, and one-third would be £140 in such case and he would hope to get another one-third from the local authority.  In the case of an urban or non-farming group, then in any case they will only get one-third, so that really if their job costs less than three times the maximum grant, they can theoretically lose, and indeed, in practice, lose, if they are in a local authority area where there is no supplementary grant there to match what is paid by the Government. Assuming that there was a case of a similar cost relating to a similar sized house, the applicants for which were one from the non-farming group and one from the farming group, and if there were the full supplementary grants operating and applying to the non-farmer as to the farmer, then the ultimate wind-up would be that the two would have the same amount, twice the maximum grant.  Where the cost comes below the maximum grant, then in some cases, depending on the operation of the supplementary grant, the non-farmer may get less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister and the House will agree that the expenditure of money on reconstruction <Col N="637" /> grants was money exceptionally well spent.  It has done a considerable amount of good in repairing old dwellings and eliminating unsightly buildings in many of our towns and cities.  The expenditure of money under this heading has done more to make our towns tidy than anything else I know of, apart altogether from the benefit it conferred on the human beings whose habitations were improved as a direct result of these grants.</P>
      <P>Consequently we are concerned that, in a comprehensive Bill of this kind governing all aspects of housing, no increase was provided for reconstruction grants.  Money is the most essential ingredient and the greatest incentive we can provide for the re-housing of our people.  People looked to this measure with hope and confidence for an increase in grants of this kind as the first essential.  They hoped that reconstruction grants would be increased out of all proportion.  That seemed only right and proper and realistic, in the light of the considerable increase in labour costs and the costs of materials which has taken place since these grants were first introduced a considerable number of years ago.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will have second thoughts and make this measure a little more realistic by increasing the grants of £100, £120 and £140 to a figure more in keeping with present day costs.  Otherwise, I do not think he will have done anything in this measure to make reconstruction grants more attractive to our people.  They have been widely availed of up to now and they have done great good.  If the Minister wants to ensure that that trend of happy events continues, he will have to be money-minded.  People are money-minded in this matter and the grants should be increased proportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that it is difficult for a person with little means to avail of a reconstruction grant in the first instance.  Many local authorities do not make money available for this purpose.  One must have at one's disposal a minimum amount of money to put a contractor to work. As public representatives, we know <Col N="638" /> that very many people are frustrated because they do not have the initial outlay of capital to entice a contractor to accept a reconstruction job.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said that these grants are to be on the basis that the applicant must be prepared to pay not less than one-third of the cost.  That can be quite a considerable sacrifice for a person with little means.  On the other hand, we know that some applicants are quite handy, or their families are in the building line, or their friends or relations are tradesmen, and can carry out a reconstruction job within the confines of the grant alone.  I appreciate that the principle of the applicant spending some of his or her own money is necessary.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this aspect of the reconstruction grants and to increase the amount to some extent at least.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that the grants made by the Minister's Department were allotted on the assumption and understanding that the local authorities would pay £ for £ with the State grant, that whatever amount the inspectors stipulated was the grant involved&mdash; whether £100, £120 or £140&mdash;the local authority, be it a county council, a corporation or an urban council, would pay £ for £ with that grant. Many people were of the opinion that that would apply, and when the Minister indicated the amount of his grant, they automatically doubled it in anticipation of getting that amount from the local authorities towards the repair of their houses, but they found to their distress and disappointment that the local authority to which they belonged had not adopted that grant scheme.  Some local authorities paid nothing towards the generous grants given in the past by the Minister's Department and the unfortunate people in their areas had to meet two-thirds of the cost of the repairs involved.</P>
    <P>There are other local authorities that pay only a percentage of the Department's grant, perhaps 75 per cent, or 50 per cent, or on the basis of a means test.  Again, the principle of paying £ for £ with the reconstruction grant awarded by the Department is <Col N="639" /> frustrated and set aside.  Where the Minister is unable or unwilling to compel or direct local authorities to adhere to the principle of paying grants <i>pro rata</i> with the Department grants, where he is unable to bring about that happy situation, I submit he has a moral obligation to come to the rescue of the people who are obliged to bear this unfair share of the responsibility for the reconstruction of their houses.  He should make provision for increasing these grants.</P>
    <P>I can imagine the argument being made to me that this would be an acceptance of the shelving of responsibility by some local authorities, and that all local authorities would follow suit, and eventually, because of the impost on the rates, no local authority would want to pay their contribution towards reconstruction grants which are already a serious burden on the rates.  If this measure is to be realistic, as I said at the outset, and if it is to have regard to present day costs, grants for reconstruction and repairs must be increased.  This Bill will fail very largely in its intention and in its hopes if the Minister does not provide these increases which the people are expecting.</P>
    <P>He has quite rightly increased the grants for new houses, especially for the farming community.  We now have grants of up to £450&mdash;that is quite a considerable figure&mdash;and like amounts from the local authorities, but in the matter of reconstruction, we have the <i>status quo</i>.  We have the same figure now as the figure which obtained a long number of years ago.  I think these grants came into operation ten or 12 years ago, and there has been a colossal change in the times and an upward spiralling of prices since then.  I should not like to hazard a guess as to the extent to which the cost of living has increased since the grants were first introduced at this figure.  In all the circumstances, I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to increase these grants which are doing such tremendous good. He must realise, most of all, that, by assisting people to repair their homes he is not merely conforming to a plan which will beautify a local district or <Col N="640" /> a town by eliminating eyesores and derelict sites but is easing the burden on the local authority and obviating the necessity for that authority to build new houses for these people.  Bad and all as the situation now is, our new-house problem would be increased out of all proportion and would probably be truly chaotic, were it not for the amount of money spent on reconstruction grants and the vast number of people who avail of these grants to improve their homes.  We must continue that good work which has obviated the necessity for the local authority to build so many more new houses which otherwise would be required. In all the circumstances, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this good work is continued and accelerated so that these grants will readily be availed of in the future.  He must create, in this Bill, the opportunity for people to avail of them.</P>
    <P>There must be provision whereby the man of little means can get the necessary outlay money to avail of the grant and put the contractor to work. The amount of the grant must be sufficiently attractive to entice more people to embark on jobs of repair and reconstruction.  These archaic and outdated figures of £100, £120 and £140, which have been on the Statute Book for quite a long number of years, are just not big enough in these times. It is a poor appreciation of the number of people who avail of these grants and the local authorities who have contributed, many of them very generously. The local authority with which I have been connected for a long number of years, Clonmel Corporation, has been foremost from the commencement, in paying <i>pro rata</i>, £ for £, with the Minister's grant.</P>
    <P>There are not very many grants involving housing.  There are new-house grants and there are repair and reconstruction grants and sanitary facility grants for bathrooms and toilets.  The number of grants where £ s. d., the main criterion, is involved is small. The Minister is increasing the number of these grants, certainly for new-house building.  We hope he will see the wisdom and the realism of increasing these reconstruction grants.  The <Col N="641" /> country now finds itself in a period of depression, due to the acute shortage of money, which is affecting housing. I would hope the Minister would be optimistic enough not to be overpessimistic on this account alone by reason of the recession which we have at the present time and that shortage of money.  I certainly would hope that this is the reason he is not prepared to increase these grants because we all look forward to better times and to the passing of this recession.  In all the circumstances, if this measure is to accelerate the housing drive, the re-housing of our people, these grants, as a first essential, should have been increased.  Despite the present economic crisis and the acute shortage of money, I am appealing to the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards these essential grants and to increase them in proportion to the new-house grants which he has awarded to the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows from his records that there are quite a large number of houses in rural Ireland capable of economic repair.  He knows also that the housing needs of most of these people would be met by reconstruction rather than by a new building.  I know it is his policy and his intention, as indicated in this Bill, to keep as many houses that exist at the moment standing as long as possible and providing housing accommodation. He has demonstrated this by introducing a new grant for houses that are not capable of economic repair.  He desires to keep them standing for a limited number of years&mdash;say, for ten years&mdash;and serving the purpose until, we hope, our housing needs may be met and a lot of the backlog and arrears wiped out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy has drawn attention to quite a number of the snags that public representatives at local authority level come across from time to time.  He indicated the difficulty of even finding the initial money to start the contractor.  I do not know how that might be overcome.  It arises only in exceptional cases but it has arisen in a number of cases I am aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that has caused a <Col N="642" /> considerable amount of trouble is the two inspections, where a supplementary grant is being provided by a local authority.  There is the Department's inspector and, on his report, the Department decide to pay the grant but then the local authority inspector goes out and he may say that the standard of the work is not good enough for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the grants being provided.  I refer to it in this way that if the Department could arrange to pay both grants and get a refund from the local authority, it would assist this considerably.  There would then be one inspection and we would avoid wasteful duplication. I have in mind one certificate that both the local authority and the Department would accept.  It gives rise to considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>I wonder if this reference to people whose livelihood is the pursuit of agriculture includes horticulture?  Does &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; include horticulture, please?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that it should include horticulture.  I have in mind market gardeners, fruit-growers and, perhaps, glass-house people in some instances.  I think this should be so amended as to ensure that horticulture will not be excluded but will in fact be included.  I thought the Minister might be able to clarify the position for us.  This is operating against the payment of supplementary grants by county councils.  In quite a few councils at the moment, they are refraining from paying the £ for £ supplementary grant because it may attract too many people to demolish houses that should be left standing and to go ahead and build new houses where reconstruction would meet the need.  The Minister must accept that, if he raised the grants for new buildings because of the increased cost of building, the cost of reconstruction has <Col N="643" /> increased in the same proportion as it has increased for the building of new houses.  It does not seem equitable or right that a man who is deciding to meet his housing needs by reconstruction does not get the same consideration as the person who decides to meet his housing needs by building a new house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of horticulture, I would refer Deputy Clinton to page 6&mdash;not page 6 of the Bill we are now discussing but of another one.  If he cannot find everything there, we shall have another look at it.</P>
      <P>Getting back to this question of the size of the reconstruction grant which was very much laboured here by Deputies Clinton and Treacy, indeed, listening to Deputy Treacy, one would think that unless we in the Government and in the local authorities make it almost so attractive that people cannot avoid repairing their homes, it just does not make sense.  This is, of course, very far from the truth and indeed it is a good thing that it is.  Before there were ever grants to build, repair or maintain homes, 99 per cent of the cases showed that in one way or another the job would be done anyway.  We have been trying to incorporate more people, and even those who would not be able to do a good job or who would have been doing it at great sacrifice to themselves and possibly doing a poor job in the long run.  By virtue of these grants we hope they will do a better all-round repair and reconstruction job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that in the past ten years, on a very rough count, 72,000 homes have been so repaired under reconstruction grants.  This is not taking into account the recent high level of activity in the installation of services which is probably one of the best improvements of all which can take place in our homes.  The water and sewerage grant cases being done are running at a figure of up to 6,000 a year at the moment, as I am sure the House will be very happy to hear. Against that, a few years ago this was practically non-existent and we did not really have a scheme for it.  We were <Col N="644" /> not water conscious in those days. The situation today is that about 6,000 a year is the rate of progress. That seems to be growing very rapidly, together with the fact that well into 70,000 have had reconstruction jobs done with the aid of grants in the past ten years.  These figures are still maintaining a very healthy level and this would appear to me to be a fair indication that our housing stock in private hands is not being neglected, however much it may have been in the past.</P>
    <P>As to the amount of the grant, we discussed this on the new house grants and we had all the arguments, not the least of which was that the new house grants were far too little.  Now we have the same people making an argument in the opposite direction: that in future the new house grants may attract people to build new houses instead of applying for a reconstruction grant.  Pardon me if I seem confused by the arguments advanced on two different sections.  I would say the average cost of the grant-aided reconstruction jobs handled in the Department is just over £400.  Admittedly, there may be ones costing £1,200.  I do not say there are not, because otherwise we would not have an average cost, but taking the average, this means that a great proportion of our people applying for grants and supplementary grants are getting up to two-thirds of their total outlay on these reconstruction and repair jobs.  We should remember that, even though it may be seven years since, in 1958, we gave some increase in these grants.  Since then, we have also by various means, made it more attractive and more feasible for people to avail of these grants by making moneys available through the local authorities and SDA authorities for reconstruction.</P>
    <P>In this Bill for the first time ever, directed towards the reconstruction and repair group, we have a very specific useful new addition to our loan facilities, that is that £200 may be provided through the SDA and council sources without security.  Quite candidly, I do not know at this juncture how much further we are expected to go.  We have to keep in mind that the average cost of repairs in the cases <Col N="645" /> we deal with in the Department is £400.  We have grants running up to two-thirds and sometimes up to £250 or £280 if the total cost of the job is over £400.  I think we should take this into consideration as well.  Despite the fact that costs are being quoted here as the be-all and end-all of what the measure of a grant should be, surely the real measure is the numbers in which they are being made available.</P>
    <P>I do not want to re-use the argument used about housing earlier in regard to the new housing grant figure and the amounts of these grants but the very same argument applies.  Ten or 12 years ago when these grants were almost as large as they are now, not as many of them were being availed of to the same degree as at present. To these further higher figures we must add this 6,000 of the water and sewerage grant applicants and take credit for the fact that this is a further decided improvement in a very great number of our houses.  That particular aspect of our activities is growing very rapidly and I hope will continue to do so right up to the time when we can truthfully say that the great majority of our houses have water on tap, whether it be privately supplied, publicly supplied or through a group supply.  These are the things we have to remember here.</P>
    <P>I would say further in regard to Deputy Clinton's fear, as expressed, that people may be encouraged to build new houses instead of reconstructing on the basis of the level of this grant, that taking another line on it, the new higher grant will not be allocated unless there is a need for a house either by reason of the condition of the existing house which is no longer fit for or capable of being repaired at a reasonable cost or the applicant having no house at the moment, in that event, the reconstruction as an alternative does not arise.  I can assure the Deputy that whatever the position may be with regard to this, one of the essential conditions of qualifying for the increased higher grant is the need for housing and this applying to a person whose house is capable of being put into sound condition, that person will not get the new higher <Col N="646" /> grant.  If he wants to go ahead, despite that, he will get the normal grant but not the higher grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question here?  In subsection (2) (a) which says:</P>
      <P>In case the person reconstructs a house for his own occupation, and derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture and the rateable valuation or the aggregate of the rateable valuations of the land (if any) and buildings occupied by him does not exceed sixty pounds, two-thirds of the amount estimated by the Minister to be the cost of the works and ...</P>
      <P>No valuation limit is mentioned.  I know that local authorities who previously operated this scheme have contended that a person must be a member of the working class before he qualifies for the grant.  You also have local representatives trying to prove that a man is, in fact a member of the working class, even though he may live in a house with a rateable valuation of £30.  The house may be let to him, or he may have got it cheaply in some way or another. Dublin Corporation will not pay the grant on that house even if he does make application.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister mention some figure of valuation which would entitle a person to get even one-third of the grant?  Would the Minister consider a person who is on the approved waiting list of the local authority, even if he lives in the city, and pay him a two-thirds grant as well as the agricultural worker mentioned here?  This would encourage more people to buy and repair houses.  It would also relieve local authorities, I am sure, of many hundreds of people on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>Finally, I think Deputy Clinton has a point in the matter of inspections because I think three inspections are carried out in respect of each grant in this city.  As a measure of economy and expediency the Department and the local authority could agree to have one inspection or, at most, two, the cost to be met jointly by the two bodies.  That would speed up inspections greatly.</P>

      <P>In present circumstances where there is such a housing shortage and where so many people are living in such deplorable conditions, I welcome this section because it seems to give grants to, shall I say, bolster up existing houses and keep them so that they will provide some reasonable shelter and accommodation until the time arrives when we have sufficient houses.  I have often been <Col N="648" /> angered in my own local authority to see the council insist on demolishing a house that was reasonably good.  In some cases the sequel was that, the family had to go into a night shelter accommodation and the husband was separated from the wife and children. In those circumstances, it is deplorable that any house with a roof capable of keeping out the rain should be demolished just because somebody has decided it is unfit for human habitation.  I am glad the Minister has decided this should no longer be done and that every effort should be made speedily to improve the house to such an extent that it will provide accommodation for some ten years more until we can hope that this enormous backlog in housing needs will be wiped out and we shall not have this type of case to meet.</P>

      <P>Apropos what Deputy Clinton said, it seems to me that in the city area houses are being demolished which might reasonably be kept in repair for some little time until the present bottleneck in housing is eased.  I ask the Minister to look at that problem.  There is, I think, a panic attitude in certain sections of the corporation administration regarding housing at the moment and many houses are being condemned as dangerous which might be put into repair for a short period at least and obviate some of the terrible torment and hardship which citizens endure at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister might also explain whether this section can be made applicable to the tenants of old county council cottages.  Will the grants provided for in the section apply to the reconstruction of old county council cottages.  Some of them in County Dublin, at least, are very old&mdash;Parnell cottages, as they are known&mdash;and are in very bad repair.  Even some of the more recent ones built in our own lifetime were jerrybuilt in many parts of the county and situated in most awkward places.  They were built of inferior material and might very well be described as unfit for human habitation. In such circumstances, will the grants provided in this section be made available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the point about very old houses and cottages, if these are old vested houses and cottages, they come within the section just as ordinary houses do that have fallen into disrepair and are housing some old persons who were incapable of doing anything about them.  The council can step in and do something there.  There is nothing new in this; it is a re-enactment of what has been there since 1962.  Apart from answering Deputy Dunne, my only reason for intervening is to try to impress on Members of the House who are members of local authorities that they should use this section to a greater degree than has been the practice.  It was very slow in getting off the ground. It does not seem to be very well known throughout the country, and while the number of cases coming forward has shown a fairly substantial increase, the use made of the provisions of the 1962 Act is small.</P>
      <P>Further, the operations taking place under this section are not spread uniformly throughout the country but are accounted for to a great extent by a very few counties.  That would indicate these counties have realised the value of this provision and have used it systematically.  Some counties are using it having seen its advantages.  That should be an indicator to other counties that this would be worth doing.  I would appeal to Deputies to try to publicise this a little more than it has been publicised in their local authorities, particularly their rural local authorities, to try to get a systematic survey of these cases and a systematic approach to their elimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly all the activity we have on record at present is accounted for by the counties who have done so.  No doubt this can be very useful and can alleviate a great deal of hardship and suffering for some of our not so well-off elderly people.  At the same time, it can save the local authority a great deal of money.  By doing these limited repairs, they can enable the house to last the lifetime of the person concerned and obviate having to provide for them in an institution <Col N="650" /> at a high cost.  I will come to the House, as I did in 1962, to ask them for their fullest co-operation in getting this going.</P>

It is easier to get a scheme of 100 houses going than to get this type of improvement in the existing house, where the family have increased so much that they are almost out the windows.

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  A housing authority shall without further inspection upon receipt of a certificate from the Minister that he has made a grant under this Act, pay to a person the appropriate supplementary grant already approved by the housing authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have already made the case for this on the question of reconstruction grants.  This is where a lot of difficulty arises because of two inspections.  I am glad to be assured by the Minister that this is something that can be rectified at local level and that in fact there is nothing to prevent a local authority deciding to accept the Local Government inspection and go ahead and pay. If it were possible also to have the Department pay the two grants, with some sort of arrangement for reimbursement, rather than have all this confusion about the payment of two grants, it would be much better.  This is all in connection with the same job. It would relieve the amount of hardship on the people applying for these-grants if there could be one inspection and one payment rather than two inspections, two sets of standards and two payments.  I certainly will move in my local authority that we accept the standards prescribed by the Department, accept the inspection and pay on it, but there are all sorts of crisscross notifications involved as between the Department of Local Government, the county council and the person involved, and I would strongly recommend that the two grants be paid by the State and that the local authority then pay their portion to the State rather than to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary Estimate not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ended 31st March, 1966 for certain Miscellaneous Expenses including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that the Funds of Suitors Act, 1963, provided that up to £50,000 might be made available from unclaimed balances in the Funds of Suitors towards the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House which was destroyed by fire late in 1955.  At the same time as that Act was passed the Oireachtas agreed to the scheduling to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, of the Cork Opera House Co., in the sum of £50,000, enabling the Cork Opera House Company to negotiate a long-term bank loan for that sum.  The grant and loan, together with a loan of £25,000, from Cork Corporation and the funds raised by private subscription was thought sufficient to meet the full cost of completing the Opera House which was then estimated at £200,000.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, as in the case of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abbey Theatre, which was the subject of the last Supplementary Estimate for this Vote, the rise in building costs has made the original estimate obsolete and it is anticipated that £35,000 extra will be needed to meet the cost of completing the building. This is now at the point of completion, the opening being fixed for 31 October, <Col N="653" /> and, accordingly, the final bills will have to be met at an early date.</P>
    <P>The directors of the Cork Opera House think that there would be little hope of a fresh appeal to the public raising any significant sum, in particular in view of the fact that £82,000 has already been subscribed from private sources.  I have therefore intimated to them that I would approach the Dáil for sanction to a Supplementary Estimate to cover the shortfall and that they might, in view of this, be able to make temporary arrangements with their bankers for accommodation to meet their most pressing needs.</P>
    <P>In view of progress on the new Abbey Theatre being slower than expected, the full cost of its completion will not need to be met in the current financial year.  I have thus been able to count on a saving this year of at least £35,000 from the £290,000 already voted towards the completion of the Abbey and the vote here presented is for a token of £10 only.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has agreed to introduce legislation enabling a further draw to be made on the Funds of Suitors towards the completion of the Abbey Theatre.  This will mean that the Exchequer will be recouped any payment made from Subhead A for completion of the new Abbey Theatre.</P>

      <P>When I met the directors of the Cork Opera House earlier this year, they presented me with a bill for outstanding items due to builders, mechanical suppliers, electrical suppliers, and so on, amounting to about £35,000 and they intimated to me that this sum would require to <Col N="654" /> be paid before the opening of the Opera House could take place.  It may be that some items of this sum could be delayed for a short time but, by and large, I feel the total sum would be required by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the time the building is handed over by the suppliers to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the building has in fact already been handed over by the builders to the Opera House directors inasmuch as the Opera House is officially opening on Sunday night next.  At this stage I should like to express my personal appreciation of the excellent work done by the self-sacrificing people in Cork who associated themselves with the idea of building a new Opera House on the ruins of the old one.  On matters such as this, there is always room for disagreement.  Some thought the plans for the new Opera House were too ambitious and that a smaller, more intimate theatre would be more suited to the needs of a city of the size of population and type of hinterland Cork has, especially in present day circumstances in which the theatre, because of television and other media, is going through a lean time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in developing that argument at this stage because the Opera House is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  It is there and it will be opened on Sunday. Lest anybody might be misled by the term &ldquo;Opera House&rdquo;, I should like to explain that the new building, like the old building, will not be exclusively an arcade of culture.  It will not be a place for the performance only of operas, good plays, or anything else. The old Opera House had ordinary reviews and various other shows and I believe&mdash;I trust I am right in this&mdash; that the new Opera House will have similar shows.  I mention that to explain to the House that, if they do vote this £35,000, they cannot do it in the name of culture exclusively.  That is not a criticism of the Opera House.  It is simply a statement of fact and it is a matter this House should take into consideration when they are asked, <Col N="655" /> at a stage such as this, to give&mdash;it would appear from the Minister's speech as a matter of urgency&mdash;to a cause such as the Cork Opera House a sum of £35,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that this was to meet commitments which had been entered into by the Opera House directors.  If this £35,000 is not immediately given to the Cork Opera House, it does not mean the edifice will fall down.  It is there and nothing can be done to it.  It will be opened on Sunday night next and the directors are in no worse condition than many of my constituents who entered into commitments with builders for a humble thing like a dwellinghouse and were unable to get the money to build that house.  I refer the Minister to the fact that Cork Corporation are in even sorrier straits than the directors of the Cork Opera House in relation to the immediate procurement of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out, without making any suggestion that this money should be spent otherwise, that there are people in Cork who have gone to Cork County Council looking for paying orders which are there and they have been told that they cannot get the paying orders, for what reason I do not know.  These people are just as badly off as are the people for whom the £35,000 is being requested.  They are in exactly the same situation.  Deputy Casey, who is in the House, must share my view that there are in Cork, without particularising, many matters which require the urgent attention of this House but the same sense of urgency in regard to them has not been shown by the Minister or by his colleague, the Minister for Local Government.  I object on these grounds to the proposal of the Minister to get £35,000 for the Cork Opera House.  The point of my argument has been largely taken from me by your ruling.  I feel sure, however, that it will be appreciated not alone in Cork but up and down the country where people are meeting the difficulties to which I intended to refer prior to your ruling.  I take it I am in order in referring to the White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure which was laid on the Table&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not in order in referring to the White Paper.  The Deputy is in order only if relating his remarks to the relevent subheads of the Estimate. That has been the practice in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the Government <Col N="658" /> issue a White Paper counselling the nation on certain matters and if the Minister comes in here with a proposal which would appear to run completely counter to the counsel contained in the White Paper, I am entitled to point out that there seems to be some discrepancy between what the Government say in the White Paper and what the Minister says now in relation to his request for £35,000 for the completion of a theatre in Cork city.  I would ask your permission to continue along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not continue along those lines.  The Deputy may refer to the Estimate and the various subheads. Anything else would be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way? It is a truncated argument but I suggest that it will surprise many people that at a time like the present the Minister should come to the House looking for the sum in question as a matter of supreme urgency, because these are times when money cannot be spent unless it is a matter of supreme urgency.  Members of local bodies, including members of Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, know that, because it is drummed into them time and again by the Department of Local Government and, no doubt, at the behest of the Minister who asks us today for this £35,000 as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other times and in other circumstances, I might adopt a different view of the Minister's request, although I do not believe the building of a theatre of the size and with the equipment of the Opera House in Cork was, at any stage a wise venture.  From what the Minister tells us, it will cost £250,000 by the time we are finished. The volume of public support for the project can be judged from the fact that £82,000 was subscribed by the public.  The Minister will recall that that £82,000 subscribed by the public was not by any means an expression of wild enthusiasm by the man in the street or woman in the household in Cork for the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House.  It was subscribed mainly in large sums by big organisations. <Col N="659" /> Some of them tried to outbid their competitors in generosity in their donations.  I think there was a need for an Opera House but I do not think there is a need for the type of building which compels the Minister to ask us at this stage for £35,000 extra.</P>
    <P>The matter which is of some concern to me as a member of Cork Corporation is this: I take it that this sum has not to be repaid to the Department at any stage, and if for any reason the Opera House should be sold to anybody, that the Minister does not intend that the claims of the Government in respect of this sum of £35,000 would antecede the claims of Cork Corporation in respect of a loan which they gave to the Cork Opera House Company before the Minister's proposal was made.  It would be inequitable that the Government should come in at any stage and make a claim which they would say was anterior in priority to the sum of £25,000 which the Cork Corporation granted some years ago on the basis that they were dealing with the financial commitments of the Opera House Company, as it then was.</P>
    <P>Speaking of priorities, I would conclude by saying that in this matter the Minister has got his priorities mixed up.  When people are in urgent need of housing, drainage, and various other matters of that nature, first things should come first.  The Minister's priority would appear to be the Cork Opera House.  He is entitled to his view, I to my view and every Deputy in the House to his own view, as the man in the street is entitled to his view.  I believe that the average man in Cork will be rather surprised that the Minister at this stage should select this matter out of the urgent problems awaiting monetary solution in Cork city and that this should take precedence in the Minister's mind and in the minds of those in the front and back benches of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this motion by the Minister in regard to the Cork Opera House.  Anybody who has his fingers on the pulse of the people in Cork would express the same <Col N="660" /> opinion.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has met this request from the directors of the Cork Opera House and also for the part he has played over the years since the effort to rebuild the Opera House began.  The Minister, both as Minister and as a Corkman, gave every assistance, and as one closely associated with the work on the Cork Opera House, I should like to express that opinion and put it on record. Quite obviously, you could not have got the voluntary effort of the ordinary people in Cork unless they wanted to rebuild the Opera House.  When I hear the question asked: &ldquo;What will the man in the street say?&rdquo;, I know, as many of us know, what he will think because we have seen ordinary people going from door to door collecting six-pences, shillings and half-crowns and contributing their own pounds when they could hardly afford it.  That work was continued for eight or nine years and we have seen people running bazaars and dances and forming parish committees in order to raise funds and we have seen them going out on bleak, cold days to run flag days.</P>
      <P>In that way, and with subscriptions we received from business houses, the local contribution came to £82,000.  I do not know of any other project, charitable or otherwise, for which you could have raised £82,000 by voluntary subscription.  The Government after tremendous pressure indicated that they were prepared to give us the first subvention that was necessary.  Then the directors of the Cork Opera House had to go to Cork Corporation, where there are 21 hard-headed men, and look for a loan of £25,000.  Some of the arguments we have heard here today were the very same arguments we heard in the Cork Corporation at a time when there was no talk of the credit squeeze or of a shortage of money for housing.  The arguments trotted out today by Deputy Barrett were in the main the same as he trotted out at the meeting of the Cork Corporation at which we had to decide on the £25,000 and his colleagues, including members of his Party, did not subscribe to his views.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that I thought that the £25,000, if given, should be given with the fullest possible safeguards that could be adopted by the corporation.  Deputy Casey will remember that I was Lord Mayor at the time and we went through a legal document which provided the fullest safeguards for the corporation, and that I was in favour of giving the £25,000 to the Opera House committee, once these legal safeguards had been made available.  Deputy Casey will agree that I did not in any way obstruct the giving of the £25,000, once it had been decided to give it, and that I gave every assistance to ensure that the corporation's rights would be properly safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat: the arguments we heard at the corporation when this loan of £25,000 to the company was under discussion, were in the main the same as we have heard here from Deputy Barrett today.  This reference to the man in the street not wanting it is completely wrong, as has been proved by the voluntary efforts made by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Barrett but if he wants to interrupt me, he will find that I am a fairly good mixer in that regard too. Anybody who knows anything about the feelings of the people in Cork must know that if this request for this further £35,000 to complete the Opera House had been made and if the Government had refused it, there would have been a furore in Cork next week or the week afterwards.  As the Minister explained, the cost of building did rise steeply since this whole thing was planned.  I have no doubt that the people in Cork will applaud the Government for making possible the completion of the Opera <Col N="662" /> House which we are happily opening next Sunday night.  I hope Deputy Barrett will be there to join with the Minister and myself in welcoming our magnificent new Opera House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with Deputy Casey in saying how grateful I am to the Government and to the Minister for making this sum available and for ensuring that the building which has now been completed in Cork at tremendous sacrifice to the ordinary people will not be allowed to stand idle for a number of years as a monument to some kind of restriction on the part of those who could make available the money necessary to open it. I am sorry indeed that it was a Corkman who had to put on record that the people of Cork did not in the main subscribe to the building of this house and that it was done through individual subscriptions of big firms.  That is a completely false picture to paint. You will find that never in any part of the country did so many individuals subscribe towards the building of any single edifice as they have done in Cork.  That is the main reason why in Cork, and indeed elsewhere, we should be proud of the fact that the Opera House has been rebuilt.  It should be an example to people in other parts not to stand by when some tragedy or catastrophe befalls them and wait until such time as the Government or some body come to rebuild for them.  I would not stand here today, and I would not have stood in the corporation, to ask for a single penny to be subscribed, were it not for the fact that the citizens did more than their share in subscribing.  The figure of £80,000 at any time represents a lot of money to collect.  I agree with Deputy Casey also that we have heard in the main most of Deputy Barrett's arguments against the rebuilding on a previous occasion, at least once, if not more often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the size of the theatre and the future of the theatre, I want to say that in Cork we think we have <Col N="663" /> a very proud tradition in culture, the drama, opera and ballet, and all the other arts, and this is somewhere in which these media can be presented to the people of the city, and to visitors to the city.  Certainly I believe that 80 per cent of the people of Cork felt that there was a tremendous void in the city without that theatre.  Of course we know that the Opera House, as an opera house, will only have an opera season once or twice a year.  Generally speaking, it is a theatre, but, as I say, we have had a tremendous tradition down there and I have no doubt this Vote of £35,000 can be regarded as a vote of confidence in the future of Cork, and in the love the people of Cork have for things theatrical in whatever medium they are presented.  I again want to express on behalf of myself and those whom I represent our gratitude to the Government and the Minister for making this available and for making next Sunday's opening possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absolutely astounded listening to Deputy Barrett to think that he as a Corkman and, indeed, as a member of Cork Corporation, would stand up in Dáil Éireann and oppose the granting of £35,000 for the completion of the Cork Opera House, especially when he himself so very nearly became a director of the Opera House.  However, Deputy Barrett is quite entitled to his view and I am sure he thinks he is acting in the interests of the people of Cork.  I was one of the people who witnessed the burning of the old Cork Opera House. I know the sadness which everyone felt in Cork when it was burned, tragically as far as we are concerned, and I am delighted at the attitude of the Government in wanting to give to Cork the tradition they had before this burning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, some of my happiest and fondest memories are of being in the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; in the Opera House and having a sing-song before the show came on.  Indeed, on some occasions the talent in the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; was as good as the talent on the stage, but that did not matter.  It was a get-together and we all enjoyed it very much.  I am also proud of the efforts which were made <Col N="664" /> by the ordinary man in the street in Cork going around from house to house on bad nights to collect six-pences and shillings, as Deputy Casey said.  That was no mean feat, and it reflected the type of metal of which the Cork people are made.  We set an example to the rest of the country by going out and doing the work for ourselves. I have lived in Dublin for a considerable length of time and I have often heard people say: &ldquo;Why could we not do something like that in Dublin for the Abbey?  If they could do it in Cork, surely we could do it in Dublin.&rdquo;  We have shown in Cork that when you have the man in the street behind you, you can set out and achieve almost anything.  I am delighted to be standing here today in Dáil Éireann and thanking the Minister for making this effort on behalf of the people of Cork by granting this £35,000.</P>

As Deputy Casey said, men, women and children subscribed to this work, going from door to door to ensure the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House.  As public representatives, we are playing our part in expressing our thanks to a Corkman who brought to a successful conclusion many years of hard work in our own city of Cork.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his stand in this matter. If cultural activity in the south has to be kept alive by a financial injection, then by all means it should get it.  The Opera House in Cork will afford an opportunity to the people in the provinces of having readily accessible the facilities which are enjoyed by a limited few in the metropolis of Dublin. <Col N="665" /> I applaud the Minister and I applaud everyone connected with the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House and with the filling of a void which was long overdue to be filled, so that talented people in the south will have an opportunity of performing under ideal conditions, and audiences will be able to enjoy the cultural values of opera with very little inconvenience to themselves. When the wailings of the Jonahs of the Fine Gael Party are long forgotten, the Cork Opera House will still stand as a monument to the beliefs and hopes and integrity of the Minister and the committee who have established this Opera House.</P>

This House, I sometimes think, is going mad.  I am entitled, I respectfully submit, to call the attention of this House to the feelings of the ordinary people whom we are here charged to represent.  It may be clear to us who are dealing in hundreds of millions that £35,000 is a trivial sum but I ask ordinary Deputies to consider the reaction of a man and woman with a family living in one room who cannot get a house and have no prospect of getting a house on hearing that here in Dáil Éireann for 2½ hours we have spent our time pouring unctuous praise upon the senior Deputy for Cork city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I warn Dáil Éireann that the time is coming to pause.  We are slowly drifting from one folly to another.  We have settled institutions in this country, thanks be to God, but we have them because our people have always hitherto believed that, whether they agree or disagree with the majority, the people were doing the best they could according to their lights.  I do not believe that Deputy Healy misunderstands me when I put it to him that, from the point of view of the individual who is suffering acute hardship at the present moment, there must be a sense of frustration and exasperation that money can be made available for a project of this character when it is not available for the relief of his personal distress.  Now, multiply it by 40,000 families up and down the country and think of the ferment which you are starting in our society. I ask any Deputy of the Labour Party or of the Fianna Fáil Party if he would not have sympathy with an ordinary person who feels that intense sense of exasperation.</P>

Surely, as Deputy Dillon says, we must have some sort of priority arrangement which will eliminate this sort of thing.  In spite of the fact that all of us feel that Cork should have its Opera House and want to see Cork getting its Opera House, <Col N="673" /> we certainly consider it should not come at a time when the building of all local authority houses has been suspended or stopped for want of money.

Deputy Barrett and Deputy Dillon know in their heart of hearts that there is no relevance in the case they made about housing and the sum sought here for Cork Opera House.

      <P>Speaking of priorities, in October, 1963, this House voted in favour of making provision such as this for the rebuilding of Cork Opera House and it is perfectly consistent with the unanimous decision of the House then that we should fulfil our undertaking and finish the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sum of money comes from what every Deputy knows are Funds of Suitors which were made available for purposes such as this, and only purposes such as this, by Act of the Oireachtas.  It is a small sum which accumulates by way of small amounts from month to month and year to year.  It is in no way suitable for purposes other than those of a once-for-all <Col N="674" /> type like this involving limited expenditure. It could not in any way be applied for such general purposes as housing or roadmaking.  The moneys originally provided were committed as far back as over two years ago when the rebuilding of the Opera House had commenced.</P>
    <P>I had been informed by the committee&mdash;it is hardly right to call it a company, even though it must be a company to conform with the Act, because the individual members of Cork Opera House Company will never see a penny piece as a result of their contribution and their work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad of that. However, the remark was made and naturally I have to comment on it.  I am glad the Deputy is withdrawing it.  On the general merits of the proposition and the extent to which the ordinary people of Cork felt about, and subscribed their own money for, the rebuilding of Cork Opera House, I can say I was present at the burning of the old Opera House.  I stood in the rain on the steps of the Dominican Church on Pope's Quay with poor people who came from the surrounding area and out to Gurranebraher.  I saw tears pouring from the eyes of old and young who regarded the <Col N="675" /> Opera House, not as a centre of culture but as something that was part of their very lives.</P>
      <P>I realised how they could feel that because I regarded the Cork Opera House as an essential part of life.  I had joined the boys in the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; and sung with them.  I deplore any suggestion that the ordinary people of Cork are not interested in Cork Opera House and in whatever moneys the Government can supply for the completion of the job.  The ordinary poor people of Cork had been going to the Opera House, to the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; and to the pit and supporting in a generous way the many local societies that put on presentations there.  I believe, and it has been proved by the contributions of these poor people, that they, to this very day, wish the Opera House to be opened on Sunday as is proposed and I am informed by the company who manage the affairs of the Opera House that if this money were not forthcoming, the opening would not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that could not be the case because they have not got the money yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is usually well able to marshal facts when he has them and when they are available, he is usually able to absorb them, but I told the Deputy in my opening speech that I informed the Cork Opera House Company that I would move the Supplementary Estimate and I gave them a letter to that effect so that they could in the meantime go to their bankers and get temporary accommodation which I understand they did in order to pay off the outstanding sum.  I mentioned that in my opening remarks.  Therefore, the Deputy's observation is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into any more detail about this but merely to say that I am gratified by the contributions made by the Members of my own side of the House, and in particular the contribution by Deputy Casey.  I am not putting myself forward as a patron <Col N="676" /> of the Arts as Deputy Dillon says. Indeed I am not; I am far from that; I could well be described as a Philistine but I do like stage performances, whether dramatic or musical.  I have no desire to cloak myself with such a description and no desire to purchase popularity, but I am certainly glad and proud as a Corkman that this has been possible and glad I was able, in my own way, to make some contribution administratively.</P>
    <P>It could very well be suggested, and Deputy Dillon seemed to imply, that this being in the heart of my constituency and I being a Minister from Cork, facilitated the provision that this House made for rebuilding Cork Opera House, but having regard to the wonderful effort by the people of Cork, I believe that any Government would have been impressed and glad to endorse the action of the people of Cork by helping in the cost of such a venture, if only as an example to similar facilities in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The action of the Cork people has been further endorsed by the gracious acceptance by the President of the invitation to perform the official opening. Not only will people now living in Cork be grateful that this has been possible, but future generations of Cork people who have always been known for their traditional love of music and theatre generally will also be grateful for it.  I repeat that I want to claim no personal credit for this but I am glad I have been able to play some small part in it.  I believe that in making this provision, I am not upsetting in any way existing priorities. I know what priorities are and they are as dear to me as to Deputy Dillon and Deputy Barrett, but there has been a sequence of events here, and when the Act was originally passed, there was not the same pressure on capital funds as there is now.  In any event, the capital funds which are devoted for the other purposes have no relevance to the funds of suitors out of which this sum will be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with this question of two inspections and two standards.  I take it from what the Minister said when we were discussing this previously that a local authority is at liberty, if it so wishes, to accept the inspection of the Local Government inspector and pay on that without any further inspection.  If that is so, what is intended in this amendment is already permissible.  I certainly will ask my local authority, Dublin County Council, to ensure that this is done and that this unnecessary second inspection, which causes so much upset and disturbance to people, will be waived in future.  Could the Minister <Col N="678" /> assure me that we are at liberty to do that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law stands at the moment, the Deputy's local authority are quite at liberty to do that. They can waive the inspection and accept the Local Government certificate in lieu thereof.  If they have reason to believe at any time they should not do so, they are still perfectly free to change their mind; but if these amendments were inserted, they would not have the option in the future.  At present they are perfectly free to do what the Deputy seeks by amendment to make them do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair, the inspection could have to do with the enforcement of building bye-laws and might have a bearing on whether or not the local authority should pay the supplementary grant.  I am not saying it should be done but that is a reason it might be done.  The difference in approach could be for such a reason rather than merely because the finish, the input of material or workmanship was not satisfactory.  I am merely suggesting this could be the cause rather than two technical people differing as to what was satisfactory or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything must be cleared before the Department authorises a grant.  That is what happens in my county and, I assume, everywhere else.  The Minister says there is no appeal from a decision.  If <Col N="679" /> there is no appeal, a person who gets caught between an extra officious local official and the Minister's inspector who has passed a house could be held up for an indefinite period.</P>

The Department's standards are not considered good enough or high enough and the local authority will not pay.  It seems ridiculous to a person getting grants that the Department should consider the job good enough while the local authority does not.  If we could get something done by way of notice of motion in the county councils, it might be possible to cover the position in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not quite clear about the intention behind the amendments.  Deputy Ryan may have in mind that, when we reach the limit at which a supplementary grant is paid, if a man is £1 over that, then he gets nothing.  It may be the intention <Col N="681" /> of these amendments that we could go a step further and, where a man is £50 over, he would get some grant, not the full grant but a reduced grant.  We are paying up to the maximum on a graded scale.  It may be that Deputy Ryan wants in future grants paid on a graded scale instead of just cutting a man off arbitrarily at a certain point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Clinton says is correct, though I was not primarily thinking of an increase over the permitted maximum because, if I were to recommend that, the Chair would immediately rule me out.  I am concerned, however, about the situation in Dublin where either one qualifies for a supplementary grant or one does not.  A man's income could be £1 over the limit and he would therefore be deprived of the total amount of the supplementary grant.  I hold the grant should be on a sliding scale.  If a man's income exceeds the permitted limit by £50, then the grant should be reduced <i>pro rata</i>, thereby avoiding the complete cutting off from benefit by having, as there is now, one grant and one limit.  It may be argued that this introduces a means test.  Perhaps it does, but it is a means test in reverse. By measuring means, one might be able to give some assistance, thereby avoiding the present unhelpful situation in which a person who is a small amount over the permitted limit loses all benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the estate duty code, there is a system whereby a person is allowed to go to a certain point above a particular scale before the increased rate of duty applies.  The same system should operate here.  I gather Dublin County Council, and perhaps other local authorities, have a sliding scale operating.  The view is held in Dublin that existing legislation does not allow local authorities to have grants of varying amounts and the purpose of my amendment is to state clearly in this Bill what appears now to be doubtful in the minds of some.  The Minister has stated on some other section what he understood to be the true legal position, but he has conceded that some law agents to local authorities have held a contrary view and we know that senior counsel have, in <Col N="682" /> some cases, held views contrary to those of the Minister and his advisers. It is to put beyond any doubt the right of local authorities to have a means test and to give grants varying according to the incomes of the applicants that I tabled this and the other amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The most extraordinary argument I have heard for some time is the reasoning behind these amendments.  Will Deputy Ryan explain to me how this will help those who at present qualify for the maximum grant?  If the grant is graded down, what use will it be to the fellow who is just £1 over the limit?  What advantage will there be for the man who is £1 under the limit if he gets a reduced grant instead of the maximum grant.  That is what he will get if this amendment is carried.  I should dearly love to have this explained more fully.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, existing legislation allows a local authority to give a supplementary grant to people with an income of a certain amount and to grade that supplementary grant, if they want to.  The amount is a matter for decision by the local authority.  I should be with Deputy Ryan if the suggestion were that, from the maximum up, those receiving no grant now might receive a lower grant until we reach the point at which it would disappear altogether.  I could not in any circumstances agree that it would be any use at all to the people who were £1 over the grant if we graded it down. It reminds me of the old fellow whose cattle were carried away in the flood in a valley; he was terribly unhappy until he heard that his neighbour's cattle were also carried away, when he said: &ldquo;Things are not so bad at all.&rdquo;  That seems to be the attitude behind this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully is right in saying the permission is there to meet the grant up to the maximum but, as he says, while it is possible to grade the grant up to the maximum, it has been operated by some county councils, including my own, against the applicant. The local authorities have power to <Col N="683" /> reduce the grant according to income but certainly I would support the idea that over and above the income limit, the axe should not drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>A person might have £1 more than the maximum income. The Minister might readily say we must stop somewhere, and I agree we must.  However, it is the cause of much disappointment and dissatisfaction if a very small increase in income deprives an applicant totally.  If it meant he would only be deprived partially of a grant until he reached a further income, that would be worth implementing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To dispel any doubts may I say that, having a generous disposition myself, the miserable and limiting interpretation which some Deputies have put on my amendment never entered into my mind.  A person of mean disposition might avail of the amendment to reduce the amount of the supplementary grant, but I would consider it unreasonable to allow the axe to fall as soon as the person moves one penny above the permitted income. If the axe is to come down, I want it to come down very gently and softly so that it will not make a mark or cause any pain.  I simply want a situation that if a person exceeds the permitted income limit by a small amount, he will not lose the full supplementary grant but only a portion thereof, that as he exceeds the permitted limit by a certain amount, the amount of his grant will decline on a scale somewhat equivalent to the degree to which his income exceeds the permitted limit.  That is the only purpose of the amendment.  I believe it is a humanitarian and beneficial way to approach the problem and I urge the Minister to put the matter right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to have this dealt with even by somebody with as generous a disposition as Deputy Ryan, surely it would be necessary, first of all, to make arrangements that <Col N="684" /> there will be an increase in the income limit.  The income limit is laid down and no attempt is being made to interfere with that.  Therefore, if we are referring to any amendment, it must be within the existing income limit and, in fact, these amendments refer to grants payable within the income limit as already laid down.  I want to repeat that I am opposed entirely to what the amendments mean, not to what Deputy Ryan's generous disposition intended them to mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will concede that if I tabled the amendment in the form he now suggests I should, it would have been ruled out of order and we would not have had any discussion at all on the merits of the proposal?</P>

      <P>That is one way of getting discussion on something we are not allowed to discuss.  However, talking about Deputy Ryan's sweet disposition, the sweet way out of this, if a person who wishes to apply for a grant has an income of £1,046, the income limit being £1,045, is for that person to get himself a wife and then he moves on to the income limit of £1,145.  If he has £1,146 he might add a child to the family and he then goes on to £1,245; if he has two children, the limit is £1,345 and if he has three children, it goes to £1,445.  After that there is nothing I can suggest that would help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is natural that we should oppose this amendment, because, as we have said already, the Minister was less than generous in the restrictive effect of this legislation.  I have said that this Housing Bill has been heralded for so long and been discussed at such length that people were not entitled to get the impression that it would have a restrictive effect. In view of the fact that 1964 is the date that has been inserted in the Bill and that whoever was drafting the Bill felt, too, that it should be 1964, I appeal to the Minister to stick to his guns and leave it 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong when he says those who drafted this thought as he does, that it should read 1964.  What follows in the Bill indicates that it would make no sense if we left 1964, for the reason that what it governs does not operate until 1965, that is, the following subparagraphs (a) and (b) in page 23 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spiked my guns by saying this refers to two distinct paragraphs, that it would not make sense otherwise, but we must remember that certain sections of this Bill still refer to 1st October, 1963, and I think the Minister would have been much better off if he had left it 1st October, 1963.  The <Col N="686" /> fact that it does not make sense here does not matter because if something can be done for the purpose of getting the grant under the Act it could not be done two years ago if there is no notification about it until now.  The Minister would be quite safe even in leaving it 1964, though I personally think it should be 1st October, 1963, for the whole lot and that it would not do any harm to the meaning of the section or the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not quite as confusing as it is being made out to be by the Deputy.  We must go back to 1963 and realise that at the time when we indicated that legislation would be forthcoming to justify, as from 1st October, 1963, the payment of these new higher grants to the special classes named, the land valuation, for instance, obtaining at the time had a £50 limit.  Beyond that you could not go and nobody did go beyond it, nor had we any intention of going beyond it at that time.  Likewise, in relation to other groups of people, income levels were different from what they were last July.  What I said was: &ldquo;All right; we will have the beneficial effects starting after October, 1963, but governed by the conditions that generally governed all other grants of that time,&rdquo; and up to last July when we introduced the Bill changing upwards the valuation from £50 to £60, and the adjustments down the scale together with the income limits for supplementary grants. This is really the cause of this and not any fiddling around with dates and figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the proper time to adjust the rates the time when this occurred on a reasonably big scale, which was from 1st January, 1964, when in most cases there were the ninth round wage increases?  If the Minister left 1st October, 1963, he would be as near as mattered to the actual time.  In addition, there is the fact that the turnover tax was being introduced in or around 1st October, 1963.  The Minister will find that 1st October, 1963, is far more relevant to most sections.  I think that he will <Col N="687" /> agree with me that it would be far more reasonable to say 1st October, 1963, and let people have the benefit of this.</P>

They were not told that until 30th June this year.  To do what is suggested by the Deputy would be going back and would mean having to find out who had built and might have got more if they had waited and then give it to them, all the time remembering that our intention is to give encouragement to those who have not started.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 24 between lines 7 and 8, to insert two new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) A housing authority may, in lieu of making a supplementary grant, make an annual contribution towards the annual loan charges (if any) incurred by a person providing a house.</P>
      <P>(11) This section shall come into operation on the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things we have been hearing in this House and outside it, over a period, is in relation to the fact that when a supplementary grant is given, it very often occurs that the builder is the person who gets hold of it.  That <Col N="689" /> does not apply in every case but according to my information, it is quite common around Dublin city and in other parts of the country.  It does not happen in the area I represent but I feel that the way to counteract this is simply to make the contribution towards the loan charges.  This would mean that one of the big problems facing people owning their own houses, the finding of money to pay the loan charge, could possibly be dealt with and the cost of borrowed money for house purchases and house erection could be reduced very much. The idea behind this should be considered by the Minister.  I am aware that in some countries this system is adopted to assist people to build their own houses.  In some countries grants are not payable at all but loan charges are subsidised, and the full amount of a loan necessary for house building is made available to people who want to build their own houses.  I should like the Minister to comment on this to see what his view is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be completely in favour of this amendment if it were additional to the supplementary grants which can be paid already, but I am very much afraid it would operate to widen the gap again between the amounts provided by way of loan and grants and the amount required to purchase the house, and that it would operate against many people being able to purchase their own houses.  If it had the effect which Deputy Tully expects it to have, of taking something away from the builder that perhaps he should not get, especially in cases where he is making an undue profit, I would be in favour of it, but I am afraid it would not operate in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for a reduction of the service charges on the debt, more especially when a house is purchased by a newly-married couple, because when the family comes later, the weekly outgoings very often are a nearly unbearable burden.  If this could be operated in the way suggested by Deputy Tully, it would do a lot of good for these people, but unfortunately I cannot see it having the effects we all want to see, that is, that the supplementary grant will not <Col N="690" /> automatically be passed on to the builder and be added to his profit which it is felt is already high enough, if not too high.  I should like to see it as the Deputy sees it but I am afraid I cannot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the intention of this amendment is that in respect of a grant of £150, this grant would be reimbursed by way of reduced annual repayments on the loan.  Let us assume that a person needs £1,000 to do a job and he is entitled to a grant of £150.  As I see it, what would happen under this amendment is that the person would really repay £850.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will settle for £850 or £1,000, I am with him.  In fact, if the figure were £1,400, he would repay about £2,300, with interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking £1,000 as a nice even figure.  I am taking £150 as another even figure, and asking am I right in saying the intention is that having borrowed £1,000, the amount is abated forthwith by the amount of the supplementary grant.  No?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the borrower borrows a certain sum of money, the repayments on that sum are one problem and the repayments of the interest on that sum are another problem.  The result is that a person who borrows £1,400 will find that over a period of 35 years, he will repay £2,300.  The suggestion is that the supplementary grant should be used for the purpose of reducing the interest rate on the money, and therefore reducing the amount of the repayments. The Rules of Order of the House will not allow me to propose interest-free loans because they would be a charge on the Exchequer, so I am putting something into the Minister's mind and having it discussed by using the only means I can, the supplementary grant.  If we keep to the supplementary grant, we cannot be ruled out of order.  If the Minister decides to introduce a further amendment to wipe out all except the ordinary service charge on loans, he will get the full <Col N="691" /> support of the House, I am sure.  We think an effort should be made to alleviate the crippling repayments which the unfortunate person who borrows money to build a house finds he has to make over a long period. This is one way in which this can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that this is completely out of the question so far as this Bill and this section are concerned.  I could point out that an excellent scheme is operated by Cork Corporation, a scheme of subsidised loan rates related to income levels and so on which I believe is working extremely well.  I am not sure but I think it is two or three per cent. Actually, the interest rate is abated according to the income of the recipient of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is never enough money available.  Even before the credit squeeze was ever mentioned, only a limited amount of money was made available.  The Minister is aware of that even in Cork or Donegal or anywhere else.  We tried to borrow some money in Meath but it represented only a percentage of what we needed, with the result that we could not afford to borrow this money and at the same time continue paying supplementary grants.  We are suggesting that this is one way to get around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy Tully to further clarify the position.  Is the Deputy not, in fact, sowing other seeds in the Minister's mind?  Is he not asking the Minister to subsidise from <Col N="692" /> the State the servicing of the debt incurred in borrowing money for the purchase of houses?  I think he is asking for a State subsidy towards the cost of servicing the debt incurred in borrowing money to purchase houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the least of what he appears to be asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as appears from what the Minister said, the local authorities are at liberty to do this, I think Deputy Tully is looking for something in addition to the £ for £ contribution from the State towards a subsidy on loan charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before there was any mention of a credit squeeze, there was a limitation on the amount of money available for these subsidy operations. I do not know how that arose unless there was confusion about those outside the SDA classes.  There is no limit within SDA classes, either upwards or downwards.  The amount of interest may be charged by the local authorities in their business.  They can charge over or under the rate and we do not interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that the reason I mentioned the supplementary grants was to remain within the Rules of Order.  I think the Minister appreciates the fact that it would be pretty difficult to supplement the loan charges on the scale necessary in some housing areas.  In other words, everyone who would come within a certain income limit could have his loan charges supplemented by a payment from the local authority, and even the £300 for the supplementary grant represented as a loan charge over a period of 35 years would not go anywhere near what would need to be done.  I am suggesting that the Minister might consider this proposal worth putting in as a special section in the Bill.  I put down the amendment for the purpose of having it discussed.  We have discussed it now, and if the Minister is prepared to consider it, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Through some confusion, I am sure on my part, an amendment in the name of Deputy Ryan, who was not here at the time, was not moved.  It sought to have certain restrictions removed in relation to dependants.  The section allows four dependants to be taken into consideration, and only four.  It stops there. I feel that what is in Deputy Ryan's mind is that if we are prepared to pay £100 for dependants up to four, why do we not continue to pay this £100 if there are more dependants?  If dependants up to the number of four cost £100 each&mdash;and this is accepted by the Minister&mdash;surely they do not cost less from then on.  I shall leave it to Deputy Ryan to deal with this aspect of the amendment which, through confusion on my part, was not moved at the right time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can add much to the well-stated case by Deputy Clinton.  Being a member of a large family myself, I can never understand why people are envious of any allowances or other benefits made <Col N="694" /> available to large families by reason of the numbers in them.  During the war, when we had rationing, neighbours used to speak enviously about the large amount of tea and other commodities going into any house on our road that had a large family.  They did not seem to have regard to the additional expenditure involved and to the extra mouths that had to be fed.</P>
      <P>In this country, where we always pride ourselves on the size of our families, we are appearing to impose a restriction.  It is in the case of the larger families that the accommodation is required.  Most of the units of modern accommodation, I am afraid, are not designed to house them in comfort.  The cost of adding the accommodation is, in many cases, prohibitive.</P>
      <P>The effect of limiting the benefit here is to deprive the larger family and those in greatest need of the additional help which they require.  Consider the initial basic cost of one room, whether the room be small or large.  A certain portion of the price of the additional accommodation will basically be the same whether you are adding a room 10' × 10' or 20' × 10'.  It seems undesirable and wrong that we should impose a limit on the benefit which we will confer and base it upon the size of a small family.  We should continue these benefits where there are larger families.  It will not cost the State very much to continue benefit according to the necessity of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Minister in mind that somebody who was up to an income of £1,440 should not require any further supplementary grant?  Was that the reason why this limit was imposed?  I am aware, as is everybody in the House, that it is a very much more generous interpretation of this measure than the previous Act laid down for a supplementary grant.  Before this, if anybody had over £840, whether he had one child or 20 children, he could not get the supplementary grant.  Above £840, they got nothing at all.  Possibly that might be the idea why it has now been decided to raise it to a maximum of <Col N="695" /> £1,440 which is a big change.  It should not be limited at that.  Even if the amount per child or dependant is reduced after that, it should be possible to give some allowance over that.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Clinton, the person who was to move an amendment here on this section unfortunately did not do so and I should like to explain what we were trying to do.  The section itself reads that &ldquo;where a relevant grant is made by the Minister or the Minister for the Gaeltacht, as the case may be ... the housing authority may make a supplementary grant ...&rdquo; We feel that a lot of unnecessary annoyance is caused to people building houses because of the fact that they cannot get any payment from the local authority or any supplementary grant or portion of a supplementary grant from the local authority until the grant by the Minister for Local Government is available and approval is sent to the local authority We can see no reason why the Minister should not have included in it that, when the grant was approved, if the local authority thought fit they could give portion of the supplementary grant to assist people of limited means to bring their house to the stage at which it would qualify for the full State grant.  Perhaps the Minister might consider this before Report Stage.  It affected a lot of people, particularly in the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>Last night, I asked the Minister when he was asked to define &ldquo;body&rdquo; if a health committee of a local authority qualified for such grant and the Minister was very emphatic in saying it did not.  He said that a body should be a charitable organisation or a committee of a local authority consisting of members of a local authority, some members or all members.  At the time, I let it slip.  Why was the Minister emphatic that a health committee, who might be the entire local authority or a committee consisting of members of it, would not qualify while another type of committee set up by the local authority would, according to the Minister, qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that the Deputy should raise this matter again because I, too, thought about it later and wondered why Deputy Tully should interject about a health committee when I was talking about a body or a group.  At that point, the Deputy mentioned a health committee. From the way he said it, I thought the Deputy did not think much of health committees and that there was some gag about it.  I now understand why he asked the question.  There is no reason why any body such as a health committee or other committee <Col N="697" /> that might get itself together or is already an entity should not qualify for these grants if they are of a philanthropic nature.</P>
      <P>Take a health committee made up of a large mixture of outside people and councillors.  This is the type of committee I believe could do the job, where there are no other bodies in addition, and where none of your voluntary bodies or charitable organisations might be making any move. At the worst we could even appoint people on behalf of ourselves, through the membership or some agency of the county council, who would have the advantage and the knowledge of the facilities available to them as councillors and could more readily get the thing going than those you might select outside.  That is what I had in mind.  I misunderstood Deputy Tully at the time.  I did not intend that health authorities were not the people who should do this.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) A housing authority may impose in relation to the making of a supplementary grant under this section such conditions as they think fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment and nothing more.  I should say, in explanation that section 29, subsection (3), provides that reconstruction grants may be confined to certain classes of persons reconstructing houses of particular types, etc., if the housing authority think fit.  Under the amendment it will be provided simply that &ldquo;a housing authority may impose in relation to the making of a supplementary grant under the section such conditions as they think fit&rdquo;.  I should add also that the amendment will bring the section into conformity with section 26, subsection (4) on the making of supplementary grants for new houses. It is really a relaxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have quite a time on that yet.  The amendment says:</P>
      <P>A housing authority may impose in relation to the making of a supplementary grant under this section such conditions as they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister explain to me how that is a relaxation of the existing terms upon which a supplementary grant may be made?  I should like to know, because at the present time a supplementary grant is made, if everything is OK from the State end.  Now we are allowing the local authority to come in and decide that there are certain things which are not mentioned at all until the job is complete.  Do not forget that the question of the paying of a supplementary grant will not arise until the complete job has been done. Then the local authority might step in and say: &ldquo;Oh, well; we meant you to have a window with four panes and you have only two and you were supposed to have a wooden floor here from a certain type of timber and now you must have something else.&rdquo;  The Minister may think this is going a little too far but, from experience, most of us know how far this can go.  I think the Minister should be very careful about handing over authority, not, <Col N="700" /> mind you, to the elected representatives of the council but to one of the officials, again, who will decide what terms should be laid down before a supplementary grant is paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Deputy Tully points out is quite correct, but I think there is a very fundamental objection to the amendment in that it would seem to most of us to be desirable that applicants for supplementary grants should know, as far as possible, where they stand.  In the Minister's amendment, it seems to be open to the local authority to treat different individuals in different ways. You might have a case which, to the onlooker at any rate, would seem to be exactly the same as another, but it is open to the local authority to treat each of these in a different way because under the Minister's amendment, it seems to me to be open to the local authority in respect of each applicant for a supplementary grant to impose different conditions.  There is no kind of over-riding guide or rule which applicants can rely on as showing whether or not they are going to come within the category which will get them a supplementary grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to what Deputy M. J. O'Higgins has said, are local authorities not obliged to prepare a scheme outlining the conditions under which they will give a supplementary grant and apply that generally to all applicants?  I should like to clear this point with the Minister, when he is disengaged.  Is it not right to say that local authorities are required to prepare a scheme, whether or not they are prepared, because the normal practice is to prepare a scheme in which they outline the conditions under which they will pay supplementary grants?  I think a point arises there as to whether or not they are compelled to prepare this scheme and operate the supplementary grants according to this scheme.  Are they obliged to do that? I know that has been the practice but we feel people should know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an objectionable amendment because it permits local authorities to <Col N="701" /> worsen the supplementary grants scheme and to impose additional conditions, over and above those required by the Minister.  Again, it re-introduces these two sets of standards I have objected to earlier on.  I think we should have one set of standards recognised at both levels.  As Deputy O'Higgins says, people are entitled to know where they stand; otherwise it only makes for confusion and an immense amount of trouble for the applicant.</P>

      <P>The point is that here we are on the Housing Bill and some other time not so long ago we were discussing something else&mdash;perhaps the same Bill and we were all talking about the local authority not being able to do things without coming back to the Minister.  Here, instead of having in the Bill a provision that the making of grants under section 29 may be confined to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) persons of such class or classes,</P>
      <P>(b) persons reconstructing or improving houses of such type or types, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) persons of such class or <Col N="702" /> classes reconstructing or improving houses of such type or types.</P>
    <P>&mdash;we are now suggesting the wiping out of a number of them from line 11 to line 18: those three restrictive passages.  Instead of that we are merely saying the same local authority may impose such conditions &ldquo;as they think fit&rdquo;.  Surely it is a much more straightforward method of dealing with it?  It imposes and creates no danger that I can see and it simplifies generally the actions of the local authority in arranging their scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The straight answer is that it is an executive function but the money must be provided, and unless the councillors agree, where is the manager to get the money after performing the executive function?  The only sane way to approach this is to have the scheme prepared by the manager and brought to the council by whom it may be amended and it may even be brought back and forward until it conforms with their views and as a result of the scheme hammered out between the manager and the council, the council will be committed to provide money to finance it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is not being fair.  He knows that the scheme is prepared by the manager and the members are allowed to have their say and eventually the money is provided for the scheme.  All the difficulty here, in my view, is that the housing authority may, in relation to making supplementary grants under this section, impose such conditions as they think fit, picking out one case, and the housing authority referred to does not mean the members of the authority <Col N="703" /> who draw up the scheme but the authority's officer, the manager or whoever gets the job to do for the council. I am sure the Minister knows well there is a great difference in the preparation and placing before the council &mdash;the elected members&mdash;of a scheme when they can discuss the provision of money, and under the section as it stands that can be done, and what can also be done under the amendment. When all the preparations are made in the case of John Brown's house and when the house is finished and the State grant is paid and the time comes for the payment of the supplementary grant, the manager can say that the wrong paint was used or the wrong type of chimney and that is an argument the manager can use and will use to avoid paying the grant.  The Minister should look into this and see that it is not a question of our asking the Minister to take over the control of things that belong to the county council so much as a case of not placing extra power in the hands of the county manager.  That is all he is doing and I am one of the people here always asking for more power to be given to the elected representative.  It does not give one iota of power to them.</P>

Having said that, what I shall undertake to the House is that if this is lessening the power of the council, I shall see that it does not go through. If it has to be amended, I shall have the amendment made in such a way that it will not lessen their powers.

Claims for arbitration are normally dealt with in the order in which they are entered for arbitration.  Factors determining the times of hearings at arbitration are the frequency with which the Civil Service Arbitration Board can be convened and the time taken in presentation of claims.</P>

      <P>The amount of money involved in offers of loans cancelled by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, on the grounds that they were not taken up within three months, since <Col N="732" /> the 15th July, 1965, is approximately £600,000.</P>
      <P>As explained in a reply I gave to the Deputy on 20 October in order to ensure that available capital is conserved for productive purposes, it was found necessary to cancel loan offers for unproductive purposes, i.e., funding of debt, land purchase and purchase of motor cars, where the offers had not been taken up within the time stipulated by the Corporation.  If the Corporation did not restrict its loans to directly productive purposes, it could at a time of general scarcity of capital, such as the present, be charged with operating a policy prejudicial to agricultural development.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider asking the Corporation to differentiate between those loans to which expressed approval had been given and any new applications and is the Minister aware that a not inconsiderable number of persons entered into commitments for the purchase of land and even made deposits and are now in danger of losing those deposits owing to their inability to get the loan which they understood the Agricultural Credit Corporation had committed itself to giving them?

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of cases in which land purchase has been mixed up with funding of bank debts and in many of these cases the banks, I think, themselves have honoured their own commitments.  I want to point out to the Deputy that as a result of consultation I had with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, I put them in funds to the extent of £1 million more than had been settled in the review of the Capital Budget.  I do not think there is any possibility that I could put them further in funds for the purposes suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>State grants of £275 for a 5-roomed house, £225 for a 4-roomed house and £175 for a 3-roomed house are normally available in respect of serviced houses built in Dublin.  Where the house is provided by a public utility society the amounts of the grants are increased by £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of action taken by me earlier this year, new house purchase loan schemes have been adopted by the housing authorities in the Dublin area.  There is now no material difference between the schemes operated by these authorities and none of them operates a residence qualification in relation to loans.  Housing authorities themselves decide the <Col N="737" /> conditions which apply to the payment of supplementary grants in their areas. Under the schemes at present in force in the Dublin area, persons from the city cannot normally obtain supplementary grants in respect of houses built outside the county borough.  I have pressed the authorities concerned to come to a suitable arrangement to resolve this difficulty.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of amalgamating the three local authorities concerned into a unified authority, there is ample power under existing law for co-ordinated action between local authorities whose areas adjoin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the present position in Dublin City area.  In March last, when I announced details of the £16,000 prototype indoor heated pool, a proposal had been received from the corporation for a pool at Crumlin estimated to cost £164,000.  I requested the corporation to reconsider the proposal in the light of the developments regarding the prototype pool and in conjunction with the suggestion that a number of low-cost pools might be provided for the city area with the minimum of delay.  Subsequently, discussions took place between officials of my Department and the corporation about the points at issue.  The corporation have now submitted a proposal for a pool costing £48,750 and this proposal is under examination in my Department. I hope to be in a position to reply to the Corporation in the matter shortly.</P>
      <P>In so far as private pools are concerned, during the current financial year, I have approved of the payment of subsidy towards loan charges arising from contributions by the corporation in respect of pools at Marian College, Ballsbridge, and St. Mary's School and Home for the Blind, Merrion.</P>

      <P>The object of the Scheme of Grants for Calved Heifers is to encourage farmers to keep additional heifers for breeding so that the national output of cattle will reach by 1970 the target of 1,500,000 set in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  To achieve this object the country's cow population will need to have increased to 1,700,000 by 1968, that is, 377,500 more than in 1963.</P>
      <P>Although cow numbers had reached 1,537,000 by June, 1965, an increase of 214,000 over the 1963 figures, the target has not yet been reached and, accordingly, no date has been set for the termination of the scheme.  If, at any time, it is decided to bring the Scheme to an end, adequate notice will be given to producers.</P>

He was described as having got out of his car, looked into the water, got back again and driven away.  How long are you going to continue to fool the people of that area about this?

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are, I presume, referring to a portion of a speech of mine which was criticised in a recent editorial in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> The same editorial said, and I quote: &ldquo;We feel sure that some eagle-eyed Opposition Deputy, like Oliver Flanagan or Richie Ryan, will seize on it and ask the Minister ...&rdquo; and so on.  And, sure enough, the Deputies duly did what they were told.</P>
      <P>My speech was delivered at St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman, on 14th October last and was, among other things, a serious effort to encourage and stimulate further improvements in the mental health services.</P>
      <P>In it due acknowledgment was made for improvements carried out in mental hospitals in recent years as will be evidenced from the following quotation: &ldquo;Improvements have, however, been taking place all the time&mdash;in some hospitals more rapidly and more markedly than others&mdash;and I am told, by persons who are in a position to cast their minds back 10, 15 or 20 years in the service, that the cumulative effect of the improvements which have taken place since, say, the end of the war, is quite startling.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We must all, Ministers and their staffs, and mental hospital authorities and theirs, together with the community as a whole, carry a share of responsibility for the conditions to which I have referred.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reasons for the recent <Col N="761" /> change in the regulations covering corporal punishment in schools; the purpose of these new regulations; and the practical effect which they are expected to have on the practice of corporal punishment in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the new rule is to ensure that there will be a positive rather than a negative approach to the matter.  It is framed on the basis that the teacher in the school holds for the time being the place of the parent and, that being so, the teacher must in relation to the control of the pupils under his charge act as would a just and wise parent.  The rule contains ample provision to deal with any case in which a teacher does not act accordingly.  My predecessor made a full statement to the House on the 4th May, 1961, in relation to this matter of corporal punishment.  I want to endorse what he said when he stated, as reported in the Official Report, Vol. 188, No. 12, Col. 1776:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The teacher holds for the time being the place of the parent and so for the time being carries in this matter the rights of the parent.  In these circumstances it would be unreasonable for me to forbid the teacher to adopt any deterrent that might be adopted by a just and wise parent, and a just and wise parent might on occasions deem it necessary to inflict an adequate amount of corporal punishment in order to control the child and bring him up in the way he should go.</P>
      <P>Even a parent, however, has no right to inflict excessive punishment and is liable to court penalties if he causes injury to the child.  In that regard, I wish to say that I personally abhor excessive punishment of any kind, either physical or mental. I will go further and say that I will not countenance any punishment in the schools that goes beyond the limits of adequacy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the teachers are under no misapprehension as to what constitutes excessive corporal punishment and I can see no grounds whatsoever for the sensational interpretations <Col N="762" /> of the effect of the new rule to which we have recently been treated in some organs of the public press.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the new regulations are somewhat vague and the fact that the speech to which the Minister refers is somewhat vague, would he be more specific and say, for example, if corporal punishment can now be administered for failure at lessons?  This is an omission from the 1965 regulations. Can he say whether or not corporal punishment can be inflicted on any part of the body, other than by use of a rod, a cane or strap?  Would the Minister say why the prohibition on the boxing of ears and pulling of hair has been omitted from the 1965 regulations, in view of the fact that it was specifically mentioned in the previous regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension in regard to the new rule.  It is divided into four subsections, and No. (2) says:</P>
      <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It says &ldquo;should not&rdquo;.  Why not &ldquo;must not&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of wording.  To go any further in regard to what Deputy Corish said on the question of the boxing of children's ears, pulling of hair, and so on, the reason they are omitted is that it does seem to be quite inappropriate in a rule of the Department of Education. The new rule has a positive approach instead of the negative approach of saying: &ldquo;You may not do this or that.&rdquo;  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason and not by harshness and severity.  Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a <Col N="763" /> pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) read:</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that there has been no question of giving licence to teachers to assault and batter children. They are expected to act in a way a just parent would act and if they fail to do so, they are subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the vast majority of teachers would not act in any inhumane way towards children but what we have to guard against is the minority who may act against the spirit of the regulations.  The Minister should not be so vague in this regard. He talks about excessive punishment, improper treatment.  They should be defined in somewhat the same manner as they were defined in the last regulations. As it is, there is a licence.  It is all very well to say that teachers must behave as parents with the children but the Minister should be a little more specific because there have been examples, isolated though they may have been, of excessive and improper punishment, boxing of ears, pulling of hair, and other such punishments.  The Minister did not answer another question I asked.  Is it now permissible to administer punishment on other parts of the body than the hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last part first, in certain circumstances it could be.  It would be a very unusual case in which this would be permissible but I can visualise circumstances in which it would happen and they would be circumstances in which a just and wise parent would deal with his own child by administering corporal punishment other than on his hands.  However, it would not be a normal case.  On the question whether we should try to be specific in the rules&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how specific one is, somebody can think of another way round it.  Having regard to what the old rule says, we did have cases under the old rules that none of us would want to see happening in the schools.  However, the wording of the rule, specifically mentioning certain things, does not prevent their happening. The essential thing is that when such matters occur and they are reported, they should be dealt with and dealt with fairly but firmly. This is the essential nature of what is involved here and I repeat what my predecessor said, that in such cases it is appropriate to have a fair and impartial investigation and, where it is found that a teacher has acted in a way unbefitting a teacher, take disciplinary action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a case came to the Minister's attention where it had been proved that a teacher had struck a child, boxed him on the ears or on the head, would the Minister be prepared to take appropriate disciplinary action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give a blanket answer to that.  Every case must be answered on its merits.  In the normal way, if a teacher does this, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that he is guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher.  There may be circumstances in which he can rebut this but there would be a <i>prima facie</i> case against him.</P>

      <P>I have given sanction to County Mayo Vocational Education Committee for the appointment of 26 of the 31 teachers whose appointments were proposed by the committee at their meeting on 14th September last. The question of sanctioning two appointments as principals proposed by the committee at that meeting is at present under examination in my Department.  The other three appointments proposed at that meeting were in excess of the allocation of teachers of woodwork and teachers of metalwork which had already been made and notified to the committee and accordingly there was no option but to refuse sanction for these three appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that the issues involved in this matter may be clearly understood, it is necessary to give a brief review of the events which have led to the present strike by certain male night telephonists.  In 1963 a number of male night telephonists broke away from the Post office Workers' Union because they disagreed with decisions taken by the National Executive of that union on matters connected with the sub-postmasters' strike which was then in progress. This break-away group formed the Irish Telephonists' Association and subsequently sought recognition under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service as representing male night telephonists. Under the terms of this scheme which was set up by agreement between the Minister for Finance and the various Civil Service Staff Organisations, the grant of recognition is a matter for the Minister for Finance but he is required to consult the Staff Side panel which represents all the organisations that are parties to the Scheme before granting recognition to any new Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance consulted the Staff Side panel about the application by the Irish Telephonists' Association and the panel recommended that recognition should not be granted to the Association.  In a subsequent letter from my Department to the Association it was suggested that a meeting between the Association and the Post Office Workers' Union under a mutually agreed Chairman would help to resolve the differences and that if the outcome should prove otherwise the report of the Chairman would provide <Col N="772" /> an independent assessment of the matters at issue between the two staff groups.  The Association did not accept the suggestion and they took one-night strike action on 30th March last.  The suggestion was repeated to them later but was again not accepted.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Post Office Workers' Union had indicated that it was agreeable to such a meeting.  The Association wrote to the Minister for Finance on the 4th August requesting an interview with him to discuss their claim for recognition.  The Minister for Finance replied on 12th August to the effect that he considered the request for an interview should be addressed to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The Association wrote to me on the 1st September requesting that a deputation be received from the Association to discuss the question of official recognition for the Association.</P>
    <P>A reply issued on 14th September indicated that I was prepared to receive a deputation at a mutually convenient time.  Reports of the intention of the Association to take industrial action in support of their application appeared in an evening newspaper on 17th September. An officer of the Association telephoned the Department on 20th September with a view to fixing a date and time for the meeting with me.  He was informed that in view of the threats of industrial action which had been published in the interim I would have to reconsider my offer to meet a deputation from the Association.</P>
    <P>On 22nd September my Department wrote to the Association with regard to these published threats stating that it was not clear whether the statements referred to were made with the approval of the Association and represented the Association's intention and that I would be glad to hear from them on these matters. No reply was received to this letter and strike action commenced on the evening of 24th September and pickets were placed on the telephone exchanges in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.</P>
    <P>On the following day an interim injunction was obtained from the High Court restraining the Chairman <Col N="773" /> and certain other named individuals, their servants and agents, from picketing Post Office premises.  The picketing was not discontinued, however, and was later extended to the GPO, Pearse Street Sorting Office and Hammam Buildings.  It has since ceased at these centres.  On 8th October an interlocutory injunction was obtained against the persons already mentioned.  On 21st October a committal order was made by the High Court against three of six defendants.  The other three had given undertakings in the course of the proceedings to refrain from picketing or arranging for picketing.</P>
    <P>It will I think be clear from what I have said that the matter at issue is in effect a dispute between the Association and the Post Office Workers' Union as to which of them should represent male night telephonists.  The Association does not hold official recognition and my Department cannot, therefore, deal with it as a negotiating body.  Since the strike started various grievances which the Association maintains that it desires to see redressed have been published but as all telephone operating grades including male night telephonists continue to be represented by the Post Office Workers' Union claims and representations on behalf of male night telephonists can be dealt with under the existing machinery.</P>
    <P>The staff employed on operating telephone exchanges is approximately 2,060, comprising 1,570 female telephonists, 294 male night telephonists&mdash; including some 150 believed to be members of the Association&mdash;and 200 night and Sunday telephone attendants. These people are all engaged in the same type of work and in the large exchanges male and female operators work together for several hours each day.  These figures indicate that the membership of the Association does not even represent the majority of the male staff and that it is only a fraction of the total operating figure.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier it has been suggested to the Association that they should meet the union in an effort to resolve the differences and I still think <Col N="774" /> that this offers the best hope for an amicable solution.  It is regrettable that two members of the Association have had to be imprisoned for contempt of the High Court Order but the remedy for their unfortunate position lies in their own hands.  I am sure the House will agree with me that the authority of the courts must be up-held.</P>
    <P>My main concern in this matter from the outset has been to minimise the effects of this irresponsible strike action on the telephone service.  It is for this reason that I sought an injunction to restrain picketing in order to ensure as far as possible that other members of the staff would not be prevented from coming to work. I am glad to say that despite the continuation of the pickets the great majority of the staff at the three exchanges affected have continued to report for duty.  Nevertheless, I could not allow a position to drag on where substantial numbers of male operators were not reporting for duty and thus causing serious disruption to the public service after 10 o'clock at night.  Accordingly, on 12th October I directed that each of those people should be informed that unless he resumed duty he would be regarded as having abandoned his position in the Civil Service.  I would earnestly advise them to consider their position because time is running out and already the question of their dismissal is under consideration.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, and to a lesser degree in Cork and Limerick, we employ numbers of part-time night telephone assistants to operate during periods of pressure between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. These are not Civil Servants.  They have no continuity of employment and they are paid an hourly rate for the work they do.  Contrary to statements which have appeared in the newspapers these part-timers do not affect in any way the prospects of full-time employment of male night telephonists. I regret to have to say, however, that as a direct result of serious intimidation by members of the Association the stage has now been reached where none of these part-time night telephone assistants is <Col N="775" /> attending for duty at the Dublin exchange.</P>
    <P>That is a serious state of affairs. But more serious still, in my view, is the threat to ordered trade unionism that arises from breakaway action on the part of small groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is no telephonist on the staff side panel, that this dispute has been developing for the past two years, and that recent developments are not conducive to a settlement of the admittedly difficult issues involved?

      <P>I think that the offer made of a meeting between the two parties concerned, with a mutually agreed chairman, is the best possible effort that could be made, and certainly provides all the necessary ingredients for a good discussion.  As I have stated, that course is still open and always has been.  There is no more suitable tribunal I can think of than that already offered.  The Deputy must appreciate that the principle involved here is not a usual one.  It is a question of whether we are to support an effort at solidarity within trade unionism as such, or allow anyone, anywhere, any time, to take strike action in support of anything.  We have all been pursuing a definite means of finding agreement in disputes.  Great trouble has been gone to, to devise and set up suitable machinery for this purpose.  If we are to support what we have mutually agreed with the unions, we have to show we are prepared to stand by it, and that we will not have absolute anarchy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

No coercive action has been taken other than what was absolutely essential in the interests of ordered trade unionism and good relationship between management and employees. This is the only course open to anyone to take.  It is not coercive.  It is the ordinary course which the trade unions themselves would expect anyone to take.</P>

An evening paper published a front page report that strike action was to be taken.  They were asked to withdraw this or whether this represented the official view.  There was no reply and the action took place.  Deputy Tully said that perhaps the less said at this time the better.  I am not going to give any undertaking other than what I have said already.</P>

      <P>The amendment has been ruled out of order.  I suppose it could possibly have that effect.  I put it down mainly to make the case that TB is no longer a special housing problem and that there are other conditions such as heart or other similar disability which would require, for instance, the provision of a downstairs room.  That was my only interest in putting down this amendment which has been ruled out of order on the grounds that it would impose a charge on State funds.  The Minister should reconsider this section in the light of the fact that the whole position in relation to TB has completely changed and that, in fact, before the position had changed this section was not used <Col N="780" /> to any great extent.  But, if it is to be retained in legislation, it should be widened to take into consideration other health conditions and other disabilities besides just TB which, as I say, is no longer the problem as far as housing is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will really bring to an end an anomaly that exists under section 39 (4).  On that subsection I should say that where default is made in complying with conditions subject to which the loan is made, other than a loan in relation to which an agreement has been made under subsection 39 (3), a housing authority may recover possession of the house in respect of which the loan was made.  If the authority did not enter into an agreement under subsection 39 (3), they could, therefore, operate under subsection 39 (4) to secure possession, even though their interest might be confined to that of second mortgagor. This amendment will get over the objection by excluding loans secured by a second mortgage or a second <Col N="781" /> charge from the powers of a local authority under subsection 39 (4) to recover possession of the house to which the loan relates.  If they wish to proceed for the recovery of such a loan, they would have to act under any agreement they made with the first mortgagor under subsection 39 (3).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The reason for putting down this amendment is the peculiar situation which can arise with the upper limits of income for loan purposes which is £1,200 and the upper limit of income for supplementary grants which is £1,445, when we take dependants into account.  We meet this type of case frequently, where a person can be eligible for a supplementary grant but not eligible for a loan.  I think the Minister will readily agree that that should not be so, that you can have an applicant with three dependants earning £1,345 and one with four dependants earning £1,445. They can get the supplementary grant but they cannot get the loan when they pass the £1,200 limit.  I should like to hear the Minister say he is prepared to accept this amendment in order to overcome this peculiar feature of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one might say in this case that the operation of the loans under the SDA system in these more recent years has been reserved and preserved for those who would not be creditworthy to the degree required by the normal commercial institutions. The £1,200 income limit is <Col N="782" /> the point at which we have recently raised this eligibility to qualify for SDA.  In other words, anybody over that figure would seek his loan elsewhere. We feel that this principle of the reservation of these moneys for those who may not readily find the money through normal commercial institutions is being retained and the income limit of £1,200 in that regard is reasonable, in all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a comparison made as to the availability, in certain circumstances, of supplementary grants to those with incomes of up to £1,445, this could in a sense be regarded as generous on the side of the grant provisions rather than restrictive on the side of the loan provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that making provision whereby a local authority can pay supplementary grants up to £1,445 is an inducement to the local authority to pay grants up to that figure where there are dependants.  While the Minister recommends that local authorities should do that, at the same time, he says the State should not agree to borrowing if a person has an income in excess of £1,200.  It does not seem to make sense that the two income limits should be the same, both for a supplementary grant and for loan purposes. I am amazed the Minister will not accept this amendment to bring the two into line.  I would say that the amount of money involved would not be enormous.  It seems an extraordinary thing that a person who qualifies for a supplementary grant is not, in fact, eligible for a loan from the State.  It seems unthinkable and I must ask the Minister to try to agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are another few aspects which can be looked at in this. Perhaps we should be prepared to increase the limit of £1,040 to £1,200. We should also have regard to the fact that this limit only applies to loans under the SDA scheme and drawn from the Local Loans Fund and that loans from this source may not be made to persons with incomes on a higher level than £1,200.  In this way we are not really saying that you may not lend money to people over £1,200. <Col N="783" /> If the local authorities wish to go beyond that, they may do so, but they must supply the money from other than a Government source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the extreme difficulty experienced at the present time.  He knows the money just cannot be found.  Is the Minister saying that as long as this credit squeeze lasts, no money can be found outside?  I cannot understand why somebody if entitled to a supplementary grant, should be put in the position that he cannot also be given a loan.  There is nothing wrong at all with the amendment which says that the upper limits of valuation and income for a loan shall be the same as that for a supplementary grant.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware of this but local authorities have a habit of trying to juggle around so that somebody would give a high income figure for the purposes of a loan and, thereby, deprive himself of a supplementary grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I would not agree with the Deputy.  I do know that juggling around has been done in the past where a person who established himself as qualifying for a supplementary grant could not qualify on creditworthiness for a loan. I know of one case only where both were got in these circumstances, but that is a long story.  It is not the parallel of that at all.  It does normally set out that if the local authority wish to provide these supplementary grants, they may go to a limit of £1,450, provided it is in respect of an applicant who has not less than four dependants.  In other cases, it is scaled down and comes back to the basic £1,045, where there are no dependants. If the appropriate cases come along, that person will get some part of the supplementary grant as determined by the local authority.  That same person, if over the £1,200 limit, will not get an SDA loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand if he earns under £1,200, he can get both supplementary grant and the SDA loan from the local authority so that this is radically different from the situation Deputy Tully has mentioned as <Col N="784" /> being a sort of &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; in the past and which I knew was so myself, that if you qualified for one, you put yourself out of court for the other.  In other words, if you made a good case for a loan, the same case defeated you for a supplementary grant.  But here, if you go on the permitted limit, it is quite clear that within the scheme a person may qualify for a supplementary grant and, provided his income does not exceed £1,200, he will be entitled to full consideration for an SDA loan.  I think this is fair.  It is codding nobody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed by the Minister's attitude to this amendment.  It is incredible that a person can qualify for a grant from the local authority and at the same time, cannot qualify for an SDA loan.  As we advance in this Bill, it is revealing itself more and more as a Bill to enable the local authorities to contribute more from the rates, while, at the same time, little or no additional contribution is made by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider this point?  We all know of people living in rented houses or who are married and have not a house of their own and want to build a house.  There is a fairly well established salary at which certain people feel they are in a position to build their own houses.  Is it not rather ridiculous that people who have reached that salary feel they are able to pay a loan and these are the very people who are deprived of getting a loan by this section?  If the Government are serious about encouraging people to build their own houses, would the Minister not consider making provision that the necessary finances when available to the Government would be made available to them?  This sort of penny-pinching which is put in for no reason that I can discover should not be included in this Bill.  It would be far better if the Minister said &ldquo;If those people want to build their houses, the State will give every possible assistance&rdquo;, instead of saying: &ldquo;You have an income which will allow you to repay a loan. <Col N="785" /> You have got a grant from the local authority but you will not get a loan because you have a few pounds more than we think you should have to qualify for the loan.&rdquo; I cannot understand that.</P>

Some of them have been waiting for two months and they have been told: &ldquo;You will get the money when we get authority to pay it from the SDA.&rdquo; Is that just talk or making use of the fact that there is a credit squeeze?  Will the Minister say: &ldquo;We have not got the money.  We are short of money and we ask the people to have patience until it is available.&rdquo;  If the Minister does that, we are prepared to sympathise and give him support but do not let us have a continuation of this story that there is plenty of money.</P>

There is a credit squeeze but despite that, the total amount of money, the total contribution from public money going into housebuilding and reconstruction this year will be the highest ever put in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking about the amount of money provided in the Estimates.  Last year, we provided a certain amount of money but it was not spent.  I do not think it can be spent this year because everybody is held up for want of money for housing.  We are only fooling ourselves if we say there is money available.  It is not available.  Apart from that, we are not legislating for today but for a period when I hope money will again be available.  It is certainly not available at the present time.  The Minister is quite right in saying that the number of applications for SDA loans to Dublin County Council has rocketed in the past couple of months but I submit that that is not entirely due to the increase in income limits.  It is largely influenced by the fact that loans have been refused by building societies and others who provide credit for building and people are coming to the county council as a last resort.  Many people do not like to use SDA loans. <Col N="788" /> Many builders dislike intensely to do so because of the delays involved in getting the money.  When building societies were making money available it was made available quickly and without difficulty.  There is considerable difficulty always in connection with SDA loans and grants.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister should seem to be disappointed and dissatisfied that moneys being provided by way of loan and grant through Government machinery are being utilised and that he should use all the time as a reason for not improving the facilities the fact that they are being used more and more by the people.  The Minister should be proud and glad that increased building activity is taking place in a country where so much building is required and so many houses are needed.  I would ask the Minister to take a serious look at this before we reach the next Stage of the Bill and, if we have failed to convince him, see if he cannot convince himself that there is a strong case to be made for having the income limits the same for loans and grants and thus eliminate all this confusion.</P>

I am sure he recalls that there was a builders' strike for almost three months which very effectively reduced the output and that a greater hold-up had taken place than was represented by the amount of money unspent.

      <Col N="789" /> The other point is that this year, which is the year in question here, more than half of the total provision of money, which is the greatest amount of money we have ever provided, is already spent, so that there cannot be any question that we are providing money merely on paper and doing nothing about it.  More than half the figure is now gone.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 29, before subsection (8), to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  In calculating the amount of a loan under this section the value of the house shall not be reduced by the amount of the supplementary grant if any such supplementary grant is being paid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my experience as a public representative, I have found that the deduction of the supplementary grant before the loan is estimated has caused a great deal of trouble and confusion.  Everybody seems to be aware that he is entitled to a State grant but persons are not always aware that they are entitled to a supplementary grant because the practice has been that no supplementary grant was paid by certain local authorities or there was a very small grant and there were grants of various sizes paid by various local authorities.  In their ignorance and innocence about these matters, persons applied for the State grant and the loan and the State grant was deducted and the loan was calculated on the balance.  An applicant might subsequently meet somebody who inquired if he had asked for a supplementary grant, which made him aware of the fact that such a grant was available. He applied but could not get the grant. He was debarred because the loan had already been calculated after deduction of the State grant.  If application for the supplementary grant is not made within a month, the applicant is debarred. There is one month in which to make application for the supplementary <Col N="790" /> grant, in which case both grants are deducted and the house can be proceeded with.  The supplementary grant involves a delay of one month because of the operation of a means test by the local authority, and the necessary investigation whereas it is quite an easy matter to know who is entitled to a State grant and who is not and the application can go through much more quickly.  All the amendment seeks is that the amount of the supplementary grant, if any, will not be deducted for the purpose of estimating the loan.</P>

      <P>We will not go into that.  We do not want the Deputy to incriminate himself at the moment.  In this connection I would say that 95 per cent is the limit of an SDA loan, plus the top limit of the loan that may be granted regardless of the cost of the house.</P>

      <P>Do not draw me on valuers because I have more bother with certain valuers than with others. I will say no more about it.  It is a reasonable thing, if we are to have a 95 per cent loan, or 99 per cent as is the case where persons vacate a local authority house, that regard must be had to the net cost of the house rather than to the gross cost.  Therefore, the deduction of any State or local authority grants would seem to be a fairly reasonable operation and the loan thereafter would be calculated on the residue rather than on the original amount.  I cannot see a great deal <Col N="791" /> wrong with the operation as of now. Assuming that we forgot about all this and said that we will make it 95 per cent of gross cost, is it not conceivable that on the 95 per cent of gross cost the loan in those circumstances would be greater than the net amount of money the person had to find in addition to the grant?</P>

      <P>This anomaly will arise unless there is a downward scale for the percentage loan that would be granted.  It is not unreasonable to expect that some contribution would be made by the person raising the loan and getting the grants and having a house provided.  I do not say that this necessarily should be large but even as an expression of good faith on his part, the applicant should be expected to have got to the stage where he had gathered up some part of the cost, no matter how small, and that some part would be provided by him before he looked for aid by way of grants and loans, particularly having regard to the fact that in all cases these grants and loans come from public moneys, whether rates or taxes.

      <P>He missed the main point I was trying to make in favour of the amendment, that by taking the supplementary grant into calculation for loan purposes, many people who would get a supplementary grant have been deprived of it simply because they did not apply for the supplementary grant within a month of applying for the loan.  That is the rule.  I am aware of many cases where this has happened, and if the persons had known it would happen, they would not have built.  I would ask the Minister in a particular way to listen to this argument.  I know many people within the prescribed income bracket who have been deprived of supplementary grants because this deduction was made.  That is why I am asking that this be left out of the calculation. It makes an enormous difference to a person when he is deprived of a supplementary grant.  The effect on the loan would be so little by leaving this out of the calculation that I would ask the Minister to accede to the terms of the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is the one I referred to briefly before.  It says that provided the housing authority make such conditions, which are approved by the Minister, they may make a loan providing the house is fit for human habitation.  It is a little bit difficult with regard to reconstruction, <Col N="797" /> repair or improvement of a house.  In the case of a big house if the people who own the house cannot afford big repairs and can only repair enough of it to satisfy the family needs they do not qualify according to this because the entire house would not be fit for human habitation.  Can the Minister say would &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; cover this in a different way?  It says &ldquo;necessary to provide suitable accommodation&rdquo;. Does this mean if somebody has some repairs carried out that it will apply to this?  Does it mean it can only apply to the necessary repairs?  Does it apply to the house even if the repairs might be desirable and the Minister's engineer may consider they are not necessary?

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 31, subsection (1), lines 53 to 56, to delete all words from &ldquo;for&rdquo; in line 53 and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the provision under this Act of dwellings in respect of which a grant under section 15 of this Act has not been made, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the provision of sites for building purposes, provided that the Minister is satisfied that the work of developing the site commenced on or after the 1st day of July, 1965.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the new subsidy for developed sites will apply to sites on which development started on or after 1st July, 1965.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been saying things since 1963 but if he went back as far as he has been talking about he would go back to 1963.  I know from my previous efforts here the Minister is not prepared to move an inch in making the application of various sections of this Bill retrospective even for a short space of time.</P>

      <P>My amendment on this section was ruled out of order and I can only discuss it on the section. We had, in County Dublin, for years, people living in overcrowded conditions as subtenants of cottages and the Minister would not accept them for the larger subsidy.  After a lot of effort we got him to say this was undesirable. None of us can understand why he still excludes people who are forced into living in caravans.  We, ourselves, are, in fact, providing caravans for a number of people where we cannot provide houses and where we cannot get the money fast enough to provide houses and also while we are waiting for the money to provide those houses. We have put the people into caravans and as a result of doing that we are deprived of the subsidy.  It does not make sense to me or to anybody else.</P>
      <P>There is even a distinction made here between itinerants being housed out of caravans and ordinary residents in any area who are living in caravans. If you house itinerants out of caravans, you get a subsidy.  If he is an ordinary, decent person who is in a caravan because of the deplorable housing conditions he was living in, there is no subsidy.  If the Minister takes a good look at this, I think he will include people in caravans.  A caravan any day of the week is a great improvement on Griffith Barracks, Mountjoy Square or any of the temporary accommodation provided through the health authority.  It is in an effort to meet that situation that we are putting people into caravans.  It is in order to keep out of such institutions that people provide themselves with caravans. Therefore, it seems unreasonable that they should not get the subsidy, and I do not know how the Minister is going to defend his stand on this.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for coming to our aid in County Dublin by giving the two-thirds subsidy to subtenants in council houses. We were the first breakthrough.  In regard to Deputy Clinton's point about caravans, the Minister gives one-third subsidy to caravan dwellers and two-thirds if they are subtenants.  I have <Col N="800" /> been speaking to the Minister about this matter.  It is hard to know where to draw the line.  We had to house seven people out of caravans in Lucan. When a housing scheme is started anybody could draw in a caravan and be living there.  It is open to abuse in that way.  However, I would like if the Minister would have another look at the matter because we have a problem in Dublin dealing with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing that seems to be overlooked in this is that a caravan is not in the normal sense a dwelling.  Anybody living in a caravan cannot be claimed to be living in a house.  They have not got suitable housing accommodation.  If they have not got suitable housing accommodation, they should be entitled to the normal subsidy.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the proper subsidy to be given to caravan dwellers going into a new house is the two-thirds subsidy. The caravans may be retained for other unfortunates who will require them at a later stage.  This whole matter of saying that because they are living in caravans they are only entitled to the one-third subsidy is wrong and I think Deputy Clinton is perfectly right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a bit of confusion here?  It has only dawned on me that Deputy Tully is talking about people out of caravans already provided by the local authority.  I do not think that is what Deputy Clinton is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three elements in this.  First, there is the payment of subsidy by the local authority for the provision of caravans.  We have allowed subsidy for such operations in the recent past.  Next is the question whether persons by reason of living in a caravan should indiscriminately, <Col N="801" /> as of right, be entitled not only to be rehoused but to get the higher subsidy. There is no straight answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of this Bill it is the need of rehousing that will determine the matter.  Whether they are in caravans or not is not the essence of the claim.  The claim could arise because a person is in a caravan or it could arise on medical or compassionate grounds.  It might happen that a person in a caravan&mdash;it might be his own or somebody else's and need not necessarily be a local authority caravan&mdash;would be entitled by virtue of need to the higher subsidy. The third element concerns caravans provided by the local authority.  The question seems to be raised here whether persons leaving those caravans and going into houses are entitled to the subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was already subsidising those caravans. He is not.  They are being provided by the local authorities out of the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  The Minister refused to subsidise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying they are getting nothing at the moment?  That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the caravan being provided with the aid of subsidy obviously must be different from the question of the caravan provided by the local authority without subsidy.  The two cannot be treated in the same manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has attempted to unscramble this question of caravans.  If you are housing an itinerant, you get a 50 per cent grant, but if the person concerned is not an itinerant but a working class person who, by his own thrift, got into a caravan, he will get only a one-third subsidy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about an ordinary member of the community who lives in a caravan.  He gets a one-third subsidy.  The caravans are provided by the local authority to keep people out of institutions like Griffith Barracks.  Why does the Minister think such a person is not entitled to the normal subsidy?  They are living in caravans because they want family type accommodation other than institutional accommodation where they will be separated from their wives and families.  The Minister should agree to take a serious look at this.  I can see a point can be made for eliminating people with lots of money who live in caravans.  But, since they are not members of the working classes, they are not eligible.  But those living in caravans because of their circumstances, who would otherwise be eligible if they were living in any sort of house, should receive the two-thirds subsidy the same as anybody else.  This is merely cheese-paring.</P>
