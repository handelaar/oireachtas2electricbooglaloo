      <P>Quite apart from the actual texts of the Bills that normally would be printed and which may have to be dealt with by some form of stencilling, it is impossible to consider the Finance Bill on Report Stage unless we have an opportunity of considering carefully the Minister's remarks on the actual amendments in Committee and I think there should be a limited number of copies of the typescript report of the debate made available to Members for the purpose of considering them in relation to the proceedings of the House.</P>

    <P>SECTION 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> In subsection (3), lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;either before or after the passing of this Act&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;after the 12th day of May, 1965.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is clear, I think, from its wording.  It is proposed to ensure that the section will not have a retrospective effect.  So far as we are concerned, we agree with, and can understand, the policy enshrined in the section which deals with the avoidance of death duties but we feel that if a person does something which is in accordance with the law, he should be entitled so to act and it is not right or proper that legislation to deal with the particular thing he has done should have retrospective effect.  For that reason we move this amendment which is intended to ensure that while the section will be passed, it will operate from the usual time, that is, from the date of the Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy O'Higgins has said.  While we all can agree on whatever tightening up may be necessary to prevent deliberate avoidance or evasion, there is a well established rule and many precedents here over the years opposed to retrospective legislation. Professional advisers and others who have been consulted by people making their legal and other arrangements in order to provide for family and personal commitments of one sort and another are entitled to act in the knowledge that whatever the law is at a particular time will so operate. But, as this section is drafted, it means that, without warning, professional advisers, either legal advisers or accountants, or both, who have given advice in the light of the existing state of the law find that the proposed changes nullify that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is a bad precedent to set down that retrospective legislation should interfere with what has been the established legal position up to the enactment of this proposal.  In general, Budget Resolutions and the legal effect of Budget decisions apply either from the day following the Budget in so far as they may have penal effect <Col N="369" /> or, in certain other cases, from a later date.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable criticism by those who have the responsibility of advising people professionally of the effect of retrospective legislation in this regard.  We believe that the retrospective provision in this section should not apply and that any gift made before Budget day should be exempt.  As the section is at present framed, people who sought and accepted professional advice and made arrangements accordingly now find that that advice and the action taken in consequence of it can be set aside.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a bad situation that the law may be changed with retrospective effect.  On many occasions and on a variety of topics, criticism has been expressed in the past of retrospective legislation where a penal effect is involved.  This particular section might well be put into effect from the day subsequent to the Budget day, 12 May.  We regard any retrospective application of this proposal as opposed to the principles which should govern the enactment of legislation of this kind and which have in general been applied in matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I would urge the Minister to consider the amendment which has been moved by Deputy O'Higgins and which we believe would allow the Minister's intentions to be implemented in so far as any avoiding action which could have the consequences envisaged but which at the same time would preserve the existing arrangements in respect of persons who acted in good faith and in the knowledge that the law was so framed up to the date of the Budget and who accepted on that matter professional advice and acted accordingly.  For that reason, we believe this section should operate only from the date when the Budget took effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's amendment and what Deputy Cosgrave says again go back to the question as to whether estate duty legislation operating from the time of death is retrospective or not.  I submit that it is not retrospective in the sense that it is a question of application as to time and all down the years estate duty legislation has been made applicable from the time of death and even if transactions before death were caught up by this legislation&mdash;avoiding transactions&mdash;then the principle has been that such transactions are caught.</P>
      <P>I am not going to quote Deputy Sweetman again because I think Deputy Sweetman's views are well known as expressed on a previous Finance Bill, on retrospection generally and the date of operation of legislation dealing with death duties, but I might, with your permission, Sir, quote an extract from <i>Taxation</i> which is the acknowledged journal in this field, in its issue of 1st June, 1957. I have not got the actual journal with me but I take it the House will accept this extract from it.  In its editorial in that issue the following statement occurs:</P>
      <P>We are sure that most professional advisers have explained to their clients that transactions of this nature are always liable to be upset by future legislation and therefore the taxpayer appreciates that there is some risk that his acts will be made of no effect.  He will usually accept this risk because he is no worse off if he dies within the five-year period and would be much better off as a result of having made the gifts should he outlive the five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in general, Sir, but, in relation to this amendment and the subsection to which it refers, the amendment would seek to create a privileged position in relation to gifts <i>inter vivos</i> for gifts given by way of the formation of family companies.  As the Bill is at present and at least up to the point we passed it last night, an outright gift <i>inter vivos</i> would be caught if made within five years but, under the section, if the gift is made three <Col N="371" /> years or more before the passing of the Act, it will not be caught.</P>
    <P>A gift given by way of the formation of a family company within five years is still a gift <i>inter vivos.</i>  The formation of a family company is a device whereby a person seeks to avoid payment of death duties and to make the subsection applicable only after 12th May would create a specially favoured position in relation to gifts given to members of a family by way of this device over outright gifts given within the same period and it would, therefore, be both illogical and inconsistent to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply to the Second Reading debate mentioned views I had expressed on the Finance Act, 1955, but he omitted to tell the House that the views I expressed then were views in support of the section which the Minister is now proposing to repeal.  We shall have that discussion later on, but to quote views of mine in another context, when they were expressly stated for the purpose of asking this House to support the Act of 1955, which the Minister is now proposing to repeal, is, to say the least of it, taking remarks slightly out of their context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, one respect in which the statement just made by the Minister is entirely incorrect.  The only precedent that exists in the statutes in relation to the extension of the gift <i>inter vivos</i> period is the precedent contained in section 59 of the Finance Act of 1910.  In that section there was, very deliberately, no retrospection. The position up to the Finance Act of 1910 was that gifts <i>inter vivos</i> were not liable to duty if they had been made more than one year before the date of death.  The Finance Act of 1910 extended that period to three years but the Legislature deliberately made the section operative only after the expiration of the period of one year, so that, in relation to any transaction effected one year, or more, before the operative date, which was 30th April, 1909, which was, I think, <Col N="372" /> the date of the Budget announcement at the time, and, in the event of a death within the period of that year, notwithstanding the three-year rule, they did not go back.</P>
    <P>The amendment Deputy O'Higgins has here is phrased slightly differently but the principle is exactly the same. The only precedent we have in the whole death duty legislation for an extension of the gift <i>inter vivos</i> period is the precedent in section 59 of the Finance Act of 1910 and, in the period then stipulated, the 12 month period was quite deliberately protected so as to ensure that there would not be retrospection.  When we are dealing with gifts <i>inter vivos,</i> we are certainly entitled to follow that precedent rather than any other and the Minister should, therefore, make sure that this section does not come into operation until after the period of three years from the date of his announcement the other day and thus follow the precedent already established.  It is a precedent on which people are entitled to rely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have not quoted Deputy Sweetman out of context. I did not quote him at all today but I did quote him in my reply to the Second Reading debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on that occasion we were doing no more than was done on any previous occasion by making the operative date as of the date of death.  I had no intention whatever of quoting Deputy Sweetman out of context in the slightest degree. I should like to repeat now that we have gone so far in this Bill as saying last night that, if a person dies, within five years of his death making a gift, the gift <i>inter vivos</i> will be subject to estate duty.  That is an outright gift and the type of person who will be caught is not the person who usually has the resources or the means to form a family company.  The person who has such resources and can pay for such a device and has formed a family company in some period up to <Col N="373" /> the passing of this Bill would be, through the device of the family company and the making of gifts to his relatives, in a preferential position as compared with other recipients of gifts <i>inter vivos.</i>  I said I thought that was inconsistent and would not be equitable as far as the general mass of the community is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer one question very deliberately, after consultation with his advisers, if he so wishes?  Is it not a fact that the only occasion on which the gift <i>inter vivos</i> period was extended was on the occasion of the section I have quoted?  Is it not a fact that that section was not retrospective and that it provided for the case of a person dying after 30th April, 1909, but it had a provision saying that it did not apply to a gift <i>inter vivos</i> made or effected before 30th April, 1908.  In other words, if the previous period of twelve months had operated before the date of death, then it was quite clear of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read what I have here.  Section 24 of the Bill follows the line of the earlier Act which related to gifts made by persons dying after 30th April, 1909, but was not confined to gifts made after that date.  It had, however, a transitional provision exempting gifts which had been made one year, or more, prior to that date and which, therefore, would have been exempt under the previous legislation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Section 24, in fact, follows the lines of the earlier Act which related to gifts made by <Col N="374" /> persons dying after 30th April, 1909, but was not confined to gifts made after that date.  It had, however, a transitional provision exempting gifts which had been made one year, or more, prior to that date and which, therefore, would have been exempt under the previous legislation.  I must admit I do not follow that very clearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pose this question to the Minister.  It may cover what Deputy Booth has in mind. If a person formed a family company four years ago and effected a gift <i>inter vivos</i> through that device, and dies, under the provisions contained in section 18 that property becomes liable to death duties; but if, in fact, another person gave all his property by means of a gift <i>inter vivos</i> four years ago, not using a family device, and dies, that property is not subject to death duties.  In fact, not only are we dealing in this section with a person who sought to avoid the impact of death duties by doing something perfectly lawful, not only are we saying he shall not be able to do that in the future, but we are punishing him and putting him in an adverse position compared with the person who did not seek expert advice, did not do what he was advised to do and <Col N="375" /> did not act lawfully.  We are putting that person in a worse position.  That appears to me not only to be bad because it is retrospective, but also to be doubly bad because it seeks to single out and punish a person who has in fact acted lawfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider further the reference that has been made here.  If the Minister reads section 59 of the 1910 Act, he will see that, after providing that three years will be substituted for 12 months, it goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Provided that this section shall not apply to any gift <i>inter vivos,</i> surrender, assurance, divesting, or disposition made or effected before the thirtieth day of April, nineteen hundred and eight, or made or effected for public or charitable purposes.</P>
      <P>That was the Act in which the three years period was brought into effect instead of 12 months.  In that case it was made quite clear that it would not apply to any gift before the 30th April, 1908, in other words, 12 months previously, I believe the Minister should favourably consider a similar provision if he is not prepared to go to the extent which Deputy O'Higgins's amendment proposes.  As far as I can see, this is the first time this change has been made without allowing a ceiling.  Although there is a difference as far as section 24 is concerned, as far as this section is concerned, as it applies to a gift <i>inter vivos,</i> there is no saver such as there was in the case of the Act passed in 1910.</P>

      <P>There is an exactly similar saver.  The period operative up to the 1910 Act for the purpose of charging duty on gifts made <i>inter vivos</i> was one year.  In the 1910 Act, it was extended to three years.  But the 1910 Act, as Deputy Cosgrave has just said, expressly excluded gifts made in that preceding year, because that was the year of operation then.  Now we are changing from the new period which came in in 1910, three years, to five <Col N="376" /> years.  But we are including an exactly similar exclusion.  It is the same type of exclusion except that we are changing the one year to three years.</P>

The exclusion in relation to the three years is exactly the same as that in relation to the five years we are bringing in now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Or anywhere else. I first read subsection (4) of section 24 as meaning that you were, but I do not think you are.  You have to go to section 24 in order to understand this section.  Subsection (4) of section 24 states:</P>
      <P>This section shall have effect only in cases in which the deceased dies after the passing of this Act and the relevant disposition, surrender, assurance, divesting, determination or other transaction was made or effected after or within three years before such passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;passing&rdquo; there is not passing on death but the passing of the Act. For example, say this Act will be passed on 31st July, 1965 and the person made a disposition on 1st January, 1963.  That person dies on 2nd January, 1966, that is, within three years from the passing of the Act.  It is over three years from the date of the disposition.  In other words, it is within the three year and five year period.  That gift will be liable for duty now in contravention of the principle laid down in the 1910 Act. I admit quite frankly that the construction of subsection (4) of section 24 is difficult.  But, when you get it down to exact dates like that, I do not think there can be any doubt <Col N="377" /> about the matter.  This section should certainly follow the precedent laid down in 1910.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow what Deputy Sweetman has said, it is fairly clear to me that there is some differentiation between subsection (4) of section 24 and the subsections of section 18 in respect of which this amendment has been put down.  I have a suspicion that what the Minister intended to do in section 24 was to follow the basic provisions in the 1910 Act, but to discriminate in some way in respect of gifts <i>inter vivos</i> made between an individual and a family company. From what he has said this morning, it seems to me he has been advised there is something rather naughty about a gift to a family company, but there is something slightly more respectable about a gift to a relative. I think there is a discrepancy between section 18 and section 24 and I should like to know why.</P>
      <P>If a gift to a company is to be treated adversely, a gift to an individual should be treated just as adversely.  Similarly, I would hope that, if a gift to an individual was to be treated comparatively favourably, exactly the same should apply to a gift to a company.  I would agree with Deputy Sweetman that subsection (4) of section 24 is difficult to pin down, but I feel what the Minister had in mind was that section 24 should give preference to gifts to an individual.</P>

      <P>At least we have got this far: we are down to an argument on what subsection (4) means.  I think I have persuaded the Minister that what he wants to do is to follow the procedure of the 1910 Act.  This is a different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man dies say before 1st August, 1967, and has made the gift, he will be caught by the two years.  I cannot see how subsection (4) deals with the situation.  It would be much better to deal with it in the way <Col N="379" /> in which it was dealt with in the 1910 Act and the way which I copied exactly from the 1910 Act in amendment No. 37.  However, that is section 24.  At least we have got this far. There is no case whatever to be made for section 24 and section 18 not being on parallel lines.  If what the Minister wants to do is to exempt a gift on the same basis as it was exempt in 1910, following the same precedent, in comparison, for the extension of three to five years, as was done from one to three years, then it should also be done in section 18.  There is no case for dealing with the two sections differently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman said we have made some progress.  I want to get back to the point I raised before.  Assuming&mdash; which is not the case&mdash;that section 24 (4) does preserve the position of a person who made a gift within three years of the passing of the Act, assuming that is the intention of the section, it still leaves the problem of the person who did form a family company four years before the passing of the Act and who, by means of that device, did distribute his property to the company amongst members of his own family.  As section 18 stands, although what was done was perfectly lawful, and in accordance with the law, and in fact proved to be unnecessary because the person lived longer than three years and is in the fourth year and dies after the passing of the Act, under the section as it stands there is going to be a visitation of death duties which could never have been contemplated.  It could never have been contemplated that if a man lived more than four years, death duties would have to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be carrying the degree of retrospection to the point of madness and it is quite wrong.  If section 24 has the meaning intended by the Minister, then the person who does not form the family company and makes a gift to his family without a device of this kind and who lives for more than three years and dies after the passing of this Act has his position preserved and death duties will not <Col N="380" /> have to be paid.  That is something that must be faced up to.  I suggest the Minister might look at it again. I am sure the Minister could not have intended not only to legislate retrospectively but also to make two distinct classes and to deal with one person in such a way that not only would he be made to pay something the law said he would not have to pay at the time but would be punished for something that was lawful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has proceeded on an assumption, and may I also proceed on another assumption?  If we can be satisfied that the same pattern as was followed in 1910 is followed here, subject to the changed ratio of one to three years and three to five years, I take it that if section 24 (4) achieves that for the purpose of section 18, Deputies opposite will be satisfied?</P>

      <P>While preserving our position.  Assuming that section 24 is as the Minister contends, would he be prepared to recommit section 18?  We would still feel that section 18 in its retrospective position is not only retrospective but may in certain circumstances, such as the example I have given, create a particularly adverse position for a person who had acted lawfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I do not think it would be fair to recommit section 18 on that basis.  There is a reference to section 2 of the Finance Act 1894&mdash;<Col N="381" /> this is the question of the imposition of duties from the date on which they would apply.  It relates to gifts made <i>inter vivos</i> and that must be read as amended by section 24.  Section 64, subsection (8) ensures this.  What I am saying is that what Deputies opposite seem to want is that the same relationship as the one year had to the three years in 1910 should apply to the three years and the five years that we are producing under this Bill.  I am satisfied that what we are doing is on all fours with what was done in 1910, subject to the ratio, but I would be prepared to look at it again between now and Report Stage to ensure that this is so.  I am satisfied it is; nevertheless, I do not think it would be fair to recommit section 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand what the Minister means by recommitting section 18.  Does he suggest that section 18 should follow the pattern of section 24?  We think it does not.  Again, for the sake of example, does he believe that subsection (3) of section 18 in effect reads &ldquo;where the deceased has after the 12th May, 1968 ... &rdquo; shall we say, which is three years after his Budget day or the passing of the Act, I do not mind which?  Is that not what he means?  Anyway, I think the Minister might admit that it would shorten discussion if he would agree to recommit to Committee the discussion on section 18, if he finds that his interpretation of words differs from ours, so that we can have a discussion then after both of us have looked into it, rather than today.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;the commencement of the receipt by the deceased of any such income or benefits&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;the incorporation of the company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is in relation to subsection (4).  A case can arise in which the wording of the section does not achieve what the Minister intended to achieve.  A period of five years here, of course, is an average period and is not a gift period, as we have just been discussing. Suppose, for example, we have the case of a company that was incorporated on this basis on 1st January, 1963, and that the person concerned dies on 31st December, 1966&mdash;so as to get away from the three years and the five years we have been discussing.  The position there is that the company has been in being for only four years and you cannot, therefore, in that case, take a five year average.  In this, the Minister takes the date to start as being the date on which income was paid to the deceased.  In the case I have in mind, no income was paid to the deceased in the years A, B and C, 1963, 1964 and 1965, and, in 1966, he was paid income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, on the true interpretation of the spirit of this section, the amount of income he was paid in 1966 should be averaged over the four years, but the Minister provides in that case for no average at all.  It is only the last year in which he received income that is taken into account.  It does seem wrong that where there may have been certain <Col N="383" /> very excellent reasons for the paying out of the amount, for example, to children in the earlier years and then perhaps, because of heavy illness or something like that, that something is paid out to the deceased in one particular year, that year is taken as the sole basis on which the slice of capital will be calculated.</P>
    <P>I agree that the averaging period, five years, is perfectly fair.  I think I agree that there must be a provision, in case five years have not run, for averaging purposes.  Otherwise the section could be meaningless in certain circumstances.  But, where you have not as long a period as five years, I suggest the spirit of the section should be to take your averaging from the commencement of the incorporation of the company rather than from the commencement of payment because if you take commencement of payment of the income alone, you can get an entirely lopsided position.</P>
    <P>Supposing, for example, no payment had been made in the case I gave up to the last year and that, in the last year, nothing was paid for the first quarter to the deceased, nothing was paid for the second quarter to the deceased and nothing was paid for the third quarter to the deceased, but, for the last quarter, a payment was made equivalent to one-quarter of the annual income, it seems to me that, in that case, an entire slice of the capital would be charged, on the wording of this section, even though only one-quarter of the income had been paid to him in that year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> It deals with the last line of page 15. The sub-paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>where the income or benefits purport to be or to include remuneration for services rendered by the deceased to the company, the Revenue Commissioners shall deduct from the said average annual amount such sum as appears to them to be reasonable remuneration in all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of getting complete clarification on one point, might I put this to the Minister?  If the words &ldquo;to them&rdquo; are left in, and a person goes to the court, is it clear that the court can say: &ldquo;That decision by the Revenue Commissioners was wrong&rdquo;? I am worried that, because the words &ldquo;to them&rdquo; are included, the court is restricted and cannot say that the Revenue Commissioners were wrong and can upset it only if the circumstances are such that the Revenue Commissioners should not have come to the conclusion they did.  I think the court should have an absolute freedom in deciding whether such sum is reasonable remuneration in all the circumstances of the case; in other words, that there would be a full appeal from a determination by the Revenue Commissioners and that the Revenue Commissioners would not be the last judges of what sum was reasonable.  I am afraid, as the subsection is phrased, it could be so held. I do not think the Minister would feel justified in standing over such an interpretation.</P>

On the strict interpretation of the section, one <Col N="385" /> appeals against what is or is not the opinion.  These words were used right through the income tax statutory legislation ever since 1894.  I am advised the phrase appears to them to be reasonable.  It is exactly the same as the phrase &ldquo;which, in the opinion of is reasonable&rdquo;, In fact, the substance is appealable at all stages.

Could the Minister say to me why, &ldquo;as appears to be reasonable&rdquo; would not do all that is required in this section?  It seems to me that it would and it would get over any possibility of trouble.  Would the Minister examine this between now and Report Stage and we can have a discussion then, if necessary?</P>

It has been laid down over the years that they are not to be subject to duty, if they are of national importance, unless they are sold.  They are exempt under the provisions of section 15 (2) of the Finance Act, 1894 which says that pictures, prints, books, manuscripts, etc. as appear to <Col N="386" /> the Treasury to be of national, scientific or historic interest are exempt from duty.  That section is being carried out in our legislation. In every schedule of assets, there is a blank space for the purpose of inserting items that come under that heading. It seems to me that the articles themselves would not be liable to estate duty if they were held as articles.  Equally, in a company where they go back and treat the articles as being of importance rather than the shares in the company, the same exemption should apply.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the amendments which have been drafted in relation to this and certain other technical matters are not drawn up in the nicest and tidiest manner but I consider my amendment makes perfectly clear what I have in mind.  If the whole purpose of the Minister is to get behind the value of the shares and get to the value of the articles, the same exemption as is there for the articles should be included here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15.</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 16, line 16, to insert &ldquo;which were not bona fide incurred for full consideration in money or money's worth given by the relative to the company&rdquo; after &ldquo;deceased&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), page 16, line 23, after &ldquo;determined&rdquo; to add:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided however that the value of preference shares which carry no voting rights or which only carry voting rights when the dividend is in arrear, shall be computed on the basis of a capitalisation of the dividends paid and likely to be paid&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in respect of the valuation of shares provided by subsection (5) of this section.  The subsection provides that in the case of stock, shares or debentures in a non-trading company which is controlled by the deceased, the value, for all purposes of death duties, of the securities shall be such sum as would have been payable in respect of them to their owner of the company had been voluntarily wound up.  Very often, in the case of the company such as we are thinking of here, there are different types of shares.  Class A may be given to the sons and Class B to the daughters.  Class B shares have no value and the daughters have no rights in the winding up of the company. The effect, therefore, of the subsection is to give the shares held by the daughters a value which they could never have.  This means they will be assessable for duty in the case of valuation in winding up.  The shares are such that they could never really wind them up.  I included this in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The proper way of dealing with these non-voting shares is to compute their value on a capitalisation basis. If the Minister would prefer market value to the capitalisation value, it could be included, and I would be perfectly happy.  It is not right that they should be valued on a liquidisation basis when they have no right whatever to enforce a liquidation either by coming together with the other members of their class or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to what Deputy Sweetman states, when you are dealing with a private company, if A owns five per cent of the shares of the <Col N="388" /> company and has four brother owning 12 per cent each, then, on his death, his interest of five per cent is deemed to control this company.  In addition, the Bill provides that five per cent of the company controls it, whereas, in law, for winding up purposes, three-fourths of the shares control it, and all these shares will be valued in liquidation on a realisation value, although the shares in a public company are not so valued.  Further, if A controls the company with 75 per cent and another relation has one per cent, that one per cent has the value of controlling the company.  For the purposes of this section, control means 51 per cent of the company. I would like to know what control means in subsection (1) line 11.  There is no definition of control.</P>
      <P>There is a great discouragement set up here against brothers going into business.  When brothers are married and have separate families, nine times out of ten, they are further apart than businessmen coming together in a company.  This section will certainly have the effect of making brothers decide not to go into business with one another.  There is no incentive for brothers to be in business at all.  Right through the debate on these proposals, the Minister has said he favoured the father handing over to his family as soon as possible.  That is why five years was looked for instead of three years.  This section is completely changed, because, where a man has a family of age to take over, he hands his property over but is himself the practical owner.  At this stage the father is going to retire.  He passes over the whole control and retains ten per cent, 12 per cent or 13 per cent in pension.  The company is run by his family and the number of shares he holds as a pension are now deemed as controlling the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means he is taxed on the realisation or liquidation value of this company, not on the shares.  In a public company, you can have millions of reserves and still the shares are valued at the market value; but, in this, everything is added on.  The premises must be sold based on saleable value and nobody can sell it in <Col N="389" /> law unless he has 75 per cent to sell, or controls 75 per cent.  The Minister in this is parting families and there will no longer be the family business to give.  I think it is one of the harshest things in this whole Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the last point raised by Deputy P. Belton first.  He seems to have in mind trading companies but the subsection refers specifically to non-trading companies. The subsection does not say the company should be wound up.  It says that if in the circumstances the company were voluntarily wound up, then the hypothesis is that the Revenue Commissioners could revalue the shares.  The purpose of this subsection is to enable the Revenue Commissioners to get behind the face value of the shares and get down to what the real value is.  Accepting the amendment put forward by Deputy Sweetman would appear to open the way to avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, if the amendment were accepted, the main shareholder, the controller, I suppose, in this case, in the context of the Bill could allot to himself preference shares carrying an artifically low rate of interest.  It is not so much the winding up of the company we are interested in here as the death of that person.  The object of the subsection is to enable the Revenue Commissioners to see what is the true value of these shares, and make an assessment accordingly.  If the shares were, as I said, preference shares, carrying a low rate of interest, naturally enough, the value would be very low and would not be in accord at all with the income the deceased was in fact getting out of his property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not open the door to avoidance.  There is a lot of sloppy thinking here.  If preference shares carry a low rate of interest and that is the only income the man is receiving, why should he be charged more than the capitalisation value of the interest he is receiving?  If the position is that he has ordinary shares as well as preference shares, then the ordinary shares will rise in value as the value of the preference shares is depressed. If he is getting his income by means of a governing director's salary then he will be caught by subsection (4).  The plain fact of the matter is that the proper reading of subsection (4) and subsection (5) is that the Revenue Commissioners can get duty on more than the value of the company, and there is no other interpretation open.</P>
      <P>I am quite happy to accept the Minister's words&mdash;true value, market value&mdash;if he does not like capitalisation value.  The position appears clear to me that you are valuing something here at an entirely artificially high value for the purposes of getting duty, and that is all wrong.</P>

What the Minister is saying now is that &ldquo;true value&rdquo; is to be the value the Revenue Commissioners think they should get tax on and not the value of the shares themselves. Either words mean something or they do not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a holding company which is a non-trading company, one member of a family can have a five per cent share in it and in the subsidiary company and each of the brothers or nephews can have an aggregate of 12 per cent each.  In this case, if a person dies with five per cent, he is deemed to control that company and it is valued at a greater value; in other words, at a realisation value.  It must be; that is what the Bill says.  If that is the case, it would be valued at a higher rate altogether. In a public company, that does not happen.  In other words, you are giving advantage to big companies which nine times out of ten, are big English companies.  In Ireland, 90 per cent of the Irish-owned companies are small family-owned concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are different points.  I do not think it matters all that much because the words &ldquo;or indirectly&rdquo; occur also in subsection (1) of section 18.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (6).</P>
      <P>This is the one that affects the trading company and, in fact, subsection (6) of this section, as I understand it, is the one that deals with the most common case we have here in Ireland, the family company which has been built up over the years and the profits ploughed back from time to time.  The business is carried on, and the principal shares are held by the descendants of the original founder.  Very often in this case, there are relatives who are co-shareholders but not directors and who, in fact, have no say whatever in the affairs of the company.  Notwithstanding that fact, they are deemed in this subsection to be in control.</P>
      <P>So far as I understand the subsection, notwithstanding the fact that they have no say in the direction or control of the company, this Bill provides that they are valued as controlling shareholders.  In fact, the plain and unadorned purpose of this subsection is to overrule the Supreme Court decision in the Convoy Woollen Mills case.  There is no other purpose in the section except to beat the Supreme Court in the Convoy Woollen Mills case.  So far as I understand it, the decision of the Supreme Court is now overruled by subsection (6).  I do not think it is very creditable for the Minister for Finance to come in here and propose this subsection for the purpose of overruling the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me also that this will <Col N="393" /> have the effect of Revenue getting a greater valuation of the shares than the shares are actually worth, and I cannot see where the equity in that is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This applies again to the changing of the character of the company within a period of five years before the death.  It refers particularly to a person who has control of the company by reason of shares and who, in order to avoid death duties, splits up that control into a number of minority holdings, leaving something of a very small nature in his own possession, when he finds that the value of his shares would become subject to duty.  Again, where he does this breaking up of control by distributing a number of shares amongst his relatives and his family within a period of five years, that is deemed to be making gifts <i>inter vivos.</i>  The purpose of the section is to aggregate these small shareholdings so that for valuation purposes each would be regarded as part of a control holding.</P>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Sweetman's reference to the Convoy case is not quite right because the Supreme Court decision was that the man did not have a control holding originally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think that we were legislating here for drunken dukes avoiding taxation for the benefit of dissolute doxies.  We are, in fact, dealing with very respectable people living down the country and trying to avoid leaving their widows and children virtually destitute on their deaths. Let us take the ordinary farmer or shopkeeper who, by prudent living all his life, managed to build up a solvent company or a solvent enterprise, has <Col N="394" /> grown weary of being kicked around the place by the local bank manager, and is determined that he will plough back into the business or farm sufficient capital to permit him to say with his head erect that he is in a position now to kick in the door of any bank in the town in which he lives.  He arrives at the end of his life, or at the prospect of the end of his life, and he is faced with the appalling prospect that, having established his independence of the bank manager by his forbearance, thrift and care, he is now about to deliver his wife and family into the hands of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I say the Department of Finance deliberately, because the Revenue Commissioners carry out the laws we make very humanely, very courteously and very decently.  If, in effect, we impose on the Revenue Commissioners the obligation to pursue the widows, and children, and families, of these people with whips and thongs, to extract from them the maximum we can by way of death duties, what that means is that without breaking up the provision the fathers made for them during their lives, it is impossible for them to meet the demands made on them.</P>
      <P>If the credit situation is easy, it may be possible for them to go to the bank and get an advance to meet the obligation which we are in the process of providing here by way of death duties, and pay them off over the years by a joint family effort, without breaking up the family assets.  But do we want to do that?  Is there anything wrong in a thrifty individual with a wife and family, when he reaches the autumn of his days, seeking to divide his property among his wife, children and relatives in such a way as to avoid their being crippled by estate duties and death duties when he comes to die?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister may say that I have overlooked the fact that in making provision in section 18 he is trying to finance certain concessions he has in mind for widows and dependent children, but taking the whole picture of the discussions which proceeded heretofore on the amendments <Col N="395" /> proposed to the section, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are living in a country where there are not any dissolute dukes.</P>
    <P>Sir William Harcourt introduced this whole scheme of death duties in Gladstone's last Budget in the late nineties for the purpose of making the big landed proprietors of England liable to taxation which at that time they substantially avoided.  I believe that at the time Sir William Harcourt had in mind people like the Duke of Westminster who owned half of London, and other persons who drew vast revenue from the landed estates of rural England.  As the years have rolled by, death duties and these other duties have come to affect a greater and wider section of the community. They were incorporated in our legislation in the nineties of the last century and have remained part of our taxation structure ever since.</P>
    <P>Surely the time has come when the Minister should ask himself if, in following the British code of the Labour administration which is primarily concerned to prevent tax avoidance, it constitutes the same kind of evil as it may constitute in Britain. We know that in Great Britain every duke and marquis is a limited liability company and all sorts of strange devices are operated by very wealth men to establish companies and avoid taxation within the law and that highly-paid accountants and advisers spend the greater part of their time examining the Finance Acts of England to provide loopholes for these people.  Nobody here wants to assist any shrewd individual to avoid his fair share of taxation, but in our zeal to achieve that end, do we want to make it impossible for an individual to leave to his wife and family a viable inheritance by way of a business of farm which has to be carried on?  I think the Minister ought to pause and recognise that he may be creating a situation in which no family business or farm can be carried on if we continue to press the inheritance or estate duty aspect of our taxation system.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the changing <Col N="396" /> world in which we live we have all suddenly come to the conclusion that the whole social pattern of our country should be torn up and that we should adopt the British social pattern.  Do we want that?  Every Deputy knows that there is in this country a vast number of relatively small family business and a vast number of small farms compared with the situation in Great Britain.  By small farms, I mean farms of 100, 200 and 300 acres on which families live.  Is that the social pattern we wish to preserve or do we want to destroy it?  I put it to the Minister that the lines he is travelling at present are calculated to make the operation of a family business or family farm impossible.  It is time we took a look at this whole situation and determined, as a policy, whether those are the lines on which we wish to proceed.</P>
    <P>I think they are bad lines: I do not accept the proposition that everything that is new and foreign is better than the system we have built up for ourselves.  There is a great danger in blindly following precisely what the revenue authorities may do in Britain or in Germany, France, Belgium or Holland.  We have a different type of society and I think ours is the better and more stable type and one of the greater stabilising influences in our society is the family business and the family farm.  I speak by analogy when I say this whole tendency to proletarianise all property in the country is wrong.  We are losing sight of the family until and I think the more we depart from it the greater injury we do the foundations on which our society stands.</P>
    <P>It is hard, in the context of section 18, which is the operative section, and the various amendments put down to it, to determine what is exactly the appropriate point at which to make the point I am now submitting, but I suggest to the Minister that, without recapitulating the whole argument when we come to consider the situation in its entirely, it is appropriate now to ask ourselves what we are trying to do.  Do we want the family business and family farm made impossible of survival?  If we do, we <Col N="397" /> are going the right way about it: if we do not, I suggest we should stop and consider whether, in following every development of British revenue law, we are serving the best interests of the kind of society we have built up in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has gone rather outside the specific terms of the subsection, although he could not be held to be out of order as this subsection is part of the whole structure of estate duty, but what is involved here is the family company, as he said, and the man who has the controlling interest giving that control or this interest to members of his family in such a way that if he had not done that, when he died his interest would be subject to a certain amount of estate duty.  But in order to avoid the payment of that amount of estate duty, he splits up his control and gives a quarter here, a quarter there and a quarter somewhere else and still retains a quarter for himself. These are separate gifts <i>inter vivos</i> if he dies within five years and the value of these smaller portion or shares individually will be the value for estate duty purposes and will be far less than if all those shares were held in the one controlling hand.  If he splits up his control in this way five years before his death, they are regarded as gifts <i>inter vivos</i> and <i>prima facie</i> at any rate&mdash;possibly more than <i>prima facie</i>&mdash;he has done it deliberately to avoid payment of the larger sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept substantially what the Minister very reasonably says: he is disarming in that he is so reasonable and anxious to explain the position.  I have the uncomfortable feeling that the Minister is in substantial agreement with this side of the House but does not care to say so.  Do we regard it as a criminal offence, or as an action which legislative steps should be taken to prevent for the future, for a father, who has had to exercise for bearance all his life, restrict his own spending and keep his family within certain limits and point out the necessity of making the farm viable and the family independent of the controllers of credit, to call his family around him in the autumn of his days and say: &ldquo;I am approaching three score years and ten and will shortly be living on borrowed time.  We ought to get together and determine how we are to carry on the business?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If he does not do that, when he comes to die, if he leaves everything to his wife or to the eldest child or, as the Minister says, leaves the property to be aggregated for the purpose of death duty, what happens is that his widow gets a business or a farm which, to make it viable, requires the capital that is in it but she is called upon to pay over to the Revenue Commissioners £10,000.  Where is the to get the £10,000?  At the present moment she could not get sixpence from a bank.  There is no place she can get it except by breaking up the business or breaking up the farm.</P>
      <P>The alternative is that the man in question calls his family around him and says: &ldquo;I am going to leave the wife such and such a provision and John, so much, and Mary, so much, and you may as well have it now as have it later on&rdquo;.  He divides it up and divides it up avowedly for the purpose of putting them in a position to meet a lesser charge than would otherwise fall on the aggregation of the family fortune that he built up so that they can carry on.  Is there anything wrong in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got the feeling that the Government are building up a picture <Col N="399" /> that a man who accumulates a family business is a quasi-criminal.  Is he? I have been reared to believe that such a person was an admirable citizen and somebody deserving of praise.  The best situated citizen under this code of law as it closes in upon us is the man who in his 60th year says: &ldquo;Let us be merry, for to-morrow we may die.  Let us all go out and have a whoop-a-doop and we will leave the Revenue in the position that when they come to assess my estate, there will be nothing in it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Do we want to promote that kind of approach?  I do not think it is a good approach to this whole problem at all and I would like to hear the Minister tell me, if it is the Government's view that the practice of building up a viable family business and so distributing it in the lifetime of the parent that it will be viable for the family after his death is a type of tax avoidance which the Government think it expedient to stop by law? Because I do not think it is.  I should like to see that kind of thrift and prudence promoted but I think the tendency at present manifesting itself here and abroad for everybody to spend everything they can get their hands on and borrow as much more as they can and spend that, too, is catching up with society in Great Britain, the United States of America and elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to put the case that if we pursue what appears to me the underlying philosophy of the trend manifested in section 18 and in the Minister's general approach to this Bill, that is the rational thing to do; there is no use exercising self-restraint and economising and living within your means if you are faced with the inevitable consequence when you come to die.  Nobody hopes to take it with him.  Nobody is hoping to go to heaven, purgatory or hell, taking it with them.  The normal thing is to make provision for your parents, your family or your widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now appearing to take up <Col N="400" /> the position that we regard that as dishonourable, something that we ought to put an end to.  I do not.  I have much more respect for the man who lives within his income and frowns on the members of the family who clamour that they should spend everything as quickly as possible.  If the trend of section 18 is to be pursued, what parent can honestly say to his children who clamour that they should have motor cars, colour television and anything else they can put their hands on, that we simply cannot afford it if we are to leave the family business viable after the parent has gone?  The answer is that there is not the least use in doing that because, no matter what you do, the Government will take a great part of it, whereas, if we spend it now, we will have the enjoyment.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties is that once a Minister gets the bit between his teeth and starts travelling a line of country like this, he is very loth to turn back.  I would like to ask the Minister this specific question: does he think it a good thing for a family firm or a family farm to be passed on to the family after the father dies in circumstances which make it possible for the family to carry on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreed on that, and we would envisage a family arrangement which would dower the daughters and allow one or two brothers to look after their mother and carry on the enterprise.  I put it to the Minister, if that is to be done in a family farm, is not some kind of family settlement before the father dies a necessary and desirable precaution? I emphasise &ldquo;necessary and desirable&rdquo; from the point of view of the society to which we all belong.  If the Minister is prepared to accept that proposition, which I think flows inevitably from his agreement with me about the first proposition I have made, why are we legislating to make that which is necessary and desirable virtually impossible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is whither we are unconsciously stumbling and we are <Col N="401" /> stumbling along in that direction because we have followed the British legislation which is designed to meet an entirely different social pattern.  I earnestly press on the Minister the proposition that we here in Ireland have worked out for ourselves and our circumstances a better social pattern than the British have succeeded in working out and a better social pattern than is emerging in post-war Germany or, indeed, in the post-war continent of Europe.  I urge on him that he is mistaken in moving in the direction in which he is at present undoubtedly moving, that is, the extinction of the family business and the family farm and, mind you, they are complicated and in many ways abstruse social consequences.  I do not want now to engage in a dissertation, and tax the patience of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle by engaging in any dissertation, on the anthropological aspect of our rural society, but they are there.  They ought to be considered and changes in our taxation policy which are calculated to disrupt that pattern ought to be undertaken only with a full realisation of their consequences.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is in substantial agreement with the arguments I am putting forward but finds himself caught in a dialectic that we are bound to follow the general pattern which has emerged in Great Britain.  I do not think we are and I do not think we should.  I would like the Minister now to look at the whole philosophy underlying section 18 and reconsider the amendments that have been here submitted in the light of a review of that philosophy on which this whole scheme is founded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think 75 per cent should still be deemed to control a company for the purposes of this section.  If a man dies and leaves shares to his family, these shares are valued; because the aggregate of the shares is 51 per cent, the people concerned may be forced to sell.  They would not have enough money to pay death duty.  If they are forced to sell, they must sell on share value only, not on liquidation value.  Because they do not own 75 per cent of the company, <Col N="402" /> they cannot sell the shares at the value of the Revenue Commissioners.  All the shares aggregated together owned by them amount to only 51 per cent.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with control and the only way in which a person or group should be deemed to have control is when that person or group hold 75 per cent and the shares are valued on realisation basis.  If that is the position, they will be able to sell; but that will not be the position under this Bill.  Under company law at the moment, 75 per cent means one can sell the premises, but 51 per cent does not.  A holding of 51 per cent therefore cannot be regarded as a controlling interest, even if the holding is held by a group.</P>

      <P>Certain other matters have been discussed in relation to this amendment but the amendment asking for the deletion of subsection (6) deals primarily with the position of the family company, the family company with which we are all familiar throughout the whole of this country.  Subsection (6) is designed to hit that company, and the members of it, in an entirely unfair way.  While I accepted the view the Minister first expressed at column 1337 of volume 216 of the Official Report of 23rd June last in relation to Financial Resolution No. 18, I am bound to say now that the more he goes on, the more I am beginning to wonder whether I was right in initially accepting his <i>bona fides.</i>  I am beginning to wonder now whether the Minister was telling us the whole facts when he said he wanted to make it clear that no proposal was ever put to him.  I doubt very much indeed that anybody put down that Resolution without his signed authority and, the more we go on discussing this subsection today, the more I am inclined to think that we are witnessing the same mentality in it.  For that reason, as this affects family companies all over the country, I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In subsection (8) to add at the end of the subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;unless the same was incurred <Col N="404" /> for services rendered or under a service agreement where the amount in question was paid <i>bona fide</i> for such services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) of this section deals with the question of disposition to or for the benefit of a relative.  I can visualise a case in which a brother of the deceased, who had no share <Col N="405" /> interest previously in the company but was acting as solicitor or accountant to the company, could be forced under the wording of subsection (8) to pay duty in respect of the capitalised value of the remuneration he had been given for his services to the company.  That obviously should not be.  In fact, it is something I do not think the Minister intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it what the Deputy has in mind is a disposition in the form of payment for services. In that case I understand the amendment is unnecessary because of section 3 of the 1894 Act, which exempted property passing on the death of a person by reason of a <i>bona fide</i> purchase:</P>
      <P>where any such purchase was made, or lease or annuity granted, for full consideration in money or money's worth.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) The provisions applicable to quick succession relief shall apply to duty chargeable under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not terribly happy about this amendment.  At first reading it appeared a situation could arise in respect of which there would be a quick succession.  If it is on the principle we discussed before, that we were going back behind the value of the shares to the value of the property, it is appropriate that quick succession should operate.  But, on a subsequent reading of the section, I am not entirely satisfied that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has in mind is contained in section 15 of the Finance Act, 1914, where it is provided that when</P>
      <P>estate duty has become payable on any property consisting of land or a business (not being a business carried on by a company), or any interest in land or such business, passing upon the death of any person, and that subsequently within five years estate duty has again become payable on the same property or any part thereof</P>
      <P>the duty on the second part should be abated.  Under this section the business does not pay tax.  I do not think it would be applicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>May I put a case to the Minister?  A transfers the business to the company and gives some of the shares to his son B and to C and so forth.  A dies within the period and the shares he had given to his son B become liable for duty and the way in which those shares are valued is to go back and value the business and treat the gift of the shares to B as being a gift of a proportion of the business to B.  Then if B dies within the five years provided, there should be a similar quick succession relief because I think the Revenue would get duty again.  I am not very clear on it, I may say.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister, first of all, to explain what is intended in line 31 by the words &ldquo;or indirectly&rdquo; which also come into subsection (6), line 35, on page 16.  The first place they appear, however, is in line 31 and I want to know (a) what is intended and (b) who decides: is it the Revenue Commissioners or the courts?  Again, I want to know what does the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; mean in line 31 of page 14?  Does it mean in excess of 50 per cent or does it mean a higher percentage?  I want clarification also on who is to determine the words &ldquo;by any other means whatever&rdquo; in line 43 on page 14.  Who is to decide that?  Is it to be the Revenue Commissioners at their absolute decision or is the court to be entitled to look back to it and see whether it does not conform to the principles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that the word &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; in line 31, on page 15, has no definition and that for the similar word in the British legislation which we are copying&mdash;we are copying all the bad points and not taking some of the good ones out of it&mdash;there is a vast definition of &ldquo;benefits&rdquo;.  These are contained in the <Col N="408" /> British Finance Act, 1946 and in the Finance Act, 1947.  I find it difficult to understand whether the phrase &ldquo;otherwise than for full consideration&rdquo; in subsection (5) of section 19, is in fact imported into subsection (4) of section 18, paragraph (b), subparagraph (i).  I have a good few more questions but I think that is enough for the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I will produce some more points.  What does &ldquo;control&rdquo; mean?  Deputy P. Belton raised this in regard to section 18 (1) &ldquo;Control&rdquo; under the Companies Act can be 51 per cent and in certain aspects of the Control of Manufactures Act and it can be two-thirds in certain other circumstances, or it can be the percentage required for the passing under the Companies Act, 1963 of a special resolution, which is 75 per cent of those entitled to vote and intending to vote.  May I also go back to the five year and three year period which we were discussing earlier and which is mentioned in subparagraph (b) of the definition in subsection (1) of a company controlled by a deceased?  Does that three years follow the pattern of section 59 of the Finance Act 1910 which we discussed at some length this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I refer also to subsection (2) to &ldquo;the majority of the voting power or shares&rdquo;?  Does that include shares that only get the right to vote in certain circumstances, such as where a dividend has not been paid?  Is it clear in subsection (4) that the holder of an office is the definition of an <Col N="409" /> officer under the Companies Act 1963?  There is no definition here nor, I think, in the Finance Act of 1894, of the holder of an office but there is a definition of the officer of a company in the Companies Act, 1963, sections 174 and 175.  Supposing, in subsection (4), a house is let on a full rack rent to an officer of the company. Is it clear in such cases, when he is paying the full rack rent, that his family will not have to pay in addition, if he is unfortunate enough to die in the period that is covered here?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The spouse exemption retained by section 14 of the Finance Act, 1914, shall be given in respect of duty payable under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with discretionary trusts and with liability for estate duty <Col N="410" /> in respect of funds that remain within the discretionary trust.  As I understand the matter, if a discretionary trust of a certain amount is set up and the settler in the discretionary trust provides that the income from the fund can be paid to his children, it is usual also to provide that it can also be paid to the wives of the children and the issue of the children as well.  In the case I have in mind, if the income from half the fund is paid to child A, then, on the death of child A, a slice of the discretionary trust fund is taken equivalent to half the income, which would be half the fund.  Duty, on the death of that child, is payable on that fund.</P>
    <P>Though nobody likes paying duty, I must confess that I find the method by which the value is taken of the discretionary trust funds deemed to pass not to be an unfair one in respect of that first death.  That having been done, duty has been paid on half the fund.  The discretionary trustees then go on, after the death of child A, to pay the income from what is the equivalent of half the fund to the widow of child A for her life and then she comes to die.  If this were not a discretionary trust but were an absolute trust, then there would be no death duty on the widow's death.  The second spouse would be exempted by reason of the provision of section 14 of the Finance Act, 1914.  But, in this case, it is a different situation.  We are valuing the slice of the capital by reference to the amount of income paid out and, while the slice would have paid, and properly paid, duty on the death of child A, it would not obtain the spouse exemption and would fall to be valued for slicing on the second death in so far as the income again represented a proportion of the fund.</P>
    <P>I know that subsection (2) of section 5 of the Finance Act, 1894, exempts property that has already borne duty but the effect of that subsection in this would be only to exempt half the fund that fell for duty on the death and, in respect of the other half, there would be a second claim for estate duty following the death of the spouse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Let me admit quite frankly to the Minister that it is an even more complicated transaction than some of the other ones that we have made.  However, because he is adopting the slice method in relation to the discretionary trust, there is no doubt that we have to take the slice of the whole fund that is under the discretionary trust. That means therefore that to the extent of one moiety of the fund in which the son first, the widow, secondly, got a life interest, duty will be charged which would not be charged if the spouse exemption were provided here as it was for regular trust property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The same exemption as is provided by section 14 of the Finance Act, 1914, as regards an enforceable annuity under a non-discretionary trust, would apply here to section 19 and relates to discretionary trusts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a question on subsection (2).  I have heard two different cases argued on this in relation to subsection (2). One argument is that because of the provisions of this section, you can never wind up a discretionary trust at all.  If you try to wind it up and any of the people to whom you give the fund dies within a period of five years afterwards, there would be a claim for duty on the trustees.  Therefore, they must retain a part of the fund to meet that claim and, equally, during the period during which they retain the fund.  Therefore, it is going round in circles in <i>saecula saeculorum.</i></P>
      <P>That was my reading of the section and it was so read by an eminent counsel.  I do not think it is entirely accurate because I think the position is governed by subsection (2) where it says that the trustees &ldquo;select and one or more of those persons dies or die during the continuance of the discretionary trust fund&rdquo;.  If you wind up a discretionary trust by paying the funds to people who are alive at the date you pay them, there cannot be any liability afterwards in respect of that sum so paid when those people die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It means the Revenue are getting it twice if that interpretation is not right.  If there is a wind up by making <Col N="413" /> a discretionary trust fund to a person who is alive, and if there is still liability under section 19, the person has got the money into his own hands, and if so, he has got to pay duty on it.  It would not obviously be equitable that he would also pay the discretionary trust provision.  I would like, therefore, if the Minister would confirm that as long as the trustees pay the capital of the fund to one of the beneficiaries in whose benefit the trust fund is, when that person is alive, then there cannot be any liability for duty in so far as the discretionary trust is concerned.  When that person dies afterwards, there will, of course, be liability in respect of his free assets and in respect of the discretionary trust fund.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>Before section 20 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of chargeability for estate duty a mortgage of land or other property situate outside the State shall be regarded and treated as movable property.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe the note put at the end of this amendment says that acceptance of the amendment involves the deletion of section 20.  I do not know whether that is correct or not.  As I said on Second Reading, it appears to me that the object of section 20 is to deal with the Jersey mortgage and to that extent its object is to deal with another device for the purpose of getting out of the liability for death duties.  We are concerned, however, with what appears to be the general scope of the section. We also are concerned with what may well be the effect of a section of so general a nature as this on the <Col N="414" /> domicile of choice of a number of people over a number of years who have invested, or may indeed invest money in this country.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me or any other Deputy, to remind the Minister for Finance that at this time we cannot afford to have a disappearance of cash and a flight of capital from the country itself.  There is not only an overriding need to preserve what we have but clearly it is becoming apparent we need a great deal more than we possess.  If the fears we entertain are justified that section 20 may have the effect of frightening people who already have a domicile base here or who may be contemplating such a step, then obviously, whatever tax evasion is involved, it creates a situation in which we may lose in the long run.  May I remind the Minister, as I did on Second Reading, that under the 1949 British Finance Act, when they took a step similar to this, it had the result in England that quite a number of wealthy people proceeded to change their domicile.  One of those people was the proprietor of <i>The Times.</i>  That was the result in England, which may have been able to absorb the loss and weather the storm but I doubt if we could afford to set up a similar trend here.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I have endeavoured in this amendment, and I do not say it is the proper way to deal with it, to suggest that some effort should be made, if we want to deal with the mortgage of property where the law of the land where the property is situate holds the property to be immovable property, to legislate in those terms and not try to do something which may have an unintended effect and may widen the scope of what is being done.  I therefore tabled this amendment so that there might be a discussion and an explanation as to whether it is possible to narrow the scope of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this section is, as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has said, to catch what is commonly known as the Jersey mortgage and, in relation to that, we must all agree that the Minister is perfectly entitled to legislate and provide that a Jersey mortgage will be liable to duty here.  I say a Jersey mortgage because this is the normal form that is used.  There may be a Guernsey mortgage or a Sark mortgage or an Isle of Man mortgage in the same category but I do not know.  If, by the law of any other country, what we consider personal estate is deemed to be immovable estate, then I think it is fair and proper for the Minister to assess such for duty because, in fact, it is merely taking these mortgages as a means of avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, however, that the same position arises in what I call genuine immovable property and, particularly, it is not right in a case where we have not a Double Taxation Agreement with the country concerned. The case of immovable property <i>per se</i> very often arises where somebody in this country is left such property in the other country and I think the Minister, by providing that such immovable property is liable to duty here, is flying rather in the face of international law.  The British Finance Act of 1962 which dealt with this in, I think, section 28, did not go so far, as far as my information goes, as the Minister has gone.  I think the British Act rather provided, first, for the case where the immovable property was, in fact, personal property like the Jersey mortgage and, as well as that, provided for the case where it had been purchased by the deceased.  But this section covers not merely property which has been purchased by the deceased but property to which the <Col N="416" /> deceased has become entitled by any other means.</P>
    <P>There is in the British Finance Act, 1962, also, I think by virtue of section 29, provision for a double taxation agreement which does not appear to be here.  Because of that, it would seem to me that it would be desirable that an amendment, either on the lines of that put down by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, or on the lines I have put down, would be fair in all the circumstances, catching the avoidance case, and will not hurt the genuine person who has succeeded to property abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies have observed, those provisions were primarily designed to catch the Jersey mortgages and rightly so, as the Deputies opposite agree.  There will also be cases where people can go to some other countries and invest in mortgages of genuine immovable property, in countries which may have a very low estate duty or none at all.  I thought it was not unreasonable to seek to tax that property on death. However, now to prove that I am capable of second thoughts, I am beginning to have second thoughts about this.  I think it might be reasonable to limit the section to Jersey mortgages and, while I would not like to go as far as Deputy J.A. Costello's amendment, I think where the purpose of this amendment is to limit the scope of the section to Jersey mortgages, I shall think more about it.  I am inclined to agree and I shall bring in a suitable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section correctly, it means as the section is drawn that if the gift is made at any time&mdash;even more than five years ago&mdash;there is a liability attaching.  I do not know whether or not I misunderstand it, but it seems that there is a liability, no matter when the gift was made.  That may be qualified by subsection (3) but I should like the Minister to consider <Col N="418" /> it when he is considering the other matter.</P>
      <P>Another question is: is the effect of paragraph (b) of subsection (4) to make an executor liable even though he has not enough funds under his jurisdiction?  There could be a case under the section in which a person would have very little assets here and substantial assets abroad.  The substantial assets abroad might not vest in the executor, and the executor would be personally liable for the amount of duty payable, even though he had not enough funds in his hands to pay the duty as the personal representative for the property in Ireland. If that is so, that case should be provided for also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  We appreciate the fact that he will give the matter further consideration or, as he described it, that he will have second thoughts.  A great deal of the discussion here on Second Stage was on the position of wealthy people who have come here, or wealthy people we are anxious to attract because of their investments here, or because of the fact that they bring artistic treasures or some other benefit of a particular kind.</P>
      <P>While it is very desirable from that point of view that we should attract that type of person, I think the Minister might well consider the position of people who are either long resident in this country, or who are Irish by origin, and who have considerable investments here both in property and in business and who also have property outside the State.  As Deputy Sweetman said, in many cases that property was acquired because some relative, or some other person in close contact with them, left the property to them, or in some cases they may have acquired it themselves.  We should consider, if necessary, the special position of these people and, if need be, we should possibly have a different approach to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment the fact that we are most anxious to attract to this country and facilitate in every way possible people who are bringing wealth to this country and <Col N="419" /> making investments of one sort or another, we should consider the special category of Irish people who because of one circumstance or another&mdash;and there cannot be a great many of them &mdash;have property elsewhere, and also have investments and involvements in industrial development in this country, which are not merely considerable but in many cases are of long standing.</P>
    <P>In discussing a matter of this type, one does not like to mention names of individuals for many reasons, but it is easy to recognise the type of person concerned and their value to the community for a great many years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Any sum paid by the deceased to enable him to acquire the property or an estate therein may be deducted from the value on which duty is payable under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 21 is, I think, the section that deals with enlargement of life interest, and it follows section 30 of the Finance Act, 1941, which dealt with the disposition or determination of life interest.  It seems to me that some difficulty could arise in respect of the effect of this section in a case such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose for example that there is a fund the total value of which is £50,000.  The tenant for life gets the appropriate actuarial calculation and the value to the remainder man is determined and agreed between the tenant for life and the remainder man at, let us say, £15,000.  The tenant for life pays the remainder man £15,000 and he is enlarged, and he has a fund in hand of £50,000.  It is understandable <Col N="420" /> where he had the £15,000 to pay to the remainder man, but I am interested in the case where the tenant for life has not got £15,000 and where he goes to a bank, for example, and borrows £15,000 for the purpose of buying out the remainder man, and he then has property worth £50,000 in hands.  Now, it is not clear under this section that he is entitled to make a deduction for the debt he incurs in respect of that property, and had to incur for the purpose of buying in the whole property.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill that in certain circumstances one is not entitled to claim as a deduction a debt incurred in that way.  That is obviously wrong.  If the person has his own free estate and uses it for the purpose of buying out the remainder man, his free estate is reduced by that amount, and the value of the property he has bought is added.  If he has not his own money and has to borrow money to buy in, the sum so borrowed by him should be allowed in the calculation of the value of the property he bought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal first with the second point raised by Deputy Sweetman about the free estate.  I forget the figure taken by Deputy Sweetman but let us say the property is worth £40,000 and the value of the interest is £15,000.  If the person has a free estate out of which he buys in the remainder man's interest, it would be natural for him to seek to reduce the value of his free estate by that sum.  The purpose of the section is to avoid such a thing happening.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I dealt with the matter of home assistance and the attitude of many public assistance authorities in the matter of these payments. I do not propose to repeat <Col N="421" /> myself but I again suggest that while the Minister has no direct responsibility, he has overall responsibility for the alleviation of distress and poverty. I therefore submit he should consider introducing some scheme of national assistance such as they have in Britain. While there is legal responsibility on public assistance authorities to come to the aid of those in need, they do not seem to be aware of or to accept the responsibility put on them by law. They have also a moral responsibility which, in my opinion, they do not discharge to a proper degree.</P>
      <P>I should be far better pleased, and have much more confidence in a Minister for Social Welfare, no matter to what Party he belonged, if he tackled this problem and accepted responsibility more fully than has been the case.  Unfortunately there still appears to be an assumption that in this country nobody can starve.  I do not wish to exaggerate poverty.  Suffice it to say that there is poverty.  It may not be widespread but if only one person is left in need of assistance, the Minister and the public assistance authorities must have regard for that person's needs.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the situation in my Budget speech.  At that time I welcomed the proposed increases.  I do not wish to repeat what I said then but I again suggest to the Minister that his attitude in giving these increases should be maintained so that in three years or five years we shall not have him pointing to 1965 and to the substantial increase then given. Social welfare benefits and public assistance generally should be kept in step with whatever increases there may be in the cost of living or improvement in the workers' standard of living through increases in wages and salaries under national agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House recently passed a general motion to the effect that social welfare benefits and public assistance payments should be kept in line with increases in the cost of living and general improvements in living standards of wage-earners.  There are objectionable features in some of the proposals of this Bill.  Frankly, we in the Labour Party do not like the means test.  It <Col N="422" /> seems to me the Minister is the only person who has endeavoured to justify the new means test.  Deputies, even from his Party, during the Budget debate expressed dissatisfaction with this retrograde step.  There was a feeling when the contributory old age pensions were introduced that the means test, if not abolished, should be modified to a great extent.  There is also the factor that many people who saw the announcement in the newspapers assumed, particularly in the case of widows, that the 10/- increase from 1st August next would apply to them.  If I heard or read the Minister correctly, it seems to be the position that 30 per cent of the beneficiaries will not get 10/- but only 5/-.  That will be a big disappointment to them. As this is an administrative matter, I should like the Minister to comment on it.  Will there be a general provision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">

      <P>The information is available in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister anticipated the question.  Since the Budget proposals, has there been a general revision of all means and will the increase of 10/- or 5/- be given on the last known means on record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That will make it handier for social welfare officers.  Not to labour the point, I submit that the Minister should consider in future the payment of these increases from an earlier date than has been the practice heretofore.  The same applied when I was Minister for Social Welfare and when others apart from the present Minister filled the position.  I suggest we should now make some effort to give the increases much earlier after the Budget announcement.  We all appreciate that there is much work to be done in the Department before the increases can be given&mdash;legislation has to be passed through the Oireachtas authorising the payments&mdash;but it is the feeling of the House that 1st August is far too late.  There is the added incentive to pay the increases earlier when we realise we are dealing <Col N="423" /> with people who are more than 70 years of age.  Some of them are 80 or 90 years old and they can only look forward to perhaps a week or a month, not knowing when death will occur. It is a bit trying for them to wait for upwards of four months for the payment of these increases.</P>
      <P>On the question of the proposed increases, I have heard criticism outside that we are spending far too much money on social welfare, on health and on education.  Perhaps the Minister can verify the information I am about to give.  I do not put this against him: I give it for the benefit of those who say that too much money is spent on those items.  As far as social welfare, health and education are concerned, the proportion of State expenditure has fallen from 19.8 per cent in 1959-60 to 16 per cent in 1965-66. Therefore, the proportion of State expenditure on those items has fallen by 3.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>In other years I pointed out that as a proportion of tax revenue, expenditure on social welfare has been falling during the past five or six years.  As far as social welfare, health and education are concerned the proportion of tax revenue has fallen by four per cent from 38 per cent in 1959-60.  Let nobody get it into his head that we are lashing money around in the fields of social welfare, health and education.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's proposals, has the proportion in relation to the Social Insurance Fund been changed by comparison with the position under the 1952 Act, that is, the proportion of one-third contributed by the State, one-third contributed by the employer and one-third contributed by the employee? I am assuming that the proportion is the same unless the Minister can inform us otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Party believe that the contribution required from the employer should be greater.  It is 50 per cent of the cost of the insurance stamp affixed to the card.  Under the new proposals, the price of the stamp for the industrial worker will be 14/8d. per week, meaning 7/4d. for the worker.  That <Col N="424" /> is a pretty substantial amount of his pay packet and the Minister should consider asking more from the employer as contribution.  This may be regarded as a fringe benefit of employment and an employer has a certain amount of responsibility for those whom he employs.  I think it was Deputy Declan Costello who, the other day, gave us information to the effect that in most other countries in Western Europe where there is any sort of social welfare scheme, the employer pays the bulk of the contribution. Our employers get away very lightly and we should insist on a bigger contribution from them.  So far as I know, a proportion of the full insurance contribution is allowed for the purpose of income tax deductions under PAYE.  The Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the whole contribution will be allowable.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that employment period orders should be scrapped.  I do not know how they can be justified, particularly at present.  They were introduced on the assumption that in the summer period, from March to October, I think, and in the second period, from June to October, there was plenty of employment in rural areas and that a single man did not need any assistance from the State by way of unemployment assistance.  That is very wrong and unfair.  In this Bill the Minister is alleviating the case of a man in the rural areas in certain scheduled counties for the purpose of unemployment assistance.  I do not know how much that will cost: probably the Minister has given the figure already, but, in view of the fact that there is little employment in rural areas now, the employment period orders which debar single men from unemployment assistance should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>In any case, one of the qualifications for unemployment assistance is that the applicant must show evidence that he is seeking employment and anybody who does not want to work in the rural areas can easily be recognised by the social welfare officer, and if it is proved that he is not genuinely seeking work, the deciding officer has, <Col N="425" /> and, subsequently, the appeals officer has, power to deprive him of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Congratulate&rdquo; is a hefty word to use but I want to thank the Minister for the improvement he has made in the form of a decision recently in respect of the recognition of anonymous letters received in his Department alleging that a man was drawing benefit or assistance and at the same time working.  This seems a small thing to most people but I know all the annoyance it can cause.  The Minister seems to appreciate what hardship it has caused in that when an anonymous letter is received, the case must be investigated: that may take up to five or six months and in that period the man is deprived of unemployment assistance.  The Minister's decision meets the case so far as out criticism of anonymous letters is concerned, and we are grateful to him for it.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to annoy the Minister again about workmen's compensation. He has behaved very badly in that regard.  I am not talking about the new comprehensive scheme he is proposing.  That has yet to be introduced. We have not got it this session, although we have been asking for it for the past 12 or 18 months.  I do not know if we shall get it in this financial year or next but it will take quite a while to have it approved by the Dáil and Seanad and in the meantime the maximum payment for workmen's compensation is £4 10s. 0d. per week.  I do not know how the Minister can justify it.  We have spent hours to-day and yesterday discussing part of a Finance Bill which the Minister says will give extra revenue to the State of £50,000.  We have had detailed arguments and have spent hours discussing something which, while relatively important, is not at all as important as the payment that should be made to a man disabled during work.</P>
    <P>What we have suggested is simple and reasonable: as a temporary measure, the Minister should bring in a short Bill to relieve the plight of these people.  That would not take as long to discuss as a small amendment <Col N="426" /> such as we had here today on section 18 of the Finance Bill.  We think that Bill should propose that workmen's compensation be increased to a certain amount and provide also for lump sum settlements.  That could all be done, if not in five lines, at least in a two-page Bill.  It is too late in this session to expect that the Minister would move to do that but if consideration of the new Bill will take months or if its introduction is delayed for another six or 12 months, the Minister should consider for the first business of the Dáil after the summer recess the introduction of a workmen's compensation measure more or less on the lines we suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief observations on this measure and on the Estimate we are taking with it. This, of course, as far as the measure is concerned, is the mere perennial effort to match the cost of living increases by giving increases in social welfare benefits.  It is also the time when the social conscience, not alone of public representatives but also of persons outside interested in these matters, is aroused and when an examination should take place.  I regard social welfare enactments down the years and the recent small increases as nothing more or less than a patchwork system to tide us over in a way that appears to me to be regulated by expediency rather than by any long-term plan.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the means test first.  When I think of the whole of the area of the west, north-west and southwest and the means test being applied to small-holders, and even to those with less than a small holding, virtually garden plots, and think, on the other hand, of the phrase, &ldquo;a man of means&rdquo; or &ldquo;a person of means&rdquo;, I certainly realise the social and financial futility of applying a means test to people who have not got, in the meaning of the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; as I see it, the wherewithal to live even in moderate comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in this regard that there is a change being brought about in this Bill in the method of assessment of means.  I should like to hear a more <Col N="427" /> detailed explanation by the Minister. While the information is given that assessment will be made at £20 per £1 of valuation, I do not think the Minister or anybody on his behalf has given the ceiling for the reteable valuation which will be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be any. The assessment will be made on the basis of £20 per annum for each £1 of reteable valuation and the ceiling will depend on the individual circumstances of the applicant, whether he is married and what family he has.  It will depend on the amount of unemployment assistance he would be entitled to, if he had no means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I take it, on examination, is satisfied that this will be in ease of these people and will also tend towards production. Side by side with that, this change is alleged to be in furtherance of agricultural production.  Does that mean that people on small holdings, particularly those who live near an employment exchange, will be asked to come in two, three, four or five times a week to sign on at the local exchange, as heretofore, because, if so, the time wasting element will be continued and the incentive to work at home will be greatly reduced if not completely thwarted?</P>
      <P>I notice also that side by side with this new system regarding the reteable valuation the Minister is reserving the right to apply the old system in certain cases.  I wonder why that principle is being incorporated in this provision and why the Minister wants to do that.  Perhaps he will tell us more clearly and in greater detail what the purpose of the retention of this provision is?  I notice also that there is no appeal from the Minister's decision in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other speakers from all sides of the House, I want to exhort the Minister to abolish the two employment periods and, in addition, in rural Ireland, not to deprive single men of unemployment assistance during the summer season who have hitherto been deprived at that time.  Single <Col N="428" /> people as well as married people must eat.  Single people as well as married people must provide for themselves and must have the means of doing so, whether it is summer or winter.</P>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy O'Donnell in his plea that the part-time fishermen be included under this system of taking the reteable valuation, without any other means, and that part-time fishing be regarded as part of the small farm activity, as a supplementary occupation to the farming and carried out at a season when the farming business is not too exacting.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to Deputy O'Donnell yesterday, said that for the last year there was not any investigation by investigating officers for the purpose of reducing unemployment assistance.  I have written many letters to the Department in the last few weeks inquiring as to why the unemployment assistance of certain people was reduced from £x to £x minus £y as a result of investigation.  Maybe we are not <i>ad idem</i> in the argument and I should be glad to have the matter clarified.</P>
    <P>In the social welfare scheme, particularly in relation to old age pensioners and possibly in certain cases in relation to widows, more cognisance must be taken of the plight of people who live alone and something extra should go with it.  Where an old age pensioner, or pensioners, as the case may be, both the father and the mother, live with a married son or daughter, while having no means and getting the full pension, they are nevertheless enjoying certain benefits which are not assessed for the purpose of means but which are still considerable from the point of view of comfort.  Not so much in the country where neighbours are very kind to neighbours whether they live alone or not but certainly in the cities and larger urban areas, the plight of the old age pensioner who lives alone is very severe indeed.  The time should not be too far off when on the application from there should be an extra question, &ldquo;Do you live alone?&rdquo; so that something extra might be provided for a person who lives alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> I know that in cities, in particular, the home assistance people rally round, as do charitable organisations, but I do not think our old people should be dependent upon charitable organisations when the State has a bounden duty to provide for them.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in my constituency which might also affect a constituency like north-west Donegal, and perhaps portion of Galway, in relation to people who have been migratory workers all their lives and, as a result of whatever contributions they have had to pay while working in either England or Scotland, eventually, at the age of 65 are able to return home for good to the home which has been broken for half of the year by reason of economic circumstances forcing them to migrate.  They return home for good and they then enjoy either a British old age or contributory pension, or some kind of pension under the British social welfare code.  That is taken into consideration when they apply for the old age pension here.  It is a considerable source of irritation, particularly in Achill Island and, to some lesser extent, along the coast to the north in the Ballycroy and Erris districts.</P>
    <P>It would not cost very much, I think, to ignore this income from Great Britain altogether.  I want to be perfectly clear now that all I am talking about here is British pensions that have been earned by the contributions made by migratory workers.  I am not talking about people who went away and never came back, except possibly for a short holiday, and ultimately decided to retire and come back home; I am not talking about them at all.  I am talking about the man who, either by himself or with other members of his family, had to go away to England or Scotland generally from May to November and work in the potato fields or the beet fields, or in some other agricultural activity.  These people are specialists and I know of a few cases in which the fourth generation of English farmers is employing the fourth generation of Irish migratory workers.  Not alone has a definite employer-employee relationship grown <Col N="430" /> up but there have also grown up friendship and trust.</P>
    <P>In a place like Achill, where the holdings, if they can be called holdings, are very small, people must do something to supplement what they can get from these smallholdings and the few cattle they rear on the commonage.  They must go away to work.  The State has failed&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;failed&rdquo; may be too strong a word&mdash; to provide employment for these people and, having failed to do so, I think the State should measure up to its responsibility by not taking into account what these people have earned through social welfare contributions during their period abroad each year and let these people see that the State is grateful to them for relieving the economy of responsibility for them by their supplementing their meagre incomes at home by going abroad for part of the year to find work.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in this, as, I am sure, are Deputies on both sides of the House who come from these constituencies. I am particularly interested in the Achill area.  Apart altogether from any national obligation, I want to point out that the Government Party should have a consistent loyalty to these people in that particular area because of their long and continued support.</P>
    <P>It is hard to blame a Government for not being able to do all they would like to do for such a congested area and one which was so heavily populated until of late years.  The population is declining.  I should not like to press the Minister to incorporate a provision into the Bill to cover this situation but perhaps he would give me a promise now that he will look into the matter and ensure that, by regulation, these pensions will in future be ignored for purposes of the means test.  I shall be satisfied with that.  Such a regulation would relieve the people in that part of the country of considerable irritation and the deep feeling of ingratitude they bear towards the State, not towards Parties but towards the State itself.</P>
    <P>It is illogical, too.  These workers go to England for part of every year as migratory labourers and have done so <Col N="431" /> since the Unemployment Assistance Acts were brought in here.  They earn what is to them a considerable amount of money.  When they return, they can sign on immediately at the labour exchange and they qualify immediately for unemployment assistance. There is no reference to the money earned abroad.  Why then should these earnings be taken into account when it comes to old age or to a widow's pension?  It is then they need money most.  The Minister has correspondence from at least one person in that area.  She is the daughter of one of the persons affected.  I think she wrote to the Taoiseach some time ago and sent a copy of the letter to the Minister. She sent a copy to me.  Her approach is reasonable.  It covers the whole problem.  I am not confined to that one example.  I have several letters and several examples in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I should be very much impressed if the Minister and his officials would now approach this matter in a humane manner.  It is not something which will cost a great deal of money. Indeed, I believe it is something that will not continue because migration is taking on a different aspect altogether. It is now becoming emigration.  My plea is for the migratory labourers and their dependants.  The State would do well to do something about this problem.  I should be glad to hear the Minister's views on that particular aspect of life in the congested areas of the west and north-west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I always feel that the Minister for Social Welfare has the most unenviable task of any Minister because he has to deal with the most needy section in our community and try to get from the State coffers sufficient money to ensure that the needy amongst us will be looked after. The outlook today generally seems to be to try to get everything possible from the State, irrespective of the condition of the economy as a whole. As I have mentioned before, the great need here is to educate each one of us and the people generally into the realisation that, unless we have a very buoyant economy, our social services <Col N="432" /> will be affected.  If there are shortcomings in our economy, needy sections cannot be given all the help and aid we would like to give them.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Corish that a sliding scale of pensions would be a good idea and that, if there is an increase in wages generally, then there should be a similar increase in pensions. While agreeing with him in principle, I realise that this is something not easily attained.  It may be some years before we reach the stage at which we can guarantee to pensioners that they will be looked after in the same way as the more vocal workers are looked after through the machinery at their disposal in relation to wages. It has been said that the hallmark of any civilisation is the way it treats its aged.  I am very glad that this year a big increase has been given in the various pensions and allowances.  I compliment the Minister on that.  We, on this side of the House, are keeping faith with our social principles under which it is our aim to improve the lot of the needy sections of our community.</P>
      <P>I should like now to deal with the treatment of the blind.  Any person who has lost his sight cannot be compensated in terms of money.  We have a great field to cover here in providing welfare schemes for the blind before we can feel complacent about what we are doing for them.  In Dublin, it is true we have some workshops for the blind run on a semi-State basis, but we must have a greater expansion of this kind of activity.  Not alone must they be taught the ancient crafts of basket-making and mattress-making, but new methods of employing the blind in operation on the continent should be introduced here.  We should take every opportunity of making these people feel a part of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blind workshops are at present situated in Ballsbridge in my own constituency. Blind people come to these workshops from all over the city, from places such as Finglas and Ballyfermot. At the rush hour every morning and evening, I see them having to take their place in the bus queues, the same as if they were people with full faculties.  Perhaps the Minister might <Col N="433" /> consider in collaboration with Dublin Corporation having a housing scheme developed near the workshops so that these people would not have to travel across the city.  In the near future, the workshops are to be transferred from Ballsbridge to Rathmines, which is no more easy of access.  Again, you will have blind people travelling across the city from places such as Raheny and Coolock.  Perhaps next year the Minister might consider some kind of grant or have his officers discuss with the corporation the need for a housing scheme conveniently situated to the workshops.</P>
    <P>Another way of helping the blind and aged I have thought of is this. Could not labour and capital in this country get together and earmark, say, five per cent of their productivity increase each year for social welfare purposes?  Unless we show the needy that we are not just paying lip service to the principles laid down by the men of 1916 and afterwards, they will become more and more cynical about our present parliamentary set-up.  I believe that, if we could get the message across to the people, we would get a tremendous amount of cooperation from all sections.  If taxes had to be increased to provide greater benefits, I believe the people would accept them, knowing that the Government and the Oireachtas were in earnest about this matter.  It may be said that the people did not mind the recent Budget increases because they went to pay for increased social benefits. That is not true.  Several people approached me because the price of the pint was increased, even though I explained that most of it was for social welfare.  We did not get any degree of unanimity on this matter.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that, instead of having separate social welfare and health services, we could have a unification of the two?  In the matter of administration, there is a certain degree of amalgamation.  Both health services and social welfare services apply to people in need.  Perhaps we could make a big saving in administration if we were to have a scheme whereby one Department would administer all kinds of sickness and social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> I compliment the Minister and the Government on their decision to extend the insurance range from £800 to £1,200 a year.  Wages will continue to increase in the next decade.  Instead of waiting for people to go outside the £1,200 limit, we should have a sliding scale.  In the transition period before the Government change the limit, we have people falling out of benefit. Although they can become voluntary contributors, people are human and tend to put off doing this.  When they need social welfare benefit, they may find themselves in trouble, even though they have contributed for many years of their lives.  I had a case recently of a man who was insured from the time of the British occupation.  He paid his contribution for all those years.  Then he went over the £800 mark and did not qualify for payment.  That man has gone to tremendous trouble to try to get back in.  He can do so now under the new figure.  The Minister should consider a sliding scale so that such cases will not arise.</P>
    <P>I take the liberty of turning from the Bill to mention another case.  This concerns a person who is gravely ill but who is not in the social welfare bracket and has to pay for his treatment. He may be the father of a large family, perhaps the only wage earner in the family.  He is given no income tax allowance in respect of that illness, but he is given an allowance for loss of salary during that period.  However, he has to face doctors' bills and hospital bills.  This man should be given some concession on income tax for the period of his illness.  It is not a question of getting something for nothing. This man does not want to be ill.  The proof that he is ill is that he has to pay hospital expenses.  At the same time, he has to pay income tax for that year, apart from the allowance for loss of wages.  I put it to the Minister, even though it is not his responsibility, that perhaps he would consider this matter when he comes to prepare his Estimate next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Moore has said that the handling of this Department is probably one of the most difficult tasks of all because of its complexity and the very <Col N="435" /> wide field it has to cover.  As Deputy Moore said, our ability to deal with social welfare as most of us would like to deal with it is strictly related to the state of the national economy.  We, as a Party, appreciate the steps that have been taken by the Minister this year to endeavour to have a fairer approach to our social welfare problems. At the same time, we would not like it to be thought that sufficient has been done.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are aware of the difficulties, but we know much remains to be done.  Proper attention to social welfare and the provision of the maximum amount of satisfaction can only come about when we reach the stage here that every person qualifying for benefit will have, as a result, a standard of living that will give him at least the normal requirements of life.  We have a long way to go before that position is reached.  For that reason I thought there was much merit in what Deputy Lindsay said, that special consideration should be given to those of our people who live alone and who are compelled to live on what we give as social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>It is in this direction, in regard to people who live alone, that our social welfare shortcomings are blatantly exposed.  We are not unmindful of what Deputy Moore said, that we must also have regard to the state of the national economy.  The situation that exists is extraordinary and it is true to say that some of our people are enjoying the highest standard of living in the world.  This high standard for such a small country is extraordinary and there is an amazing amount of money available to some people to play with.  There is a topsy-turvy situation and a great disparity exists between those at the top and those at the bottom.  We will have a long way to go to get away from that situation in which you have the county home so near to the mansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it would be difficult and complex to try to make that position substantially different.  We believe something will have to be done to bring about a more equitable distribution <Col N="436" /> of the national wealth.  Deputy Corish gave the percentage figures to show what we were providing from State funds for social welfare benefits and these seemed to indicate that we should have done much more.  I think he mentioned that we had been giving 19.8 per cent of the national funds to social welfare and that this figure has dropped to 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increase of 10/- a week on the old age pensions is very acceptable and is a big improvement on previous years.  For that reason this measure received the approbation of the Labour Party.  However, I do not think that anybody could say that old age pensioners are now in a position that they can live happily ever after. Nothing could be further from the truth and we have a long way to go before we can fully compensate any man or woman who has given 70 years of service to the State.  While we support the measure, we abhor the means test.  I am merely mentioning these points to indicate that we as a Party feel that there is much to be done in this field.  While I appreciate the efforts made in the current year to try to eliminate at least some of the hardship we intend to pursue matters until we think that a fair situation generally has been created for those who qualify for social welfare benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I observe that section 8 of the Bill provides for a new system of assessing the income from land with a small poor law valuation.  From now on, the actual income will not be taken into account but the income will be assessed on the poor law valuation.  I approve of this proposal.  I notice that it applies to the old congested districts, but in addition, it is being applied under this Bill to the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Longford.  I welcome that particularly because for a considerable time I have been advocating both in the Seanad and here fair play for those counties and that there should be a readjustment of the old congested districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pleaded strongly for that when the Land Bill was going through the Seanad and I was rather shocked when <Col N="437" /> in the statement made by the Minister for Social Welfare at Killorglin some months ago, when he was announcing this legislation, he intimated that it would apply only to the congested districts.  Indeed, from the Minister's Budget speech, it appeared that this relief for small farmers would apply only to the old congested districts which were settled away back under a British Act of 1909.  Speaking on the Budget Resolutions, I drew attention to this and pleaded for the inclusion of my constituency of Cavan at least in the benefits which it was proposed to confer on farmers by this new legislation. I hope I will be pardoned if I say that I feel that my pleading on this has borne fruit.  I hope that this is only the beginning of fair play and fair treatment for the counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Longford, which are every bit as congested and require preferential treatment every bit as much as the areas described as congested areas by the British Act of 1909.  I hope, too, that the beneficial provisions in the Land Act which apply to congested districts only will be extended to these counties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in the old age pensions which were necessary to keep the bodies and souls of these old people together but I deplore the new means test under which the means of every person who is to get an increase of 10/- a week will be reinvestigated. This means, in effect, that before 1st August the social welfare officer will visit every old age pensioner to ascertain whether or not he qualifies for an increase of 10/-.  I notice that the Minister shakes his head.  I hope that that shaking of his head means that the social welfare officer will not reinvestigate the means of an applicant for the full increase of 10/- per week but I fear that there does not seem to be any other way out.  It seems to me to be a new type of means test.  Heretofore, the social welfare officer was not concerned whether an applicant for the old age pension had an income of £1 a year or £51 a year, because in between that bracket he was entitled to the maximum old age pension. Under this Bill he is not going to be entitled to the maximum old age pension if his income exceeds £26 a year. <Col N="438" /> That means that there will be a reinvestigation. As I say, I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that such reinvestigation will not be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a question which I put down yesterday and which the Minister for Social Welfare answered.  I asked him to extend the dental scheme to the dependants of insured persons.  Unfortunately, I was not in the House when the question was answered but the Minister stated that it was not possible to extend the dental scheme to these dependants.  I think that is a mistake.  The Minister should look into this again and extend it.  I am not asking him to extend it to the families of insured persons but to the wives and dependent children of insured persons.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that the contractor in question was informed that his tender, which was one of five received, for the erection of the new national school at Stackallen would be accepted.  The position is that at the time of tender the contractor who submitted the lowest price for the work had several other contracts in hands for the Office of Public Works, and it was felt that the award of the Stackallen contract to him might result in his being overloaded. The question of accepting another tender accordingly came under consideration and the contractor referred to by the Deputy was asked for the purpose of considering his tender in conjunction with the other tenders received if he could furnish evidence of his ability to provide a bond from an insurance company for the satisfactory completion of the contract in the event of his tender being accepted. He obtained confirmation of his ability to procure such a bond, but it then <Col N="445" /> transpired that the contractor who had submitted the lowest tender had made such progress with the contracts which he already had on hands that there was no longer any justification for passing over his tender.  That tender, which is about £2,000 lower than that of the contractor referred to by the Deputy, has accordingly been accepted.</P>

      <P>On 22nd April, 1965 an application was received by the Commissioners of Public Works from the Dublin County Council for the sale to the council of a field at Dunsink for the purpose of an itinerants' encampment.</P>
      <P>The field in question, which contains slightly less than 4 acres, is part of the Dunsink Observatory property which was purchased by the State in 1946. The greater part of the property, including the Observatory buildings, is leased to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  When the lease was being arranged, the Institute sought and were given an assurance that no portion of the remainder of the property would be disposed of without prior consultation with them.  The Institute have been consulted accordingly and they are strongly of opinion that the entire property should be kept intact because of the necessity to maintain an open area around the Observatory for observation purposes and to provide for future developments, not only of the Observatory itself, but of the School of Cosmic Physics as a whole.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the views of the Institute, it is obviously difficult to accede to the county council's request. I am having the matter considered further, but at the moment I am unable to say when a final decision will be made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether, following his investigations into the matter undertaken since 1960, he will now amend the provisions of section 11 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 to permit an officer of the Defence Forces on taking up permanent pensionable appointment as an officer of a local authority to transfer his Defence Force service.</P>

      <P>Amendment of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, on the lines suggested is not at present contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind the absence of a provision in section 11 of the Act similar to that in section 34 which enables a local authority servant to reckon service with the Defence Forces.  That provision, however, refers only to service in the Defence Forces of a servant who left the local authority service to join the Defence Forces and on his discharge <Col N="448" /> returned to the local authority service. This applied in the case of local authority servants who joined up during the Emergency and returned to the local authority service on discharge from the Defence Forces and who but for the special provision in section 34 could not have reckoned the time they spent in the Defence Forces.  Local authority officers who joined the Defence Forces in the Emergency were released on special leave which was reckonable for superannuation purposes and the necessity for a special provision in section 11 for officers did not arise.</P>
    <P>The general issue raised by the Deputy of permitting an officer to reckon prior service with the Defence Forces in the calculation of his local authority superannuation award will be considered in conjunction with other suggested amendments, when the 1956 Act comes to be revised.</P>

      <P>A decision has not yet been reached regarding an increase in the annual grants payable to officers of the Reserve of Officers (First Line).</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the question, as stated by my predecessor in reply to a similar question tabled by Deputy P. O'Donnell on 10th November, 1964, the annual grant is only one item in the total remuneration payable to Reserve Officers each year.  During periods of annual training courses of instruction, etc. the rates of pay and of children's allowances issuable to officers of the Permanent Defence Force apply also to Reserve Officers.  Uniform replenishment allowance at one-third of the rate applicable to officers of the Permanent Defence Force is also payable.  Since 1928, when the Reserve of Officers (First Line) was established, the total remuneration (excluding children's allowances) payable to members of this class of the Reserve in respect of annual training, etc. has been increased by 61 per cent for Lieutenants, by 117 per cent for Captains and by 144 per cent for Commandants.</P>
      <P>While I do not consider that officers of the Reserve of Officers (First Line) have been at all unfairly treated over the years in the matter of remuneration in respect of annual training, etc., I am, nevertheless, having the question of increasing the annual grants examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with amendment No. 32 to section 21 in Deputy Sweetman's name, which deals with a person with a life interest who buys out the interest of the remainder man in the trust and terminates the trust. I think I had pointed out that if the person has a free estate under which he buys out the trust, the fact that he reduces the value of the free estate by the amount which he pays for the trust is disregarded, and his full estate is taken into account for duty purposes. If he has to borrow money, even though he might have liquid assets of his own&mdash;and even if he has not liquid assets of his own&mdash;the same applies.  The full value would be assessed for estate duty purposes. Deputy Sweetman's amendment would defeat this, and it would facilitate the device of avoidance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand. If the person pays in the reversion out of cash he has himself, and pays that cash over to the reversioner, that cash is gone from his free estate, and it is not liable to duty, even if he were to die the day after that happened.  What is the difference between the man who has the cash himself and the man who borrows money for the same purpose?  Where the life interest was enlarged or used up, there is no duty.  I agree that it <Col N="463" /> is fair that there should be a duty on an enlargement, but in the case of a man who pays out his own money, and the man who borrows the money to pay it out, there should be more concern for the man who borrows the money because he is not in the same readily fluid position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make sense.  If you have a fund that is worth £50,000 and the value of the reversioner's interest has been ascertained at £10,000 and the tenant for life buys that piece of property&mdash;let us say, a shop in Grafton Street&mdash;for £10,000, it then belongs to him absolutely, and the £10,000 belongs absolutely to the reversioner.  If the reversioner dies, Revenue get duty on that £10,000.  If the person has free estate to the extent of £10,000 and pays the free estate over, that free estate will not be there, and therefore there cannot be any duty on it.  That seems clear enough, and fair enough.</P>
      <P>If instead of paying out his own money, the person borrows £10,000, then what the Minister is suggesting is that he is going to be charged duty on £60,000, not £50,000, because he will be charged duty on the £50,000, and not allowed to take a reduction for what he has paid over.</P>

      <P>If the purchaser goes through that process and buys out the remainder man's interest, he is deemed to have given a gift of that amount to the remainder man, and therefore the gift, plus the value of the estate, will be charged.  That is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() A death benefit or death benefits so deemed to have been provided by the deceased shall not be aggregated with other property of the deceased for the purposes of determining the rate of estate duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section and the following section are, in our view, the most objectionable in the Bill.  This section is aimed at taxing death benefits accruing pursuant to superannuation schemes and both Deputy Sweetman and I have indicated our objection to the section.  I therefore find myself in a somewhat difficult position in moving an amendment to a section I feel should not be there, but I must move the amendment declaring my view, at the same time, in relation to the section as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the section is passed the position will be, as I understand the law, that death benefits, which until now have been regarded as exempt from death duty because they have not been provided by the deceased, accruing pursuant to a superannuation scheme, shall be deemed to have been provided <Col N="466" /> by the deceased and therefore the benefits passing or resulting from death become taxable.  Many superannuation schemes are provided by employers, firms and companies, to which no contribution is made by the employee.</P>
    <P>Up to the moment, benefits from such schemes would not be liable for duty because they were not a provision by the deceased.  I assume the object of this section is to end that exemption and provide that benefits resulting from such schemes will in future be liable to death duties.  If that is so and if the section is to stand as part of the law, the object of this amendment is to alleviate the blow somewhat by providing that a death benefit which is deemed to have been provided by the deceased shall not be aggregated with other property of the deceased for the purposes of determining the rate of estate duty.  In other words, we propose that a death benefit in those circumstances should stand by itself and be liable merely to such duty as its own value attracts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position in respect of the law on the death of a beneficiary in a superannuation scheme, it is entirely different from what it is in Britain.  I speak subject to correction, because I find it hard enough to keep up with our own law much less British law, but as far as I know, death benefits accruing from superannuation schemes in Britain are covered by the case of J. Bibby and Sons, Ltd., Pensions Trust Deed, Davies and the Inland Revenue Commissioners.  It was heard by Harman in the Chancery Division on the 9th and 10th of July 1952.  The decision of the Bench was that in Britain such benefits were not liable to estate duty.  The report I have of that case, which I obtained from the Incorporated Law Society Library, does not indicate that the case was appealed and as far as I have been able to trace it has not.  The position there was that such a benefit would not be liable to duty.  The position here is different.  I think the pension benefit is liable to duty here, perhaps, but that there have been some <i>ex gratia</i> extensions which have arisen <Col N="467" /> perhaps under the provisions of section 22.  There is no doubt, however, that the position up to this has been that death benefits for a pension scheme were to be treated as an estate in themselves and that the death benefits of a pension scheme were not to be aggregated with the remainder of the estate of a deceased person.  To that extent, the problems that are at issue in section 22 are allied to the problems at issue in section 23, but section 22 is even worse than section 23 because this is a normal, ordinary superannuation scheme which is part and parcel, and an essential part and parcel, of every company having good industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The fact is, as the Minister is no doubt aware, or as he can easily make himself aware, that a superannuation scheme when introduced, has to be submitted for certain purposes to the Revenue Commissioners and adopted by them, not primarily for death duty purposes&mdash;that only arises when somebody dies&mdash;but in relation to its income tax angles.  Here we have the extraordinary situation that a pension scheme with the superannuation benefits that are included, having been submitted to the Revenue Commissioners and having been considered and accepted by them under one section of the tax code, is then thrown overboard by them in relation to another section of the tax code.  That seems utterly illogical and indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his closing speech on the Second Stage of the Bill the Minister quoted certain extracts from what I had said on an earlier Bill.  I was speaking then in relation to the Finance Bill, 1955 where I specifically provided that all the benefits that might arise under section 23, for example, benefits where policies were made, would be treated as one separate estate and that they would not be aggregated with the free estate or other settled estate of the deceased, but that they would be aggregated as one estate on their own.  The purpose of that was quite clear, that by doing so a general benefit was protected and what one might term freak avoidance, stopped.  It is precisely <Col N="468" /> that very measure adopted then which the Minister is now, in these two sections, overruling.</P>
    <P>It is essential that one would consider to some extent those two sections together because they undoubtedly have an interlocking effect.  I cannot see how, in any circumstances, the Minister can preach, as he does, that he wants to have good industrial relations and at the same time hit a provision of a superannuation scheme because it is accepted&mdash;and I think that the Minister himself accepted it when he was sitting a little further down the Bench&mdash;that a good superannuation scheme is an essential part of good industrial relations.  The effect here will be that the amount that will be paid will bear substantial duty.  I do not know what it would take to provide say £12 a week for a widow but we may say £10,000.  I do not think the Minister will quarrel very much with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>She would be a very young widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends whether you are going to buy it on an annuity basis or have anything for the children afterwards.  If you are going to buy a pure life annuity for the life of the widow it will be ended entirely on her death with nothing for the children even though they may be dying under 21 years of age and then, of course, the calculation you would make would be entirely different.  But I think a sum of £10,000 in present circumstances is not out of the way.  In relation to the law as it is, that benefit would at present be bearing duty at 4 per cent and you pay £400.  Let us assume that the person concerned also had a house and furniture, nothing else.  It does not require to be a very big house in these days to be valued at £5,000 or very much furniture to be valued at £1,000.  The effect of the Minister's amendment is that whereas before the family concerned would have paid £400 in one case and £60 in the other &mdash;I am not giving even a penny in the bank&mdash;making a total of £460, the Minister's amendment will make that family pay £1,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> Does the Minister think that is a reasonable way of treating what is a very small, middleclass case in the light of present monetary values?  I think there is no justification for the extra £1,140 being charged on the person in that bracket.  That is precisely what this does.  It brings the effect of a death benefit in a superannuation case back into the maelstrom of general free estate and, accordingly, has the effect of substantially increasing the duty.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister waxed very eloquent about the big man, the man with over £100,000 but when you get a man with property in excess of that value this section does not hit him at all, either in this section or the next, because there will be 40 per cent in any event and the aggregation bringing in any superannuation benefit or any benefit of a policy under the Management and Property Act is not anything that will hurt.  It seems grossly unfair that this should deliberately hit the margin that there is of people in the middle class and that the really big man about whom the Minister spoke last night will not be touched at all by this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with this under two headings.  First, I am concerned with the retrospective implications of section 22 as regards existing pension schemes which, as Deputy Sweetman said, have already been submitted to and approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  In that regard I hope the Minister will consider redrafting or amending the section but certainly reconsidering it between now and the Report Stage just as we did with other amendments which were tabled and withdrawn in reference to the phrase &ldquo;whether before or after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got some progress now in that the Minister has agreed that this Bill shall be based on the precedent of the Finance Act, 1910, which was careful to avoid retrospection in any way.  So, my first concern is that in no circumstances should existing pension schemes be affected.  These schemes were negotiated between employers <Col N="470" /> and either pension companies or insurance companies handling pension business.  The draft schemes were submitted to the Revenue Commissioners and were approved and on foot of that final approval a legal and binding contract has been completed between the employer and the pension trustees concerned.  To that extent it would be absolutely intolerable if a legal binding contract were to be upset by the Revenue Commissioners under any circumstances but particularly so where the contract had virtually been approved in detail by the Revenue Commissioners who are subsequently responsible for the amendment of the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>In general principle, however, I am also concerned with the proposal to tax these death duty benefits because what we must remember is that the person who will suffer is the survivor and not the person on whose death the benefits will become payable. What makes it worse is that in most cases the survivors of a member of a pension scheme are entitled only to a pension on annual basis but for estate duty purposes the estate duty is calculated by capitalising the pension.  So that the person who is receiving the benefit is not receiving a capital sum but has to raise the money somehow to pay this duty which is calculated on a capital basis.</P>
    <P>We have all received a letter from one pension company which has gone into this matter in considerable detail and which quotes the case where the capitalised value of a pension would be approximately £8,000.  This, if treated as an estate upon its own, would have resulted in a duty of £240 being payable, which is heavy enough for a widow to have to pay when she is not getting a capital sum.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to expect that the total value of the private estate of the deceased would be not less than a further £8,000, shall we say £5,000 for the house, £1,000 for the furniture and there is probably a car and various other assets which make £8,000 a very reasonable figure. If those two sums&mdash;£8,000 death benefit and £8,000 private estate&mdash;are <Col N="471" /> taken separately the total duty at 3 per cent on each of the estates would be £480 which, to my mind, is heavy enough, by far too heavy, but if this provision goes through and the two estates are aggregated this brings the total estate up to £16,000, which attracts an estate duty of 10 per cent, making the total duty £1,600.  That, to my mind, is an intolerable suggestion.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that the Minister has had the opportunity of going into this matter as thoroughly as he would like and I would ask him to make some offer at this stage that he will reconsider this whole suggestion.  If he does that I will be much happier because I feel that the longer he looks at this the more he will see that it is basically unreasonable.  If he forces it through at this stage, I for one will be more than unhappy, to put it midly.  So, I would make that request to him.  As he has met this House in connection with other matters already, I, for one, and, I am sure, others, would appreciate it if he would meet us on this case also and give us some indication that he will reconsider this section before the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to endorse the argument which Deputy Booth has put forward.  It is a most mild and reasonable argument and I hope the Minister will see his way to reconsider this section.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we are going to balance the budget to any great extent by extorting a few pounds from a widow and orphans and I would not like for a moment to be thought to be in favour of doing so or to be associated with this section in its present form.  So, I hope the Minister will see his way to reconsider this, as he has been requested now by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>There might be a risk that in dealing with section 22 and the various types of superannuation schemes involved, we might, as I often do, lose the main trend that should be followed.  There are contributory superannuation schemes and non-contributory superannuation schemes.  A superannuation scheme is usually designed to provide for a pension at the end of a person's employment or, on his earlier death, a lump sum for his widow and dependants. At the present moment the law provides that the lump sum in a contributory scheme is subject to estate duty.  On the other hand, a person can contrive to provide for his widow a lump sum on his death to which he did not legally contribute, in other words, if he was a company director, probably an important man or the most important man in the company, he can so arrange his affairs that on his death the value of his own estate could be reduced but by reason of payments the company were making for death benefit for that director's widow and children &mdash; and it often happens that in such cases the provision is very handsome&mdash;escape liability to duty because it was not purchased or provided by the deceased.</P>

      <P>I want to say to Deputy Booth that, in fact, the agreements reached between the proposers or organisers of a superannuation scheme in advance of the implementation of the scheme do not have regard to death duties in the ordinary sense.  The purpose of the advance agreement is to ensure to the satisfaction of both sides and the Revenue Commissioners that (1) whatever contributions are payable will have due relief for income tax purposes and (2) that there will not be, in the course of the operation of the scheme, payments of excessive lump sums.  But, as such, it has no relevance to death duties.</P>
      <P>There are other types of schemes under which death benefits arise and in which a person has no right of enforcement.  These are not covered either.  I can see the force of Deputy Sweetman's case.  I know it can arise in a genuine case.  What I propose in the section is that £5,000 of this would be free anyway.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to look at the whole structure of the section.  What pensions <Col N="474" /> are captured by this section and what are not?  I should like him to tell us where we stand in regard to what pensions are captured.  He said contributory.  From the point of view of estate duty and of actual payments, we do not know what the relative incidence of these pensions is, and I think we should have a very clear idea of what pensions are captured by the section and what are not.  We can come back to these points later, but I add my voice now to that of Deputy Booth.  I should like the Minister to leave the way open for him to consider the section and its implications as a whole.  We have not had very many opportunities of examining it in detail.  In particular, I should like to be very clear as to what pensions are captured; it is there already; they are contributory.  Equally, it is important to know what pensions are not.  The Minister has instanced cases of evasion.</P>

The case of a company director that the Minister referred to is, of course, a practical consideration and one will have sympathy with the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners if there is anything like evasion or the doing of something that should not be done. However, the trouble about a section like this is that it may do more than is intended or it may not do as much as it appears to do on the face of it. I should like the Minister to clear up these points and keep the way open for himself to give some larger reconsideration to the whole section.</P>

At the moment we are concerned with a proposal that, whatever death benefit falls now to be charged for estate duty where otherwise it would not be <Col N="475" /> charged, that benefit should not be aggregated with the rest of the property passing on death.  That proposal, if it is accepted, would merely extend to these death benefits covered by section 22 what up to this has been the accepted principle in relation to benefits of this kind under section 4 of the 1894 Act in respect of the provision made under insurance policies and so on.  We will be discussing that in relation to section 23 but, up to this, it has been accepted that where provision is made at the instance of a person, who will never benefit himself and who can have no interest in it himself, that provision which passes on his death, while it is liable to estate duty, is not aggregated with the rest of his property.  I do not know what the full legal position is.  I endeavoured to ascertain it, but I certainly do not know it.  I am sure Deputy Sweetman knows a great deal more. But I understand the position to be at the moment that, where a pension is provided or secured in an employment as a result of a contributory scheme or as part of the contract of service, that already is liable to estate duty because it is regarded as a pension or provision provided by the deceased.</P>

      <P>I do not think a contributory pension aggregates at all. I think the effect of my 1955 Act was that it did not.  All the benefits to different dependants are aggregated, but they are all treated as one dependent estate, so to speak.</P>

      <P>In any event, the point I want to make in relation to such contributory pension schemes is that this section is obviously necessary because they are already caught for estate duty.  This section, therefore, is designed to deal with the type of superannuation or pension scheme or death benefit which is not provided by the deceased in the sense that he has contributed to it but is provided by his employer, or someone else, as an added amenity in relation to his employment or something of that kind.</P>

      <P>I doubt if civil servants contribute to a superannuation scheme.  I am reminded by Deputy Byrne that bank clerks do not and death benefits arising in those circumstances at the moment would not be liable under the law to estate duty.  Obviously this section will have the effect of making such benefits chargeable for estate duty.  I know the Minister says that it is not, of course, that kind of person he intends to catch; he intends to catch the man who, during his life, subtracts from his means a certain amount of money which, when he dies, reappears in the form of a beneficial interest accruing on his death.  It is the very monied man who can take from what he does not require during his life and make certain provisions and subsequently a pension or some benefit appears for his dependants.  That would be an understandable approach if that appeared to be the only effect of the section.  But it is not the only effect of the section.  The section, as it appears here before us, is a section which clearly will tax bank clerks, junior civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I kept well away from that.  We contribute certainly. That will be the effect of it. If that is to happen, it certainly would appear to me to be elementary justice that that benefit itself, if it is to be taxed now for the first time, should bear its own taxation and should not be aggregated with other property. The Minister, while he talks about considering providing an increase on the £5,000 limit, is not answering the case made to prevent aggregation. While I appreciate the Minister's indication of an intention to look at that provision of the section again, I <Col N="477" /> cannot, merely because he says that, withdraw the amendment in relation to aggregation, which is a different thing.  If these benefits are to be taxed, it appears to us to be only reasonable that they should not be aggregated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is the bad training I got when over in the Minister's seat there, but in relation to these two sections, let me look for a moment, regardless of what the sections provide, at what I think is fair in the circumstances.  As long as we have a scheme for death duties, it seems to me reasonably fair, where there is a death benefit under a superannuation scheme, contributory or non-contributory, or where there is a policy provided under the Married Women's Property Act for the benefit of a wife and dependants, there should be a limited provision there in relation to death duties that would prevent in that way too much amassing of personal fortune and passing it on.</P>
      <P>The scales in relation to death duties in general are deliberately designed on a graduated basis for the purpose of ensuring that in the smaller estates there will not be hardship and, if the estate gets larger, that there will be appropriate slices taken off for the general good.  The law, as I feel it should be, is that the benefits in this category should be isolated in that category and treated in that isolated category in the manner appropriate to death duties for the general law of the land.  That will mean that in the case where the superannuation scheme benefit does not exceed £5,000&mdash;the Minister was quick to correct me in the case I gave of a £10,000 benefit&mdash; smaller benefits up to £5,000 each are treated in isolation.  On the benefits that section 22 and section 23 will affect, there is no death duty payable. If that amount goes up to £10,000, there is duty payable at four per cent. If it goes up to the top, the curious fact is that the very rich man&mdash;the man the Minister was talking about last night&mdash;would not be affected by what we are doing here, because he would be already at the maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two sections appear to me to infringe that principle.  They appear to me to have been imported into this <Col N="478" /> Bill because of the situation that arises in England, where they might be operative and where death duties rise up to 80 per cent in the case of very big estates.  In such cases I can see every necessity for some restrictive measure of this sort, particularly in respect of a non-trading company.  But here there is nothing like that.  The maximum here was set by the Minister's predecessor, Dr. Ryan.  The minimum is at the £5,000 level.  The margin in between is really not worth bothering about to the extent that anybody is going to get away with murder, because they are not.  But I do think doing it in this way the Minister will unduly hit the ordinary, run-of-the-mill case in which we are all concerned and which we see day in and day out.</P>
    <P>If the Minister provides that benefits passing on death pay duty, pay that duty as an estate in itself, and that policies under the Married Women's Property Act are treated in the same way&mdash;that they pay that duty as an estate in itself&mdash;provided that all the benefits are amalgamated and you cannot therefore avoid duty by making separate policies, one for the wife and one for each child, and in that way depress the value that comes under the superannuation or the Married Women's Property Act, then the Minister is going to get a fair cut; and, at the same time, it is going to avoid the undue hardship that undoubtedly these cases would mean.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever, without going into the question of retrospection, that the enactment of these two sections will mean that a great many people in the small class will have to turn around and rethink out their whole basis for their dependants if they are taken suddenly.  The worst thing of all about section 22 and the manner in which the Minister is doing it now is that it is going to hit the young widow who has young children much harder than the person who dies in harness maybe a year or two before he is going to retire.  That man, the man who dies just before he is going to retire, probably has got his children brought up and, we hope, provided for and settled in life.  The <Col N="479" /> value of the pension to his wife, presuming they are of an age, is smaller than it is to the young widow who has a great many years before her but is caught at the most vulnerable point of time as far as she is concerned because she has young children on her hands and the breadwinner is gone.  The type of people we are considering here in our inflated values of today are not rich people.</P>
    <P>The provisions the Minister is introducing are provisions which are applicable to the very rich in England, running up to the 80 per cent duty.  I could understand a case being made for that.  I am afraid that all the provisions which are being introduced in this Bill are being brought in for the purpose of doing in another way what Resolution 18 was suggested to do.  I believe that the approach to this has been: &ldquo;We want to make sure that we get 100 per cent certainty against avoidance and as long as we get that, we do not care whom we hit on the way&rdquo;. That is a wrong approach.  I still believe that what happened in relation to Resolution 18 was that it was put up to the Minister: &ldquo;This is the only way in which you can get 100 per cent certainty against avoidance&rdquo;, and on that it was put through.  The sections have been framed with the same mentality.</P>
    <P>You cannot get 100 per cent certainty against avoidance without hurting probably 50 to 60 per cent of the cases nobody wants to hurt.  It is much better that one odd person should get through with the difference between, say, the tax on a life policy of £50,000 and what he would have to pay if it were aggregated &mdash; the difference between 30 per cent and 40 per cent&mdash;ten per cent on £50,000, which is £5,000.  It is much better that one person should get away with that than that 99 should be hit unfairly. The whole of this part of the Bill has been deliberately framed, I suggest to the Minister, with the intention that the job to be done was to provide 100 per cent prohibition on avoidance, regardless of whom it hit in the event. That is bad.  With our maximum rate of 40 per cent. it is not worthwhile <Col N="480" /> proceeding on that basis and it would be far, far better that one odd person should get through the net and for the general run of people to be reasonably and fairly deducted, and no more than reasonably and fairly deducted.</P>

      <P>My concern is with subsection (4) in relation to small farmers and smallholders.  I do not know if it is the Minister's intention to raise the figure from £5,000 to £10,000.  If it is, it would serve a very useful purpose.  I believe it will be necessary to have the figure nearer to that level, particularly for small farmers.  In my county a farm of 30 acres will make £5,000 today and with the necessary stock&mdash;a farm of that size should carry 15 cows&mdash;and with the other appurtenances, this would bring it up to another £5,000.  A well worked farm of that size will still only produce £4,000, or at the maximum, £5,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to relate this to what has to be paid out of this figure.  Assuming that he would have to pay on £4,000, a young farmer who got his holding from his father on his death will be faced with the payment of £400 death duties.  Over five years he would have to pay £2 a week out of his earnings to the Revenue to clear up that £400.  It is on that type of person that this section leans hardest of all.  He may be a person who is already overburdened in other directions. I would ask the Minister to give all the advantages that should accrue here to this type of person.  If nothing else, there is a case in the fact that the £5,000 in 1961 must now be nearer at least to £7,000 or £8,000 on present-day values.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that this figure will be raised to £10,000.  I doubt if it would be worth the candle otherwise in regard to what would be collected and there would be endless trouble trying to collect it.  I am asking the Minister to do this in my capacity as Chairman of the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture, on <Col N="481" /> behalf particularly of our small farmers, and to give them every consideration and avoid endless trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to answer a couple of points which were made and perhaps I will be indirectly answering Deputy Norton in a way he will understand.  I appreciate that I may not be terribly explicit but it is a new line of country to me and while I can understand some of it, not all of it, I may be able to explain the some I understand.  I agree in general with what Deputy Sweetman said, that we should so frame our tax laws as to ensure that we catch the people we would like to catch.  The trouble is that these people can so arrange their affairs that they can get around almost any piece of legislation we introduce here.  In that respect I should like to refer the House to, unfortunately, a British judgment by Viscount Simon, Lord Chancellor, in May, 1942.  I have not got the reference to the case but his remarks are of interest in this context.  He is quoted as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Lords, of recent years much ingenuity has been expended in certain quarters in attempting to devise methods of disposition of income by which those who were prepared to adopt them might enjoy the benefits of residence in this country while receiving the equivalent of such income, without sharing in the appropriate burden of British taxation.  Judicial dicta may be cited which point out that, however elaborate and artificial such methods may be, those who adopt them are &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; to do so.  There is, of course, no doubt that they are within their legal rights, but that is no reason why their efforts or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter, should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship.  On the <Col N="482" /> contrary, one result of such methods, if they succeed, is, of course, to increase <i>pro tanto</i> the load of taxation on the shoulders of the great body of good citizens who do not desire, or do not know how, to adopt these manoeuvres.</P>
    <P>What I am after is one such device and perhaps here I might be of some assistance to Deputy Norton.  I think he understands that death benefit accruing out of property not purchased or provided by the deceased is not, under the law, liable to death duties.  As I said before, I think it is agreed that contributory schemes are in general caught.  A man who owns a company is entitled to receive, say, £x a year.  He says to the company: &ldquo;Do not give me £x a year but give me £x-£y a year and put the £y away into a fund that will be worth a lot of money on my death and give that to my wife or my children or my brother or my sister&rdquo;, and so on.  He has succeeded in siphoning off that amount of money from his estate which otherwise would form part of his assessable estate on his death.  That is the kind of case we are looking to catch and these are usually the cases in which a considerable amount of duty is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, there could be what appear to be genuine schemes in which the death benefits could involve very considerable sums.  It would be difficult, I think, to justify relieving them completely, or not adding them to the person's estate for tax purposes.  So, in between these two, it is very difficult <Col N="483" /> to frame legislation that would be effective for the purpose intended.  I got a letter, to which Deputy Booth referred, marked &ldquo;Personal&rdquo;.  I assumed it was addressed to me and to me only.</P>

      <P>I set about having a polite reply prepared.  That could have been done.  I saw the personal letter to me in the newspapers and everybody else got a letter marked &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; along the same lines.  The company on whose behalf it was written are very expert people.  I will not say whether they are the type of people to whom Viscount Simon referred.  However, they are very expert in the tax field, anyway.  I am not denying the validity of the type of point they were making and which Deputy Sweetman made in his own way.  I think Deputy O'Connor was slightly off the line, so to speak, as far as this section is concerned.  I think he thought we were talking in more general terms about death duties. But if, added to the £5,000, there were the £5,000 we have here, then, to make that free of liability, it would mean a sum of £10,000 which would be completely free.  It is not perhaps a terribly high sum in present terms of money, especially in the case of a young widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The moment the Minister does that, he will be in a position easily assailable to raise the exemption for all free estates up to £10,000.  I should be delighted to come after him for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the increased sum beyond the £5,000 provided free here, I think we would be making very ample provision in genuine cases.  Realising how difficult it is to restrict the operation of the section to the type of case we all agree ought to be taxed and also to have regard to not permitting benefits, no matter how high they are, under what we might call genuine schemes, to escape as well, I think it is necessary to keep the form of the section as it stands subject to giving an even better <Col N="484" /> higher limit as far as the value of the death benefit is concerned.</P>

      <P>When the Minister talks about wealthy company directors who try to avoid their liability for death duties, I may say I do not regard people with £10,000 or £15,000 as the type of persons we ought to try to capture.  It is socially very desirable that husbands should be encouraged to provide for their widows and children. The emphasis which we ought to place should be further to encourage and not to handicap them in any way. The fact that a few people may try to avoid it is a poor argument for trying excessively to deal with these small estates.  The Minister really ought to raise his idea of what is a reasonable amount of money.  I think he has not adjusted to the 1965 prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position for us. Section 22 does one thing expressly and another thing follows from it. Subsection (2) provides expressly that death benefits will be liable to death duty.  It provides expressly that a death benefit shall, for all purposes of death <Col N="485" /> duties, be deemed to be an interest provided by the deceased and to pass by reason of a disposition made by him.  Frankly, I am prepared to accept that but I am not prepared to accept what it does by implication.  As I understand the situation, unless there is in some section another subsection expressly excluding aggregation then aggregation is operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept the view I put forward a few minutes ago.  Let the benefits be subject, but treated in isolation.  Then you will get fair justice for all, a little bit one way, a little bit the other way. When talking in terms of very large sums being made available, once we go into the very large sums, then they are not benefiting because of the fact that we have a top limit of rate.  If we had not that top limit of rate, if we ran up to the 80 per cent, then it would matter.  But in these circumstances here it does not really matter. It would be far better, and far more logical, to make them all liable, make them all run as an estate in themselves, and if they are under £5,000, they will automatically be free.  If they are over that, they will have to bear a little bit and if they get right up to the big money the Minister is anxious to get after, they will be caught for much more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned mainly with who are affected by the provisions here and who are not. Deputy Sweetman has dealt with the widow and certain other cases.  I think Deputy T.F. O'Higgins is wrong in some of his assumptions.  I feel this section needs further consideration as to what pensions are captured and what are not.  I would ask the Minister, for that reason, to clarify that matter and also keep himself open to consider perhaps broader amendments, if necessary, on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I take it, while discussing this amendment, I may also speak on the section.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A death benefit shall, for all purposes of death duties, be deemed to <Col N="486" /> be an interest provided by the deceased and to pass by reason of a disposition made by him.</P>
    <P>On the face of that an interpretation is being put by Deputy O'Higgins in which he seems to assume it will capture all death benefits wheresoever and by whomosever they are.  I think it will be found that that will not be so.  This requires a little more examination as to who will be affected and who will not.  I am with the Minister in regard to the type of case he wants to capture.  I am sure we are all with him in that.  Deputy Sweetman has not put a tooth in it.  We are all apprehensive about the type of case Deputy Sweetman mentioned and I would ask the Minister specifically about uniformity of the incidence of the use of this taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the people who are using a device like that should be caught and I do not believe anybody will disagree with him on that.  Deputy Sweetman says that in trying to get 100 per cent certainty against evasion, you cover a number of cases that were not intended to be covered. The answer to that is that it will not be enforced in certain directions. The Minister is going in that direction with the raising of the levies. I do not believe we have had enough time to examine this.  I think Deputy O'Higgins is definitely under a misapprehension when he thinks this captures everything.  We should all have another opportunity of having a look at it.  I ask the Minister, at this stage, to leave himself open and we can reconsider the matter on Report Stage.</P>

        <i>Ex gratia</i> payments are also not caught.  Deputy de Valera asked me what is in and what is out at the moment.  The contributory superannuation scheme is in at the moment but it is not aggregable with the free estate.  This section would in effect make the contributory scheme benefits aggregable with the rest of the estate for death duty purposes but there are other superannuation schemes which are non-contributory and it has been claimed that the benefits payable on the death of a member of such a scheme, unless of course paid to the person's representative, are not liable to estate duty since they were not purchased by the deceased.</P>

The section seems to catch all, on the appearances of it. There are exceptions.  I have no objection to the exceptions if the same kind of uniformity is in for all other classes.  I would like to examine the classes to see what classes or groups, for whatever reason, are not caught by this section.  I do not wish to go into this matter any further at the moment.

      <P>In so far as the Minister appears to be thinking on the lines of perhaps doubling the exemption allowance in subsection (4) to £5,000, I want to suggest that that will not meet the case.  The type of person spoken of by Deputy Sweetman is the young widow who is the hardest hit by this provision.  Her pension rights in some of the superannuation schemes at present in force can have a very high capitalised value of £12,000 or £15,000 or more.  My experience is that salaried persons do not often realise how very valuable their pension <Col N="489" /> rights are in the annuity sense.  There is one asset above all others which in any probate matter is valued to the full by the Estate Duty Office, that is, a superannuation or pension right. There is no scope for bargaining and no negotiation arises at all.  All they have to do is look at the annuity tables.  It is assessed to duty to the fullest possible extent.  If the Minister is thinking in terms of an exemption allowance in subsection (4) of £10,000 in respect of the young widow, that will merely cover a benefit of about £12 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us back to the question Deputy Dillon was speaking about here this morning.  I am glad to see the Deputy is back in the House.  Whom are we trying to get at in the matter of death duties? Do we want to tax an estate in the £20,000, £25,000 or £30,000 category, in the context of today's inflationary values?  The young widow left with six or ten small children and an annuity income of some sort of, say, £1,000 a year is not a proper subject for death duties at all.  We heard much maligning from the Minister here last week. Last Thursday's Official Report is not yet available unfortunately.  The Minister then referred to the social value of death duties as preventing accumulation of vast wealth.  There is something about it in our Constitution&mdash; inheritance of vast sums of accumulated wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon pointed out this morning when death duties were first devised in the last century, these were the cases it was sought to grab into the net.  Nowadays the situation is that the persons hardest hit are persons of very moderate means indeed.  I think this section as at present drafted and section 23 are downright iniquitous and no amount of cheese-paring or messing about will meet my objection to it in its present form.  I sympathise with the Minister entirely, in so far as he is trying to get at the managing director who joins a superannuation scheme, injects vast sums into it in order to have his estate drawing vast <Col N="490" /> sums and obtaining the benefits and relief not intended for such cases.  The Minister can go ahead with that type of situation to the fullest extent and we on this side will support him but, in so far as in this Bill he is grabbing into the estate duty net more and more small people of moderate means, we are entitled to object to the utmost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to voice an opinion on this.  I as a layman would protest against the whole manner in which this section 22 was brought before the House, and I can include section 23.  No layman would, and many lawyers would not, have seen the pitfalls that were in this.  The Minister says he himself is responsible for it.  I find that hard to believe.  It is shown in the marginal note to section 23 as:</P>
      <P>Cesser of proviso to section 4 of Finance Act, 1894, except with respect to certain property.</P>
      <P>The explanation given for that in the explanatory memorandum is:</P>
      <P>Section 23 is designed to ensure that property which was provided by the deceased and which, under existing law, is regarded as property in which he never had an interest and is therefore non-aggregable,</P>
      <P>The explanation gives us no idea of what is in section 23.  It would be great for testing drunken drivers.  It continues:</P>
      <P>will in future be aggregated with the rest of the property passing on his death for the purpose of determining the rate of Estate Duty payable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, it embraces this.  Section 22 is in regard to superannuation.  Section 23 is in regard to insurance policies.  They are mainly benefits that would come to a widow that heretofore, or even today, were not taxed for death duty but will be now.  I find it hard to know who thought this out.  I cannot imagine the Minister did it himself or that even the Government did.  Surely the Fianna <Col N="491" /> Fáil Party did not because many of them I have met are not in favour of it.  I do not know why this is going through the House at all.  If democracy were at work in this House, this whole section would be taken away. This is a terrible imposition.  The Government have been asking people to save and to make provision for their retirement and a man is expected to contribute to a pension scheme.  Now, here late in the day we come in and attack them.  It is shameful the way this was brought in as a trap for Deputies.  It is shameful the way the explanatory memorandum covers it up. I would suggest to the Minister that the best way out of this&mdash;it makes no difference to the raising of money&mdash;is to take out section 22, and section 23 as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said he was against the whole section but that all he could do was put down amendments. The Minister then pointed out he was taxing gifts.  If a man worked and earned money and passed that money on as a gift why should the people who received the gift be taxed on it?  That is a dreadful philosophy. Did it ever strike the Minister that the people who would be benefiting from this would be working in anticipation of the expectation they will have and they might have worked hard for a whole lifetime and this was not a gift that was handed to them.</P>
      <P>There is no human feeling in this.  I am glad to be in this House and to see that there are members, prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who have spoken against section 18 and section 22 of this Bill.  I think it is not a case of the Minister looking at it again and being mild about it. Demand is here in this House from all sides that the Minister should remove that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy T. Lynch has overstated the case slightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain to Deputy T. Lynch that democracy does work but, at the same time, I was not consulted by the Minister before he introduced this Finance Bill. <Col N="492" /> Neither were the rest of us.  We can hardly expect that that omission will not occur in exactly the same manner the next time.</P>
      <P>I think we should look at the Bill as it was presented to us.  I was disappointed at the way the Minister has been speaking just recently when he was explaining to us that he was trying to catch managing directors of companies who were avoiding tax by salting away part of their estates in their superannuation schemes.  It is, of course, very common now to assume that all company directors in general, and managing directors in particular, are inherently immoral so far as taxation and remuneration matters are concerned.  I think that is not a fact. Certainly we should not pin this section around immoral or even moral company directors.</P>
      <P>If a director who is a member of his company's superannuation scheme were doing something unusual, it would be perfectly obvious to the Revenue Commissioners as soon as the scheme was submitted to them for approval.  That, I think, wipes out that as an argument.  I do not know whether the Minister has got any information from the Revenue Commissioners that this has become a common practice, and that company directors are salting away their funds.  We have no evidence so far that that is the case.  If I am wrong in that, I am sure the Minister will tell me, but I do not believe it is the case for one moment.  To be perfectly frank, I agree with a lot of what Deputy Sweetman said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so much worried about the person with tons and tons of money because his estate will suffer the maximum rate of estate duty anyway. I am concerned about the great number, and the growing number, of small people who are now members of superannuation schemes.  We must get this clearly stated and I want to state it quite clearly now: beneficiaries of superannuation schemes go down in some excellent companies to the very lowest level of employment, and even in medium companies, they include salesmen, foremen, charge-hands and senior employees, male and female. <Col N="493" /> These are not capitalists by any manner of means.  They are earning £700, £800, £900 or £1,000 a year at the very least, and many of them are earning up to £1,200 or £1,400 a year, and they are still not regarded as being overpaid or as being wealthy.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who will be hit by this provision if it goes through. Those are the last people the Minister wants to hit, or any of us wants to hit. I feel there is still a misconception in the minds of the Minister's advisers that there is some fearful skulduggery carried on by company directors and that this is the only way to stop it.  I deny that there is any such skulduggery on any scale.  I cannot say there is not even one case; there may be a few; but there are few, if any.</P>
    <P>Here we are making provision for what I regard as an almost impossible situation and thereby making life impossible for the dependants of a deceased member of a superannuation scheme who, in many cases, will be completely crippled by the burden placed on them.  While the amount which the larger dependants will have to pay in estate duty will be considerable, I cannot foresee that the total amount to Revenue raised thereby would be considerable by any manner of means.  I do not think it will help us to reduce income tax, or turnover tax, or anything else.  It will be a marginal receipt and Revenue will hardly know whether they got it or missed it. There seems to be in the minds of the Minister's advisers a feeling of jealousy that &ldquo;someone is getting something which I cannot get&rdquo;, and they take one wide swipe and try to hit someone.  They may hit him but the follow-through connects with a lot of other innocent heads.</P>
    <P>For that reason I agree with Deputy de Valera in his plea to the Minister to lay off section 22 for the moment and give us some assurance that the whole matter will be reconsidered before Report Stage.  We could, if he likes, have a showdown on it, but that is not the way in which we should do it.  We had an argument with him this morning on the question of retrospection and, after a very quiet and reasoned discussion, the Minister met <Col N="494" /> us very fairly indeed, and he satisfied us that certain amendments would be made.  We were all delighted.  I certainly was.  I see no reason why we should not be met equally fairly in this matter.  There is no point in having a clash.  It is quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I would feel much happier if some specific steps were being taken to combat unjustifiable tax avoidance.  I do not agree for a moment that section 22 does that.  It is far too much of an omnibus arrangement, and it taxes people who should properly be excluded altogether.  I have a horrible suspicion that there are people whose dependants will be in receipt of death benefits of a certain sort who will be excluded from this altogether.  The Minister mentioned certain <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  I do not know whether he would like to enlarge on that matter at this stage, but that appears to me to show there are still loopholes, and that certain classes of people are being given preferential treatment.  I see no reason why they should.</P>
    <P>I can see that there should be some differential between contributory schemes and non-contributory schemes. A non-contributory scheme can never benefit the individual who was a member of the scheme.  A contributory scheme is part of his own money and, as I say, I can see there may be some reason for a differential there.  As regards the <i>ex gratia</i> payment I am more doubtful.  On the general principle I feel we would be very well advised, in view of the unanimous opinion expressed in this House, to defer consideration of this section over the week-end at least.  I would prefer if it were possible for the Minister to meet us here and now and say that he will agree to have a complete reconsideration of sections 22 and 23 before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the atmosphere the Minister has generated, I shall use a mild observation. What was in my mind in this respect was far from mild.  The paragraph in the explanatory memorandum dealing with section 22 is outrageous.  Section 22 does two things: it provides a liability for duty and a liability for aggregation.  The paragraph in the explanatory memorandum deals with a liability for duty but is completely silent on the more important effect of the section, the liability for aggregation. Memoranda of this sort are for the purpose of explaining to nontechnical, non-legal people what the sections mean and the legal consequence they will have.  The second legal consequence of this section was not explained and it should have been. However, in the atmosphere the Minister generated a moment ago I shall not say what was in my mind in this respect.  I shall keep it for another occasion.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Sweetman.  At this stage it is worth calling the attention of the House to the fact that yesterday <Col N="497" /> and today in many instances we have been probing, inquiring and seeking, at some times unduly persistently, information with regard to the meaning of sections in this highly technical Bill.  It is a Bill of legislation by reference and the precise meaning is at times concealed in references to previous sections.  Therefore, when one finds in relation to sections 22 and 23 that the explanatory memorandum does not alert Deputies in a clear way to what the proposals are, there is a clear danger that this House, as a deliberative assembly, can be stultified.</P>
      <P>It is a very grave threat to the position of Deputies.  We in this House, apart from Ministers, have not the assistance of experts in the Departments. Whatever we do must be the result of our researches.  We are perfectly willing to do it provided we are alerted to the need for it.  In relation to sections 22 and 23, Deputies have been lulled by a feeling of false security through the explanatory memorandum.  We have a repetition of what took place in relation to Resolution No. 18.  If that continues we might as well lock up the House and let somebody in a backroom in a Government Department legislate.  I protest as strongly as possible against this position.</P>

      <P>Section 22 as it stands provides that death benefits will be liable to duty in all circumstances, whether or not it is property in which the deceased was deemed never to <Col N="498" /> have had an interest.  There is nothing in the section which says it will be aggregated.  Section 23 does say so.</P>

      <P>It says &ldquo;shall in future be aggregated with the rest of the property&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that there might not have been a fuller explanation of section 22 if there were a reference in that section to what section 23 proposed but, strictly speaking, an explanatory memorandum is limited to giving three or four lines of explanation of what is proposed. It might have been fuller.</P>
