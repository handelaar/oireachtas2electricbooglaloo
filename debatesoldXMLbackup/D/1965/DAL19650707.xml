As there is no statutory limitation in Ireland in respect of prosecution for criminal offences, no action is necessary in our case.</P>

The Board are liable for rates at a fixed valuation on the Pigeon House generating station, which is an acquired undertaking, under section 11 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1930, as amended by section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1942.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be helpful in the first instance to emphasise the legal coverage envisaged by the section.  The essential purpose of the proposed section 22 is threefold&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  to continue, if section 23 of the Bill is enacted, the existing exemption from estate duty of death benefits not exceeding £5,000 where such benefits are payable to the widow and dependent children;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  to preclude a liability to <Col N="691" /> succession duty at 11½ per cent of death benefits payable under non-contributory schemes by providing that all death benefits should be deemed to be interests provided by the deceased and therefore within the charge to estate duty, in which case benefits not exceeding £5,000, payable to the widow and dependent children, would be exempt from estate duty;</P>
    <P>(3)  to bring under charge to estate duty payments, in the nature of death benefits, made under such arrangements as where a policy of assurance for a large amount may be effected by a family company on the life of a director for the benefit of the director's dependants who may be the other shareholders.</P>
    <P>No figures are available on which to base an estimate of the amount of duty which would have been payable if benefits not caught by existing law had been under a charge for duty in the last financial year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, however, each of these accounts, being the expenditure side of the Exchequer account for the financial year to which it relates, had already been published three times, namely, in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>, in the financial tables issued in connection with the Budget, and in the Finance Accounts.</P>

      <P>A site for the erection of a new Garda station at Tramore near the railway station was acquired from Coras Iompair Éireann in 1962.  It transpired, however, that the site is located in an area which Bord Fáilte Éireann wish to have developed for recreation and amusement purposes and both they and the Waterford County Council have represented that the Garda station should be built elsewhere.  In the circumstances, negotiations were initiated with the county council and Bord Fáilte with a view to the provision of a suitable alternative site.  It has not so far been found possible to procure such a site but every effort is being made to bring the matter to an early conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 21 by Deputy Esmonde on 19th May, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in County Meath the rate is 35/5d. in the £ as compared with the rate of 72/5d. in County Donegal, so that the £17 abatement to the Meath farmer is equivalent to a valuation of £34 to a Donegal farmer who is in receipt of only £17.  Would he not consider this and make some allowance at least for the counties on the western seaboard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that situation but I am also aware that 89 per cent of the farmers of County Donegal have valuations of under £20 and that any increase under this heading would not be of any value to them. At least 89 per cent of them would not benefit by one penny if this were increased. Apart from this, the question of increasing the employment allowance is one which has been considered on a number of occasions and while other benefits have been increased by way of a reduction in rates to the farmers, this one has not been changed and I do not think that any strong <Col N="695" /> case can be made for changing it now, any more than was made in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

As the Minister's party in the majority in that county council, surely that might influence him.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the replies to Question Nos. 22, 23, 24 and 25 together.  With your permission, I also propose to circulate parts of the reply with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Since 1955, nine local authorities submitted technical documents involving eleven proposals for the provision of public and privately-sponsored indoor swimming pools with State assistance: the names of these authorities and details of the location of the pools will be circulated with the Official Report.  Preliminary enquiries were also made by a number of other local authorities and voluntary bodies. Subsidy has so far been paid in respect of one proposal only, namely, at the rate of 50 per cent of the loan charges arising from a loan of £7,500 payable by Limerick County Council for a completed pool at Mungret College, Limerick.  In the case of the other proposals seven are at an advanced planning stage and two pools are in course of construction.</P>
      <P>To date, 34 local authorities, the names of which will be circulated with the Official Report, have requested information on the scheme to erect basic indoor pools.  While no local authority has yet formally notified me of its intention to provide a pool under this scheme, my Department is in consultation with a number of voluntary bodies in the matter, and the position is also being considered at meetings of elected representatives of local authorities.  I have impressed on interested bodies that they should contact my Department without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The precise information requested in Question No. 36 is not readily available. Perhaps, however, it would meet the Deputy's requirements if I tell him that, in the five year period ended 30th June last, a total of 1,147 properties purchased for land bonds amounting in nominal value to some £5.36 million vested in the Land Commission while, in the same period, purchase moneys aggregating about £4.36 million in respect of 1,041 estates were allocated.</P>
      <P>Delay in allocation of land bonds representing the purchase moneys of estates taken over by the Land Commission is a matter about which I have expressed concern on a number of occasions.  In particular, I would refer the Deputy to my remarks at Vol. 182, cols. 909-910 and 1368-9 of the Official Report, in the course of which I informed the House of the results of an investigation made by me regarding delay in allocation of purchase moneys in cumpulsory acquisition cases.</P>
      <P>This investigation showed that the average time-lag between the Appointed Day (normally the date on which the Land Commission enter into possession of a property) and the issue of payment instructions to the bankers was 27 months.  Commenting on the duration of this time-lag, however, I pointed out that the Land Commission were responsible for only two months out of the 27 month period&mdash;the greater part of the delay arising from owners and their legal advisers not expediting lodgment of title&mdash;and I stated that the whole matter was under examination with a view to simplifying the existing procedure and eliminating delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resultant introduction, in consultation with the Incorporated Law Society, of the Land Purchase Acts (Rules) 1964 has considerably simplified the machinery in relation to title clearance and the application of these Rules, together with the operation of sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Land Act, 1965, will, I feel, lead to marked <Col N="708" /> improvement in this important sector. Moreover, to ensure that examination will proceed with the utmost expedition in future.  I am arranging for a strengthening of the staff of the Examiner's Branch of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our primary interest in importing Charollais into this country is to improve the quality and suitability of our commercial cattle through the use of Charollais bulls. As a necessary part of this programme, I have decided that we should endeavour to build up a number of pedigree Charollais herds here to provide us with a supply of first-class bulls for crossing, and also to enable us, in time, to become an exporter of pedigree Charollais cattle and semen.  It seems to me that the best way to do this is for my Department to establish a first-class pedigree herd and, side by side with it, to permit the establishment of a limited number of private pedigree herds by individual breeders. Last year, my Department imported 18 Charollais animals from France. This year, in addition to a further import by my Department, I have also authorised the establishment of private herds by five persons who are, in my view, capable and qualified to establish and maintain first-class pedigree herds. Applications from other suitable persons will be considered whenever a further importation is being made.</P>
      <P>The number of animals involved in the current importation is 50, 15 of which are for my own Department and 35 for private importers.  It is not the practice to give particulars relating to individuals in cases such as this.</P>
      <P>The conditions under which the cattle are being purchased and imported are detailed and lengthy, and I am arranging to have copies made available in the Library.  It will be noted that all costs and expenses are being borne by the importers and that they are required to give an undertaking not to re-export the animals they import.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister, in relation to amendment No. 54, consider amending it so as to bring within the net of &ldquo;exclusive occupation&rdquo; relatives, on the same lines as relatives are included elsewhere in the Bill; in other words, have it, &ldquo;in the exclusive occupation of the person concerned or of his issue,&rdquo; within a limit?  I am thinking, looking at it again now, that if a person buys a house for his son and the son lives in it exclusively, it will not be exclusive occupation by the purchaser and if that house were sold at a profit afterwards, there would be a tax on it.  That is not the type of case the Minister is trying to catch.  I think it could be covered well enough by something on the lines of &ldquo;person or relative&rdquo; and defining &ldquo;relative&rdquo; as being father or mother or issue.  At least, you will get somewhere there. As it is at present, it seems to me that the amendment is not sufficient to cover the genuine case of a person who buys a house for another.  Fathers have been known to have to do that for their sons.</P>

      <P>Is that not a very daft arrangement, if the Minister stops to think of it?  Surely he should consider this position.  There are in Ireland at present, in rural Ireland particularly, and indeed in the city, a lot of large, unmanageable houses which could be worked as long as domestic staff was available.  Domestic staff no longer being available, the owner can do either of two things.  He can take the roof off the house and abandon his home or convert it into two or three flats, retaining one for himself and letting two to two of his neighbours, which incidentally creates additional residences for families who otherwise would have to get housing elsewhere. With the passage of time, the person determines to move from the country to the city and the business, profession or whatever it is, is passed on to a son, to the future generation who have their own accommodation.  The owner sells the house which now consists of three apartments and goes to live in Dublin.  Is he to be charged with the difference, which is to be assessed I do not know how, between what the house was worth before he changed it into three flats and what it is now worth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The market value of one of the large houses I have in mind is minus £500 at present.  It would nearly pay anybody £500 to take it down.  I know of several, but the trouble is that one cannot get them taken down.  Many people with such houses would cheerfully take the roof off if they were free to do so but it cannot be done.  The valuation commissioners are apprised of this problem. If you have a large house in rural Ireland and you go to the valuation commissioners today, in almost every case they will substantially reduce the poor law valuation of the house in order to make it possible for people to retain it and not constrain them to take the roof off in order to avoid the impact of the present burden of rates.  They recognise that these large houses which may be in reasonably good condition are now a liability rather than an asset.  If a realistic sale value were taken or if the value placed by the commissioners of valuation on such a house were taken before adaptation and if that were compared with the value that might be realised after conversion, a very heavy burden might be thrown on the person who had done what, in my judgment, was the public-spirited and sensible thing to do, that is, to convert these big gazebos into three or four manageable apartments which are badly wanted. These cases frequently arise with dispensary doctors or country solicitors, and so on, who have inherited these big houses which in modern times are quite unmanageable and yet in many cases eminently susceptible to useful adaptation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 57:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 32, subsection 3 (b), to add a new subparagraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii)  The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a holiday residence so used by an individual or his family.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to exclude a holiday residence from the provisions of the section where it is used by an individual or his family. <Col N="738" /> The Minister will be aware from what has been said that where a person has a holiday residence, a seaside bungalow or small house, or a bungalow even in a rural part of the country which he uses as a temporary residence for himself or his family, it is our view that such a residence should be exempt.  In certain circumstances a person may dispose of such a place but generally they are retained in a family, possibly for a very considerable period.</P>
    <P>The point has already been made by Deputy Sweetman that the same exemption should apply to the children of the occupier.  In many of these cases the individual who purchases the house, or who may be the owner, may, in practice, use the house or bungalow less than the members of his family. He may be occupied in his business or profession and may allow a married son or daughter to use the place over a period.  For that reason, we believe that this type of residence should be exempt because it is not by any stretch of imagination comparable with the development of land which the section is designed to catch.  There is a strong case for arguing in favour of exempting any holiday residence or seaside apartments used for the purposes of an individual or his family during a certain portion of the year, or, indeed, for the greater part of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again you can give rise to all kinds of avoidance contrivances on this.  One must define what a holiday residence is.  It does not necessarily mean a seaside bungalow or house.  I might live close to the sea and have a holiday residence in Dublin. Having acquired that residence, I could sell it and acquire another residence and allege that this was a holiday residence, too.  It would not be possible to define what a holiday residence is.  In any event, in a case such as described by Deputy Cosgrave, the relief which I propose to give of £1,000 would exclude it.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks about someone forming a company and then doing a major development work. These people could not possibly contend they were doing anything other than the business of developing land. Obviously they must have been formed for that purpose and the fact that they have completed the job and then maybe gone into liquidation does not affect the issue.  The only people we are worried about are isolated individuals doing small jobs.  I agree with Deputy Lenihan in this.  I do not think excluding Case 6 is asking the <Col N="741" /> Minister to take any risk at all because the collectors of taxes will be well able to catch those really engaged in land development and not just doing small jobs on farms and private houses. The exclusion of Case 6 really only relieves the small private individual doing an odd job.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed:&mdash;&ldquo;That section 39, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to make it clear that, so far as I am concerned, I agree that section 6 of the 1935 Act was not workable because of the inclusion in it of the declaration of intention.  I can see strong arguments being raised, therefore, on the point just made by Deputy Booth in relation to the formation of that particular company.  One difficulty in relation to Standing Orders is that very often in a case like this, it is impossible to discuss amendments adequately until one knows exactly what the section means.  There is, I think, considerable doubt in many minds as to what this section means.  Certainly there is some doubt in my mind.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) there is reference to a person having an interest in land, that is to say, having an interest in land at the date this Bill is enacted. In subsection (3) there is a reference to a person having acquired an interest in land.  It seems to me the difference between the two is that the first catches anybody who owns property today and the second catches the person who will acquire land after today.  I think that needs to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also some misunderstanding about the period of six years.  As I interpret the section. the six-year period operates only after the reconstruction work has been done.  The <Col N="742" /> position, therefore, is that a person who has owned property for 25 years and disposes of that property between this and the enactment of the Bill can be caught, even though he does not know at all that the property is going to be developed.  A person can go to someone who has owned property for the past 25 years and say to him: &ldquo;I like your house.  I want the privacy of your grounds.  I want to go and live in your house,&rdquo; and the vendor sells in good faith, unaware that the purchaser has entered into a development arrangement.  It seems quite clear from the wording of subsection (2) (b) that in that case the vendor is the person who will be liable for tax on his profit notwithstanding that he did not know he was selling the property for development purposes and notwithstanding that he believed he was selling it for occupation by the purchaser in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised with me as soon as the Bill was published.  I understand it is a matter that is worrying another Dublin solicitor.  He was sufficiently interested to get an opinion of senior counsel.  The view of senior counsel is that the vendor in the case I have mentioned is caught and will have to pay tax.  It is not for me to go into the niceties as between the Minister, Deputy P.J. Lenihan and Deputy Booth about Case 6.  It is the Minister's job to solve that one, not mine; but it is my job on this side of the House to ensure that the genuine case is not caught.  I know all about the law in relation to cases that are not genuine and the way in which the necessity to carry conviction through home to judgment in court meant that Case 6 was really to a large extent a holder in certain cases, particularly in cases in which people wanted to tell an untruth which could not be proved against them, and the manner in which, after that, it could be breached by liquidation.</P>
    <P>The situation, as I see it, is that if a person buys land and then disposes of that land to a builder and the builder is able to charge in the cost of acquisition, then I accept that the Minister must find a method of ensuring that, in a case where the land has <Col N="743" /> been bought in modern circumstances, what is allowed as a deduction, on the one hand, cannot get away as a tax free profit on the other.  If it can, we would drive a coach and four through the whole question of all builders' profits.  I must be realistic about that. It is entirely wrong, however, to take into that net people who have been, down through the years, living in the house for themselves.  The six year period of exclusive occupation after reconstruction does not get them out of it.</P>
    <P>The section and this Part of the Bill should be so framed as to ensure that anybody who is in a house and living in it at the date of the passing of the Act is able to dispose of it afterwards. If that were done, you would not have the difficulty in the case mentioned by Deputy Dillon, or the difficulty that arises in the case I mentioned where a vendor can be caught willy-nilly. As the Part stands, it goes far further than is warranted and, I believe, goes further than the Minister intends.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of this going to be?  Let the Minister consider this: if the person who is genuinely in occupation of a fringe house and lands, or a farm and lands around Dublin, where there is a desperate shortage of land, is to be caught for income tax and surtax then he is not going to sell and there will be an even greater shortage of building lands.  The Minister's remedy, for tax purposes, is going to provide a very much worse social and economic evil.  The Minister knows from the time he was in Industry and Commerce that one of the main causes of the increase in the price of houses has been the shortage of building sites. If a person who has been living in a place for a long time is not to be able to sell without being caught for income tax and surtax, all of which is piled into one year, then he will not sell at all and the Minister, the House and the country, will have a much worse problem in relation to building lands.</P>
    <P>There is also the point which the Minister can take as being reasonably clear, that the way he has drafted <Col N="744" /> section 39 (b) catches an innocent vendor.  I do not believe he intended to do that but undoubtedly he has done it.  There is, in some people's minds, the idea that we should take the value as at the 1st April, 1965, and run that through.  That was the basis of the recent capital gains tax in Britain.  I do not think that is desirable. I do not think a capital gains tax is desirable here.  I accept that the Minister had to do something to strengthen section 6 of the 1935 Act but in doing sofi he should not catch the innocent cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a capital gains tax that he wants this for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am talking about a tax on incomes by reason of selling or developing property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>But when the person sells the property, he does not know at the time that it is going to be for development.  Ultimately he discovers he is liable for tax as a result of green belt land coming within the ambit of building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a person who sells a house or land, or a house with land, for development, and the developer has entered into an arrangement in advance of the sale to develop it.  It is reasonable that the person who sells knows exactly what the purpose of this is and usually the price is fixed accordingly.  As Deputy Sweetman says, the person who develops the land will be subject to tax on the profits he makes out of his activities.  He may deduct whatever he paid for it from these profits but the person who has got the sum which is deducted should be liable to tax, too, because that is income in connection with development.  The section is designed to catch cases like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the period of operation is concerned, the tax year of assessment will be 1965/66.  As Deputies know, accounts for the year preceding are <Col N="746" /> what are looked into for the purpose of the year of collection, 1965/66. Therefore, if a man had carried out this transaction and had made up his accounts to the end of last March and if this were a transaction within that period, the 1965/66 assessment year would catch that transaction.  That answers Deputy Sweetman's point about the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does.  Specific examples are much better.  A man I know well bought a place in 1925 for £5,000.  He has lived in that place since 1925, within the meaning of &ldquo;exclusive occupation&rdquo; as it is in the section here.  If he sells that place for £15,000 the day after the Bill becomes law, openly for the purpose of development, will he be charged income tax and surtax on the £10,000 profit, and if not, why not?</P>

      <P>Since 1960, land has nearly doubled in value.  I can give the Minister particulars of actual transactions <Col N="748" /> in land.  In 1960, a sum of £3,500 was paid for 66 acres.  In 1965, those 66 acres fetched a sum of £6,600. A 55-acre farm fetched £3,000 in 1960 and £5,500 in 1965.</P>

      <P>It is an apparent increase in the value of land equally explicable by a drop in the value of money and land retaining its real value.  In those circumstances, there will be visited the penalty of income tax although the person disposing is getting in or about the real value of what he paid for the land in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be possible to decide now how much of the increased value is attributable to a rise in land values and house property values and how much is in connection with the addition of an extra room at the back, or something like that?  If anybody develops his land in the country&mdash;and that does not mean necessarily taking virgin land and building a house upon it&mdash;or if you transform a holding in any way and make it usable for a different purpose, it may become of more value.  I cannot see how you will decide how such of the increased value is due to the alteration which was carried out and how much is due to the change in the value of money. It is very much a matter of opinion and bargaining but it does not seem to me to be a fair basis on which to assess tax.</P>

That is not a question of intention.  That is a factual question that can be decided in the first place <Col N="749" /> by the Special Commissioners and, after that, by the circuit court.  If he amends it as that if a person was himself in exclusive occupation on Budget day&mdash;even if the Minister wants a short period before that so as to avoid the proof of one particular day&mdash;then it means he will exclude by that, anyway, all the genuine cases of people who have houses and lands and who have not been acquiring them for their own so-called intention to develop but in fact really for occupation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the outskirts of Dublin, there is land that cannot be built on at the moment.  Suppose the Government or the corporation decide they will build on it and some speculator or builder comes out to a farmer and says: &ldquo;The value of farming land around Dublin is about £300 to £350 an acre.  I shall give you £500.&rdquo; He cannot build by law and does not see any future in building on it.  However, this is suddenly changed and the seller of the land is absolutely robbed.  Then the Revenue Commissioners take a tax off him, although the land in question might have been purchased two generations back for £1,000 or about £20 an acre.  In this case, he will be taxed on the difference between whatever he paid for it and whatever he received from the speculator, although he did not know the land was going for speculative purposes.  Consequently, in the one year, he is taxed on his profit. Suppose that, at the moment, you have a farm on the Dublin mountains.  With the building going out every year, the value of such property is increasing. Surely the tax should be worked out over the number of years rather than surtax and supertax, and so on? Surely everything should be worked out and he should be taxed over the period of years during which he was in residence of the property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again, if a man is a farmer, say on Griffith Avenue, Dublin, and wants to hold on to his farm all his life.  Suppose the corporation say they will compulsorily acquire his land.  He does not want to sell it.  He wants to <Col N="750" /> enjoy it and to make his money out of farming it.  If the corporation acquired that land compulsorily and he gets the market value, he does not want to sell it, but he is obliged to do so, and is taxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there should be an allowance.  The land has been appreciating in value over the years as building approaches nearer and nearer. A man could sell it three years earlier when it could not be developed.  He will get away with that.  The purchaser cannot make any agreement with the corporation because there is no solution to the building problem.  Why not have an abatement of tax over, say, a period of five years instead of one year?  Otherwise land will not be sold at all.  It comes to the point Deputy Sweetman made that land will not be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>How will Deputy Sweetman's amendment cover the man who sells land as agricultural land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My main interest is to protect everybody who is <i>bona fide</i> in occupation of a house and land or of land alone on Budget day.  To tax anybody in exclusive occupation on Budget day because of prospective development on his land afterwards is tantamount to a capital gains tax.  The Minister has given an undertaking that he will cover that.  However, there will be other cases where people will, after Budget day, buy land and houses and dispose of them later, as Deputy Belton has said.  There should be an arrangement entitling them to spread their gain over all the years from the date of their purchase to the date of their sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they have bought for speculation, certainly they should be caught but why should it be concertina-ed into <Col N="752" /> one year?  Deputy Belton's suggestion for a spread over is perfectly reasonable. I can understand the Minister's anxiety to ensure that sums taken as a deduction from profits will not be allowed as capital free gains in the hands of another person.  That is understandable. Trying to prevent avoidance by that simple means does not require the services of a technically clever man.  We must be quite sure that we shall not either attack the innocent case&mdash;in this context everybody was innocent on Budget day&mdash;or the person who genuinely buys and farms land which, 20 years hence, is acquired for development.  It is wrong that that man should have to pay in that one year sums running right up to the top of the surcharge scale. There must be in the Bill, to cover cases of purchase, a provision by which a person is entitled to spread tax over the years that have elapsed since he acquired the land.  That seems only reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not give rise to a claim that high income in a given year should be levelled out against low income in another year or other years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Land could be worth £25,000 or £30,000 as farming land.  It could be sold at a price of £120,000 to £140,000 as building land. If a man sells and is taxed on the higher price, he will be better off if, when selling, he puts a stipulation in the lease that the land should not be built on ever.  He will be better off keeping the leasehold and charging £10 a year ground rent.  As I have said, if this provision is not spread over the years, such land will not be sold for building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man buys anything that appreciates in value&mdash;a picture, shall we say&mdash;and after five years sells that picture, this provision will reduce the profit he made on that picture to an annual profit.  Anything brought into the income tax or surtax sphere is brought in because it is deemed to be an annual profit.  When the person has sold his picture, is it <Col N="753" /> not the proper conception of the profit he made that it should be divisible by, say, five and that he would be called on to pay one-fifth in each of the years?</P>

      <P>I do not quite agree with the Minister there.  I think the proper way to put it is that he wants to make it an annual profit except in certain circumstances, which is a different way of putting it, but he does want to make a single transaction, in certain circumstances, an annual profit.  If he wants to make it an annual profit, then he must make it an annual profit when it is to his disadvantage as well as when it is to his advantage and the way to make it an annual profit is to average it from the date of purchase provided such date of purchase was after Budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he was considering having £1,000 profit tax free.  That might be adequate in cases of very small houses, seaside residences, and so on.  Would it not be possible to work out some percentage because, to follow what Deputy Belton has said, I also feel that there is a danger that we may discourage <Col N="754" /> land from coming on the market for development?  Certainly around my constituency that is a very real problem.  I can see that a tax free profit of £1,000 might be attractive in a very small case but it will mean nothing if a man is disposing of a fairly large acreage.  I would hope that people who have control of fairly large acreages of land around the city would be encouraged to sell them for development, rather than the reverse. If we could say that any profit below a certain percentage would be tax free, that might be an incentive to people to put their land on the market for development but £1,000 is neither here nor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Something on the lines of Deputy Booth's suggestion could be worked out, but it would need to be reasonably big, say, over a period of four or five years that he would pay only half the tax and no surtax, or something like that.  Any accountant could work out that the stage could be reached where it would be better for a man to sell his land for farming than to build on it.  We have not reached that stage yet but we are near it.  If the owner could be encouraged to sell for development by the fact that he could make a profit, he would prefer to sell it for building rather than for farming.  The incentive could be a 50 per cent reduction in tax or no surtax.</P>

Today, I told Deputy Sweetman that I would consider his point about the date of operation.  I told Deputy Belton that I would consider his point about the difficulty that might arise from the social point of view in obtaining land for building purposes. Then Deputy Booth comes in and wants to have an escalator used for relieving profits.  When a person is being reasonable, surely the House can accept it.  I can stand on the section.</P>

      <P>A person might have acquired land by purchase or otherwise, say, 15 years ago.  At the time when he acquired it, he might not have been engaged in dealing in or developing land.  He might, for example, have utilised the land for a number of years afterwards for agriculture.  If at a later stage he developed the land by building, it would be inequitable to take the original value of the land as trading stock on his accounts.  The broad effect of the paragraph is that if a person sets about developing or disposing of the land within five years of the time he acquired it, the actual cost of acquisition or, where the land was not purchased, the market value at the time of acquisition, is to be the initial valuation of the land as trading stock.  In any other case, the initial valuation is to be the market value five years before the person embarked on developing it.</P>

Nevertheless, I have decided, in order to ensure that nobody would be left in any doubt by reason of the opening words of the section &ldquo;whether before or after the passing of the Act&rdquo;, to put in the specific year of assessment: &ldquo;For the purposes of an assessment for any year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1965, or on any succeeding 6th day of April...&rdquo; That ensures that there is no retrospective element that is strange to tax legislation.</P>

      <P>The assessment for 1965-66.  As the Deputy knows, in a continuing business&mdash;I think I mentioned this casually a while ago&mdash;the profits of the preceding year are assessed in the year 1965-66 and tax is payable on them in that year, and there is ample judicial authority for this practice.  There is the case with which I am sure Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Higgins are familiar, Connolly v. Birch, in which the judge held that the profits taxed in respect of a year before the assessment year were properly taxed.  This gives effect in words to the same principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 43 is aimed at defeating a particular type of case where a group of persons form a company which buys land and puts up a building on it&mdash;say, an office block&mdash; with a view to reselling at a profit. The actual building may be done by the company itself or by a building contractor.  The building contractor may be independent or he may be an associate.  If the building were disposed of in the normal way, the profit <Col N="759" /> would be taxable under section 39 (2) (a) of the Bill even if, apart from this venture, the company was not engaged in dealing in or developing land.  However, if the person who wishes to acquire the building does not buy it but instead buys shares in the company, the seller or sellers of the shares do not incur liability.  The consequence of the operation accordingly is that what would have been a taxable profit in the hands of the company emerges as a non-taxable profit in the shareholders' hands.</P>

The contract was entered into in the first ten days of April and the date for closing of the sale is 1st September.  The shares will not be transferred until 1st September.  I have not examined this from another point of view, whether there is liability or not, but there is a case where the contract was genuinely made before the Minister stood up on Budget day.  There should be an exemption to cover a case where the contract was so made.  I think &ldquo;sale&rdquo; refers to the closing of the sale, not to the execution of the contract.</P>

      <P>It inserts two new subsections in section 86 of the Finance Act, 1963.  These are subsections (2 A) and (2 B).  Subsection (2 A) concerns two types of case.  The first is where a lump sum may be paid at the option of the lessee as an alternative to a full rent.  The second case is that in which a lease is granted which is deliberately onerous and a sum is paid, as part of a colourable transaction, for the surrender of the lease.  The sum paid for the surrender of the lease is in effect a lump sum in place of rent. The proposed new legislation provides that in either case payments are to be deemed to be premiums.</P>

      <P>They will be taxable accordingly under section 86 of the Finance Act, 1963.  The new subsection (2 B) relates to a case similar to that in which a sum is paid for the surrender of an onerous lease, namely, the case where a sum is paid as consideration for the variation or waiver of any term of a lease.  It is provided that such sums will be liable to tax in the same circumstances and to the same extent as premiums.</P>

Frankly, until I turned up section 86 a moment ago and saw that section 54 of this Bill refers to it, I had completely forgotten, but I want to raise it now, so that, if I feel disposed, I can put something down about it on Report.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it might help myself to understand it.  The proposed new section 86A deals with the case where a short lease is granted for a premium less in value than the full market value of the lease&mdash;to, for example, a company which the lessor controls&mdash;and the lease is thereafter assigned by the lessee at a more or less adequate price.  The proposed new provision is broadly to the effect that tax is to be charged by reference to the amount by which the consideration paid for the assignment exceeds the original premium.  The amount of the excess is, for purposes of the charge, to be written down at two per cent for each year of the original duration of <Col N="766" /> the lease except the first.

It should be explained that section 92 of the Finance Act, 1963, is concerned with a case in which a charge is being made on a lessor under section 86 of the Act and the premises in question are occupied for business purposes by the lessee.  The purpose of this section 92 is to even things out, as it were; broadly, it provides that, where the lessor has been charged by reference to the premiums as if it were rent, the lessee is to be treated correspondingly as paying rent over the term of the lease and an appropriate deduction is to be made for tax purposes in the accounts of his business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 62:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> In line 19 to substitute &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; for &ldquo;twenty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is not very elegantly phrased to deal with what I have in mind but it provides a peg on which to hang my hat.  I should like, first of all, to say that I appreciate the extension contained in section 60 which has been included by the Minister in response to representations by me, amongst other people.  It is, of course, desirable that the date on which a mine had to come into operation to get the concession should be extended somewhat.  It is not generally realised, however, that there is a good deal of work at the beginning in operating a mine which to a large extent would take away the benefit for the first year which is provided in the 1956 Act.  I admit quite frankly that when I introduced the 1956 Act, I did not know anything like as much about the business of mining as I have had to learn in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The 1956 Act provides that there shall be an exemption for the first four years at full rate and an exemption for the second four years at half rate.  This was brought in for the purpose of trying to engender an interest in mining in Ireland, just as the export tax remission was brought in at the same time in the other complementary Acts for the purpose of engendering an interest in exports. Both Acts have played their part in creating that interest.  Export tax remission is given at 100 per cent for the whole period of exports under the Act; mining relief was restricted to 100 per cent for the first four years and to 50 per cent for the second four years. It does appear clear to me now, as it was not clear to me in 1956, that in the first year of a mine's operation, there will inevitably be quite a substantial tuning-up period and that there will be a long period, running for six months or more, during which a mining mill may have to be operated, stopped, restarted and so forth, for the purposes of adjustment and that a large part of the first year will be lost in this tuning up.</P>
    <P>I agree at once that a large part of the first year in relation to exports is <Col N="769" /> equally lost, but in relation to exports, it does not matter to this extent that exports get full remission all the way through.  Mines, however, get full remission for the first four years but get only one-half remission for the next four years.  The effect of the tuning-up period, therefore, in practice, means that the first year's exemption from profits is of no value at all, because during that year no profits are earned at all because of this tuning-up period.</P>
    <P>The format of the 1956 Act is such that the period of the exemption comes into force immediately the mine starts to tune-up.  That has several disadvantages.  It has a disadvantage in relation to the loss of the first full year which is never recovered; it has a disadvantage in relation to the carry forward of capital allowances and of initial allowances of one sort or another.  It was fair enough before the Minister for Finance of the day extended in, I think, 1958, the remission for taxation on profits from exports from 50 per cent to 100 per cent, but once that was done, the effect of these restrictions has been to cut down quite substantially the position for mines as against the position for exports.  Virtually the whole of the production in a mine, as apart from the position of capital equipment, is something which is exported and has, and will have, I hope, in the future, a very substantial effect on our balance of payments.  For that reason the Minister should go further than he has gone here.</P>
    <P>I do not think my amendment for extending the total period from 20 years to 25 years is either an elegant or even an accurate way of doing what I want, but perhaps the Minister will consider it.  He has representations already in his Department from me about the matter and having given the appropriate notice now, if I felt so disposed, I would be in order in putting down something on Report.  It is a matter of some consequence and one which is so technical that the Minister would find it difficult to understand exactly the implications from a technical <Col N="770" /> point of view as apart from the technical tax point of view.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that if he or his officers have any difficulty in grasping the whole concept of what is involved in the initial engineering side of a mining venture, and how that trial run period and certain other aspects of it must affect the benefit of the tax provision that is being given, I will be very happy to arrange that the people who do understand and can express themselves better than I can will attend to the Minister and his officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Minister might do what Deputy Sweetman has just said, namely, consider going much further than this whole question of mining taxation.  I believe that it is not being helped by the attitude of the Minister's Department.  The situation with regard to mining generally is something new to this country.  They are depending on information received from mining countries where mining has been carried out for a very long time and where the system of mining and of taxation is entirely different from what it is likely to be here.  The Department is trying to set up a system of taxation which should not apply to a developing country.  Perhaps the Minister might have that matter looked after personally.  If he wants particulars, I can give him some particulars where the prospect of a mine is being seriously interfered with because some people in the Minister's Department seem to think that a mine here and one somewhere else must be the same and that when a mine goes into production there are no obstacles here which do not occur in other countries, the result being that taxation which could easily be borne by a mine in some other countries which have been developed for years might not be possible at all in this country.</P>

      <P>I know he felt there was a certain urgency about encouraging these people to undertake mining operations and, therefore, a limit was set beyond which if they did not start, they would not merit these tax reliefs. The time has been extended first to ten years and now to 20 years.  That would bring the date up to 5th April, 1976, that is, 11 years hence.  I think, as of now, at any rate, that that should provide sufficient incentive and encouragement to these people, people who have prospecting licences or who even contemplate asking for prospecting licences and going into development, to start as quickly as possible because, while we like to do things for posterity, we like to enjoy the fruits of our own labour, too, as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens, as I understand it now&mdash;as I frankly admit I did not understand in 1956&mdash; is that a mining mill starts.  It finds after some months experience that because of some unforeseen thing in relation to the minerals law it has to stop and to make some substantial change in relation to its engineering technicalities.  When any ore has run through the mill it has to be sent away, abroad usually, for treatment or, in any event, it has either to be dumped or used.  It is obviously better for it to be sold than dumped even though it may have to get what is a very much lower price than it would get if the mill were working correctly. The dumping would cost a great deal of money both from the point of view of having to transport it and of having to find some place to dump tailings and waste.  Because of the fact that the product of the mill has to be sold, even though at a reduced price, that is the commencement of trading. There may be stops and starts.  I can tell the Minister that, in a case with which I am associated, and which he knows about, it is estimated that there will be a six months' period of stops and starts and that will have the effect of killing the first year of the operation of the benefit unless there is some adjustment in that respect.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is the question of the capital allowances which cannot be carried on afterwards. Again, the argument is used that it is different from exports; it is.  It is different from exports because this comes to an end in eight years whereas the export relief goes on now until 1981, I think.  I would urge the Minister, the door having been opened wide enough, to get his officials to discuss it with people who are more competent than I am to discuss the engineering technicalities.  I can assure him from my personal experience that before I realised the engineering difficulties I did not understand the manner in which the taxation code would work in respect of it.</P>

It appears somewhat unjust that where an appeal is brought before the Special Commissioners and where the Special Commissioners, having commenced the hearing, adjourn it, they may order that a certain proportion of the assessment money may still be paid forthwith.  I can see a very good reason for paragraph (a) because if that provision were not in the Bill, it would be possible for an appellant to delay the hearing of the appeal improperly.  However, it seems unjust that the Special Commissioners, at their discretion, can adjourn an appeal and still order payment of a certain proportion of the amount still under appeal.  There is a procedure set out under subsection (2) that the inspector of taxes shall give notice in writing to the appellant of the making of the order and there may be an appeal back to the Special Commissioners who made the order in the first place.  Would the Minister undertake to look at the provision so that the right to make an order under this paragraph will be confined to cases where the hearing has been adjourned on the application of the appellant?</P>

      <P>In the first place, the Deputy will appreciate that the purpose of the 25 per cent duty was more as a deterrent than as a means of collecting revenue.  The purpose was, of course, to deter aliens from buying land here.  We found it was not a sufficient deterrent because, much though we regard land prices as inflated, nowadays in Ireland, by international standards, land is still very cheap and the 25 per cent duty did not seem to operate as effectively as we thought it would.</P>

      <P>I am still not yielding to the argument that there was undue purchase of land by aliens at that time.  Nevertheless, there was a certain amount of public feeling and campaigning, and it was felt the purpose of deterring such purchases would be better achieved by an amendment of the Land Acts which would give the Land Commission power to say whether or not land may be sold to foreigners.  That section is now in operation.  The amount of duty collected in a 20-year period was £869,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last year, the duty brought in £183,000.  In face of that, we spent the best part of a day discussing legislation which was to take £10,000 from our own hard-pressed widows and orphans&mdash;small, insignificant sums being extracted from widows because, the Minister said, the finances of the State would not stand any less.  Here we are to present £183,000 to Germans, British and other non-nationals and we apparently regard this as unimportant. On the question of non-nationals buying land, I feel very strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The sooner the Minister allows me to make my point, the sooner I shall finish.  Where we induce foreigners in with money and grants for the purpose of setting up factories which give employment in a permanent way, I am in agreement with the Government but I think the whole idea of allowing them to buy land here is wrong.  If a 25 per cent duty was not sufficient to deter them, we should have raised it to 250 per cent if necessary.  Our idea was to stop them coming in and if that required that they pay a very substantial duty for the privilege of buying land here, then we should impose that duty and maintain it.  The idea of relieving these people of a £183,000 duty is wrong. If the Land Bill makes it possible to regulate the availability of land to <Col N="777" /> foreigners, that is no reason why they should not pay a duty on the land they buy.  If the Land Commission allow such people to buy land, they should pay a substantial tax for the privilege.  We spent a day discussing the extortion of money from our own deserving people and today we decide not to take £183,000 from foreigners.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I dissociate myself from this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The object in changing the method of deterring non-nationals buying land from a 25 per cent duty to a provision in the Land Act was to ensure, for the benefit of the people of Ireland, that agricultural land would not be bought up by Germans, French, Americans or anyone else.  The Deputy mentioned industry.  The same tax would not apply at all to an alien in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the purpose of the legislation was to deter and since that purpose was not effected, a new method of deterring the purchase by aliens of agricultural land has now been provided.  Therefore, this £183,000 is not germane at all to the discussion in that under the new method it would not come in.  As I said, it was not for revenue purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Land Commission is going to give permission to these people to buy land, why do we not charge them tax at the same time?  If our land is, by international standards, cheap, what is the purpose of taking off this 25 per cent?  It <Col N="778" /> would be an additional deterrent.  Why depend on one when we can have two, one of which is already in force?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The 25 per cent cases were cases of purchases of land the Land Commission would have no means of stopping but where the Land Commission gave consent, even under the old system, the lower rate of duty would be applied.  I want to repeat that this is not revenue as such.  The purpose of the original legislation was a deterring one.  It is no longer necessary now because there is another deterrent and a more effective one in other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the Minister's statement that there is a more effective deterrent but it is a pity when we are raising taxes and taxing ourselves that we do not put a tax on non-nationals buying land because, whether they get permission from the Land Commission or not, it seems an ideal method of raising revenue and getting some benefit for the ordinary man-in-the-street from the fact that non-nationals are coming in and buying up the place.  It is a pity that this section has to go, no matter what point of view the Minister has.</P>

It is a pity that that is the Minister's attitude.  If it is <Col N="779" /> not bringing in revenue, what harm will it do to leave the provision there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with it.  This new Land Act simply requires a person to apply to the Land Commission for permission.  There is no prohibition whatsoever imposed on the Minister for Lands to prevent him giving permission.  Once permission is given, these people can now purchase the land without paying the share of stamp duty they have been required to pay since 1947.  If the Minister is in a generous mood, I submit that this generosity should be displayed towards Irish purchasers of their own home with lesser market value than £5,000. When that is done, then something could be said for giving relief of stamp duty on purchases of property but no merit can be shown in this particular proposal.  It does not relieve the Irish taxpayer.  It provides relief for people who are coming from their own country to purchase land here and not people in need of any form of financial relief such as is proposed in this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The repeal which we have been discussing is, as I understand it, on the top of page 62 in Part VIII of the Bill and I think the Schedule should not go through with that repeal in it.  The purpose of the Land Act is to decide whether the case can or cannot go through.  There is no reason why the decision could not be left in the hands of the Land Commissioners, who are an independent body of persons, as to whether it is a case which should go through without payment of the additional duty or whether it is a case that should go through only with payment of the additional duty.  The Minister could very easily use the duty.</P>

      <P>I think it is true to say also that if the duty were retained for the moment, it would be possible to assess the validity of the Minister's contention without doubt. The Minister said the retention of the duty serves now no useful purpose; therefore, why keep it?  The only evidence we have of that is the, I am sure, <i>bona fide</i> guess of the Minister. The hard facts are that, on the figures he gave, this duty has yielded over £187,000.  That can be cut down to nothing from this on or it may yield merely £100,000 or £50,000, but, whatever it does yield is certainly a matter that we should consider fully in the light of actual experience, not in the light of guided hopes or estimates which the Minister may put forward. Certainly, we would feel that the Schedule containing that repeal is not a Schedule which should pass and we will have to consider it at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I moved the adjournment last night but in actual fact the last words spoken were by Deputy Tully who said that I spread the money available to me in the wrong way. What can this mean except that it was wrong for me to give something extra to those whose need was greatest. When the debate was adjourned I was pointing out to Deputies exactly what their opposition to this extra provision for those with low incomes means.  I pointed out that a person over 70 who has means of £156 15s. 0d. per annum or a married man with means of £313 10s. 0d. per annum, or higher if he has children, gets an old age pension of 7/6d.  That means that there is a total income between pension and the person's own income of £176 5s. for the single man and £333 for the married man without dependants.  Of course if the married man's wife is also over 70, the total means would be £352 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us compare that with the position of the people who will get the maximum rate of pension under this <Col N="784" /> Bill.  A single man with means of £26 5s. per annum or a married man with means of £52 10s. per annum will get the maximum rate of old age pension of 47/6, that is a total income of £149 15s. for the single man and £176 per annum for the married man without dependent children.  Here again, if the wife is over 70 she will qualify for the maximum rate of old age pension, in which case the total means would be £299 10s.</P>
    <P>Since the amount of money that is available to me is fixed by the yield of the new taxes which the Minister for Finance imposed this year in the Budget, what I am being asked to do by the Opposition is to reduce the income of the man whose own means are only £26 5s. per annum or less by 2/6 per week in order that the means of people who are better off should be increased by 2/6d. a week.  In other words, I am being asked in the case of single people to reduce the income of £149 15s. to £143 5s. in order that the income of £176 5s. can be raised to £182 15s.  In the case of married people without dependent children I am being asked to reduce the income from £176 to £169 10s. so that the income of £333 can be increased to £339 10s.  That is what the Opposition are asking me to do since, as I say, the amount of money available to me is fixed, and I am not prepared to do that.</P>

What the Deputy is asking me to do would cost £650,000 which I have not got, and Deputy Tully knows that very well.  He wants me to reduce the married person's income of £176 to £169 10s. so that the income of £333 may be increased to £339 10s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am being asked to do by Deputy Tully and I am not prepared to do that.  It should be noted that the position, even as it stands under this Bill, is that the majority of pensioners getting anything less than the maximum rate of 47/6 and all those who get less than 42/6 are better off than any of those who will get the new maximum. Deputy Tully and the other Opposition speakers who have criticised this want me to aggravate that position, to make the people who will get the new maximum worse off still by comparison with those who will get the 5/-increase.</P>
      <P>My aim is eventually to equalise the position of all pensioners in so far as it is possible to do so and I make no apology for that.  This is not a case of giving the 10/- increase and then deciding to cut it down to 5/-in certain cases.  It is the opposite procedure.  This is a case of a 5/- all round increase in social assistance payments and an extra 5/- for those whose need is greatest.  The 5/- general increase on the social assistance side which we are providing in this Bill is double anything that was done before and is in fact double what was done for one section of social assistance recipients only by either of the two Coalition Governments in their full period of office.  That is what we have done in this one year.  We have given twice as much as was ever given before and we are giving it to all the recipients of social assistance.  In addition to that, we have given twice as much again to those people who are in the greatest need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be obvious to Deputies on every side of the House, including Deputy Tully, that so far from the introduction of this new means category being reprehensible, to be really equitable the idea should be further developed, according as more money becomes available, by introducing further categories for those whose incomes are between £26 and £39 a year&mdash;there is an obvious gap there and one that should be filled &mdash;for those whose means are below £13 and for those who have no means. The disparity which I have shown is between the incomes of those with the lower rates of pension and those with the maximum, in fact, in most cases, much more pronounced.</P>
      <P>A large number of those with means also have the right of free maintenance and free lodging from relatives.  This is assessed at the nominal value of 1/-a week.  It is inconsistent that Deputies should urge that something should be done for persons with no means at all and who are living alone and that at the same time they should object to the fact that extra provision is being made for those whose need is greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> A terrifying picture has been presented of wholesale reinvestigation of the means of existing old age pensioners. There will be no reinvestigation of their means.  The information on which to decide whether a person is entitled to an increase of 10/- a week or 5/- a week is available in the Department.  I always thought that previous attacks by members of the Labour Party on the idea of a means test were merely thoughtless repetition of criticisms they had heard from people who never thoroughly examined the position.  Now the Party have officially come out in favour of the abolition of the means test, that is, in favour of giving to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; at the expense of the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.  I reject the idea, both in principle and from the point of view of practicability, that there should be no means test in connection with these services.  To abolish the means test would be a gross inequity to those most in need.  If I had sufficient money available, I would not use it in that way.  I do, however, think it desirable that it should be possible for every citizen to qualify for an old age pension of some sort and I am investigating the possibility of making a voluntary contribution scheme available to all.</P>
    <P>While the Opposition are against the means test where it applies at present, they apparently want to apply it to the only non-insurance service where it does not apply at present, to children's allowances.  I am in complete disagreement with this idea.  The provision of children's allowances without a means test is completely justifiable.  Deputy Costello referred to the fact that there may be different standards of living among people in the same employment and with the same emoluments because one may have substantial family commitments and the other may be single or have no children.</P>
    <P>The purpose of children's allowances without a means test is to help to adjust that position.  This scheme performs a different function from the other social services which are designed to provide an income for a <Col N="788" /> person when the normal income ceases or is reduced because a man has lost his employment, because he has become ill and is unable to work or because of old age or the loss of the breadwinner.  Children's allowances are designed for a different purpose. They are designed to reduce the disparity in the standard of living to which Deputy Costello refers between the man with a family to support and the man with a similar income and no dependent children.  The children's allowance scheme is complementary to the provision of tax free allowances under the income tax code.  It is a more simple and more sensible thing to do to pay children's allowances without a means test rather than to apply an expensively administered means test and increase tax free allowances for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The question of the proposed extension of the social insurance scheme to embrace workmen's compensation was mentioned.  I do not think the delay in doing this has been all that excessive. The Commission took over six years to report.  It was set up in December 1955 and reported in February 1962.  That indicates that it was a complex problem.  When the report was received, it had to be printed and circulated to all Government Departments. Their views had to be obtained. That, again, took some considerable time.  From my own perusal of the document, I formed a personal opinion that a State scheme should be introduced but I waited for the views of other Departments and, of course, of my own Department.</P>
    <P>I then took a decision to recommend to the Government that the majority report should be rejected and that we should have a State scheme instead.  That was not a decision to be lightly taken.  I had to be fully satisfied that I could stand over the recommendation and that I would be able to justify it to the Government.  Deputies know that there was a certain procedure to be followed before I received a decision in principle from the Government. Then the whole scheme of a Bill had to be prepared and submitted to the Government.  The drafting <Col N="789" /> of the Bill is now in process.  I intend to introduce the Bill this session and circulate it during the Recess.</P>
    <P>A number of interesting suggestions were made but I do not think any of them were completely new.  Many have been very much in my mind for some time and there are some I intend to put into operation at a suitable opportunity.  There are others on which I have not yet completely made up my mind.  The position is that implementation must await a further improvement of the capacity of the community to pay.  One suggestion was that contributions and benefits should be linked to earnings.  I am attracted to that idea.  The question is whether or not we have reached the stage at which we can start to do that yet.  It is hardly likely that a fully wage related scheme could be introduced all together.  It seems more likely that any progress made will be gradual. Possibly a two-tiered scheme will be introduced first which will be developed into a multi-tiered scheme until we eventually arrive at a more or less complete wage-related scheme.</P>
    <P>The present rate of unemployment benefit for a man, his wife and two children of £5 18s. 6d. represents 77.6 per cent of an £8 per week wage, allowing for the deduction of the contribution in respect of the stamp.  For the lower rates of wages, therefore, the decrease in the standard of living and the burden of meeting the misfortune of unemployment or illness is not so severe.  In the case of the higher rates of wages it is comparatively severe, except in the case of people with large families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any statistics of the number of insurable persons on £8 a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, but I imagine it would be possible to get that information from the Central Statistics Office.  Deputy D. Costello referred to the disastrous decline in living standards for people on unemployment and sickness benefit, but the fact is that the system of payment of allowances for adult and child dependants lessens the severity of that <Col N="790" /> disaster considerably in the case of people with large families.  In fact, for the lower rates of wages, people with not very large families find themselves better off financially when in receipt of social welfare benefits than when they are actually working.</P>
      <P>The question of people in domestic employment not being eligible for unemployment benefit was raised.  I have come across cases of hardship. I do not know that the problem is such, however, that it would be justifiable to remedy it by requiring these people to pay the full rate of contribution in order to make them eligible for all the benefits.  The cases I have come across were mainly cases of people who had been in the same employment for a considerable number of years and that employment ceased for some reason or other at a time when the persons concerned found it difficult to adjust to the needs of different employment.  As far as I can gather, these cases are few and far between and I do not know that we would be justified in requiring these people to pay the full employment contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the type of person I am thinking of and I am wondering if a special rate of contribution, with maybe more rigorous contribution conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit, would be suitable or whether a reduced rate of contribution with an age limit would be the solution.  I do not think the problem is such that it would be desirable to make these workers pay the full rate of contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking into it and have been for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three-day waiting period for the receipt of unemployment and disability benefit was raised.  I do not think there <Col N="791" /> is a good case for the payment of these benefits from the first day but obviously when an illness or unemployment period is of fairly long duration, there is a certain amount of hardship in not being paid for the first three days.  To introduce an amendment to cover long periods of unemployment or illness would be very expensive.  I do not preclude the possibility, however, of its being done some time in the future, but it cannot be done this year.</P>
    <P>There were some criticisms of the proposed amendment of the Unemployment Assistance Acts in relation to smallholders.  The most surprising feature in all this is the estimated cost of the amendment.  From information available, this is likely to cost over £1 million this year.  I find that very surprising, but that is the position. Further extensions, such as applying it to the whole country or abolishing the employment period orders, just could not be considered in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any figures of what it would cost to give it to the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  To abolish the first employment period order for the congested districts as proposed in the Bill is estimated to cost £400,000 extra per annum.  To abolish the second employment period order is estimated to cost an additional £100,000 per annum.  I have not got the exact figure of what it would cost to extend the present proposed scheme to the whole country but I think it would be in the nature of £250,000.  Then, of course, if the employment period orders were to be abolished also for the whole country the amounts would also be greater.  In any event I think there is a good case for doing this for the congested areas and not doing it for the rest of the country.  After all, it is in these areas that the small farms predominate and while you have small uneconomic farms in the rest of the country, in general the position is that side by side with the small farms you have larger farmers who have labour <Col N="792" /> problems.  That does not apply in the congested districts.  The theoretical justification for the employment period orders is that in the case of all farms over £4 valuation, it is assumed that the smallholder could be more or less fully engaged for this period of the year on his own holding, and the justification for the second employment period order is that agricultural employment is assumed to be fairly freely available during that period. However, I must say that I am not fully convinced of the validity of those arguments.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy P. O'Donnell's allegations that the enactment of these amendments to the Unemployment Assistance Acts was to be accompanied, and had in fact been accompanied, by a wholesale re-examination of the means of existing recipients of unemployment assistance, I may say that that is completely at variance with the facts. The Deputy should know that, if he has any contact with his constituency. There was a definite instruction that there was to be no re-assessment of the means of existing recipients and I am satisfied there has not been any.</P>
      <P>Another suggestion was made that there was no reason why, when there are increases in contribution rates, these should be levied to the same extent on employer and employee.  I am not completely averse to that idea. As a matter of fact, the first time it was suggested to me was when it was suggested by a substantial employer who felt that employers generally would not be very averse to it.  At the same time, it would not be a good idea that employees should not have to bear portion of the cost.  It would be wrong to create the impression that these benefits could be got without any expense.</P>

I do not encourage the writing of these but it is a fact that social welfare officers are in duty bound to ensure that public money is not obtained fraudulently and are bound to investigate any information that comes their way to the effect that public money is being obtained fraudulently.  While I deprecate the practice of neighbours writing anonymous letters.  I have certainly no intention of instructing social welfare officers to ignore them. I would agree that payment should not be stopped until the allegation is investigated and found to be true.</P>

      <P>With regard to overlapping benefits, Deputy Tully raised the point of widows who are in receipt of widows' contributory pensions not being eligible for the full rate of disability or unemployment benefit.  That is a feature of all social insurance schemes and it is not correct for Deputy Tully to say that the widow's contributory pension has been paid for by the husband while he was alive.  It is a fact that she qualifies on the basis of his contributions but the pension is provided by the whole body of subscribers to the whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not.  They are provided by the whole body of employers and employees who will never benefit in any way from them, by single people and people who will never leave widows, and also by the Exchequer.  It is a feature of all social insurance schemes which I think is defensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully made what I can only describe in the absence of evidence, as a completely unwarranted and irresponsible attack on the whole body of social welfare officers employed by my Department to administer the laws passed by this House.  I want to say categorically that I do not believe that <Col N="794" /> social welfare officers in general act in the way Deputy Tully alleges.  Perhaps there may be isolated cases and if evidence of this is produced to me, I will have such evidence investigated. To say that the whole body of social welfare officers act in the way Deputy Tully described is completely irresponsible. Our people as a whole are very sympathetic to the claims of old people and people who meet various other misfortunes and I am not prepared to accept that the social welfare officers are a race apart who think and behave differently from the rest of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that social welfare officers are a conscientious group of public officials, doing the work they are paid to do on behalf of the community to the best of their ability.  I have done everything I could to ensure that social welfare officers are in no doubt as to their functions and that they appreciate that it is an equally important part of their function to ensure that people get the benefits to which they are entitled as it is to ensure that people do not get benefits to which they are not entitled. I would like to be sure that every social welfare officer would regard it as a major dereliction of duty on his part and a serious load on his conscience if, through any fault of his, a person applying for social welfare benefit were deprived of as much as one shilling of what the law intended him to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that they should approach each case from the point of view that the claimant is in all probability suffering some hardship and the job of the social welfare officer is to find out whether the Oireachtas <Col N="795" /> has provided relief for such cases.  For instance, when a person of 70 years of age, or a widow, claims a pension, the approach, in my opinion, should be that by reaching the age of 70, or through the loss of a husband, the person concerned has established a <i>prima facie</i> case for the pension and that the job of the social welfare officer is to find out, in a completely objective and impartial manner, whether the other conditions laid down by law are satisfied.  The approach should not be that this is a battle of wits between the custodian of the public purse on the one side, and somebody trying to get something he or she is not entitled to, but a case of two people, one of whom is an expert and the other not, trying to establish something that is not always readily apparent, that is, whether benefit is payable in the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I have been at pains to make it clear that I will insist on tact and politeness in dealing with claims and that I will not tolerate an aggressive attitude.  I pointed out to social welfare officers that questions which may be purely routine to the officer who has to ask them every day may be anything but routine to a person who is claiming social assistance for the first time; that each case should be treated as a separate case; that each person should be treated as an individual and that the approach in investigating cases should be varied to suit the temperament of the claimant.  Above all, it must be clear that the benefits available to the people who qualify for them are available to them as of right established by the laws of this House and that there is no question of claimants coming as suppliants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been these occasional vague references to an intimidating attitude being adopted to applicants, no evidence has been produced to me that, in fact, this is happening.  In the absence of such evidence, I think I am entitled to characterise these outbursts as irresponsible attacks on a body of hardworking officials administering the laws <Col N="796" /> enacted here.  These unjustified attacks are all the more regrettable because social welfare officers are so readily identifiable in the areas in which they operate and in which they usually live also.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the withholding by the British authorities of increases granted to their pensioners if they are residing in this State, as I have explained on a number of occasions, that is a feature which applies not only to this country but to many other countries including countries in the British Commonwealth.  I have been negotiating for some time past to have this changed here, to have a reciprocal agreement which will embody the payment of these increases to British pensioners residing in this country.  There is, I think, a very good case indeed for it.  Deputies should realise that it takes two to make a reciprocal arrangement and I cannot make it of my own accord.  They should also appreciate that there has been a change of Government in Britain not long ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I said, this Bill marks a significant step forward and in my opinion it is a major step to take in the redistribution of income in any one year.  Deputies may be assured that, so far from this being the end of the development of social welfare under the present Fianna Fáil Government, I hope that, by the time the next General Election comes along, we shall have gone a long way to reach the goal of a satisfactory social welfare code.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Elections Bill, 1965: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to postpone until 1966 the local elections which, under existing legislation, are due to be held this year and to extend the term of office of existing members of local authorities.  I think it will be generally agreed that it is inconvenient, and in some respects undesirable, that a general election to Dáil Éireann and elections of members of local authorities should be held within the same calendar year.  In particular, the substantial proportion of the members of the House who are also members of local authorities would hardly welcome such a double campaign.</P>
      <P>We had general elections to the Dáil in 1932 and 1933 and in these years some county borough councils were elected.  Apart from this, however, local elections have never been held in a year in which a general election took place.  Indeed, on quite a number of previous occasions local elections were postponed because general elections were held in the years fixed by statute for local elections.  This happened in 1932, 1933, 1937, 1938 and 1948.</P>
      <P>The law relating to local elections originally provided that they should be held at intervals of three years.  Over the past 43 years ten Acts have been passed by the Oireachtas postponing local elections and during that period only eight such elections have been held.  The average interval between has, therefore, been slightly more than five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Elections Act, 1953, <Col N="799" /> formally altered the statutory period between elections from three years to five years.  Local elections took place in 1945, 1950, 1955 and 1960.  The Bill provides for the re-establishment of this pattern after the postponement now proposed and section I stipulates that local elections shall be held in 1970 and quinquennially thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also have the effect of postponing until 1966 the elections of members for certain bodies appointed wholly or in part by local authorities and for re-establishing the quinquennial pattern of these elections as and from 1970.  These bodies include health authorities, committees of agriculture, vocational education committees, harbour authorities, drainage committees, etc.</P>
    <P>Since the Local Elections Act, 1927, local authorities have been accustomed to hold their annual or quarterly meetings in a non-election year during the period between 23rd June and 1st July.  At these meetings they elect the lord mayor, mayor, chairman and vice-chairman and nominate members to serve for the ensuing year on certain committees and other public bodies.  Local authorities were notified last month of my intention to submit this Bill to the Oireachtas for consideration and they were advised in the circumstances to make arrangements to hold their annual or quarterly meetings this year within the normal period.  Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill propose to validate the action of the authorities in connection with the meetings.</P>
    <P>The 1927 Act also laid down that local elections should be held within the period from 23rd June to 1st July. This was changed by the Electoral Act, 1963, which enables the Minister for Local Government to fix any day within an election year to be polling day at local elections.  A corresponding degree of flexibility is being applied by sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this Bill to the election and term of office of certain bodies on which local authorities have a stututory right of representation. The bodies in question are vocational education and school <Col N="800" /> attendance committees, the Lough Corrib Navigation Trustees and harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>I submit the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are in general agreement with the proposals in the Bill.  At the same time, it is no harm to say that I believe this postponement is meeting with anything but universal acceptance throughout the country.  Many people are seriously concerned about the way rates have rocketed during the past four or five years.  They are concerned, too, that there is such a backlog in house building and while the rates contain a large element of the expense of the health services, the health services have not in any way been improved.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I think it is quite a sensible thing to postpone the elections for another year even if many people are anxious to have an opportunity to express their dissatisfaction with the way local government matters have gone during the past few years.  Members of the House who are also members of local authorities have had their fill of elections for one year.  Active supporters, I think, also have had enough.  I have come across one public representative who takes quite a poor view of the decision to postpone the elections.  Surprisingly, he is a man who has gone through general elections as an unsuccessful candidate. He feels it has always been recognised that members of local authorities were elected for fixed periods and that after such periods, the people who elected them should have an opportunity of passing judgment on them, of deciding whether or not they were doing their jobs.  He feels it is something the Government and the Members of the Dáil should not be allowed to alter just at will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with this view in the circumstances in which we find ourselves&mdash;Deputies have fought no fewer than six by-elections and a general election.  It is always well, where possible, to avoid the disruption and expense of two elections in the same <Col N="801" /> year.  I hope that, if and when the local elections are being held next year, they will be held in conjunction with the Presidential election so that we shall not have two elections in the one year.  It would be desirable to have the local elections held in the same month of the year for which they are arranged.  I do not like flexibility which allows local elections to be held at any time during the year.  People are entitled to know, and their knowing will not injure anybody, that elections, as an established practice, will be held in a certain month, be it May, June or any other month.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that provision is made to revert to quinquennial elections. Members of school attendance committees in future will be elected for five-year periods instead of three.  I am surprised this has not always been so.  Have I read the Bill properly when I say that the present school attendance committees will automatically remain in office until after the local elections next year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sensible, as are the general provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to find that a simple Bill of this description, just postponing the local elections for a year, could not be drafted without reference to no fewer than six Acts of Parliament.  I took a quick look at the Bill when I got it and found that to read it properly, I should have to refer to five Acts.  When I got home and had another look at it, I found I was one short.  Then, when I came to make a critical examination of the Bill, I found this passage in section 5:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power may&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  with respect to subsection (8) of section 7, subsection (10) of section 10, subsections (1) and (2) of section 14, subsections (1) and (2) of section 20, subsection (3) of section 31, subsection (1) of section 32 and subsection (1) of section 33 and section 27 of the Harbours Act, 1946&mdash;by regulations substitute a different day for the second Thursday <Col N="802" /> in the month of October referred to in those subsections and that section.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible to overcome that sort of thing when drafting legislation? It baffles anybody who has not got a legal training.  One must wade to the bottom of the section to find that it deals with something quite simple.  When making simple amendments of this kind, we should not make it necessary to refer back to so many sections and subsections of previous statutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the postponement of the elections. However, perhaps it is rather a pity the Minister did not hold the local elections this year because those of us engaged in politics find that once we have the election machine geared to a certain speed, it is easier to keep it at that speed than to try to restart it after 12 months.  The Minister's experience may not be the same as mine.  If it had been, he would have decided to hold the elections this year.  As Deputy Clinton said, people are sick and tired of elections and will welcome this change.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Deputy Clinton that the elections being held next year should coincide with the Presidential election.  I further agree that an effort should be made to have local elections held at a fixed date each year, not at a busy time of year.  If avoidable, such elections should not be held during the holiday period or during the harvest or sowing periods, when people find it awkward to go out to vote. Perhaps one of these days we shall decide to hold these elections on Sunday when more people may be able to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seriously attempt to have local elections held on a fixed date in the year they are due to take place.  This may not make any difference to the exalted position of the harbour commissioners to whom Deputy Clinton referred when quoting section 5.  I do not think we should be so scrupulous in referring to so many Acts and so many sections and subsections of Acts for the purpose <Col N="803" /> of ensuring that these people are appointed in a proper way.  There is procedure for appointing them in a far more democratic way.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have no objection to the postponement.  When the elections are finally fixed, I hope we shall be informed in good time.  I suggest that at the earliest possible time the Minister should set the date for the local elections so that all will know and be enabled to make preparations. We should all endeavour through local elections to get the best possible material and we can do that only if we are given plenty of notice.</P>
    <P>I expect that this will not be a very contentious Bill and that it will not hold up the House for as long as the Finance Bill or the Succession Bill did, but it is an important Bill because local elections are important matters. We cannot expect the ordinary people to think local elections are important if we treat them lightly and simply say as short a time as possible before an election that the election will take place or seem to push the date of elections around to suit the whims of certain individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very wise in postponing the elections because it will give us a little more time to get our message across to the people and to try to arouse them from the apathy which besets them at local election time.</P>
      <P>In my area, where there are about 40,000 voters, in the last election there was a 20 per cent poll.  The area I represent is as well organised as any in the country.  How we can excite the people's enthusiasm, I do not know. A member of a local authority who does his job is the salt of political life. I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;perhaps I am out of order&mdash;that this is a very good opportunity to try out the single seat constituency.  If it were done in local elections, the member elected for a much smaller area would be able to get to know all the people in the area and give them really good service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is very short, so there is <Col N="804" /> not much one can criticise or praise in it but I do think that the order should go forth from this House that any mistakes or omissions in the last register of electors should be corrected before the elections take place. We have to show the people that we are quite serious about the matter and that we do want them to vote, to return to the local council good representatives and to make them realise that if they take an interest in the work of councillors and aldermen they can do a tremendous amount of good for their own areas and the country generally.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I would ask the Minister to consider, that is, that a candidate in local elections should be given free postage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that does not arise on this Bill. The question of free postage cannot be discussed on a Bill to postpone local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I agree with the Minister and I hope the public will use the next election to return good candidates and that the electorate will come out and show by the act of voting that they appreciate the unpaid work which their representatives do.</P>

      <P>Contrary to what the two first speakers seem to think, I would be all for the local elections having been held if that had been possible and they would be over and done with now for the next five years. However, as the House is probably aware, the advent of the Cork Borough Boundary Confirmation Order Bill that was before the House became somewhat involved and it was not possible to have the elections without leaving Cork as it was and then trying to rectify the situation by bringing in special legislation to enable a special election to be held for the ensuing four years, which would have been even more onerous.</P>

      <P>In so far as section 5 <Col N="805" /> is concerned, if I had any ways and means of putting this in a form that would appear intelligible to the ordinary layman, that is the way he would have got it, but I can only take the assurance that I am given that, due to the complications of the Harbours Act, it is necessary to have this jumble of words which, I am assured, gives us the power to do the things that we intended to do through these nominations to the harbour boards.  I am sorry that is the way it has to appear but there is nothing that I could do about it.</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage there was certain discussion on this section and I made the point that the section would only operate in the case of an advancement subsequent to the making of the will.  Deputy O'Higgins, in particular, argued that this was not plain on the reading of the section.  That is why this amendment is proposed.  It emphasises that any advancement prior to the making of the will involves a question of satisfaction which is a different rule of law from that governing advancement made after the making of the will.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment probably does meet the point of view which I and others expressed on Committee Stage.  I still feel that it would have been met more adequately and would have made the position crystal-clear if the Minister had decided to adopt an amendment in roughly the terms that were suggested by me on Committee Stage, if he had added another subsection to this section stating clearly that in the case of the estate of a person who made a will, this section would not apply to any provision or advancement made prior to the date of the will, unless it was so directed by the testator in his will.  That suggested amendment did contain the net point here and made the position crystal-clear. The Minister's amendment probably does meet the point.  I will accept it as meeting the point anyway.</P>

      <P>I raised this point on Committee Stage and the Minister has met it very fully.  It shows the value of occasionally reviewing these Acts that are more than 100 years old.  The practice had grown up &mdash;and I am sure it was in the minds of the farmers of the 1837 Act&mdash;that a person who is a witness should attest by his signature.  That was invariably done, but, as the Minister recognises by this amendment, it was not spelled out in the 1837 Act that that should be done and difficulties might have arisen or even the necessity for the tendering of oral evidence as to a person witnessing a will.  The Minister has met the point very fully.</P>

    <P>I know that many solicitors in the drafting of wills require both witnesses to be present.

      <P>I agree with the Minister's reading of the position but I am a little sorry that he has decided to put this into the Bill because I do not think we should discourage the practice of the two witnesses each signing in the presence of the testator and of each other.  It is a very desirable practice.  It is an added safeguard against either fraud or mistakes in will-making.  I agree with the Minister that at the moment, without this Bill ever being introduced, the strict legal position is that it is not necessary for the two witnesses each to sign in the presence of the other. It is necessary for each of them to sign in the presence of the testator.  With solicitors who are charged with this responsibility of seeing that wills are properly executed, it is practically an invariable rule to insist on both witnesses remaining until the entire transaction has been completed: the testator signs, the first witness signs and the second witness signs.  I hope that practice will continue and that by putting in this amendment we are not going to discourage it.  It is a practice that should be continued and it is a safeguard to have it continued. However, I am not objecting to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of my amendments Nos. 19 and 20 is for clarification of what sections 113 and 114 mean.  We had a certain amount of confusion during the Committee Stage debate as to what precisely was meant and it is now quite clear from the proposed new wording of the sections that the beneficiary may take the additional bequest or elect for the legal right share.  If the testator wishes to give a bequest in addition to the legal right, the latter will be an added bequest. Deputy O'Higgins disagrees with me in this.  I considered this point very fully but I do not think it desirable that what he suggests should be the case.  I think his suggestion would be too much in favour of the beneficiary.  We propose to say to the beneficiary: &ldquo;You may take the bequest or you may take the legal right&rdquo;.  The bequest is to be taken in discharge of the legal right, unless otherwise directed.  I think that is reasonably clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I never had any doubt as to what was the meaning of the original section.  It is because of what is in the section as it stands in the Bill after Committee Stage discussion that I was arguing this point with the Minister.  I understood from the Minister's remark and from his discussion with me that he proposed meeting me on this point.  The position under the Bill and under the Minister's amendment is that the presumption is going to be against the spouse beneficiary. This section deals only with spouses and, for practical purposes, we have all agreed that it deals with the position of the widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Minister's amendment and under the Bill as it stands, the position is that if a man leaves a bequest to his widow, unless he expresses that it is in addition to her legal share, she will be put on election. <Col N="814" /> I feel that is all wrong.  If the fixed legal rights share system is being adopted, and it is being adopted, I think wrongly, the position is this: if a man makes a will knowing that his wife is entitled to a fixed legal right share and if he makes his will disposing of the disposable part of his property and decides to make a bequest to his wife in the knowledge of her legal rights share, the presumption should be that it is his intention that she should get that bequest, in addition to the fixed legal right share. Now presumption is against the widow and unless he expresses in the will that she is to get both, she will not get both.</P>
    <P>I look at it from two different points of view.  The first is the point of view of the testator who is drawing his own will without the assistance of a solicitor or other professional advice. It is most unlikely that he will be familiar with all the details of this legislation which runs into some 130 sections. It is most unlikely that he will be aware that, if he wants his wife to get a bequest in addition to her one-third legal right share, he must expressly state that in his will.  The odds are that he will make a simple will leaving a bequest to his widow.</P>
    <P>What is the position then?  We are going to legislate, at the Minister's behest in this House, to defeat that man's intention notwithstanding the fact that only a few minutes ago the Minister introduced an amendment&mdash; agreeing with me, incidentally, that the testator's intention should be paramount&mdash;to make it clear that the court would be entitled to hear extrinsic evidence in order to ascertain the testator's intention.  He comes along now and says: &ldquo;But that is not going to apply in the case of a bequest to the widow.  Unless he expressly states in the will that it is to be in addition to the legal right share, she will not get the bequest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Evidence of the testator's intention is not going to matter because, under this section and under the Minister's amendment, the testator must expressly state in his will that the bequest is to <Col N="815" /> be in addition to the one-third legal right share.  I am talking now about the man who draws his will, as he is perfectly entitled to, without the assistance of professional advice.  He will draw that will without being familiar with every one of the 129 or 130 sections in this Bill.  He will draw it without being familiar with the contents of section 113.  It is perfectly logical to assume, I think, that such a man, if he makes a bequest to his widow, intends her to get that bequest. In effect, we are saying now that she will not get it, whatever the testator's intentions were, unless he expressly states in the will that it is to be in addition to the one-third legal right share.  That is the first case.</P>
    <P>The second case is the case of the ordinary solicitor charged with the task of drawing up a will.  I agree that it is the business of a solicitor to be familiar with the law in relation to wills, but very often solicitors are very busy men.  Very often they have to draw wills in a hurry, without access to their book of statutes or any other law book.  Very often they have to draw wills at the side of the sick bed of a person in hospital, who has not very long to live.  It is quite on the cards, in my opinion, that in those circumstances the ordinary solicitor will not carry in his head all the details of section 113 of the Succession Act, 1965, and when he is instructed by the testator to leave a bequest to the wife, he may very well draw up a simple will leaving that bequest and overlooking the fact that, under this legislation, she will not get that bequest unless he takes the precaution of setting out in the will the exact position.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that it must be done in the will.  Evidence of the testator's intention does not matter in this regard.  Unless he sets out in the will that she is to get the bequest in addition to her one-third legal right share, she will not get that.  I do not believe the Minister's section will be weakened in the slightest degree by putting the presumption the other way about in favour of the widow or the spouse.  It is perfectly reasonable, I think, to make <Col N="816" /> the case&mdash;it is the case that would appeal to any reasonable man&mdash;that if persons make bequests, they do so because they intend the beneficiaries to take the bequests.  Consequently, the reasonable way of doing this is to provide that the bequest will be operative&mdash;that the widow will take unless the testator expressly states the contrary in his will.</P>
    <P>My amendment, which we are discussing with the Minister's amendment, is a simple one.  It is just as clear with regard to intent as the Minister's is in the reverse direction. I propose that, instead of section 113 as drafted, we should put in a section reading:</P>
    <P>(1)  A devise or bequest to a spouse shall be deemed to be in addition to the share of the spouse as of legal right unless the contrary intention is expressed in the will of the testator; and</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a contrary intention is so expressed such devise or bequest shall be deemed to have been made in satisfaction in whole or in part of the legal right of the spouse.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I make no particular boast about it, but I am quite sure that any person with practical experience in will-making will support the case I make, and if the Minister took the trouble to discuss this with anyone who has practical experience in the matter, he would find that I am right and he is wrong.  If he does not believe me, I suggest he should suspend his judgment until he discusses the matter with people who have practical experience.</P>

      <P>Actually I considered this very closely, as I agreed to do on Committee Stage.  I have had discussions with people who have practical experience and, as a result of those discussions, I am satisfied that the presumption should be as stated in the section as amended.  We are now giving a one-third legal right share to the surviving spouse.  This is a new provision of considerable benefit to surviving spouses.  Deputy O'Higgins has opposed this at all stages so far. <Col N="817" /> He is now seeking to do much more than I am doing by writing in as a presumption that, where a testator gives a bequest, the widow shall have along with that bequest, the legal right share.  On top of the one-third, she will get the bequest as well. Deputy O'Higgins cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>If the testator wants the widow to have a bequest, let him express that in his will.  I will cite a practical example.  Take an estate valued at £18,000.  A man makes provision of £10,000 out of that estate for his widow.  He distributes the other £8,000 elsewhere.  If we accept Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, then, in addition to the bequest of £10,000, the widow could claim another one-third, giving her an additional £6,000.  He had done enough for his widow by giving her more than half, £10,000, by way of bequest out of the £18,000.  If we were to accept Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, we would be making it incumbent on the testator's representatives to hand out one-third of the £18,000 on top of the £10,000 which the testator had already given.  That is precisely what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider that that was doing too well for the surviving spouse.  From the practical point of view, I can see the Deputy's suggested presumption leading to the situation where, contrary to the testator's intention, we would be doing too well for the surviving spouse who had already been adequately catered for.  It is a more rational position to have it as I suggest, that the testator may make a bequest but that the surviving spouse has the option of the legal right to one-third.  If the surviving spouse is not happy with the will, he or she may elect for the legal <Col N="818" /> right share of one-third.  Surely it is not the intention of the Legislature to say in such a situation that on top of the bequest which fully looks after the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse will have one-third of the total estate as well.</P>
      <P>I looked into this fairly closely and, although at first I was inclined to agree with Deputy O'Higgins, when I examined the matter fully I decided it was better as we have it in the Bill. The Bill says that the surviving spouse gets one-third if he or she does not like the bequest.  If the testator wants to make a bequest on top of the one-third, that must be said in the will.</P>

      <P>This situation arises because of the cockeyed idea of incorporating the one-third fixed legal right share for the widow.  That is what has made the whole thing into a bit of a mess.  However, the Minister is not going to be convinced by my arguments and I am not going to waste time, but I should like to ask the Minister for some clarification as to what his amendment means.  It seems to me that on one interpretation of it, it is just nonsense.  I think I know what the Minister means but look at what it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a devise or bequest to a spouse is expressed in a will to be in addition to the share of the spouse as a legal right, the testator shall be deemed to have made by the will an additional bequest to the spouse of a sum equal to the value of that share.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has chosen one particular case to argue; let me take under his amendment this case where the testator leaves his widow a bequest of 1/-.  What does that mean in relation to where a devise or bequest is expressed in the will to be in addition to the legal share of the spouse?  The 1/-is expressed to be in addition to <Col N="819" /> the legal right share and then the testator shall be deemed to have made by his will an additional bequest to the spouse of a sum equal to the value of that share.  In other words, by reason of the miraculous words contained in this amendment, the shilling is to be deemed to be equal in value to one-third of the estate.  It seems to me that instead of making the position clear, and I thought it was crystal-clear as the Bill stood, the Minister has succeeded in making it&mdash;I was going to use the expression muddy, but that would not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 should be read together.  Again they clarify precisely what is now meant by section 115 which caused a certain amount <Col N="820" /> of discussion on Committee Stage. The purpose of section 115, is that where up to now the testator during his life has made permanent provision for his spouse, under contract or otherwise, then, apart from periodic payments, such provision shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of the legal right share which would accrue to the spouse on the death of the testator.  Objection was taken to the last three lines in section 115 (i), particularly by Deputy J. A. Costello and Deputy M. J. O'Higgins.  I agree that those three lines should be deleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now about to pass a Bill which will make a very substantial alteration in the laws of succession in this country.  We are asked to take away the free right of disposition which Irish will-makers have had for more than 200 years.  It is the first time an Irish Government, since this State was established, have made such an attack on rights which have existed for more than two centuries.</P>
      <P>As I have said during the progress of the Bill through the House, that attack might be justified but only, in my view, if the Government hold the belief that the majority of Irish will-makers make wills which are unfair and unjust.  I do not think there is any other way in which this attack on their freedom of disposition can be justified.  It is because I do not subscribe to the belief that the majority of Irish will-makers are unfair and unjust in their testamentary dispositions that I and my Party have opposed the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our belief is that the vast majority of Irish will-makers have a Christian sense of responsibility in deciding to <Col N="823" /> make the best provision they can for their families and dependants when they make their wills.  It is our belief that the vast majority of Irish will-makers go to some trouble and take a great deal of care to ensure that the provisions of their wills are proper and fair.  We believe it is not right that the majority of Irish will-makers should have their rights and their wills attacked in this manner in order to solve a problem that exists with regard to a small minority&mdash;I believe it is a very small minority&mdash;of will-makers. I have stated from the start of these discussions, and indeed long before the Bill came before the House, that there was a problem that required to be dealt with, the problem of the inofficious will.  That problem was spot-lighted in this House by a motion which I tabled on behalf of the Fine Gael Party seeking legislation which would protect widows and dependent children from being unfairly and unjustly disinherited.  What the Minister has done in this Bill, and what his predecessor sought to do in a very much more drastic Bill, went a long way beyond seeking to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I would have agreed, and I do agree, that it was the duty of the Government to tackle that problem but the way to tackle it was to deal with it directly as could have been done instead of interfering with the generality of wills for the sake of remedying the ills that existed in relation to a few.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I hoped that a comprehensive scheme which would have remedied the ills of the few without interfering with everybody else would be introduced.  The Minister has chosen to travel along another road.  I am sorry he has done so.  I am sorry he should have been associated in his first major undertaking in the House with a Bill which I think is unfair to Irish will-makers, with a Bill which, when it becomes law, will cause a lot of difficulty and trouble, with a Bill which, because of its provisions, will work out most unfairly for those whom the Minister honestly believes he is assisting by this legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that under <Col N="824" /> the provisions of this Bill if a man leaves a one-third share to his wife, she cannot ever get any more and she is debarred from making any application to the courts.  She must be content with the one-third share, even if that might be most inadequate and unfair and a great injustice.  The Bill will stumble on that rock straight away.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed, when introducing the Bill, that having drastically altered the proposals of his predecessor, he had met every valid objection to the Government's proposals. I contested that at the time and still do.  Since that claim was made by the Minister, possibly the most authoritative body in this country on questions such as this, the Incorporated Law Society, have made it quite clear that they disagree with these proposals, that they think they are wrong.  I have already pointed out that that body are not in any way politically inspired. They have no axe to grind politically. They are concerned only for the welfare of the clients of their members. They are a body embracing all shades of political opinion and I have no doubt that at least two members of the Government and one Parliamentary Secretary are members of that body.  If they are not, they should be.</P>
    <P>In addition to the advice expressed by the Incorporated Law Society, within the past week or ten days, since the Committee Stage of this Bill began, other views have been expressed by other bodies making it clear they disagree with the Minister's proposals. A lengthy letter appeared in one of the daily newspapers from a former Supreme Court judge who, as far as my memory goes, was a candidate for the Minister's Party in at least one general election.  He has gone on record as showing his disapproval of the measures the Minister has incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has decided, for whatever reason, to adhere to his idea of a fixed legal right share.  It is a pity he has done so.  He had an opportunity of bringing in fresh legislation which could have been of immense benefit to the people of the <Col N="825" /> country.  We were prepared to discuss it in a reasonable, reasoned, noncontroversial manner.  I do not suggest that, in the course of his discussions here, he approached it in any other way but I do feel that had the Minister been free to come into this House with an open mind, and to consider the scheme that we put up with an open mind, it is much more likely that there would be general agreement both inside this House and outside the House on a Bill which would incorporate the scheme of judicial discretion which we urged the Minister to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Deputy M. J. O'Higgins has said concerning this Bill but I should like to say just a few words on matters I touched on during the course of the Bill.  I think that not only will this fail to do complete justice to the widow but indeed an injustice, in certain cases, to the actual testator because his wishes will not always or indeed perhaps mainly be carried out in spite of the safeguard the Minister has tried to put into the Bill.  In this Bill, for the sake of the very few cases of injustice which have occurred, you either think it is right to upset the whole will-making of this country or you think, as we think on this side of the House, that it is more important to see that justice is done to the testator and to his widow by other means.  Deputy O'Higgins and others, in the course of the discussion on the Bill, did point out various ways in which they thought that could come about.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties I can see in this Bill is that it cuts across our whole legal idea, or what was our legal idea up to now.  We did hold in this country that a man sometimes had the right to do wrong, not to do a great wrong.  We held that he had a certain amount of right to dispose of his own property in his own way. Although rights of property is not a very popular term in the century we now live in, nevertheless western civilisation, as we know it, has been built up with a great deal of respect paid to those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see a situation arising in <Col N="826" /> which, by virtue of this Bill, when enacted, the whole method of passing on property will radically be altered. I am very much afraid that, as a result, a great number of our farms will be split up.  I know, in respect of a great number of businesses which exist in certain hands today, that the shares, and so on, will, by virtue of this Bill when it becomes an Act, have to be thrown on the market to provide perhaps for the widow's one-third.  Up to now, most men leaving property left the widow a life interest and that worked very well.  But how, now, can that be done when the widow herself is getting one-third of the estate?  It cuts across a lot of the ways in which testators and men acted with the best interest of their wives in mind.  It cuts across methods such men devised, and their legal advisers and financial advisers devised, which would give the widow maximum security and, at the same time, give her an income.  When I say &ldquo;security&rdquo; I am thinking not just of the security of the income she would have but security by the fact that she would indeed perhaps be protected from fortune-hunters by virtue of the testator's arrangements that she would not have full control of her money.</P>
    <P>It is I think an unfortunate step that, under this Bill, the State now steps in and says to a man who, perhaps, in his own lifetime made that money with his skill and his efforts: &ldquo;Yes, we allowed you to make this money.  To a certain extent, we applaud you for having done so.  But now we do not think that your views on the disposition of your property are as good as ours and we force you to do this and force you to do that.&rdquo; I think that will have a very bad effect on the future of Ireland.  I think it will cut across the policy of the Government in regard to industrialisation and the building up of businesses.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to attract capital. We are, I think, anxious to have people of means living in this country, people with disposable property.  I believe that, as a result of this Bill, we shall frighten some of those people away and that will not be a good step. <Col N="827" /> Therefore, I regret that the Minister has seen fit, even in this somewhat modified form, to pilot this Bill through this House.</P>
    <P>I believe that, within a few years, certain sections of this Bill will have to be altered radically.  I think that is something this House will regret.  It is not good to pass legislation and then, within a few years, owing to public outcry, to have to alter it.  I believe that will come about as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat what Deputies O'Higgins and M. E. Dockrell have said but let me say emphatically that I agree with everything they have said.  There is no doubt whatever that when we first set out to discuss the Succession Bill our sole concern was for the undutiful will, to ensure that the wife would be properly looked after on the death of her husband.  What has happened?  We have turned the clock the whole way round and have made provision for the widower in addition to the widow. One can imagine the case of a wealthy spinster whose only possible value on the matrimonial market is her money. One knows of such cases where a man marries a lady simply on account of the cash she has and it is only after marriage that she discovers his intentions. It is too late then.  Under this Bill, no matter how big a blackguard he is, no matter how he treats her, no matter how much he wishes to discard her, she has to provide for him and give him one-third of her assests after her death.  Remember, in most of these cases, the husband is the younger of the two and he is going to derive the benefit of that marriage.  I hope I am not misconstrued when I say that it is a marriage of convenience from his point of view.  We have not thought of that in our discussions on this Bill.  Is it fair?  Is it right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, take the comparatively wealthy widow who marries again, possibly some wastrel, and he in turn becomes entitled to one-third of her estate.  No matter how old she is or how young she is when she dies, that second husband becomes entitled to <Col N="828" /> one-third of her estate and is entitled to it whether she bequeaths it to him or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Think of the confusion that will exist along this unnatural Border of ours.  The law in the Six Counties, as we all know, is the law of Britain. There the testator is at liberty to make a will and to leave his assets to whom he wishes, to the person he thinks best entitled to it.  I can imagine persons in Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry being free to make wills while their neighbours across the Border, in the next townland, are compelled to leave one-third of their estates to the surviving spouse.  We people who practise on the Border know that in some cases assets exist on both sides.  I wonder what is going to happen when there is a shuttle across the Border and a will is made in the Six Counties disposing of property in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I presume that most of the estate will be squandered in a law suit as to domicile.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to laugh.  We might think of the unfortunates who have to provide the cash.  We may laugh here but the unfortunate solicitor who has to explain the position to his clients and explain what the Oireachtas and the Government have done to land them in that mess is not exactly in a position to laugh.  It will be very difficult to explain.  We have to explain to people now whose wills we have made over the past 25 or 30 years that they have to change them if they have not given one-third of their assets to their spouse.  I know many solicitors who have anything up to 1,000 wills in their safes.  Immediately this Bill becomes an Act, if they do not contact the people concerned forthwith, the wills will be considered undutiful wills and the law will apply to them as set out in this Bill.  Despite the intentions of these testators, expressed in writing down the years, they must now come and alter their wills.  Some of them, through senile decay, may no longer be in a position to alter the will.  They may no longer be in a position to execute a valid will.  Despite the fact that their solicitors and their families know their intentions, <Col N="829" /> their wills are no longer legal wills because they do not comply with the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>These are aspects that the Minister should consider.  It should be explained forthwith and should have been explained to the public generally when this Bill was under consideration that they will have duties to the surviving spouse and to their families and must comply with the Succession Bill as introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons I think this Bill is a bad Bill, a Bill which defeats the purpose it set out to achieve, namely, to amend the undutiful will.  We have leaned over far too far.  If the House had adopted the suggestion of the Fine Gael Party, there would have been no necessity for this controversial Bill, this Bill which I believe will be cursed down through the years until eventually it is amended by another Government.</P>

Costello, and so on, who realise that there is a very real problem which demands attention and what we are doing is simply saying that anyone who is prejudiced by an undutiful will may claim a legal right.  It is as easy as that.  But, if a husband excludes his wife, eventually his widow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course they are if they are not satisfied but that is for the married couple to sort out before either of them dies.  I have received as late as yesterday a letter from a very worried constituent who said it was appalling that his will was going to be made invalid and I had the greatest pleasure in replying to him within a matter of hours pointing out to him that his will was as valid as ever it had been.  The letter was a joint letter from husband and wife. They both seemed concerned and I was able to assure them&mdash;and I think they are now assured&mdash;that the situation so <Col N="831" /> far as they are concerned has not been changed one iota.</P>

      <P>Exactly, because they are a happily married pair who are well able to look after their own affairs and they are not going to fight during their lives or one of them develop a sense of grievance after the other has died.  Let it be clearly understood there is no question whatever of invalidation of wills or of a solicitor having to call in all clients who have made wills.  I hope Deputy O'Donnell will take these words of wisdom with him.  It is absolute nonsense for a solicitor to start panicking, looking through his will boxes and telling all his clients to come in and to make new wills.  He is just looking for business. There is no necessity for it and it is certainly not in the interest of his clients.  Nobody is going to be prejudiced in any way.  The only person whose will may be upset is a person who has made an undutiful will and whose will may be varied by the court on the application of the aggrieved parties.</P>

We have made it very simple, so simple that I do not think anybody will bother to go to court; certainly it will be very much the exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these contentious matters, the Bill goes a tremendous way towards clearing up the whole law of <Col N="832" /> succession.  It codifies the whole law on the matter of legacies and makes it a great deal more simple.  This legislation deserves the most complete approval by the House.  I will admit that in the early stages, and certainly with the earlier Bill, I was one of its strongest critics.  However, the Minister has met us in our criticisms in a very fair way and the Bill which is now about to be passed is a very much better Bill than it was in the first stages and a considerably better Bill than it was when it was introduced a second time.  It now has my full support but I would ask the Deputies not to allow Party considerations to influence them in giving incorrect information.

He described to us the communication of the two aged constituents who wanted reassurance from him, and with his cheerful insouciance, without reading the will of either of the aged constituents, Deputy Booth in a matter of hours time wrote back and said all was well.  He has not the faintest notion whether all was well or ill with his two aged constituents.</P>

      <P>They have made a will and made presumably what they consider to be proper dispositions, but if they have not made the provision that is required in this Bill as it at present stands, they or members of their family, if they have any, can assert a legal right to a provision out of the estate of the deceased constituent of Deputy Booth which that deceased constituent of Deputy Booth does not wish them to have.  Perhaps Deputy Booth would get on his bicycle and dash off to tell the two aged constituents that, and then ask them to go to see their solicitor, get their pair of <Col N="833" /> wills out of the safe, re-read them and see whether in the light of certain sections of this Bill, their intentions will be carried out.</P>

      <P>If the members of their family have recourse to the legislation enacted by this House and not to the terms of the will of the two aged constituents, Deputy Booth might discover, by the time they have had this discussion with their legal adviser, that the opinions which he provided at two hours' notice are not as valid as he appears to think they are. The Deputy must excuse me but it is really not what he said but the smug way he said it that brought me to my feet.  I like a man to get up and burst out in every direction but this profession of disinterested public spirit, which in fact is a smug hypocrisy, drives me up the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister got tangled up in the refuse left after him by his incompetent predecessor.  His predecessor is a man who was trained as an accountant and who knows as much about the law as my foot.  He got committed to the original form of this Bill and the Government had to scramble out of the original form of the Bill as best they could.  The present Minister for Justice who has had some legal training as a junior barrister has some understanding of the principles underlying the law.  There is an analogy, no more than an analogy, by which I believe we should have been guided in dealing with the Succession Bill.  Our whole legal system is based upon the common law qualified by statute law.  Over the years, centuries ago, there emerged in the common law a rigidity of spirit and practice against which society revolted. Out of the revolt against this rigidity there arose the whole structure of the Chancery law and equity and there was seconded to the Court of the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls subsequently the special function of seeing justice done even though the letter of the common law did not make provision for it, and where justice, as the common law used to be <Col N="834" /> described, collided with equity, it was an accepted doctrine that equity should prevail.</P>
    <P>That is really what we sought to do here, except that here we are dealing with the statute law.  We were face to face with the Wills Act and under that Act, 99 per cent of the human race made fair and equitable provision but there did remain a microscopic minority of eccentrics who made improvident wills.  I prefer to use the word &ldquo;improvident&rdquo; because very often these wills were not dictated by malice.  Certainly the worst of them were dictated by improvidence and, not infrequently, by incompetent legal advice.  There were rare cases where widows, mainly widows but sometimes families, were left with scandalously inadequate provision and where it was manifest that disaster had taken place either due to ecentricity or some other fortuitous circumstances.  We ought to bear in mind that it is very doubtful if one per cent of all the wills that ever were made were in that category.  It was to remedy that microscopic evil, looking at it in the global point of view, but that very acute evil, looking at it from the personal point of view, that we sought to find a way out.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had originated this Bill originally, I feel that he would have followed the pattern of equity and left a wide discretion to the courts to say: &ldquo;That is a will that is manifestly unjust to the widow and children,&rdquo; and he would have left to the courts discretion to make provision for them. That would simply have been to declare that we adhered to the principle of equity that those that went before us encouraged in order to correct the rigidity of the common law.  Instead of that, we have clamped down on our people the rigidity of statute law which controls and restricts the fundamental right of the father of any family.</P>
    <P>I think we are all coming to the conclusion that the family does not exist at all and that Oireachtas Éireann ought to occupy itself with the business of straightening out the family and, if necessary, breaking it up and in that way subscribing to the idea that the father of the family does not matter a damn, that he is an old fool in any <Col N="835" /> case and that he and his wishes can be completely disregarded.  That is a dangerous principle.  There are many people in the world who are seeking to overthrow society in one way and another.  I do not think the Minister is seeking to do that but I do think that he is following a pattern which is full of dangers.</P>
    <P>That is the same path about which I had reason to comment in the Finance Bill when I said that instead of cherishing the family and recognising that its sacrosanct character is fundamental to our whole society, our Legislature is being manoeuvred into the position of trespassing within the family circle and trampling on it generally.  Can members of this House imagine the minds of Deputy Booth's two aged and respectable constituents when they came to him and said that they were alarmed to hear that Oireachtas Éireann had announced its intention of breaking into their family circle and arrogating to themselves the right to say that if their wills did not conform to the Succession Bill, any interested party could come into court and claim the statutory right to set aside the dispositions of these two venerable constituents of Deputy Booth?</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who subscribe to the widely-held doctrine that Deputy Booth is a fool.  I do not think he is. I think he is anything but a fool and now I am looking at another member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They come into the Fianna Fáil Party apparently ordinary, intelligent men and a sojourn of five years in that Party reduces them to the condition of being used codfish and they believe everything they are told.  They will walk into the lobby in support of any daft proposition because the Minister is in a hole and they cannot let the Minister down. They all speak and think with the same minds.  I have seen the same qualities manifested by sardines and codfish and that does not qualify the sardines and codfish to be legislators for this or any other community.</P>
    <P>There does emerge occasionally an individual who says that this is too tough even for his Fianna Fáil stomach.  In that regard I wish Deputy <Col N="836" /> Booth would take counsel with his two aged constituents and, having done so, allow his conscience to stir.  The advice he has given to them is not defensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>It suits Deputy Booth all right but does it suit his two aged and respectable constituents?  I am sure it suits Deputy Booth.  There are certain well recognised steps to the post of Parliamentary Secretary. Deputy Booth might like to become a Parliamentary Secretary but his two aged constituents do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether Deputy Booth becomes a Parliamentary Secretary or not.  What they came to him for was advice.  They came and asked an informed member of this House what they were supposed to do and he told them that their absolute right to dispose of their property was still intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what Deputy Booth did tell his two aged constituents. He tells us he took only two hours to draft his masterly reply.  I would like to see a copy of that reply. I would suggest that he inscribe a copy of this masterly reply to his two aged constituents on the official records of the House.  We would all read it with great attention.  I am sure that the Minister will see that this reply is inscribed in letters of gold in the appropriate Party documents when the question of further promotion comes up.  I hope Deputy Booth's two aged constituents will inscribe it in letters of gold but they may inscribe it in different form the next time they get a ballot paper into their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long experience and practice of law corrected the rigidity of the common law and substituted for it the practice of equity which was placed originally in the Lord Chancellor's Court and subsequently in other courts. We all know the impossibility of arriving at a perfect solution to any problem.  We all know that all the members of the judiciary are not what the average man would call reasonable men but we have got to assume that they had some qualifications for the positions they <Col N="837" /> now occupy.  If they have not got them it is the fault of the Government that put them there.</P>
    <P>Therefore we are entitled to proceed on the assumption that they are competent people, no matter how large an assumption that may be.  They are all charged with the responsibility of administering equity.  I put it to the Minister that he would have been wiser, instead of providing this statutory limitation on the manner in which Deputy Booth's two aged constituents might dispose of their property, to make sure that in any case of manifest injustice equity would have been invoked to see justice done.</P>
    <P>If that were the contents of this Bill, then Deputy Booth, with a clear conscience, could have said to his two aged constituents: &ldquo;Seeing that you are virtuous, and presumably sane, and that you have access to a reputable solicitor, I can now say, with confidence, that there is nothing in the Succession Bill that will impinge in any way on the testament either of you may have made.  Therefore, go in peace.&rdquo; He could have said that, and meant it, but I put it to him that he went too far when he told them to go home in peace; and now I am going to address myself to the two aged constituents: &ldquo;Haste away to a more competent adviser than Deputy Booth and ask that competent adviser is there anything in that Bill which could be invoked to alter the disposition I have made in my will?&rdquo; I think the competent adviser will say: &ldquo;Poor Deputy Booth! He did not know what he was talking about. If he had known he probably would not have talked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark you, there is no urgency about this Bill.  God knows, it has had a pretty adventurous career up to now. Of all that appeared in it when it first came before this House everything is gone but its title.  I put it to the Minister that he will do himself and his Government no discredit if, on reflection between now and the time it goes before the Seanad, with the help of Deputy Booth, he leans towards the view that our ancestors were, perhaps, wiser than he is and the appropriate way to correct excessive rigidity in the <Col N="838" /> common law, or in specific paragraphs of the statute law, is to invoke the power of equity and leave things to the judgment of a reasonable man. Mark you, that is the description usually reserved for the occupants of the jury box.  I exceptionally apply it to the occupants of the Bench.  I contend that those who, in the judgment of a reasonable man, have been unjustly treated by a capricious testator should have access to the courts to see that justice is done.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does that, he would, I think, have virtually unanimous approbation of the reform of the law relating to wills.  In such a delicate matter as this, it is not a bad thing to have virtually unanimous agreement amongst us.  Nobody will get all he wants.  We may not have achieved all we would wish to achieve if we had both the intelligence and the genius to forge a perfect instrument, but, if we achieve an instrument, after our final deliberation, which may not measure up to everybody's hopes but which is universally acceptable, that is, at least, one effective step nearer the perfect achievement we sought and it will be a very much more precious achievement than a Bill carrying Deputy Booth's certificate to his aged constituents and a Bill, at the same time, which causes grave misgivings not only upon this side of the House but amongst the more intelligent members of the Minister's own Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have certainly had a very constructive debate on the different stages of this Bill.  We have had numerous amendments suggested. The measure which is now in course of being passed by Dáil Éireann will, I feel, prove to be one embodying an appropriate scheme of succession for Irish men and women in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular aspect with which I should like to deal at the outset. I refer to the notion apparent on the Fine Gael Benches that there is something sacrosanct or basic to our democratic system in the idea of absolute freedom of testation.  That is not so.  At this point of time we are the only country in the world in which there is absolute freedom of <Col N="839" /> testation.  It is obviously undesirable that a system should operate in which a man or woman can do what he or she likes irrespective of the duties and obligations owing, in particular, to the family.</P>
    <P>The British Act of 1938 amended the British system.  Only at that late stage was an Act passed providing for a system of application to the court in respect of a wife or child prejudiced by an inofficious will.  Prior to that, in the courts of equity, which Deputy Dillon has eulogised, there was no provision for the rectification of a will by a wife or child and these could be, to use the old saying, cut off with a shilling, or left destitute.  This system of absolute freedom of testation emerged only at a very late stage, in the past 200 years, in Britain.  It is peculiar to England and Wales and to those countries to which they managed to bring this idea of absolute freedom of testation to the detriment of the duties and obligations that a testator has, in particular to his own family.</P>
    <P>In Scotland, the other half of the neighbouring isle, they have a system similar to the one we are introducing here, but the Scots have gone a little further in that there is a legal right for the children as well as for the surviving spouse.  We have deleted the provision in regard to the children, following the discussions here on the Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In every country in the world, outside of England and Wales, and wherever they have managed to plant this idea of absolute freedom of testation, it has long been acknowledged that a specific share out of a man's estate must go to his wife and children.  These shares are to be found in Roman Law.  They were recognised by Canon Law and <Col N="840" /> introduced into those countries to which Christianity spread.  It was part and parcel of the system that one-third went to the wife, one-third to the children, and one-third according to the testator's own wishes.  That system operates in Scotland, in Europe and in most of the states comprising the United States of America.  In case Deputy Dockrell feels this system is a deterrent to private enterprise, may I say that the system also operates in the strongest commercial centre of the United States, the State of New York. There is a compulsory share for the surviving spouse, and a compulsory share for the children, the remainder going at the testator's wish.  It is nonsense to suggest that the share system will operate as a deterrent to either investment or enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On becoming Minister for Justice, I met various interests and various bodies concerned in this matter.  I met the National Farmers' Association. We had a most constructive discussion. I came to the view that there was merit in the argument that the one-third legal right share for the children would not be suitable here.  In the Succession Bill of 1964 there was a mandatory one-third for the children. This has been deleted and the procedure now is by way of an application to a judge in chambers where a child who should have been provided for out of the estate, has not been so provided for.  I was convinced that having a system, whereby children already provided for, who had made their way in the world, gone into business or secured professions, could extract one-third of the estate could lead to a lot of trouble.  In regard to the surviving spouse, the widow, there is a very distinct difference.  Here we are dealing with a situation in which a man and his wife have been in partnership over the years, have reared a family, lived on a farm, or participated in a business. In that situation, arising out of the very nature of the marriage contract in our society, it is right and proper, having regard to the indissolubility and sacred nature of the marriage contract, that the survivor should have as a first charge on the testator's estate a legal right to one-third of <Col N="841" /> that estate in the event of the survivor being in any way wronged in the testator's will.</P>
    <P>This is where Deputy Booth was correct in the remarks he made earlier. This particular provision of the legal right which now stands in the Bill in the case of the widow in no way invalidates any existing wills, nor will it invalidate any wills of the future that may make alternative provision by way of life estate, or bequest or other arrangements appropriate to the particular circumstances of the survivor of the marriage.  I want to emphasise that this one-third is not a compulsory share which must be extracted out of the estate by the widow.  It is a right she must exercise within 12 months of the death of the testator, and she may exercise and probably will exercise that right only if she has been wronged under the will.  If the wife and husband make their own arrangement, as apparently Deputy Booth's aged pair did, among themselves as to how best their property should be disposed or managed after the death of one, that arrangement stands.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in the future many wills will continue to be dealt with on that basis.  Where a couple come together and decide how best to arrange their property in the event of one surviving the other, their decision in the form of a will suitable to their own circumstances will not be upset. There is nothing in this Bill to invalidate existing wills or future wills where certain arrangements are, or will be, made for the benefit of the surviving partner.  This Bill guarantees that the widow who may have been victimised or prejudiced by reason of the inofficious will of a capricious husband will have a legal right to one-third and can insist on it, no matter to whom the property is left&mdash;whether it has been left to some charity or to somebody in Honolulu.  That charity or that person must first of all deal with the widow of the dead man and she must be catered for properly out of the estate within 12 months of the death of the testator.  She can insist on her <Col N="842" /> legal right to one-third and secure a proper deal for herself.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which this Bill is going to operate.  It is only proper that property should go to the son or daughter, more often to the son of the testator's choice, to be managed.  This applies particularly in the farming areas of the country.  It is only right that we should seek to encourage that a father should decide on one son to run the land.  He may make a priest of one son and perhaps a nun of a daughter and perhaps set up others in business, but there will be a son who will remain on the land.  I was disturbed about the manadatory one-third provision for children but now as the Bill stands the father can say to one son &ldquo;John, you are the man for the land; I am giving the farm to you&rdquo;.  But John's mother, after the death of the father, has her legal right to one-third and she can use that and hold it as a guarantee that she will be properly treated by her son after her husband's death.  In the event of her husband not looking after her in the will, she can insist on her son looking after her out of the property.  That is a reasonable situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. A. Costello on the Second Reading debate last December on the Succession Bill, 1964, pleaded that we should get some marriage between the legal right system we had in that measure, the two separate one-thirds for wife and children, and a system of judicial discretion.  He did not go the whole way with absolute judicial discretion nor with our scheme of one-third for the wife and one-third for the children.  I think that the Succession Bill, 1965, represents what he had in mind in seeking a marriage between the two systems.  The Bill says that where a child who is economically dependent on the testator has not been properly catered for, he can go into court; but we are not going to drive the widow into court.  There is a very real difference between a child going into court to prove economic dependency and a woman going into court to be met, perhaps, with evidence of marital troubles, rows, matters that need not and should not be raked up, <Col N="843" /> tensions and problems between a man and wife stretching over 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years, matters that are best left buried.  These are the things that would be raked up, no matter how private the hearing against some unfortunate woman who is seeking to establish her rights.  In the case of a widow, who has been a partner all her life with her husband, we feel that the proper solution is to give her a legal right which will be a guarantee that she will be fairly treated after her husband's death.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also said last December that this problem of the inofficious will was quite a sizeable problem. That was precisely Deputy Costello's wording, the wording of a man who has spent years in the courts. He said that in his experience over these years this was a sizeable problem and, mark you, I agree with him.  In the case of solicitors like Deputy O'Higgins who have argued about the occasional nature of this type of case in their offices, I cross swords with them.  There are many hidden cases and I know of them as a public representative in a rural area.  I know of widows who have seriously been wronged and who do not want to take it further, and who at present cannot take it further because, as things stand, if they are to upset the will of a misguided spouse they must prove some form of insanity or that some form of force was used on the husband to make the will.  These are the hidden cases where wrongs have been done to people over the years.  There is nothing about these cases in solicitors' offices or in the records of the courts. The legalistic people say this is no problem at all.  As Deputy Costello said, it is a sizeable social problem. It is particularly a problem where a man and wife have lived together and unfortunately have had no children. Too often I have seen instances of jealous-minded, proud husbands in that situation, full of a stupid desire to keep the farm in the family name. Where the woman who has laboured for him has not produced a family, the farm is passed to some cousin or relative of the same name as the <Col N="844" /> testator.  These are things which can and do go on in our society and we are trying to remedy them in the Bill. This is a sizeable problem.  Far from ramming the Succession Bill through this House, we have had the support of the Labour Party at every stage and we have only had certain legalistic people in the Fine Gael Party to oppose it.  Labour have voted with us on every stage.</P>

      <P>At every stage in this House where a division was challenged by legalistic people in the Fine Gael Party, who are probably lacking in social conscience, we have gone into the Division Lobby in favour of this socially desirable measure to deal with, as Deputy Costello said, a sizeable social problem.  We have gone into the Division Lobby along with the Labour Party because they have seen, as I have sought to explain, that we are making an honest attempt here to grapple with a social problem.  I think Deputy Dillon stated that it is very difficult to get a perfect measure in a matter of this kind.  Deputy Dunne, speaking on the Second Stage, said the same thing and expressed the view that, while the Labour Party might not go the whole way with this measure, it represented, in a very difficult situation, the best that could be done.  That, I feel, is a just comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had here a very constructive debate.  Personally, I have met all the organisations associated with the legal profession who are concerned in a matter of this kind.  I might say that, at these meetings, I did not hear any constructive case against the widow getting her one-third.  Ninety-five per cent of the argument by the Incorporated Law Society and the National Farmers' Association and on the <Col N="845" /> Second Reading of the Succession Bill, 1964, was directed at the mandatory share for the children.  I felt myself that this provision was wrong and would have to go because it might involve, as I thought, the break-up of property and estates.  At no stage did I hear anybody raise a shout against the widow getting her legal right of one-third.  I was a critic of the Bill as it stood originally.  However, to me, it was a fundamental principle that the widow should be entitled to one-third if there were children and to one-half if there were no children.  As I say, I could see dangers in the situation of a legal right share for the children.</P>
    <P>We have gone a long way to meet the views that have been expressed. We have had constructive discussions. I do not think the sort of speech made by Deputy P. O'Donnell on the Final Stage helps very much in the matter. There is no point in confusing people on it.  We have here in this document, for the first time, a comprehensive law relating to wills and relating to succession generally.  We now have a document which the practitioner or any member of the public may consult on this important matter of the transmission of property.  We have in the Bill a judicial discretion in the case of child dependants and a share in the case of the widow which is not a fixed rigid share but a right which she may or may not enforce.  The Bill represents a very Christian and human approach to this problem and an approach which has been adopted in most civilised countries.  It is different from the approach which has been adopted in England and Wales but it is the same as the approach which has been adopted in Scotland.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we, in an Irish Parliament, should not look at the legislation of other countries when we seek to bring in this legislation and also look at our own circumstances.  I do not see why we should slavishly follow the legislation in England and Wales without examining other ways of dealing with the problem as well. For the information of some Deputies, I should say that the English system has not worked at all well owing to the caprice and the interpretations of <Col N="846" /> the various judges.  I think we now have here a system that will work well. The best evidence I have that it will work well is that, for a great number of years, in regard to 50 per cent of the properties in Ireland, we already have had a system of a legal right share of one-third operating in case of intestacy,</P>
    <P>I would say that, in the case of farms, particularly medium-sized and small farms, 70 or 80 per cent go by way of intestacy.  Over the years, in these cases, this particular legal right share has not been exercised by the widow to the detriment of the children, as has been suggested will be the case when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are many other sections in the Bill which have not aroused the same discussion but have given rise to constructive debate.  It will generally be welcomed that we now have this comprehensive measure.  It will generally be welcomed that we are eliminating feudal and other rules as to estates.  We now say quite clearly that land devolves on the personal representatives.  Wills may be made but the property will be subject to a legal right residing in the widow and an application to the court by a dependent child.  A new system has been spelled out for the first time in legislation. It is legislation that does credit to us as a Christian nation with a social conscience.  The Divisions indicate that the substantial majority of this House believe this to be so and they have shown it as their belief.  I am convinced that a substantial number of people in this country believe in this measure and that more people will be convinced when it is operating.  I feel that the only reason for opposition to the measure has been the befogging nature of much of the criticism, criticism such as we heard tonight, in particular from Deputy P. O'Donnell who should know that this sort of wild-cat criticism can do no good.</P>
    <P>We can do good if the legal profession interpret this Bill in a proper way and advise their clients in a sensible manner without play-acting with politics and seeking to bemuse <Col N="847" /> and befog the people about a Bill which is an excellent Christian and social measure and does not represent any form of State control.  It is a good measure.  What it seeks to do is simply to achieve a fulfilment of the indissoluble contract of married partners and to create an insurance whereby the surviving partner is provided for.</P>

Ansin beidh deis ag Gaeltarra Éireann an togra a bhreithniú agus, má oireann sé dhóibh uile, dul i gcomhar leis an gcomhlacht agus scaireanna a ghlacadh ann.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost forgotten that I reported progress myself three weeks ago but the slip is understandable. I tabled a number of Dáil questions recently to the Minister for Education on the question of art and I was horrified to be informed that the Department has only one inspector examining and advising the schools on drawing.  Drawing is being taught in some 305 schools with 22,500 pupils. It must be apparent to everyone that one inspector could not possibly give attention to the important subject of art where he has so many schools with so many pupils to cover.  It is true that some of these are vocational schools and the subject of drawing in them is primarily one of mechanical drawing and they may have some specialists in these schools to assist the teachers in their work.</P>
      <P>By and large, the situation in our schools is deplorable and disgraceful. For a lesser number of pupils in Northern Ireland, there are 20 inspectors for this subject alone.  We are constantly paying lip service to the desirability of improving our educational system and yet doing nothing about it and the field of education is particularly vulnerable in this respect. We pay lip service to the desirability of improving our teaching methods in many subjects but we fail to take the effective steps necessary to give proper training.  Teachers as well as pupils need the guidance an inspector can give in all matters of education.  Inspectors do not go around now merely for the purpose of frightening pupils.  They can do useful and helpful work in bringing in new ideas to the schools which may become stale in their methods without periodic inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I urge on the Minister for <Col N="852" /> Education that in paying lip service to the needs of our schools in regard to developing the skils of eye and hand, we are failing to give to the pupils the degree of assistance that ought to be available to them.  I would honestly urge on the Minister to see that that figure of one inspector be multiplied tenfold in the not too distant future in order that the arts of eye and hand may be properly developed.</P>
    <P>In recent times design experts from Scandinavia had to speak in very cold terms of our art schools here as designers and we deserve any criticism levelled at us in this regard.  Some nations have a natural aptitude for art but I think we in Ireland have not got that natural aptitude.  It therefore needs to be taught to our pupils or drawn out of them, if they have it. The casual manner in which the Department of Education treats the subjects of art and drawing gives us very little hope of developing the better side of our Irish nature which is capable of being so developed.</P>
    <P>My remarks should not be taken in any way as criticism of the one inspector in the Department.  Mr. Bruen does marvellous work, considering that he is expected to work alone and also considering that he is regarded in the Department as a person looking after a subject not worth being treated as one of importance by the Department. He cannot possibly give of his best due to the inadequate treatment which he gets at the hands of the Department.  The Minister said recently that he was considering the matter and I hope that Mr. Bruen will get from this consideration humane treatment and that the Minister will multiply the number of inspectors so that they will reach something like the number in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>None of us is anxious to have untrained people in our primary or secondary schools.  We have been encouraging untrained teachers to acquire the necessary training.  We must strive to do our duty by the untrained teachers who, because of the inadequacy of our system, are <Col N="853" /> there.  There are many untrained teachers in primary and secondary schools.  Many of them have a natural aptitude for teaching.  Many of them have had many years experience in teaching and have shown themselves to be first-class teachers.  Notwithstanding that, they are on a very poor salary scale compared with trained teachers.</P>
    <P>The time has come to try to close the gap between the remuneration earned by trained and untrained teachers, particularly as we have reached the stage when we have decided that the number of untrained teachers must be very few.  The day is not too far away when we will not have any untrained teachers but nevertheless we ought not fail to do justice by the untrained teachers who are there.  I hope the Minister will see to it that some modicum of justice and fair play is given to the untrained teachers as long as they have sufficient numbers of years of experience to justify being paid a higher salary than they are now receiving.  It is appalling to think that some so-called untrained teachers are receiving much less than an unskilled labourer earns at the present time.  That is a situation which exists. It is undesirable.  It has led to a considerable amount of frustration amongst the untrained members of the teaching profession and, in turn, must have a certain damaging effect on the morale of the schools and of the pupils.  If these teachers are able to show by experience and skill that they are good teachers, the Minister should see to it that they are paid a more adequate salary than they have been paid in the past.</P>
    <P>It is pitiful that our educational system does not stimulate the critical faculties in pupils.  That is the greatest shortcoming of the system.  We are producing a mass of young people every year whose main anxiety is to conform to whatever are the accepted standards of the society in which they find themselves.  The result is that the freedom which was fought for so hard in the past is likely to be taken from us by a new control, the control of the bureaucrat, the control of the pseudo-expert, <Col N="854" /> the control of a small clique in the country who set the pattern of events and who so control the avenues of propaganda that they oblige people to conform to their particular ideas. We had a notion of this menace in the speech of the Minister for Justice early tonight in the closing stages of the Succession Bill when he trounced people who dared to question the Establishment.  Unfortunately, we as a nation are inclined to quake under the cry and trouncing of the Establishment. I bemoan the fact that our educational system is producing a nation of sheep and that we have lost that critical faculty for which we were at one time famous.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, if he is not to become the slave of the same Establishment mind, ought to stimulate the critical faculty in our students.  It may well be that the anxiety to pass set examinations is a serious cause of this national malady but, whatever the cause is, it needs to be rooted out so that we will have in future a more courageous and questioning outflow from our schools and universities.  If we do not do it soon we will become as a nation the slave of the bureaucrat, the slave of the controller and all that education is supposed to produce will not be produced here.  Education is supposed to produce people with critical minds, people who are self-respecting and have a capacity to criticise.  The failure to do that is the greatest drawback in our educational system at present.</P>
    <P>We will all criticise on the Estimate for the Department of Education every year the lack of money for the building of structures.  I throw my mind back to the near past when in this city some of the best results were produced out of the poorest schools.  Indeed, some of the best results were produced out of schools that had classes of 50 or 60 in converted bedrooms of 19th century houses.  Today one can look at buildings going up but, instead of producing men and women of the stamina of those produced in the schools to which I have referred, we are producing a nation of young conformists lacking in that character which was once produced out of the <Col N="855" /> hardships which people had to undergo as a result of inadequate facilities for education.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister senses the exasperation which many people feel about our education system at the present time.  He indicated in the course of his opening statement that he was not at all satisfied with the position that our educational system at present is divided into a number of apparently water-tight compartments; that he was not satisfied that we were getting the best results where we tolerated the existence of different and competitive systems which sneered at the efforts of teachers in other systems and he indicated his desire to have some form of national body which could speak out for all branches of education.  We are with him in his anxiety to dovetail the different compartments in our educational sphere at the present time and anything which we on this side of the House can do to ease the Minister's path in that direction we will certainly do.  We do not envy him his task.  We are aware that there are a number of sacred cows which some people will not allow to be destroyed but if we are to have a people in the future with critical and useful minds we will have to get away from the stereotyped compartments which have prevented the educational system from being properly used.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that so much of our educational capital is under-used.  That is exactly what is happening.  To me it is intolerable that we should be spending considerable amounts of capital money to erect national schools which become idle at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. and remain idle until the following day although in the same area there may be a crying need for a course of education of some form or another, either cultural or scientific, at night time. Instead of insisting that the national schools, which are built out of the public purse, are made available for vocational education, we duplicate our capital equipment by building vocational schools for use at night time only.  Again, many of these schools which are built out of public <Col N="856" /> money are denied to the taxpayers.  It is a sad commentary upon our immaturity that various social bodies in the city are unable to get a place in which to meet without going to one of the commercial hotels in the centre of the city, simply because the managers of the local national schools which have been built out of the public purse, refuse to make these schools available for parish and social activities at times when they are not being used for national school purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputies who represent rural areas know the willingness of school managers in the rural areas to make the local school available for all kinds of purposes and also for political Parties to hold their meetings.  Political Parties are, after all, responsible units of our society.  If that is not acknowledged by certain people, the sooner they are made to realise the responsibility of democracy and the responsibility of political parties, the better.  But, by and large, it is certainly much easier to get national schools for civic purposes at night time in rural areas than it is in the city.  This is utterly intolerable.  I would hope that the Minister would use his good offices with the managers of these establishments to ensure that the facilities which have been supplied by the taxpayer are made available to responsible civic organisations at times when they are not being used by the school authorities.</P>
    <P>An instance of overlapping in respect of educational capital was brought to my notice within the past few months in a place not 100 miles distant from Dublin.  The local secondary school operated on Saturday mornings and wished to teach science as a subject, one that is highly desirable in this day and age.  However, the secondary school had no laboratory or science room but the local technical school had such facilities and the local technical school was not operating on Saturday morning. When the secondary school authorities approached the vocational education committee, they were regarded as people who should really be in a mental home even to suggest such a thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Here was a vocational school science room paid for by the taxpayers and the ratepayers, which was public property.  The local secondary school was providing the educational facilities for the children of the same parents, in some cases, as those children going to the vocational school, but because of the watertight compartments in which the two sections of education operate at the moment, the sensible idea of making the facilities of the vocational school available on Saturday morning for the pupils of the secondary school could not be entertained at all.  That is absolutely daft and unjustifiable and the Minister should rationalise that kind of activity. One does not minimise the obstacles he will have to overcome in this herculean task, but if he nibbles at it, there is the hope that all the unnecessary selfishness in education might be dissolved, and that in itself would be a worthwhile contribution to the national pool of proper thinking on all things.</P>
    <P>On the question of proper thinking, I do not know what the Minister can do about the appalling philosophy that is still being taught by a number of teachers who should know better. Within the past few months, it has come to my notice that children in one primary school class in Dublin were being taught that our neighbouring island was an evil place and that they should never go there because it was full of bad Protestants.  It is shocking to think that children of the tender ages of six, seven and eight years are getting tripe of that kind in a national school.</P>

      <P>Poison of that kind in a national school.  I know it is not in the official text books&mdash;thank goodness, it is not&mdash;although at times we almost go so far.  I am not suggesting this is widespread but it is certainly happening in more places than one.  I am not too sure what needs to be done about this type of poison, as Deputy Corish terms it, that is being taught in our schools but the damage done to tender minds is so terrible that drastic action must be taken about it.  Complaints <Col N="858" /> made by the parents to the teacher in question have fallen on barren soil as far as that teacher is concerned.  I have known other cases of this to occur from time to time and it is an appalling commentary that we have in our schools any teachers who would impart bilge of that kind to children.  It has this undesirable effect also, that sometimes it leads to a certain amount of disharmony between children and parents.  The children come to believe that the teacher is right to be imparting dangerous ideas like this and that the parents are wrong.  I hope the Minister will take effective steps to see that this type of poison is no longer permitted in our schools.</P>
      <P>When I say this, I am not trying to pretend that the British have always been right in their treatment of Ireland&mdash;far from it.  It is very proper that our history should be taught in correct terms but in this ecumenical age, to be telling children of six to eight years of age that Protestants are bad is something that is absolutely unforgivable.  It is very necessary that we would not do harm to young minds and, therefore, the Minister has a serious obligation to discharge in this respect.</P>
      <P>Before this debate resumed, there was an interesting passage between Deputy O'Donnell from Donegal and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  They were both talking Gaeilge Uladh.  A lot of it was above the heads of Members of this House who, like myself, received a kind of mongrel Irish at the hands of the good Christian Brothers here in Dublin.  It brings me to mention another subject on which I should like to express my own disappointment with the activities of the Department of Education in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children of my generation at school were the victims or the beneficiaries, as the case may be, of Gaeilge éigeantach as it is now called.  If we were, we learned a considerable amount of Irish and we became familiar with a form of words and spelling which, when we left school, allowed most of my generation to <Col N="859" /> maintain a constant and familiar knowledge of the language.  Since then two radical changes have taken place in the appearance and form of Irish. First of all, the spelling itself was contracted so that words which we once knew at sight and did not require to spell out were no longer familiar to us, and it required a considerable exercise of self-discipline to read the new appearance of the Irish language which was produced within a matter of five or ten years after many of us left school.</P>
    <P>Since then, a further operation has been performed.  The Celtic script with which we were familiar has been thrown aside.  It is not an unusual thing now for children going to school to ask their parents how to spell words in Irish and for the parents to spell them in correct Irish as the parents learned it and for the children to be slapped in school the following day for producing compositions with Irish words which have been misspelt.  This is an abomination and I do not care what expert view there is in the Department to justify it.  This policy has done untold harm to the revival of Irish. It has alienated the affection of the first generation to be educated in Irish schools under the system of what is now called compulsory education.  It has set up a barrier between parents and their school-going children.  At a time when it was necessary to cultivate goodwill and to encourage the use of Irish, to have introduced these two wholly unnecessary artificial operations and make Irish a stranger to the minds of the generation who spent ten or 15 years at school was an appalling thing and cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I know we will be told that for the future this is the best thing that could have been done but apparently we are not yet at the end of it.  The Minister has told us that the language is now going through laboratory tests.  I do not know whether that is to find out if the cancerous growth which was removed in the last two operations is still growing, but one shudders to think what the final production will be when it comes out of the test tubes and the <Col N="860" /> computers in the scientific laboratories. We are led to believe that these scientific language laboratories can be of great assistance in teaching people a language.  That may well be if the language is a living one and a known one, but we have made Irish into no less than three different languages in the last two or three decades.  I cannot see what kind of familiar language will come out of all the scientific tests now being applied to the language.</P>
    <P>The only problem in the past was the difference between the Irish of Connacht, the Irish of Munster, the Irish of Ulster and whatever residue there happened to be in Leinster. Those of us who went through school in the past 20, 30 or 40 years were reasonably familiar with the differences between the four dialects and there was a possibility that, in time, these dialects would become amalgamated and produce a living language. It might well be the language at which the experts sneer now, the language the Dublin people use when they talk Irish, but it would at least have been a living language.  It is my opinion that all the activity of the so-called experts has done untold harm, harm which can never be undone.</P>
    <P>There is then the Department making the situation more difficult still. Some years ago the Department directed that only the Roman script was to be used.  For the children in the junior schools, it was to be the Cló Romhánach and, in time, that would be the only script for the children and ultimately for future generations. Simultaneously, teachers in the junior schools were teaching children, who were supposed to have only the Cló Romhánach, the Irish script.  One year the children were taught Gaelic script and the following year they started learning the Cló Romhánach.  The children had the greatest difficulty in changing over from Gaelic script to the Cló Romhánach, from the Gaelic script with its aspirate and the síniú fada to the Cló Romhánach with aitches all over the place.</P>
    <P>There is a movement&mdash;the title of it <Col N="861" /> eludes me at the moment&mdash;in Sandyford in County Dublin dedicated to a form of Irish spelling which will get rid of the aitches.  I understand the experts sneer at the activities of these people.  They regard them as cranks. I can think of no greater crank where Irish is concerned than the so-called experts in the Department of Education. These people in Sandyford recently produced a book written by Miles na gCopaleen in this script.  It is easily readable for people like myself, who were taught Irish through the Cló Gaedhealach, and who were not at any stage of their schooling familiar with these spurious aitches.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had more time, and possibly a greater inclination, than others to maintain his familiarity with the Irish language.  One envies him his continuing capacity to improve and his ease in expression.  Many people, who had a desire to speak Irish, do not get the opportunity in their ordinary avocations because their customers or clients just would not tolerate it and their hours of relaxation are so full of other work that they do not even then get the opportunity to use Irish.  Such people, however, can read the book to which I have referred because there are none of these spurious aitches in the spelling.  I should like to see our scientific laboratories produce a spelling of the same kind.  If they do that, I, for one, shall shout &ldquo;Hurrah&rdquo; because that will achieve something.  Putting in the aitches means that the words one learned at school become quite unfamiliar. A familiar word of five letters can, with the Cló Romhánach, grow into a word of eight letters. Adults read visually and not by spelling out each word.  An adult has become so familiar with the form and structure of words that a mere glance carries the message.  That is impossible if one is forced to read a script entirely different from that with which one was familiar.</P>
    <P>I am nervous that the Minister will accept all that the Department has done in recent years in relation to the spelling of Irish.  It will take courage and, to use a stronger word, guts on his <Col N="862" /> part to say that all this expertise has done untold harm and he intends to put an end to it.  We would all like to see him revert to the script familiar to the parents of the school-going children of today.  Unless that is done, one will not get the affection that the language should command.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are other causes militating against the language but I do not intend to go into these in this debate.  I refer to the causes which engender opposition to the language.  I am concerned here merely with the educational aspects of it and the instruments being used in that regard.  The Department has failed miserably to retain in one of the most vital ways familiarity with the Irish language on the part of the parents of today, and I do not know what can now be done to undo the harm, but I beseech the Minister in his capacity as Minister and as a representative of these people to do something to restore familiarity so that those who left school in the past ten or 20 years will have again the kind of language with which they are familiar and to which they are entitled if they are to do justice by their children in helping them in their mastery of the language.</P>
