    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider having a Select Committee of the Dáil set up with powers to review from time to time the operations of semi-State bodies.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to questions bearing on this subject addressed to me in this House on 18th February, 1965.  9th December, 1964, 24th November, 1964, 15th April, 1964, 26th July, 1962, and 29th March, 1960.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Taoiseach and the Government has not changed in all that period?  No?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this is an idea which has been considered over very many years in this and other Parliaments and I do not think anybody has yet arrived at a reasonable solution.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say to whom these semi-State bodies are responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, therefore, it is not unreasonable that the Dáil or a Select Committee, as suggested here, would have some contact with them and discuss policy generally and general activities?  It has been pointed out here by most Deputies that nobody wants to interfere with the day-to-day administration of these semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should give that a great deal of thought because the implications of it are quite extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under consideration by many Governments for a long time.  Pending a final solution, is there not much to be said for authorising the Committee of Public <Col N="3" /> Accounts to set up a sub-committee to meet the boards of directors of these companies once a year, not necessarily in public, but to raise with them the kind of questions that are habitually asked here and which the Ceann Comhairle, in accordance with our Standing Orders, declines to allow on the ground that they relate to day-to-day activities of the company but being the kind of questions which are asked at the annual meetings of public companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the utilisation of the Committee of Public Accounts would be about the worst possible solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest the Committee on Public Accounts.  I suggested a sub-committee drawn from that body with the function simply of meeting the directors annually without the attendant publicity of taking evidence which is associated with the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give some consideration to it, say, during the recess because there is a general feeling that these semi-State bodies are far too remote from the Dáil, from public representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are far too remote from everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach should consider it again.  It would do no harm to consider it again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state, in regard to the independent inquiry made by the Central Statistics Office by postal questionnaires to a sample of agricultural holdings for the purposes of checking the June 1964 census turkey numbers (a) the full wording of the questionnaires, (b) the number posted in each county, (c) the number of replies from each county, (d) the resulting information from each county regarding the average number of <Col N="4" /> turkeys (i) over and (ii) under six months old per holding, (e) if the holdings were representative as regards size of flocks according to the June census, (f) if in selecting the sample any preference was given to holdings on which, according to the June census, the number of turkeys was more than the national average per holding, and (g) the average number (i) over six months old and (ii) under six months old per holding in the Republic according to the June census.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of the sample inquiry referred to at (a)-(f) of the question was to provide an independent check on the usual method of estimating the number of turkeys in the State.  It was not designed for publication and it is not proposed to issue any details of the inquiry.  The results were in complete conformity with the official figures.</P>
      <P>As regards (g) of the Deputy's question, the estimated total number of turkeys in June, 1964 was 69,200 over six months old and 564,100 under six months old.  The corresponding numbers of holdings with turkeys have not been compiled so that it is not possible to give the average number of each class of bird per holding.</P>

      <P>The erection by the Electricity Supply Board of poles and pylons on private property is governed by section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 as amended by section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1935 and section 46 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945.  No compensation is payable to landowners under the statutes, but I am informed by the Board that, in some cases, where there has been substantial interference with land, they make <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  Amending legislation on this subject is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>Production commenced in February, 1963.  Grants totalling £37,213 were paid to the company towards the cost of machinery and the training of workers.  The company are honouring their commitments to repay these grants.  As it is not the practice to disclose information about the private affairs of industrial concerns, I am not prepared to supply the particulars requested in respect of the number of persons employed.  It is understood that the principal reason for the closing down of the firm was a falling off of the company's market for its products in the United States.  A large proportion of the disemployed workers has already been placed in alternative employment in the Industrial Estate and it is expected that most of the remaining workers will be offered employment as vacancies arise in other factories in the Estate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, having regard to the position disclosed by the recent trade returns, he will indicate what steps the Government propose to take to deal with the imbalance in external payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The position disclosed by the recent trade returns is that for the first five months of this year, as compared with the same period of last year, imports are up £16 million and exports are down almost £10 million.  The trade deficit has, therefore, increased by £26 million and may increase further before the export expansion is resumed and the import rise slows down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was explained at Budget time, and in replies to questions and debates since, the position is one which is of concern to the Government, whose policy aim in the present difficult circumstances is to promote, as quickly <Col N="12" /> as possible, an improvement in the trade balance and to ease the pressures on resources, while at the same time ensuring continuance of the highest practicable level of productive domestic activity.</P>
    <P>Some of the adverse factors are external, including the levy on exports of manufactures to Britain and the international shortage of capital.  As far as internal factors are concerned, much of the recent decline in exports is due to a purely temporary shortfall in the availability of mature cattle for export.  Cattle stocks are, however, increasing and exports are expected to rise to a much higher level before the end of the year.  The various internal pressures on resources have tended to become, in the aggregate, excessive; the levels of public expenditure and of personal incomes have been rising steeply and borrowing and consumption appear recently to be increasing somewhat faster than saving and production.  In the field of credit, the Government have supported the <Col N="13" /> advice given by the Central Bank, which is directed towards moderating the rate of expansion of credit and reserving priority for credit facilities to productive purposes.  I have already stated in the House that it is in the national interest that applications for credit for less essential purposes receive a lower priority so that more essential needs can be met from the resources available.</P>
    <P>A continuing and careful analysis is being made for trends and developments so that steps may continue to be taken, even during the recess, to safeguard the long-term interests of the economy and sustain production and employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has contributed significantly in that, as I think <Col N="15" /> I said during my reply on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, by reason of this ten per cent, and by reason of higher costs of production, profit margins are getting thinner, and in many cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a contributory factor.  The Government have given the export promotion grants of 40 per cent of the amount of the surcharge. That leaves a margin of 60 per cent in some cases for the exporters to catch up with but as I said, the costs of production and other things have made it more difficult for them to export goods profitably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to (a) and (b) of the first question is in the affirmative.  As the amount for the recount exceeds the prescribed amount, it has not been possible to clear final payment for the following reasons.  As this was the first election in which the statutory right to a special recount was invoked, there was no experience of the amount of work on re-examining and recounting votes which would be involved and, consequently, of any basis on which this work should be paid for out of the Central Fund.  In the Returning Officers (Borough and County Constituencies) Charges Order, 1965, 75 per cent of the payment for the original count was laid down for a recount of this kind, as it was assumed that the work involved would be less exacting than the original count. As it turned out, however, the additional work on the recount in this constituency, as indicated in a statement furnished to my Department by the returning officer, was much more than could be anticipated.  This was accepted at a meeting subsequently held with representatives of the returning officers at which my Department was represented and at which it was agreed that these officers would submit their views as to a reasonable basis for fees and expenses for these election recounts.  On receipt of recommendations, there will be no delay in dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has recently advised the returning officer that, in view of the work involved in this recount, payment based on 100 per cent of the charge for the original count can be made pending a decision on the recommendations from the returning officers.  He has been informed, also, that if he has not sufficient official funds on hands to make this payment <Col N="18" /> he can be put in funds immediately on application to my Department.</P>
    <P>The statement furnished to my Department by the returning officer does not indicate the actual number of enumerators engaged on the recount but gives the number of chargeable hours as 1,024.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands me completely.  The provision up to the 1963 Electoral Act was that for a recount 75 per cent of the original rate of charges could be paid, or rather, that was what was assumed would be adequate, but by reason of the experience we have had, we have asked the returning officers to let us know what they regard as adequate.  In the meantime, pending their report, I have authorised the returning officer involved to pay 100 per cent extra.  In other words, if a person earned £10 over the two to three days of the original count, he will be permitted to get another £10 for the recount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">

The experience has been that people have done this work and have not been paid for it.  Does the Minister not appreciate what would have happened had the staff been advised on the second day that the situation is as it is now?  They would have decided to go home on strike and they would have been fully entitled to do so. Surely, because of the fact they came in and did the work, they are entitled to be paid for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>The conditions of service provided that a successful candidate who prior to appointment as clerical officer had been three years or more at the maximum of his existing substantive scale would enter the higher scale at his existing substantive salary plus one increment on the higher salary.  They did not provide, as the Deputy's query implies, that he would not receive any increase if he had less than three years' service on the maximum.  On the contrary they provided that if the three years were completed at any time within a year of promotion an increment would be allowed from that date.  This arrangement was in accordance with the rules which applied to all promotions from one established position to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only significant difference between the Departmental regulations of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs relating to increases in pay on promotion on examination and the pay regulations applicable to promotions to general service grades in relation to competitions held as of April, 1952, was that the Departmental regulations provided for entry at existing substantive scale salary plus one increment on the higher scale in the case of an officer one year or more on the maximum of his former substantive scale while the general service regulations provided for the same benefit in the case of any officer three years or more at the maximum of his former substantive scale.  The Departmental regulations were accordingly more favourable than the general service regulations and did not operate to deprive a person of any increment for which he was eligible under the conditions of service for the competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the suggestion referred to by the Deputy and I am prepared, in exceptional cases, for example in areas where the <Col N="36" /> rates are unusually high, to make subsidy available to local authorities at a rate not exceeding 60 per cent, in respect of swimming pool projects. Each proposal will have to be examined on its merits.  I have, in fact, already approved of subsidy at the rate of 60 per cent in the case of one local authority in a western county.  I should hope, however, that my recent offer to make indoor heated swimming pools available at low cost will be of greater significance in promoting the provision of swimming pools than such increase in subsidy as may be forthcoming in exceptional cases.</P>

This figure, which relates to the year <Col N="37" /> ended 31st March, 1965, represents the average daily expenditure falling on the Exchequer per 1,000 recipients of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance taken together, after allowing for the fact that approximately two-thirds of the cost of unemployment benefit is borne on the contributions of insured persons and their employers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Widows in receipt of widows' pension do not normally suffer a reduction in pension on reaching the age of 70.  The investigation of means in connection with the old age non-contributory pension may show, however, in some cases that there has been an increase in means since the widow's pension was awarded, and in these cases a reduction in pension is inevitable. In addition, because of certain differences in the method of assessment of the yearly value of capital for widows' pension and old age pension purposes, some widows on reaching the age of 70 may be assessed with a higher income on their capital and so be entitled to an old age pension at a lower rate than the widows' pension which they previously enjoyed.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that, if it transpires there is an excess of ten to 20 per cent in the supply of turkeys over and above the domestic demand, there is grave danger of a catastrophic fall of prices for turkeys generally in the month of December?

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the position last year was that there was some doubt as to whether we would have sufficient for the home market or not.

      <P>Does the Minister not realise that, if we get a ten per cent or 20 per cent surplus in a market which has to be conducted for the five weeks before Christmas, we are liable to get a catastrophic collapse in prices, once the domestic market fails to absorb the entire output?

      <P>Correct.  There was virtually a shortage on the home market-certainly a supply only sufficient to meet current demand.  Add to that ten per cent or 20 per cent in that very short marketing period, and will the Minister not agree the price is bound to fall to the level of the export market at least and could, in a very short marketing period with a very perishable article, fall very much more steeply, to the advantage of the middleman but to the catastrophic destruction of the producer?

I should like to ask the Minister if he believes this is a trivial matter and does he want to see the small farmers of the country wiped out by high costs of production and low prices for their produce.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am asking the Dáil to do is to approve of two Control of Imports Quota Orders.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated which explains the main provisions of these measures.  Competition from low cost goods coming from certain countries became a matter of concern in 1963, consequent on the Government's decision to reduce industrial protection by progressive reductions in tariffs and increases in import quotas.  The countries concerned are those where production costs are low in comparison with western European standards or where export prices are artificially low because of State-trading practices.  When the Control of Imports (Amendment) Bill, 1964, was in the Dáil, my predecessor explained to the House that the purpose of the Bill was to permit selective action to be taken in relation to imports from such low cost countries, particularly in the textile field.  The present two orders have been made under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> Since it would not be feasible to distribute the quota appointed under the first of these orders, (Quota Order No. 51), owing to the wide variety of goods involved, the quota is being administered by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis that goods are charged against the quota as they are imported until the total quota is exhausted. It is not proposed to issue licences for made-up articles subject to restrictions under this Quota Order when the appointed quota has been exhausted.  It may, however, be necessary to license certain types of yarn.</P>
    <P>The Quota appointed under the second Order (Quota Order No. 52) is being distributed in the normal way to registered importers in relation to their over-all imports from the specified countries.</P>
    <P>These two Orders are designed to maintain imports of the selected commodities from the sixteen specified countries at their present over-all level, and are purely of a precautionary nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no objection to these motions.  Individual Deputies may wish to comment on their implementation and the problems this might give rise to.  In a general way, these Orders bring into line with other European countries our system of import controls on certain goods.  It is obvious that even if we agree that freer trade is necessary, we cannot have dumping here by countries who are not prepared to abide by international rules. There are low-cost countries where wages and conditions of labour are so very much below ours that we must take steps to preserve our own employment and our production.  It appears to me there will be no great difference between the approach of the Republic of Ireland to this situation and the approach of other European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we come more into line with other European countries, we shall incidentally be preparing ourselves for conditions of freer trade, and the operation of these Orders indicates that the Common Market itself, while it is a free trade area within itself, is a <Col N="71" /> restricted area as far as imports from outside are concerned.  The world is a very big place and the best we can hope for is that in western Europe conditions of trade will emerge which will allow a decent standard of living for workers and a reasonable margin for those who provide the work.  These Orders are an inevitable result of facts which had to be dealt with by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise only one matter with the Minister.  I notice that in relation to Quota No. 51, in the first Schedule, certain provision is made for made-up textiles, including bed-linen, towels and blankets.  Some time ago I had discussions with the Minister's predecessor on a problem affecting an industry in my constituency. I understand there are two industries in the country faced with this problem&mdash;one in Dún Laoghaire and the other in the north of Dublin, in Finglas, I think.  As a result of tariff reductions and the problems arising from these reductions, quite a substantial quantity of low-cost imports&mdash;possibly because of different costs of production which operate in places like Japan, Hong Kong and other low-cost producing areas&mdash;imports of part of the raw materials, or the base manufacturing commodities, were introduced here and both of the firms I have mentioned, who are operating in a similar way of business, whose quality of workmanship is of the highest standard, who gave good employment and who had not merely a satisfactory home trade but also depended to a considerable extent on a growing export trade, were adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, both from discussions I had with the Minister's predecessor and from correspondence I had with the Minister, that certain remedial action was proposed in order to alleviate the problems created for those firms.  I was approached on behalf of one of them but I understand the viewpoint expressed by that firm represents the views of both and that similar representations were made on behalf of the second firm.  I should be <Col N="72" /> obliged if the Minister would let us know whether the proposed quota application in respect of a number of firms is applicable to these commodities and will operate to ease the problem. I should like to know also if any other action is contemplated in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his very brief statement did not give us an indication as to what low-cost countries are, but I take it they are emergent countries, possibly the Afro-Asian States.  There is an agreement among the OECD countries as far as possible to buy from these States, to permit these States to export to OECD member countries in order to bring up the economy of these emergent States and to create a greater equilibrium of trade between the developed countries, such as those in Europe, and the Afro-Asian States.  We are a member of OECD and I wonder if we have entered into an agreement on those lines&mdash;whether we are to permit greater exports by these countries.  If the Minister has introduced this legislation &mdash;it is more a protective power than legislation&mdash;merely to control imports, he would perhaps elucidate the point.</P>
      <P>On one or two occasions at international conferences, I have heard this question discussed.  In the first instance, the OECD removed all duties on raw materials in order to enable those developing countries to build up their economies.  There was also a request to member countries to allow all permissible imports to help these emergent countries.  Perhaps the Minister would give some further information on this subject.</P>

      <P>In answer to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I am having the matter considered and am not in a position to answer him at this time.  The explanatory memorandum has a list of the 16 countries covered by the legislation.  If Deputy Esmonde would look at it, he will see they could hardly be described as emergent countries.  The goods concerned are low-cost because very low productive costs or artificially low costs have obtained as a result of State trading practices.  I do not think <Col N="73" /> the point raised by the Deputy comes into consideration on these Orders. Under the 1964 Act, selective action will be taken in relation to imports from such low-cost countries, particularly in the textile field.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister further clarify the position for me?  Am I to understand that this imposition is to prevent any manufactured material at all from coming in from those low-cost countries because naturally they are producing at a cheaper rate than we can?  Otherwise, this imposition of duties seems entirely meaningless.  These countries are obviously low-cost countries and are producing at a cheaper rate than we are producing, for reasons of lower wages, lower costs of production in every way and perhaps less taxation than we have here.  Am I to understand that this imposition of duties prevents anything from coming in from those countries or are we to allow them, as I mentioned in my short speech a few minutes ago, the benefits decided among the OECD countries because of their being developing countries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of Deputies.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm three Orders made during 1964, two of them under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962, and the third under the former Act only.  It is a statutory requirement that such Orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made, if they are not to cease to have statutory effect on the expiration of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of those Orders (No. 143) provided for (a) the reimposition of customs duty on metal domestic ornaments, metal cufflinks and polyethylene film, (b) the removal of the customs duty applicable to certain paper felt and (c) the deletion of certain Notes to the chapter of the Customs and Excise Tariff of Ireland <Col N="76" /> which deals with the duties on tools, implements, cutlery, spoons and forks. The need for these amendments arose as a result of the transposition of the old Tariff to the Brussels Nomenclature form of customs classification.</P>
    <P>The second Order (No. 144) was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture. It provided for the imposition of a customs duty of 5/- per lb. on all imports of certain preparations, derived partly from meat, and materials for the manufacture of such preparations. The need for this amendment also arose as a result of the change in customs classification.</P>
    <P>The third Order (No. 145) was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It enabled that Minister to assign to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Minister for Agriculure the power to issue direct to applicants licences for the remission of protective duties.  Previously that power had been vested in the Revenue Commissioners.  The change was introduced as part of the effort being made to streamline and expedite the procedures for customs clearance.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we on this side of the House approve of the legislation proposed and, of course, again it is merely the bringing of these matters in line with what will exist as far as outside duties are concerned when we move into the Common Market. It is right that we should come in line with the Brussels Nomenclature. Our customs duties and the phraseology and implementation of them should in fact fall into line.  That will stop a very considerable amount of difficult and detailed work when we reach that stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second Order I can see a situation whereby the Minister for Agriculture would recommend the imposition of a duty in that case of 5/- per lb. on imports of preparations such as are used in preparing meals and soups.  We are aware that the Sugar Company is now engaged in this work through Erin</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Foods.  There is an industry next door to where I carry on a small business myself which also is preparing these foods.  I might add that very often we are provided with a free smell of tomato soup from this factory which is very nice.  I had better not mention the brand lest Deputies should rush off to the restaurant and demand some.  However, I wish them the very best.</P>
    <P>The third change is the transfer of the power from the Revenue Commissioners to the relevant Ministers, that is, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, in respect of imports of meat preparations and goods for inclusion in these prepared meals.  I think it is also the right attitude because if you put something into the hands of the Revenue Commissioners, they must administer it in a most detailed way and there are many times in the course of ordinary trade when the Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the advice of the Revenue Commissioners, if they want to give him advice and his Department officials can, in a far more facile manner and much more quickly, make a decision.  Very often these decisions, if they must wait for Government officials to deal with or wait for six months, are out of date when made.  Apart from these matters this seems to be just a matter of legislation which must be passed here and it is only right that we should dispose of it with the least possible delay to the House so that we can all get home for the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The final matter to which Deputy Donegan refers is one of the most important in this measure because it is high time the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had power to issue duty-free import licences.  The Minister is getting very skimpy briefs recently, apart from the fact that he has given very skimpy replies to some Parliamentary Questions.  I think we need a little more information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 143 provides for the reimposition of customs duty on three or four very different articles, metal <Col N="78" /> domestic ornaments, metal cufflinks, and polyethylene film.  I should like to know the reason for this.  I do not know if we are being led up the garden path in recent years.  I think the Taoiseach is a bit confused as to what the position will be in regard to tariffs, quotas and trade generally.  Here we have Orders, one of which says that we are going to put certain duties on certain commodities and another says that we are going to take them off.  I thought the Government's policy was that we should move in the direction of gradually reducing customs duties. I do not say that we are 100 per cent in favour of that, in view of the fact that we still believe it is doubtful, to say the least of it, that we shall be in the European Economic Community by 1970.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary, therefore, to reimpose custom duty on these items? Is it because there have been some new establishments that will manufacture these things?  If that is the reason, let us know.  Is it that those who are manufacturing them here are finding difficulty in regard to the sale of their products and consequently in respect of employment or disemployment of workers?</P>
    <P>The second Order here is for the removal of a customs duty applicable to certain paper felt.  We must deduce from this that there has been a duty on a certain type of paper felt and now it is being taken off.  Is it because the firm or factory that produced this type of paper felt is not in a position to produce it, or has it gone out of existence?</P>
    <P>As regards (c) I should like to know exactly what it means.  Does it mean a new duty on these things?  What does it mean?  Does it mean that the Order for the imposition of duty or the continuance of duty must be changed in order to confirm some other sort of formula?</P>
    <P>I think we would all agree with the second Order which provides for a customs duty of 5/- per lb. on all imports of preparations derived partly from meat.  It is a good thing indeed that the Sugar Company have decided to engage much more than heretofore in the production of foodstuffs from <Col N="79" /> one of our biggest natural resources, meat.  The Minister must tell us a little more about these things before we decide finally that we are going to approve of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Corish thought I was too short-winded. The effect of Order No. 143 is, first, to restore a former customs duty on metal domestic ornaments, metal cufflinks and micromesh perforated polyethylene film.  The explanation of this is that following the introduction in January 1963 of a new code of excise tariffs for Ireland based on internationally agreed Brussels nomenclature and classification it came to notice that goods such as those to which I have referred had inadvertently become free of duty in the transposition from the old form of tariffs. The manufacturers of goods were anxious to have the protection which they had previously enjoyed, restored. That protection was removed unintentionally and this Order then restores them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told it is the whole Order.  As regards (a), the reimposition of customs duty on metal domestic ornaments, metal cufflinks and polyethylene film, I have just given the explanation which is that it restores a duty inadvertently removed. Saturated paper felt used in the manufacture of felt-based floor coverings was made liable to a five per cent Revenue duty for the sake of uniformity in the new tariff but since the material is not available from home sources, it was decided to remove the duty to facilitate home manufacturers of felt-based floor coverings.  That is (b).</P>

      <P>Not since, nor ever to my knowledge, but I have not specific information on that point.  Provision (c) relates to the deletion of certain Notes.  It was found by the Revenue <Col N="80" /> Commissioners that in practice Notes 5 and 6 to Chapter 82 of the new tariff, metal tools and implements, gave rise to difficulties and uncertainty and they considered the deletion of these notes would facilitate the administration of the tariff.</P>

      <P>I think we left off at the stage where the Minister was going to have another chat with Deputy Booth.  I have nothing more to say on this section.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was raising the point, which I think is a legitimate one, that in the case of a solicitor witnessing a will where the will has given the solicitor authority to charge his proper costs if he acts as executor or in the administration of the estate, that should not be regarded as a gift or bequest under the will but that, in fact, it be simply an authority to charge proper costs when earned.  By reason of legal decisions down the years, it has been regarded, in fact, as a gift.  It is anything but a gift.  The case has been made that in those circumstances the Minister might consider adding a subsection here to make it clear that such an authority should not be regarded as a gift under the will.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to expand on section 85. I am aware that it is a re-enactment of the present law but it does seem to me on reading the section as it stands that it might be worthwhile tightening it up a little bit.

      <P>It is really a restatement of the position.  I do not see how it could be tightened up.  It makes it quite clear that an obliteration, interlineation, or other alteration made in a will after execution shall not be valid or have any effect.</P>

      <P>I will draw the Minister's attention to a particular point I have in mind.  This section provides that an obliteration, inter-lineation, or other alteration made in a will after execution shall not be valid or have any effect.  That is perfect as far as it goes.  Then the phrase is used, &ldquo;except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration are not apparent&rdquo;.  Taking the section as far as it goes now, incorporating those words in it, it means, surely, that you can alter, interline or obliterate part of a will after execution for the purpose of making the words in the will apparent?</P>

      <P>I think that is dangerous.  This is a matter of interpretation and construction.  The alteration might be made for the purpose of giving meaning and effect to the wording of the will, or for some wilful or malicious purpose which would, in fact, have the effect of altering wrongfully the terms of the will.  I feel this section would be better if the words in lines 25, 26 and 27 were completely omitted.  If the words, &ldquo;except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration are not apparent&rdquo; were left out completely, everyone would be quite clear as to what the law is, that you cannot alter a will after it is executed and that if a person wants to make an alteration, if he has made a mistake or something like that, it is simply a matter of adding a codicil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My inclination is towards simplicity and commonsense in regard to this matter.  I think it is quite proper to set out, &ldquo;except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration are not apparent, unless such alteration is executed as is required for the execution of the will.&rdquo; In other words, any such alteration is <Col N="84" /> not valid except when the terms of the will are not apparent and by reason of the terms of the will not being apparent the insertion is put in writing to explain the terms of the will that are not apparent.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am misreading it.  The phrase &ldquo;... executed if the signature of the testator and the signature of each witness is made in the margin&rdquo;, does not refer to the phrase I am referring to.  So far as I can see, the section as drafted means that you may alter your will without any formality at all where the meaning is not apparent to give it meaning, and you do not have to take the precautions set out in the latter part of the section which you have to take in other cases.</P>

      <P>It may be.  The section reads: &ldquo;An obliteration, inter-lineation, or other alteration made in a will after execution shall not be valid or have any effect, except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration are not apparent, unless such alteration is executed as is required for the execution of the will&rdquo;. To my mind, that cannot refer to exceptions because exceptions have been dealt with.  There are two types of alteration that can be made.  An alteration can be made in a will for the purpose of making clear the meaning of the will.  That does not require to be executed in the same way as another alteration does.  That is why I think the section is dangerous.</P>

      <P>Every will shall, with reference to all estate comprised in the will and every devise or bequest contained in it, be construed to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears from the will.</P>
      <P>As the marginal note shows, the intention is to ensure that the will will, in fact, speak from the death of the testator.  I agree with this section. Again, as the marginal note shows, it is an extension of the 1599 Act, to over-rule Wild's Case.  We are solemnly asked to enact that section and in the self-same Bill, we are asked to adopt a scheme of succession in respect of testate succession as distinct from intestate succession where a will is obviously not going to speak from the date of the death of the testator but may or may not speak from a date which can be as long as 12 months after the death, depending on whether or not the widow decides to opt for her legal share as against the legacy in the will.  It is simply a comment.  I am not asking the Minister to answer.</P>

      <P>At the moment extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show what the testator meant.  It is not admissible in court to prove the intention of the testator if there is a dispute, except in regard to the form of the will.  If the terms of the will are vague and there is an inquiry in court to ascertain what the intention of the testator was, extrinsic evidence is not admissible.  Documentary or oral evidence of what he said or did not say at the time of making the will is not admissible to show intention, but I think it is desirable to permit that evidence to be given.</P>

      <P>This strengthens my belief that section 85 should be tightened up.  Now that this step is being taken to allow extrinsic evidence to be admissible in court&mdash;and I agree with this step&mdash;to clarify the provision in the will, the Minister should not hesitate to tighten up the wording in section 85.  I think the step that is being taken in section 89 is one that should possibly have been taken before.  It is worthwhile.  As the Minister knows, the general pattern in the courts has been that the intention of the testator was paramount.  Very often, while that rule was there, at the same time it was not one which could be carried into effect.  Cases of ambiguity might exist in the will which could be cleared up by the admission of extrinsic evidence.  Once that evidence was not allowed in, there was no way of clearing up the ambiguity.  This does improve the position and it is a section which is worth having.</P>

      <P>This subsection goes to the determination of whether or not a will complies with the law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what that means. The point has been made to the Minister on a number of occasions, in relation to the Bill, that you have at the moment a number of wills in existence that are in every sense valid wills, although some of them might not comply with the legal right provisions that are being incorporated into the law under this Bill.  Does section 106 mean that this Bill is not going to be retrospective or does it mean something else?  If it means something else, what exactly does it mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is retrospective because as the Deputy knows well, a will is not a legal instrument until the death of the testator.  My intention, in section 106, is to validate a will made, for example, by a person under 18 years of age.  Under existing law, a will made by such a person would be invalid.  We are now going to make such a will, if it is in existence, valid. That is just an example.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this Bill is not retrospective.  Does he or does he not mean that?  If it is not retrospective, it means it does not reach back to affect wills that were made before this Bill becomes an Act. If it does reach back and it affects wills already made, then this Bill is proposing legislation which will have a retrospective effect.  It seems to me that it is intended that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will operate retrospectively. I had no doubt in my mind <Col N="89" /> until I read this subsection which reads:</P>
      <P>In determining whether or not a testamentary disposition complies with a particular law, regard shall be had to the requirements of that law at the time of making the disposition, but this shall not prevent account being taken of an alteration of law affecting testamentary dispositions enables the disposition to be treated as valid.</P>
      <P>This says, in effect, as I read it, that in deciding whether a will is valid or not, you have regard to the law as it stands at the time the disposition was made.  You can also have regard to any alteration made in that law if the alteration in the law has the effect of enabling the will to be treated as valid; otherwise, you do not have regard to any subsequent alteration in the law.  Is that not so?  Subsection (2) says, irrespective of deciding whether a will is valid or not, you will have regard to the law as it stands at the time the will was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with wills that are at present in existence and that have been made before the law required any provision for a legal right for spouses to be catered for in a person's estate.  Will those wills be operative, as they stand, or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are valid wills and will continue to be so.  In the last analysis, the legal right is the amount of money which must be distributed by the executor out of the estate, irrespective of what is contained in the will by way of bequests or otherwise.  The provisions as to legal rights will not become operative for a due period of time which will allow people to study the matter. After this due period of time, when the Bill becomes law, that is, after the appointed date, the legal right will be in the same position as a debt is at the moment in relation to the estate.  Any will made at the present time which is valid can be executed and administered <Col N="90" /> and there is nothing in this Bill to render nugatory any existing will, or indeed any will in the future, which may not have made provision for a legal right.  But, after the appointed date, the legal right will be a debt which may be claimed by the surviving spouse within 12 months of the raising of representation.</P>

      <P>Surely the position after this Bill goes through will not be, as the Minister says, that no will will be rendered nugatory? That is a general statement which is putting it too far.  Surely the position is that existing wills, which do not provide for a third share, to put it in its simplest terms, or wills made hereafter which do not make that provision, while they would be valid as wills, will not be wholly operative.  In other words, they are rendered partly nugatory by this provision.  Is that not the position?</P>

That was the problem dealt with in the amendments and it did not seek to interfere with wills which were good, proper, just and were not undutiful or inofficious wills.  The Minister has pin-pointed the difference between us when he points out in the section we are discussing and in the other sections of this Bill that there will be retrospective effects.  Everybody's will will be dealt with, whether the will could honestly now be regarded as an inofficious will or not.</P>

Everybody in the House agreed that something must be done to improve the present situation regarding absolute freedom of testation.

      <P>The legal position is that a will is not a legal instrument at all until the testator dies.  It can be changed, amended or thrown out up to the time of the death of the testator. So this will only apply to wills in the future where people die after the appointed date, which will be the 1st of July of next year.

      <P>This section provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal right of a spouse may be renounced in an ante-nuptial contract made in writing between the parties to an intended marriage or <Col N="94" /> may be renounced in writing by the spouse after marriage and during the lifetime of the testator.</P>
    <P>It seems to me this is likely to create a certain amount of difficulty.  I do not think a section such as this should appear in the Bill at all once it is determined that there will be legal rights.  I can well imagine a situation arising&mdash;it has not arisen up to this because legal rights did not appear anywhere in our legislation&mdash;in which with, first, legal rights and, secondly, the existence of the second provision in particular in this section under which legal rights may be renounced if one partner succeeds in persuading the other to renounce them, a considerable amount of family acrimony and difficulty is bound to arise.  My recommendation would be that, if you are determined to have a system of legal rights, it is better to go through with it whole-hog rather than make the kind of provision there is here for legal rights with an addendum that, if one partner is able to persuade the other to renounce such legal rights, they may be renounced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Renunciation would surely take place only where there was considerable property.  I am sure ante-nuptial renunciation would take place only as a result of pressure, usually brought to bear by family lawyers, and such people.  This could lead to a good deal of ill-feeling.  In cases where there was no wealth at the time of marriage but wealth was subsequently accumulated difficulty and acrimony could be created.  This seems to put one section of the community in a different position from another section.  It does not, I think, make for good legislation.  On the face of it, my advice would be not to have it at all if you are going to have the legal right. I am not sold on the legal right.  I do not agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is an illogical position for the Deputies opposite to take, since this makes the whole system more flexible.  I have already emphasised my desire to make it as flexible as possible.  I have also emphasised the fact that the legal <Col N="95" /> right may or may not be exercised by the surviving spouse.  Equally, this right can be disposed of in a very simple manner during lifetime.  It is only in the case of an ante-nuptial contract that it must be formally in writing. It is only natural that a husband and wife would have a discussion about the property held by them and it is only proper that he or she should be in a position to renounce in writing after marriage.  Such writing is sufficient evidence of the legal right.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, a very sensible position. It would be unwise to hedge it in, in any way.  This emphasises the point I made before&mdash;that we will have a very flexible position in relation to the legal right when it becomes law.  The provision of the legal right will have the great merit of ensuring that the surviving spouse is treated justly.  The approach, however, should be flexible. That has been the situation in Scotland for many years.  I envisage very few situations in which the legal right will be exercised.  If, however, some arrangement is sought to be reached by the partners to a marriage during their lifetimes, then a simple statement in writing to the effect that one or other of them is not interested in exercising his or her legal right can be drawn up.  That scheme will give more flexibility, but, at the same time, it will ensure that essential justice is done to the surviving spouse who will be, in most cases, the widow.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Minister to misunderstand the comments made by Deputy Dockrell and myself.  We think the concept in this Part of the Bill is a bad one.  We think it will lead to trouble but, for good or ill, the House has decided in relation to legal rights.  We will have them and, in future, we will have to live with them.  That being so, I am anxious to avoid the practical difficulties I can see arising under this Bill. One of the difficulties is the creation of family bitterness and acrimony, which is likely to arise under this section if a man or woman wants a system of testamentary disposition which is being taken away under this Bill.  The only way a widow, for example, could <Col N="96" /> get that back would be by trying to persuade the other spouse to renounce his legal right share.  I do not think one needs to be a prophet to see the type of acrimony this is likely to generate in family circles.</P>

      <P>That is No 1. No. 2 is that the Minister says this is introduced in order to allow flexibility and make things easier; in order, in other words, to tone down.  From the point of view of the effect of what he has done in earlier sections, that may be all to the good from the point of view of the case the Minister makes, but it will give rise to practical difficulties. One of the practical difficulties will be the withdrawal of a renunciation of a legal right made under this section.  According to the section, all that is necessary in order to renounce such a right is to write a note saying: &ldquo;I renounce it&rdquo;.  Supposing a person renounces it today and withdraws the renunciation tomorrow, what then will be the position?  Is the renunciation final?</P>

      <P>I agree a person is protected in court where there is fraud or undue influence. Here one is dealing with family matters and rights.  What the Minister is doing here is interfering in family life in relation to special family and personal considerations.  The Minister is coming in with a sledge-hammer to interfere with this.  I do not believe it is possible or workable.  But, following up what the Minister is trying to do, I think it would require a Solomon sitting in judgement to decide where influence starts to become undue in the case of spouses.  That is not going to be an easy matter at all.  Simply because a man and his wife are living together in a house and neither wants to risk a break on this question of legal rights and if the husband suggests to the wife she should renounce her legal rights under section 112 in order to avoid a row, will that be considered by the courts as undue influence?  There is no precedent for this on which the courts can rely as a guide.</P>

      <P>The courts inquire into the family circle where some deed is made making provision for the widow, which the widow subsequently disputes.

      <P>It may be that that is the criterion there, but the number of cases to which the Minister refers are very few and far between. This is an open invitation to family rows and acrimony.  That is my objection to it.  That is one of my objections to the whole set-up the Minister is operating under this Part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point.  The last four lines of this section provide that the renunciation in writing can be made only during the lifetime of the testator.  That again seems to run counter to the general provision the Minister wants to make here, that the surviving spouse shall have 12 months to decide whether or not to take the legal right share.  Apparently, if the surviving spouse, on the day after the testator dies, decides he or she will renounce the legal right share, that renunciation under this section will not be a valid renunciation.</P>

      <P>One section must be taken with another.  There is no point in putting into this section something that is going to clash with something in another section.  My query with regard to the last four words in this section is whether or not a renunciation made a day, a week or a month after the testator dies is going to be regarded as invalid or no renunciation at all, or will it be taken, as I believe it should be taken, as a renunciation of the legal right share and an election not to take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  There are two separate procedures.  Section 112 is concerned with (a) ante-nuptial <Col N="99" /> contracts, where there is agreement to renounce, and (b) where either spouse during the lifetime of the other agrees to renounce simply in writing.  Section 114, to which we will be coming, deals with an entirely different situation which arises when the testator has died, where within 12 months after the taking out of representation, the surviving spouse may or may not claim.  It is not a question of a renunciation; it is a question of whether or not the spouse elects to claim the share.  These are two entirely different procedures.  What we are concerned about here is the position that operates when the partners are alive.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is just the word I was going to use. They are looking at life through rose-coloured spectacles.  You would possibly find both of them very anxious to renounce every right and give it over to the other.  But, with the slow stain of life, they may change very much.  I think, without being cynical or anything like that, it is unfair to hold them to that.  There has been, and frequently is, great bitterness on account of ante-nuptial contracts made in a whole variety of different ways. The Minister should just think about the ante-nuptial provision and whether he should include it.</P>

      <P>This is another one of these sections that is likely to constitute a trap for testators. It is all very well for the courts to say <i>ignorantia juris non excusat</i>&mdash;ignorance of the law is no excuse.  As the Minister in his professional capacity knows as well as I do, while the general outlines of the law may be known to people, the technical details, such as those being established in this Bill, are not known to the vast majority of people.  It is not every testator who has the opportunity of having his will drawn up by a solicitor or of discussing the ins and outs of it with a solicitor before he signs it. Every now and again wills have to be made in a hurry.  A person, as a result of leaving it too late, finds himself on <Col N="101" /> his death-bed and wants to make a will, or a person is involved in an accident of some sort and feels that it has become a matter of urgency to make his will and he decides to make it there and then as best he can.  Very often in these cases there may be some particular provisions the testator has on his mind which he wants to settle and perhaps he is not particularly concerned about other extraneous details.</P>
      <P>Under section 113 (1), it is provided:</P>
      <P>Where a devise or bequest to a spouse is expressed in the will of a deceased person to be in addition to the share of the spouse as a legal right, that share shall, for all purposes (including determination of the size of any estate as to which the deceased died intestate), be deemed to be a devise or bequest under the will.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
      <P>In any other case a devise or bequest to a spouse shall be deemed to have been made in full and final satisfaction of his legal right.</P>
      <P>I want to take the case of the spouse who, after this Bill has been passed, is aware of the provision that the spouse is entitled to a legal right share of one-third and who wants to do better than that, who wants to leave more than the legal right share of one-third, and at the same time to make other dispositions in the will and not make a simple will leaving everything to the spouse but something over one-third of the legal right share.</P>

    <P>To my mind, it is most unlikely that unless a solicitor is called in to advise the testator, that person is going to be familiar with the provisions of subsection (1) of section 113.  The odds are that the person will make his will leaving a bequest to the spouse under the impression that that bequest will go to the spouse over and above the legal right share of one-third but under the Bill as it stands, that is not so unless it is expressed to be in addition to the legal right share.  That is my complaint against this section. Unless a person is advised in his will <Col N="102" /> by a solicitor that he must express any bequest to his spouse as being in addition to the legal right share, then the position is that the bequest is going to be taken as being made in full and final satisfaction of the legal right share.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is the guidance of the court in interpreting wills in the future. It is an interpretation section and it is essential to lay down the guide lines so that the court will be quite sure in its interpretation in the future. It is quite clear in subsection (1) that where a devise or bequest to the spouse is expressed in the will to be in addition to the share of the spouse as a legal right, that share shall for all purposes be deemed to have been devised or bequeathed under the will.  Where the devise or bequest is not so expressed, it will be deemed &mdash;under subsection (2)&mdash;to have been made in full and final satisfaction of the legal right share.  I think that is clear enough.</P>

      <P>Exactly; it is crystal clear.  From the drafting point of view it is a most praiseworthy section. There is not a comma wrong.  It is absolutely clear but the ordinary testator is not going to know a word about this, unless he is advised by a solicitor.  I am thinking of the testators who do not have an opportunity of being advised by a solicitor.  What is their position?  This is not only a question of interpretation for the guidance of the courts.  This is going to apply to wills, whether they go into court or not.  It is entirely wrong for the Minister to say that this is simply laid down as a guiding line for the courts.  It is no such thing.  It will apply to all wills, and if a man makes a bequest to his wife in the will and does not express in the will that that bequest is over and above the legal right share, then what is the position? The widow will have the option of electing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are going to defeat that by means of this section.  I would suggest to the Minister that in legislation of this sort we should not put the onus on the testator.  We should not legislate against the widow as we are doing here, and if the Minister wants to bring in a provision of this sort, then it should be put the other way around and should be worded that unless the contrary intention is expressed, the widow will get both the bequest and the legal right share.

      <P>It is quite flexible as it stands.  It is a matter for the surviving spouse to opt for either the legal right share or the bequest, and it is open to the testator to give the widow, say, all his estate, or nine-tenths of the estate, or eight-tenths, or seven-tenths of the estate, whatever he wishes.

      <P>The Deputy, I think, is drawing a long bow in this matter.  We have made this very flexible.  As the Deputy knows, originally there was rigidity, if you like, in that the testator could not give everything to his widow.  Now it is being provided that he can give what he likes.  He can give all his estate or any share of it.  1536 The widow may opt for the legal right or for any other sort of arrangement she wishes.

      <P>Take a simple example.  Supposing there is some item of particular sentimental value to a particular family and a man makes a will deliberately in the knowledge that his wife is entitled to a legal right share of one-third and he deals with two-thirds of his property, for practical purposes, in the knowledge that his wife will get one-third anyway.  Supposing then he leaves an object which might or might not be of particular value.  Is it not the position that the wife must take that object, which might be of sentimental value to the couple but of no great money value?  She may take her legal right share but then she cannot take the particular bequest?</P>

The testator must know of that condition and must in his will express it to be in addition to the legal right share.  That is the whole point of my argument with the Minister.  If he had put it the other way and said that unless a contrary intention is expressed, the widow could take both, I would agree.  What he is doing is forcing the testator to express in his will in respect of any bequest to the widow that it is over and above the legal right share.  If the testator does not know that is in the Act, if he is <Col N="105" /> not familiar with the Act, if he has not a solicitor or if his solicitor does not advise him of it, then he will go wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister will see that is an extremely weak argument.  It does not prevent the testator giving a bequest to his wife in addition to the legal right share, but it can, and in many cases will, interfere with his doing that because if he does not know he must express in the will that it is in addition to the legal right share, then the wife will not get both, even though it might have been the testator's intention that she should get both.  If he does not know the effect of subsection (1) of section 113 and does not take the precaution of setting it out in his will that the bequest is in addition to the wife's legal right share, she will be in the position where she cannot have both.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan's query is based on the point at <Col N="106" /> issue here.  Take the example he gave. I do not see why a testator should do it because it would be a tortuous way of leaving an estate.  Supposing he did it on the basis of leaving his wife two-thirds by will and then let the Act operate to give her the other third by legal right, she does not get the whole or two-thirds.  She must make a choice unless the husband is familiar with the exact wording of the Bill.  He must express that the two-thirds are in addition to the legal right share.  If he forgets to do that or does not know he has to do it, then she does not get both.  It is not a question for the courts.  It is a question for us to settle now.</P>

It would be, as I have said, an extremely tortuous way for a testator to act.  I am interested in the ordinary testator who has not an opportunity of being advised by a solicitor when making his will.  He makes a bequest to his wife without expressing that it is to be in addition to her legal right share.  In such a case, the wife, despite the intention of the testator, will not get the bequest he left to her because he did not know it was necessary to express in his will that the bequest was to be over and above the legal right share.  It would not weaken the Minister's position to put it the other way around and say that in such circumstances the spouse will take the bequest in addition to the legal right share unless a contrary intention is expressed in the will.  That would be far fairer in the ordinary course of events.  If a man or woman goes to the trouble of making a bequest in a will, <Col N="107" /> it is because he or she wants that bequest to become operative.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is drawing a long bow.  If it is necessary, I shall tighten the drafting of this.  This gives a guide line to the courts to interpret such a will, which I regard as being a very unlikely type of will.  The normal type of will leaves property from one spouse to the other in whatever way the testator wishes and, if the surviving spouse is not happy with the will, she will insist on her legal right share.  She can elect to take whatever else she gets in the will.  However, I shall have a look at it.</P>

They will operate, when they become law, on wills, whether those wills go to court or not.  If a solicitor is advising an executor of a will, the solicitor must advise him in accordance with the provisions of this Bill when it becomes law.  That will be irrespective of any question of the will going into court.  He will have to advise the executor&mdash;in the case of a bequest made to a widow and not expressed in addition to the legal right share&mdash;that in such a case the widow can take only the bequest in full satisfaction of the legal right share and that she cannot take both.</P>

      <P>In any other case a devise or bequest to a spouse shall be deemed to have been made in full and final satisfaction of his legal right.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, in order to get the real meaning of section 113, you must read it with section 114.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear on that.  I think there is no doubt about it.  You will find that if a testator leaves in his will a devise or bequest and expresses it to be in addition to the spouse's legal right and for certain purposes it is to be deemed a devise or bequest under the will, then, to get that meaning you must go to section 114.  Here again, I am in difficulties and I should like the Minister to resolve them.</P>
      <P>Let us pause at that point in section 113 (1).  If an additional benefit to the legal right is given by the will then, when we come to section 114, we read: &ldquo;where,... there is a devise or bequest to a spouse,...&rdquo; and, going back to section 113, it says: &ldquo;Where a devise or bequest to a spouse....&rdquo;.  That being so, it goes on to say that a spouse may elect to take either that devisory bequest or the share which is the legal right.  In section 113, it is that legal right, plus; in section 114, she must elect.  Is there not something wrong there?</P>

      <P>If the testator expressly states, for example: &ldquo;I am leaving her a sum of £1,000 and that is to be over and above her legal right&rdquo;, that is now labelled in section 113 (1) as being a devise and bequest under the will.  To find the effect of that, you go to section 114 (1) (a) which says <Col N="109" /> that the spouse may elect to take either the additional devise or the legal right.  Surely there is something wrong there, seeing that, under section 113, she is entitled to both?  Section 114 seems to take one or the other but not both.</P>

All I am afraid of is that the use of the words &ldquo;in full and final satisfaction&rdquo; may do damage to somebody.

      <P>This section has, in fact, been considered now with section 113 and I do not intend to add to the discussion other than call the Minister's attention to the way in which this is drafted.  I may be wrong but it seems to me that there is a difference between the rights of a widow where the deceased has died wholly testate, as is provided for in subsection (1) and the case where a person dies partly testate and partly intestate.  The type of case we were referring to under section 113 was the type of case where a man died wholly testate and, consequently, as Deputy Costello pointed out, we would seem to be giving a person something extra under section 113 and taking it away under section 114 (1).  I am wondering is section 114 (3) intended to plug the gap Deputy Costello was referring to where a person's bequest is less in value than the legal right.  It does not seem to me to be fully expressed there but I think it was possibly intended to cover that kind of case.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points I should like to raise on this.  The last few lines of the subsection make a very long sentence which it is often very difficult to construe.  The object of the section, apparently, is that if the testator has made whole or partial provision for his wife in his lifetime under some arrangement or other, then that is to be brought into account&mdash;and this is what I want the Minister to explain&mdash;&ldquo;for the purpose of (and only for the purpose of) determining the size of the estate out of which that share is payable&rdquo;. Surely, there must be some other purpose?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does not say that.  It is commonsense that this must be the case but the section does not say it.  It says &ldquo;for the purpose of (and only for the purpose of) determining the size...&rdquo;, not for the purpose of determining to what extent, the amount, the size or the nature of the provision is sufficient in whole or <Col N="114" /> in part to satisfy the legal right.  I am afraid that if you say it is &ldquo;for the purpose only&rdquo; you may exclude everything else, without intending it.</P>

      <P>That is what it says but if it is for that purpose there must be some object in section 113 other than determining the size of the estate.  You must, first of all, know what you are to take into account.  But it does not go on to say what is the effect of that.  There may not be a lot in this point but it strikes me as peculiar that there should be a limit inserted in such emphatic language, &ldquo;for the purpose of (and only for the purpose of)&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is a case that I have cited before and if I am not wearying the Minister too much I want to put this matter to him.  Take the case of a person, whose wife has gone insane during his lifetime.  He makes what he deems to be at the time full and ample provision for his <Col N="115" /> wife to be looked after medically, surgically, in nursing and maintenance and at the time that was apparently perfectly good provision and, perhaps, good even yet.  It is obvious that this person cannot elect, whether there is any right of election or not &mdash; having regard to other sections, I do not know.  The husband is faced with the difficulty that he has made ample provision and if he has to give the legal right share, it may be a very big sum of money.  She cannot make a will and the money will go to all sorts of people, perhaps, people in Australia, people he never heard of, next-of-kin. Perhaps it is one of those cases of which we say that hard cases make bad law, but we have an opportunity here of providing for specific cases. This is a case when the husband has had a very hard life and has done his best for his wife.  Will he have in addition to that to give the legal right share, or what is the effect of this?</P>

      <P>I have an actual case.  I know of one case where the person is still alive.  That is the case I referred to.  I have tried to make the case so that the identity of the person would not be revealed.  Although ample provision for the comfort, care, maintenance, medical, surgical and nursing attention for the rest of the life of this person was made, if something is not done about that&mdash;and I admit I find great difficulty in giving specific assistance as to how it could be done&mdash;the effect will be that a big amount of money will have to be given to satisfy the estate.  So this person may never deal with it and it will go to the next-of-kin, all over the world perhaps.</P>

I could follow this if this section went on with another subsection to say that such advances that had been made would be taken either in whole or in part in satisfaction of the legal right share.  It would seem to me to make some sense then.  But, what it says now in effect is that if a man has already made permanent provision for his spouse, that provided he has done that before the commencement of this Act then the provision which has been made is going to be collared for the purpose of determining the size of the estate and of ascertaining the amount of the one-third fixed legal right share.</P>

I will not guarantee to do it but it appears to me at the moment that the way to do it is to delete the words in brackets in subsection (1).  I will look at it, because the intention of this section is precisely to meet the sort of case at the moment where you <Col N="117" /> have, by way of separation deed or otherwise, arrangements entered into between parties to marriage contracts. It is intended, where such permanent arrangement has been made by one spouse in respect of another, that that should be in discharge of the legal right, so that the additional legal right duty is not placed on the spouse who has by deed, such as I have mentioned, made provision for the other spouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point that I should like to raise in connection with section 116.  The Minister and myself have both at different times expressed the view that in dealing with this kind of family matters it is right that the court should be enabled to hear them in private. In the amendments which I proposed and which were not accepted that scheme was proposed.  The Minister himself has accepted it in relation to the children's shares.  Section 116 deals with the case where a testator has reason to believe that the spouse will not be a fit person to take responsibility for the legal right share which he or she is getting and, accordingly, appoints a trustee to handle the share for the spouse but it goes on to provide that the surviving spouse of a deceased testator who has so appointed trustees of the share of the spouse may apply to the court to set aside the appointment.  That I agree with.  Then it goes on:</P>
      <P>and the court, unless satisfied that the surviving spouse is not a fit person to be entrusted with the management of the property concerned, may set aside the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That makes it quite clear that the question to be determined by the court, in fact, the only question to be determined by the court, under this <Col N="119" /> section, is whether or not the surviving spouse is a fit person.  Under the section as it stands it would seem to me that that is an application, that is a discussion and that is a decision that must be brought, met and taken in open court.  It might be desirable to follow the same pattern as appears elsewhere in this Bill to enable the application for children, for example, to be taken <i>in camera.</i></P>

      <P>Will the Minister look at subsection (3) of this section and explain what the scope or intention of the subsection is?  Subsection (3) as it stands at the moment provides:</P>
      <P>The court, on the application of the surviving spouse, may vary the terms of the trust.</P>
      <P>In what respect?  Does that give unlimited authority and power to the court to do anything they like?  I can imagine certain judges saying, &ldquo;Have we got any direction from the legislature as to the principles on which we are to vary this trust?&rdquo; We have no clear idea of the terms of the trust or why it should be varied.

      <P>What is the trust?  You go to section 116 subsection (1) and you find that a testator may appoint a trust corporation or any two or more persons to be trustees of any share of the estate to which his spouse may become entitled as a legal right.  In other words he can appoint by his will certain persons to be trustees of one-third but the wife is entitled to that one-third.  What are the trusts?  There are not any, as far as I can see, although further on you <Col N="120" /> can see that the court may vary the terms of the trust.  I cannot see that there are any trusts except that either the persons or the trust corporation holds the legal right, which is normally the one-third, for the beneficiary, the spouse.  There is no trust attached to that.  What are you varying? Apparently, the testator has no power to create trusts attaching to the legal right to which the spouse is entitled absolutely without any trust. What are you varying?  I cannot see any trusts.  There are very wide powers to vary nothing.</P>

      <P>The section does not say so.  I wonder has this been thought out or am I all wrong? The position as I understand it is that under the previous section the widow of a testator is entitled to one-third of the estate as a legal right.  Let us take a simple position.  She is entitled to get that and to do anything she likes with it.  No one can manage it for her.  It is hers, and unless the Minister gives additional power in this section, which is not given expressly, to deal with the case of a person who is not capable of managing her property, the trustee can do nothing except hold it for her in trust and pass it on to her.  She is entitled to get it.  If a publichouse is part of the assets, it will have to be sold, because she is entitled to one-third of the business.  That is the position under the Bill at the moment.  One-third of the business must be realised out of the estate of the deceased to furnish the widow, to take the simple example, with her legal right of one-third. She is entitled to get one-third and in order for her to get one-third, the publichouse or the business has to be sold.</P>

      <P>That is precisely my point.  The trustee has no power to do anything to interfere with the widow's right to one-third.  That is hers absolutely under a previous section.  This section does not enable any trustee to do anything except act as what was known in my student days as a bare trustee of the property.  He can do nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but it does not do that.  The position is that the widow is entitled absolutely to her legal share and no one can stop her from getting it under the previous provisions of the Bill.  The testator cannot reach down after his death and try to control her, even if he thought she was not a good business person. He cannot do that.  There is nothing in the section that enables him to do it.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, the position under the Bill is that the widow is entitled to a share of one-third without any tags, strings or trusts.  She is entitled to that within a certain period of the death, and when probate has been taken out, she can sue for her share of one-third. If you say that you appoint a trustee, all he can do is hold the share in trust for the wife.  I am not too sure if the Minister should put this provision in at all.  All I am saying is that it is not in.  All the trustee can do is pass over the property to the widow.</P>

      <P>Another subsection which upends the whole section, and which I cannot understand, is subsection (2) which provides:</P>
      <P>(2)  The surviving spouse of a deceased testator who has so appointed trustees of the share of the spouse may apply to the court to set aside the appointment and the court, unless satisfied that the surviving spouse is not a fit person to be entrusted with the management of the property concerned, may set aside the appointment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Booth is not here to discuss this section.  I have not got my copy of the Official Report with me but my recollection is that when we were discussing amendment No. 24 in my name, he described it as too incredibly vague.  If ever such a description was warranted, I think it is warranted by the phrases used in section 117.  I have no doubt that the House understands and agrees that the Minister's intentions here are good.  They are intentions with which the majority of Deputies would agree.  What does he do in subsection (1)?  This subsection says:</P>
      <P>Where, on application by or on behalf of a child of a testator, the court is of opinion that the testator has failed in his moral duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now going into the field where courts of law are being invited to decide on questions of moral duty. That is a matter which the courts have not been required to decide <Col N="124" /> heretofore.  They have been required, and obliged, to deal with questions of a person's strictly legal duty.  Here we have a requirement on the courts to decide on a person's moral duty. How are the courts to decide on that?</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister&mdash;I think we all agree with him&mdash;that there is a moral duty on a testator to make adequate provision.  Our job here is to impose on him a legal duty which the courts will be able to interpret and enforce, in addition to the moral duty which we do not place.  We have nothing to do with whether he has a moral duty or whether he has not. If he has a moral duty, it is there, quite apart from anything we say or any legislation we enact.  We are concerned at present with imposing a legal duty which the courts can interpret and can enforce.  The subsection goes on to say if he &ldquo;has failed in his moral duty to make proper provision for the child in accordance with his means&rdquo;.  That was virtually the same phrase as I used in my amendment.  I did not say &ldquo;in accordance with his means&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;reasonable, having regard to his means&rdquo;.  Deputy Booth contended that my phraseology was too incredibly vague.  I invited him, at the time, to state whether he had the same objection to this but the Chair decided it was not the time to discuss it.</P>
    <P>This subsection goes on to say:</P>
    <P>the court may order that such provision shall be made for the child out of the estate as the court thinks just.</P>
    <P>I agree we should set up this machinery.  This is machinery which I have been recommending all along. It is machinery for application to the courts in cases of injustice and cases where an unfair will is made by the testator.  We should set up such machinery but this section does not set up that machinery.  If there is anything, to use Deputy Booth's phrase, &ldquo;too incredibly vague&rdquo;, surely subsection (5) of this section is?  This subsection states:</P>
    <P>Rules of court in relation to the procedure on applications shall be so made as to ensure that the proceedings <Col N="125" /> are conducted as informally and inexpensively as possible.</P>
    <P>I know what the Minister wants to do but in subsection (5) he is merely expressing a pious aspiration of what he wants to do.  We should be concerned here with putting into our law, and, in particular, into this section, the actual machinery, to use the Minister's phrase, as far as possible spell out here what the procedure is to be.  If it is left in this vague and general phrasing that is used in subsection (5), it is very much on the cards, no matter what procedure is subsequently adopted, that somebody who has nothing better to do will go to the courts and argue that it could have been more informal and more inexpensive and that there could have been more acceptable procedure.  They could say that because the Minister is not providing for the most informal and most inexpensive procedure, the procedure which he is providing is bad.  That argument can be made when you say &ldquo;rules of court in relation to the procedure of applications shall be so made&rdquo;.  We are imposing this duty in the rules when we say that the proceedings shall be conducted as informally and inexpensively as possible.  If someone challenges the rules, when they are made, and says: &ldquo;you have provided in these rules that an application can be made <i>ex parte</i>&rdquo;, surely it would be more informal to provide that it can be done by writing a letter instead of going into the courts.  Surely that is more informal procedure.  It certainly would be less expensive procedure as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be far better advised to give it more precisely rather than do what he proposes.  He should do something on the lines of the amendments we tabled to this Bill. He should set out the actual machinery which is to operate.  We proposed in our amendments that these applications should be brought by notice of motion.  We set out the powers which were to be given in the notices and we set out the time and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>It is a matter of opinion.  You have matters set out very fully in the rules of the workmen's compensation procedure.  It can be done by the rules.  I would suggest the Minister should study the matter away from the generality in subsection (5).</P>
      <P>I now want to deal with the provisions of subsection (7) of this section.  My remarks also relate, although we have passed it, to subsection (4) of section 114.  This is the provision whereby a period of 12 months is to be allowed for making these applications.  A period of 12 months will also be allowed, in the case of a spouse, to exercise her right of election.  I am not entirely happy about this from a practical point of view.  I agree that adequate and ample time must be given to a person who is getting rights of election, the rights of going into a court and making an application.</P>
      <P>It is only reasonable that such people should be given adequate and ample opportunity of knowing their rights, of getting to know what happened in the will and of taking legal or other advice as to whether or not they should make their application. That is reasonable but the other side of the picture is the side that will give considerable concern in practice. Once this Bill becomes an Act, in practice, executors will not be able fully to administer the estate.  They will not be able to distribute the assets until the period of a year is up, until they are quite satisfied that a child will not bring an application under subsection (7) of section 117.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that here you have a kind of tug-of-war between the interests of the children, on the one hand, the duties of the executor on the other and the interest of other beneficiaries.  I would suggest to the Minister, even though the amendments which I proposed were not accepted by the House, that he should consider adopting something on the lines of the amendment we proposed in relation to applications.  I would think six months is probably sufficient, but if the Minister wishes to have it at 12 months, let that be, but <Col N="127" /> provision should be made for cases where a reasonable degree of urgency exists to have an estate administered, or there might be a question of urgency in regard to a particular beneficiary getting his or her benefits under the will.</P>
    <P>Some provision must be made for distributing the assets in cases of urgency without having to wait the 12 months provided for in the section. The most convenient way of doing that is to provide that the executor serves a notice on all parties interested in the estate, the next-of-kin, children or beneficiaries, through the Probate Office that he proposes to administer the estate and to distribute the assets in accordance with the terms of the will after the expiration of, say, 30 days.  In the cases where such a notice is served, anyone who wants to bring an application or has a right of election to exercise should bring that application or exercise that right of election within a given period which will be shorter than 12 months.  I would suggest that one month would be adequate after the notice has been served and the urgency has been demonstrated.</P>
    <P>I would think it is of considerable importance that the Minister should do something about this; otherwise, there will be a complete slowing down in the administration of all estates, not only large estates where delays of one sort or another might be encountered, but in the smallest of estates when a grant of probate is involved, where a person dies testate.  It would be placing an intolerable burden on executors generally and on the beneficiaries who are waiting for their share in that they should be held up, even though there might be urgency, for 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I take a different view from that advanced by Deputy M. J. O'Higgins on subsection (7) of this section.  I should like to deal, first of all, with the question of the moral right referred to in section 117 (1).  It is stated in that section that &ldquo;Where... the court is of opinion that the testator has failed in <Col N="128" /> his moral duty to make proper provision for the child&rdquo;.  If Deputy M. J. O'Higgins's suggestions are accepted, I am afraid that there will be great difficulty in working this subsection in court.  I can imagine questions being put to me, as one was put to me within the past fortnight in court by a certain judge, such as: &ldquo;I got no direction from the Legislature as to how I should carry out this subsection; how do you say I should carry it out? Where is the moral duty? Can you tell me what this section refers to when it refers to the moral duty?&rdquo; My answer would be that it is stated in the subsection.  A judge might say: &ldquo;It merely says it is the moral duty&rdquo;. &ldquo;Tell me what the moral duty is of a parent to provide for his children&rdquo;. &ldquo;Is it the natural law?&rdquo;&ldquo;How am I to start doing this?&rdquo; A judge who wants to be difficult may go along these lines with considerable effect.  I think it might be preferable to state that there is a legal duty to look after the children. We can then go on with the section as it stands.  I am afraid there will be play made with the words &ldquo;moral duty&rdquo;.  I am in favour of the section and what is behind it straightaway and generally in favour of what is intended.</P>
      <P>On subsection (5), which has been referred to by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, it might not be necessary for the Minister to do what Deputy M.J. O'Higgins suggests but it might possibly be the best thing to do.  There are many precedents in matters of this kind on the Statute Book where words like those have been taken: &ldquo;Rules of court in relation to the procedure on applications shall be made so as to ensure the hearing and the determination of the matters herein in a summary manner.&rdquo;  Rules of court will be made on the words &ldquo;in a summary manner&rdquo;.  I think that would be enough here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly subsection (6) appears to me to be quite inconsistent with subsection (5).  Having said there would be low costs the person who makes the application in all cases has to pay costs except in exceptional circumstances. I think one could suggest that <Col N="129" /> subsection (6) should leave it to the discreation of the court.  What is intended here is to safeguard a child who has been badly treated by his father.  A lot depends on the attitude of the particular judge before whom the application comes.  If he takes the view and says to a child: &ldquo;You should have stuck it out with your father; he died worth £10,000 and did not give you anything; you should have acted differently; you are, therefore, not entitled to anything&rdquo;.  That is a possible point of view by a judge of Victorian ideas.  That unfortunate child must pay costs unless there are special reasons, and special reasons are few and far between in the matter of costs.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should leave the matter of costs to the discretion of the judge.  It is putting it too strongly in my view to say that the applicant in all cases shall be liable for costs.  That is the general rule in all cases in court except in jury actions.  In jury actions the judge has no discretion and, except in matters of penal character, the applicant must bear the costs.  The normal practice is that, if you lose your case, you pay the costs.  In cases covered by this section a judge, although he would have to refuse the application, would have to do it with some reserve and, therefore, he should have power to deal with the matter of costs at his discretion.</P>
    <P>As regards 12 months, it is strange how a section impinges on different minds.  I thought that the 12 months was too short and I was going to ask the Minister to extend it.</P>

      <P>The whole of this section deals with a testator, who according to the child, has not treated the child properly.  That child may have been put out of his home.  He may have had to go to Australia, New Zealand, America or anywhere else, and may not hear of the will after his father dies.  He may be trapping <Col N="130" /> rabbits in the wilds of Canada in the winter and go back down south in the spring or summer, and may not even then hear of it.  I am thinking of a child who does not know his rights. Anyhow I have no great belief in solicitors taking out the administration of any estate inside three months.</P>

      <P>Because they often get themselves into a mess and have to get counsel to get them out of it.  It is very often the Estate Duty Office which is at fault, if you can call it a fault.  When an estate, however small, goes into the Estate Duty Office for the assessment of duty, it is kept for months.  They give it the most thorough and searching examination. They send out all sorts of queries.  Very often that is what causes the delay.  I had a case in court today in which that has happened.  There was urgency about it and the Estate Duty Office was holding it up.  That is why 12 months is right, I think, for an executor to pay legacies.  It is the abnormal thing for an estate to be wound up in 12 months.  I know of very few cases in which that has happened. There is consequently a case for giving the court power to extend the time.  My experience of statutory inflexible times is that they create injustices.  I do not think there should be any time limit at all.  Certainly, it should be a reasonable time limit and there should be power in the courts to extend the limit because of special circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing that all estates should be wound up or administered within 12 months.  Possibly Deputy Costello has missed my point.  I am talking about cases which should be distributed as a matter of urgency, even if it is only a percentage of the available assets <Col N="131" /> to a particular group of beneficiaries; it might be vital to distribute some part of the assets speedily.  As anyone who is familiar with the administration of assets knows, it is often possible now, where there is no question of a residual account having to be filed, to make an advance to beneficiaries out of the assets.  As long as this provision remains I do not think that can be done in future.  No executor will be safe in distributing any of the assets for 12 months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello has spoken, quite rightly, from the point of view of the deserving child who has been unfairly treated and unfairly disinherited.  I agree that the Legislature should show every consideration in such cases. There is, however, another side to the picture.  There is the person who has been a bad son and the person who has not been badly treated by his father's will, but who is a bit of a rotter and wants to get more. He will use this section to blackmail the executor, who may be his mother. He will say: &ldquo;Very well; you administer the estate and distribute the assets at your own risk.  I am going to bring an application to the court&rdquo;.  He can keep that up for 12 months and, so long as the 12 months' limit is here, the mother, who is the executor, or any other executor, will not be safe in dealing with the estate.</P>
      <P>We suggested in our amendment that there should be a period of six months.  If notice in writing were given by the executor through the Probate Office to the people interested so that there could be no question of a person not knowing his rights, then the application would have to be brought within a month of the giving of that notice.  That would have the effect of telescoping the whole procedure in cases of urgency.  We also provided in our amendment that the court should have power to extend the period of six months.  The actual wording of the amendment proposed by us was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of six months may be extended if the court thinks fit and is satisfied that at the time of the application for extension a substantial <Col N="132" /> part of the assets of the deceased is still under the control of the personal representative or in the hands of a beneficiary but in the event of any such extension being granted the personal representative shall not be held liable or accountable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the expiration of the said period of six months.</P>
    <P>I agree with part of Deputy Costello's argument in so far as it relates to the deserving child who has been unfairly treated.  We should, I think, lean over backwards to facilitate that person and I do not mind whether there you take six months or 12 months but, whatever the period you take, you should give discretion to the court in the circumstances outlined in the amendment to extend the time.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely concerned with the other side of the coin also.  I am concerned with the case of the undeserving person who can hold up the distribution of any portion of the assets until the 12 months expires.  In the case of large and complicated estates it is probably the exception rather than the rule to have them fully administered inside 12 months.  I am not talking now about fully administered or fully wound up estates.  I am talking about distribution which can take place in the course of administration. In any event, the 12 months runs from the taking out of the grant; in other words, the 12 months starts running only after the estate has been dealt with by the Estate Duty Office, estate duty has been paid, probate papers have been presented, probate fees assessed and paid, and the grant issued.  There is plenty of room, I think, for the Minister to look at this section again from the point of view of giving power to extend the time and from the point of view of having machinery under which in urgent cases the time can be foreshortened.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy O'Higgins. He answers my objection.  If the notice he seeks is given then, of course, the matter will be all right.  The person will be put on notice.

      <P>I shall take the subsections <i>seriatim.</i> First of all, with regard to moral duty in subsection (1), moral duty is, I think, sufficiently well spelled out there.  It is the moral duty which the testator fails to discharge by making proper provision, in accordance with his means, for the child.  We are now making it a legal duty subject to court interpretation. The reason why we use the phrase &ldquo;moral duty&rdquo; is because there is already a core of precedents along this line in New Zealand.  That was where this idea of moral obligation was first initiated.  Moral duty is read into the New Zealand legislation by the courts there.  The British Privy Council have also taken decisions along these lines.</P>
      <P>There is, as I say, a core of decisions in an equivalent jurisdictional system of law which can be adopted for our use if questions of interpretation arise. This is in New Zealand law.  I do not see anything wrong with transposing it here especially as we have spelled out what moral duty means.  This moral duty now becomes a legal duty. This enables the courts to make a legal decision on the moral duty to make proper provision.  I would not be disposed to changing that, having regard to the fact that we have this interpretation in New Zealand and in decisions of the British Privy Council. This concept has, as I have said, been read into the New Zealand Act.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (5), with regard to the making of rules of court, I am adopting Deputy J. A. Costello's suggestion to simply say &ldquo;...to ensure that the proceedings are conducted in a summary manner&rdquo;.  That appears to be better than the present phrase &ldquo;as informally and inexpensively as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thought behind subsection (6) is to discourage frivolous applications by children who may be well done for&mdash;the child Deputy O'Higgins referred to who comes back again at the mother and who has already been amply provided for during the course of the life of the testator.  I think it is <Col N="134" /> more desirable to discourage that type of application rather than to meet Deputy J.A. Costello's point of view, which was to provide that such an applicant would get his costs at the discretion of the court.</P>

      <P>In my view, the more likely sort of case in practice&mdash; the case we have to lean against, so to speak&mdash;is the case of the wrong headed son or daughter who makes a claim although he or she has no real ground for doing so.  We must have a certain amount of certainty in this matter.  It is important, from the point of view of the proper administration of estates, that there be a degree of certainty and that you cannot have frivolous claims being brought.  There should also be a a definite time limit.  Indeed, what has been said by Deputy J.A. Costello and Deputy M.J. O'Higgins strengthens my view that 12 months does not lean unduly harshly in any direction.  In practice, most estates are not fully administered in anything like that period.  At the same time, to extend it, as Deputy J. A. Costello seems to have a predeliction towards doing, would hold up administration unduly. We are giving a new right here and I do not think we should be too liberal with it.  There has been criticism of the introduction of legal right for the widow and spouse and the system of court application for the children.  As I say, these are new rights and I think 12 months is fair enough when we are bringing in a new system.  I would be disposed not to be over liberal by extending it, and I certainly would not be disposed to reducing it.  In practice it is not an unreasonable period of time.  The actual administration of estates will not be held up. because preliminary details in regard to the administration will be going on during the 12 months.  I do not see, therefore, any serious hold-up occurring or wrong being done.  I could see Deputy O'Higgins's point if there was any question of extending it beyond the 12 months, but I think 12 months <Col N="135" /> is about the right sort of period for a matter of this kind.</P>

Portion of the property is a house.  After this Bill comes into operation it will not be possible to vest the house in the beneficiary until after the 12 months is up.  Although it could, in fact, in the particular estate I am talking about be done, ordinarily speaking, within a week of the grant issuing, because all that is necessary is the assent of the executor.  That will have to be held up now for 12 months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>Before section 119, but in Part X, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A sane person who has feloniously killed another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other.</P>
      <P>(2)  A sane person who has feloniously attempted to kill another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other except as regards a bequest or devise in the will of that other made subsequent to such attempt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point in this amendment is one that was raised by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan on Second Reading.  Section 119 is the section which, according to the marginal note, deals with the exclusion of persons from succession.  It provides that people falling into certain categories will not under any circumstances be entitled to take a share by succession to the deceased.  One of the classes is referred to in the following subsection:</P>
      <P>A sane person who has feloniously killed or attempted feloniously to kill another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that where a sane person feloniously kills another it would be entirely wrong that that person who so killed the other should be entitled to benefit by his action of murder.  But the section goes on &ldquo;or attempted feloniously to kill another&rdquo; Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the point on Second Reading that while that is the existing law on the subject it precludes any question of forgiveness.  If a person makes an attempt on another's life and that other person afterwards, in the course of time, decides he will leave to the person who attempted to <Col N="137" /> kill him something under his will, why should the Legislature interfere with that action of forgiveness?  Why, in the circumstances where the will is made subsequent to the attempt, should we step in and interfere?</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to enable the argument advanced by Deputy Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan</i>) to be considered further on Committee.  There does seem to be something in it.  In the last section but one we were talking about moral duties and surely we should have some room for moral virtues also in this Bill and the virtue of forgiveness is one that we should not, by our legislation here, completely rule out in these cases.</P>

      <P>Before section 120 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;120.  (1)  This section applies to a disposition of property (other than a testamentary disposition or a disposition to a purchaser) under which the beneficial ownership of the property vests in possession in the donee within three years before the death of the person who made it or on his death or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  If the court is satisfied that a disposition to which this section applies was made for the purpose of defeating or substantially diminishing the share of the disponer's spouse, whether as a legal right or on intestacy, or the intestate share of any of his children, or of leaving any of his children insufficiently provided for, then, whether the disponer died testate or intestate, the court may order that the disposition shall, in whole or in part, be deemed, for the purposes of Parts VI and IX, to be a devise or bequest made by him by will and to <Col N="139" /> form part of his estate, and to have had no other effect.</P>
    <P>(3)  To the extent to which the court so orders, the disposition shall be deemed never to have had effect as such and the donee of the property, or any person representing or deriving title under him, shall be a debtor of the estate for such amount as the court may direct accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4)  The court may make such further order in relation to the matter as may appear to the court to be just and equitable having regard to the provisions and the spirit of this Act and to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>(5)  Subject to subsections (6) and (7), an order may be made under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the interest of the spouse, on the application of the spouse or the personal representative of the deceased, made within one year from the first taking out of representation,</P>
    <P>(b)  in the interest of a child, on an application under section 117.</P>
    <P>(6)  In the case of a disposition made in favour of the spouse of the disponer, an order shall not be made under this section on an application by or on behalf of a child of the disponer who is also a child of the spouse.</P>
    <P>(7)  An order shall not be made under this section affecting a disposition made in favour of any child of the disponer, if&mdash;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(a)  the spouse of the disponer was dead when the disposition was made, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the spouse was alive when the disposition was made but was a person who, if the disponer had then died, would have been precluded under any of the provisions of section 119 from taking a share in his estate, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the spouse was alive when the disposition was made and gave her consent in writing to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> (8)  If the donee disposes of the property to a purchaser, this section shall cease to apply to the property and shall apply instead to the consideration given by the purchaser.</P>
    <P>(9)  Accrual by survivorship on the death of a joint tenant of property shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a vesting of the beneficial ownership of the entire property in the survivor.</P>
    <P>(10)  In this section `disposition' includes a <i>donatio mortis causa.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the re-drafting of section 120 in order to meet certain points made by Deputy O'Higgins and other parties who made representations to me on the matter. One of the criticisms made by Deputy O'Higgins on a previous occasion was that, by allowing dispositions other than those for full valuable consideration to be upset in certain circumstances, the section would give rise to substantial title difficulties.  The point was made that it would be difficult for a solicitor investigating title to prove that full valuable consideration was paid in a particular transaction and that, if the consideration fell short, even by a small margin, of what could afterwards be shown to be the full market value of the property, the transaction might be upset.  Having considered the matter, I am satisfied that there is some substance in this criticism and I have attempted to meet the situation by deleting the reference to &ldquo;full valuable consideration&rdquo; and providing instead that the section will not apply to a disposition made to a purchaser.  The term &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;, as defined in section 3, means a person who in good faith acquires an estate or interest in property for valuable consideration; and &ldquo;valuable consideration&rdquo; means consideration in money or money's worth.  If, therefore, a disposition has been made for money or money's worth to a person acting in good faith&mdash;in other words, if it is a genuine business transaction&mdash; the disposition will not come within the terms of section 120.  I think this meets the point made by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met my point fully in his amendment. I suppose it would be churlish not to acknowledge that and possibly more churlish to raise another point, but while the Minister has dealt with my point of full value and the question of the conveyancing difficulties that would have arisen, there is another point that has been brought to my attention today by a country solicitor and I think I should bring it to the Minister's attention for consideration. It is the case, we will say, of a father who gives a field or a building plot on his land to a son to enable him to build a house.  He may do that obviously if he has the consent of his wife, but in order to prove title, it would be necessary for the spouse actually to join in the conveyance. Supposing a man does it even by way of advancement to the son to enable him to build a house and gives him a small plot of ground with it and supposing he does it during his life without the consent of his spouse, a case arises then where it is going to be extremely hard for that man to prove his title, particularly in dealing with solicitors for, say, building societies or banks or people of that sort.  I do not fault them for this: it is their job and they must go into all these cases of title with a magnifying glass.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the particular case put to me to the attention of the Minister.  This solicitor writes to me:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real point that occurred to me, however, was in relation to the situation where a father wishes to give a site for building purposes to a son, perhaps without the consent or approval of his wife.  Under subsection (2) (a) of section 120 the title would be, to an extent, perfected by having the spouse sign a consent but without the consent of the spouse the title would be wholly unacceptable for three years because it would be impossible to establish that the disposition was not part of a larger transaction which would have the effect of disinheriting the spouse or children.  This type of transaction is very common, particularly in the country, but I believe the title would be unacceptable to either a Building <Col N="142" /> Society or a County Council Law Agent who would be giving a small dwellings loan.  It may be difficult to draft a provision which will protect Building Societies or lending bodies while still providing that the legal right shall attach to some tangible property because the mortgage moneys would form part of the property which would be available to the mortgagee to sell if the sum due on foot of the mortgage were unpaid.</P>
    <P>He goes on to suggest that an amendment might be introduced to deal with it.  That was a viewpoint concerning the section as it stood previously but it is equally true in respect of the Minister's amendment.  I do not know whether the Minister can surmount it but it does seem to be the kind of case where it might be desirable to leave some freedom.  Obviously, it is not the intention of the Legislature to discourage any man during his life from giving a building site or a plot of ground to members of the family, perhaps to a son who is getting married and wants to stay in the neighbourhood and possibly continue helping on the farm, and at the same time have his own home.  It is not desirable to discourage that.  At the same time, even under the amended section, it would be difficult for that man to use the place as security.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to appear unco-operative, but this Bill, by its very terms, will not come into operation before July, 1966. It does not seem to me, therefore, that there is any great urgency to take the Report Stage before the Summer Recess.  The Minister, all credit to him, has given the Bill very searching consideration in Committee and has possibly gone out of his way to meet a number of the points raised which he has agreed to consider.  I cannot see the Minister giving the consideration they deserve to those points if we are to take the Report Stage this day week.</P>

      <P>Tairgim go léitear an Bille an Tarna hUair.</P>
      <P>Faoi mar atá leagtha amach sa Pháipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge, is é aidhm atá le beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht gníomhaíochtaí oiriúnacha eacnamaíocha a spreagadh agus a fhairsingiú agus cúrsaí sóisialacha a fheabhsú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag na daoine a chónaíonn sa Ghaeltacht, agus arb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáthurlabhra, chun fostaíocht shochrach a fháil agus caighdeáin réasúnta mhaireachtála a bheith acu. Tá sé ráite sa Pháipéar Bán chomh maith go bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis a chinneadh go gcaithfidh Gaeltarra Éireann bheith ina phríomhghléas chun gníomhaíochtaí eacnamaíocha de chineál tionsclaíoch a fhorbairt i ngach limistéar Gaeltachta.  Is chun a chur ar chumas Ghaeltarra Éireann an cúram sin a ghlacadh air féin a ullmhaíodh an Bille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann mar bhord reachtúil faoin Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta, 1957, agus tá sé ag gabháil do bhréidín, earraí cniottáilte, bróidnéireacht agus bréagáin a tháirgeadh sa Ghaeltacht.  Luach timpeall £725,000 de na táirgí sin a díoladh sa bhliain 1964-65.  Timpeall 780 oibrí atá i bhfostaíocht lánaimsire i bhfoirgnimh le Gaeltarra agus fairis <Col N="145" /> sin tá suas le 1,000 i bhfostaíocht pháirtaimsire ina dtithe féin; tuairim is £350,000 a íocadh leo mar phá sa bhliain 1964-65.  Tá monarchana nua tógtha agus feabhas curtha ar mhodhanna oibre ag Gaeltarra agus tá méadú ag teacht de réir a chéile ar líon na bhfostaithe agus ar luach na ndíolachán i gcoitinne.  Is féidir a rá, mar sin, go bhfuil eager maith anois ar Ghaeltarra chun na tionscail atá idir lámha aige cheana féin a chur chun cinn.  Tá gá le tionscail eile, áfach, chun tuilleadh fostaíochta a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is é cuma ina raibh an scéal go dtí seo go mbíodh ar Ghaeltarra Éireann gníomhú ina aonar ach beidh ar a chumas feasta&mdash;faoi alt 3 den Bhille seo&mdash;páirt a ghlacadh le daoine eile chun tionscail agus scéimeanna somhaoineacha fostaíochta a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.  De dhroim na cumhachta nua seo tá súil againn go n-éireoidh le Gaeltarra a áiteamh ar thionsclaithe fiúntacha, a bhfuil eolas teicniúil agus teacht ar mhargaí acu, gurbh fhiú dóibh bheith páirteach i bhforbairt na tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I gcás comhlachta a bhunóidh tionsclaí dá leithéid sin i gcomhar le Gaeltarra Éireann, beidh cumhacht ag Gaeltarra, le toiliú an Aire, deontas a thabhairt chun tionscal oiriúnach a fhorbairt agus, chomh maith leis sin, páirt ghníomhach a ghlacadh i reachtáil an tionscail ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  I gcás mar sin ní bheidh aon deontas le fáil ón bhForas Tionscal ach, más mian le héinne tionscal a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht gan dul i gcomhar le Gaeltarra Éireann, féadfaidh sé deontas a lorg ón bhForas Tionscal go fóill mar a dhéantar faoi láthair.  Ní miste a lua go bhfuil rannóg taighde agus forbartha ag Gaeltarra cheana chun tograí a bhreithniú le haghaidh tionscal nua a bheadh oiriúnach lena mbunú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht agus cabhair chuige sin a thabhairt do dhaoine, gan dul i bpáirtíocht leo, beidh cumhacht ag Gaeltarra Éireann deontais suas go dtí £2,000 a chur ar fáil.  Cé nach mbeidh mórán airgid i gceist in aon chás ar leith díobh siúd, <Col N="146" /> tá tábhacht nach beag leis an gcumhacht seo ar an ábhar go gcuirfidh sí ar chumas Ghaeltarra ceirdeanna agus tionscail bheaga a chothú ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar a thábhachtaí atá na cumhachtaí breise atá á dtabhairt do Ghaeltarra Éireann, measadh go rachadh sé chun tairbhe don Bhord líon na gcomhaltaí a ardú ó chúigear go dtí seachtar.  Tá sé sin á dhéanamh in alt 4 den Bhille.</P>
    <P>Níor leor cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt do Ghaeltarra Éireann gan cumas airgid a thabhairt dó chun na cumhachtaí sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá an cumas sin á thabhairt in ailt 6 agus 7 den Bhille.  Faoi na hailt sin, saorfar Gaeltarra ón dliteanas atá air chun aisíoc a dhéanamh i leith luach na sóchmhainní &mdash; £700,000 &mdash; a aistríodh chuige nuair a bunaíodh é i 1958 agus i leith méid na n-airleacan&mdash;£355,000&mdash; a tugadh dó roimh 1 Aibreán, 1965. Ina theannta sin, ní bheidh air na hairleacain a thabharfar dó feasta a aisíoc go dtí go mbeidh brabús ar a ghníomhaíochtaí.  Is le haghaidh gnóthaí caipitil a thugtar na hairleacain atá i gceist.  As an bPríomh-Chiste a íoctar iad agus is cabhair iad de bhreis ar na deontais bhliantúla a thugtar do Ghaeltarra as Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta. Tá uasteorainn £500,000 leis na hairleacain faoi Acht 1957 agus tá an teorainn sin á hardú anois go dtí £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Tuigfidh an Dáil óna bhfuil ráite agam go bhfuil réim fhairsing chumhachta agus soláthar fial airgid á dtabhairt againn do Ghaeltarra Éireann faoin mBille seo.  Is fíor a rá go bhfuil saoráidí speisialta, nach bhfuil a leithéid ag aon chomhlacht Státurraithe eile, á gcur ar fáil do Ghaeltarra anois.  Nuair a bheidh an Bille ina Acht cuirfidh sé tús le ré úr forbartha i ngnóthaí Ghaeltarra Éireann; tabharfaidh sé cumas nua feidhme don eagraíocht sin; tabharfaidh sé uchtach do chomhaltaí an Bhoird agus dá lucht oibre; agus tabharfaidh sé deiseanna saothraithe agus misneach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>D'fhógair an Rialtas sa Páipéar Bán go spreagfaí Gaeltarra Éireann chun <Col N="147" /> feidhm dhearbhfhóinteach a dhéanamh le tacaíocht chaipitil ón Stát d'fhonn dlús a chur leis an tionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Is léir ón mBille seo go bhfuil an gheallúint sin á comhlíonadh anois agus go mbeidh cumhachtaí agus airgead go leor ar fáil do Ghaeltarra feasta.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Ba bhreágh liom a chloisint ón Rúnaí Parlaiminte go raibh súil aige go raghadh an t-airgead atá á chur ar fáil anois chun tairbhe na tíre. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar limistéirí na Gaeltachta do leathnú de bhárr na ndeontas seo.  Ní dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte aon rud faoi sin.  Tugaim fé ndeara nár dubhradh rud ar bith faoina teoranacha atá ann faoi láthair. Cad tá beartaithe faoi limistéirí na Gaeltachta amach anso nó an bhfágfar iad mar atá siad i láthair na h-uaire?</P>
      <P>An féidir leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a rá cé acu tá an Ghaeltacht ag dul i méid nó ag dul i laghad?  Cad mar gheall ar líon na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht? An bhfuil líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge ag dul i méid nó ag dul i laghad?  Is ceisteanna iad siúd nár mhiste don Rúnaí Parlaiminte iad d'fhreagairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is fánach airgead a chur ar fáil le h-aghaidh na h-oibre seo muna bhfuil daoine sa Ghaeltacht nó muna ndéanfar iarracht an Ghaeltacht a leathnú. Caithfear labhairt na teangan a leathnú ach, chomh maith leis sin, ní mór iarracht a dhéanamh cainteoirí Gaeilge do choimead sa Ghaeltacht agus féachaint chuige go mbeidh saol sona sásta acu agus deis acu a slí bheatha a bhaint amach.  Sin é, dar liomsa, cuspóir an Bhille seo.  Beidh a thuille airgid le fáil ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Nuair a bunaíodh an chomhlucht seo bhí súil ag gach éinne go raghadh sé chun tairbhe na tíre agus go bhfásfadh sé.  Is fíor nár éirigh leis an gcomhlucht chomh maith i rith na bliana seo caite agus gurab áil linn. Sa Bhille nílimid ag iarraidh ar an gcomhlucht as so amach an t-airgead a íoc ar ais.  Nár bhfearr a rá anois go bhfuil deontaisí iomlán á dtabhairt <Col N="148" /> agus go gcuirfear ar ceal an chuid sin den phríomh-Acht ina bhfuil trácht ar airgead d'aisíoch.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh fónta ar an obair seo agus go raghaidh sé chun tairbhe mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tionscal an bhréidín, tionscal na mbréagán agus mar sin de, conas tá siad ag dul ar aghaidh? Dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go raibh ardú ar dhíol na n-earraí seo i rith na bliana seo caite.  Cad é an feabhas atá tagtha ar chúrsaí agus an bhfuil aon mhéadú ar an líon daoine atá ag obair sna tionscail seo?</P>
    <P>Cad na thaobh go gceapann an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go mbeadh sé níos fearr don Ghaeltacht líon na mball atá ar an mBord do mhéadú?  An ionann sin is a rá nach bhfuil an taithí is gá ag an mBord atá ag gníomhú i láthair na h-uaire nó an amhlaidh a cheapann an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go ndéanfaidh na daoine go nglacfar leo as seo amach obair níos fónta ar son na Gaeltachta?</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é tionscail bheaga nua a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.  Gan amhras, do dhéanfadh a leithéid cuid mhaith tairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. An féidir leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a rá linn an bhfuiltear chun &ldquo;co-operatives&rdquo; a chur sa Ghaeltacht? An bhfuil ar intinn ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte déanamh mar a dhein an tAthair McDyer i nDún na nGall?  An bhfuil sé ar intinn aige deontaisí a thabhairt chuige sin?  Cén saghas deontas a bheidh le fáil maidir le h-earraí talamhaíochta?</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil gá le breis airgid do sholáthar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Go dtí seo, ní raibh na deontaisí a bhí le fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus na deontais a bhí le fáil le h-aghaidh cúrsaí tionscal mór go leor chun na daoine do choimead sa Ghaeltacht.  Má chabhraíonn an Bille seo chun an Ghaeltacht do leathnú, beidh áthas orainn go léir.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud atá ag déanamh buartha do gach éinne go bhfuil líon na nGaeilgeoirí ag dul i laghad.  Tá súil againn go leathanófar labhairt na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre ach ní h-ionann sin is a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag <Col N="149" /> dul i méid agus go bhfuil saol sona sásta ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Má chuidíonn an Bille seo leis an scéal sin a leigheas agus más féidir leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte an méid sin a dhéanamh beidh moladh aige dá bharr.  Tá a fhios againn go léir sa Tí seo agus ag gach éinne an tsuim a chuir sé sa Ghaeltacht riamh anall.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  Cad iad na limistéirí atá in aigne ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte?  An bhfuil sé ag cuimhneamh ar aon leathnú nó caolú a dhéanamh orthu?  Cén fá go gceapann sé gur gá ballraíocht an Bhoird do mhéadú?</P>
    <P>Táimid ag tabhairt an £2 milliún seo mar dheontas don Ghaeltacht agus nach bhfuil brabús i gceist.  Níl i gceist anso ach cabhair a chur ar fáil don Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis na limistéirí Gaeltachta, tá siad sin go fóill faoi mara bhíodar faoi Ordú na Limistéirí Gaeltachta, 1956.

      <P>Níl aon rud im aigne go fóill maidir leis sin.  Rinne an Teachta tagairt don líon daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil an daonradh ag dul i laghad le blianta fada.  Táimid ag iarraidh stop a chur leis sin.  Táimid ag iarraidh an teanga agus an cultúr Gaelach a shábháil ag an am i láthair nuair atá fórsaí Gallda ag brú níos láidre ná riamh ina n-éadan tré mheán na telefíse, an radio, agus araoile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táimid ag iarraidh staid eachnamaíochta agus staid sóisíalach na ndaoine a fheabhsú agus a neartú faoi dheacrachtaí nach dtiocfadh le muintir <Col N="150" /> na hÉireann, taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, a samhailt fiú amháin. Agus mar bharr orthu sin uilig tá deacrachtaí síceolaíochta ann fosta a thaispeánann dúinn nach freagra iomlán ar an gceist seo obair amháin a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Ach fiú má admhaím go bhfuil na deacrachtaí sin ann, agus sílim gur fearr a aithint go bhfuil siad ann, creidim go dtig linn an Ghaeltacht a shábháil má chuireann muid chuige i ndáiríre, idir muintir na Gaeltachta féin, Roinn na Gaeltachta, Gaeltarra Éireann agus gnáth-phobal na hÉireann, ar mhaith leo a dteanga féin a shlánú.  Is urra an Bille seo dár ndea-rún.</P>
    <P>Maidir le líon na gcomhaltaí ar an mBord, ní mór cuimhneamh go bhfuil eagsulacht mhór in imeachtaí agus cúramaí an Bhoird, mar tá déantusaíocht, ceard-obair, margaíocht, tréanáil teichneoirí, agus araoile, agus ba mhaith liom, chomh fada agus is féidir é, go mbeadh comhaltaí ann a bheadh oilte sna gnéithe éagsúla.

      <P>Céim mhór ar aghaidh i gcúrsai Leasa Shóisialaigh sa tír seo is eadh an Bille gur cúis áthais dom a chur ós bhúr gcomhair anois.  Mar is léir do Theachtaí ón mheamram míniúcháin a cuireadh ar fáil dóibh séard atá ann sa chéad áit na forálacha is gá chun feidhm reachtach a thabhairt do na méadaithe tathagacha a fógraíodh sa Cháinfhaisnéis i rátaí sochar agus pinsean árachais shóisialaigh agus freisin i rátaí pinsean seanaoise, daille agus baintrí neamh-ranníocach agus cúnamh dífhostaíochta.  Sa dara háit tá foráil ann leis an dteorainn ioncaim chun árachais éigintigh faoi na hAchtanna Leasa Shóisialaigh a árdú ó £800 go £1,200 i n-aghaidh na bliana. Sa triú áit tá forálacha tábhachtacha ann a bhaineann le módh nua chun acmhainn sealbhóirí feirmeacha beaga i gceantair cúnga d'áireamh i gcomhair cúnaimh dífhostaíochta.  Ina dteannta sin tá roinnt feabhsanna éagsúla ann ar na scéimeanna árachais shóisialaigh agus chúnaimh.</P>
      <P>Forálann an Bille go bhfaighidh na pinsinéirí neamh-ranníocacha uilig sean-aoise, daille nó baintrí, nach mó ná £26-5-0 a n-acmhainn bliaintiúil, 10/- breise i n-aghaidh na seachtaine agus go bhfaighidh an chuid eile de na pinsinéirí 5/- i n-aghaidh na seachtaine. Tá uas-ráta pinsean neamh-ranníocach dilleachta dá mhéadú freisin do réir 5/- i n-aghaidh na seachtaine.  De thoradh na méadaithe seo pinsean is féidir arís leathnú ar na teorainneacha bliantiúla acmhainne agus na rátaí pinsean i dtreo 's go mbeidh ráta breise ag an bpointe is ísle de gach scála iníoctha le daoine nach raibh ach díreach taobh amuigh den teorainn acmhainne d'aon phinsin go nuige seo.</P>

    <P>The Bill which it is now my pleasure to put before the House marks an important step forward in the field of social welfare in this country.  As Deputies will have seen from the explanatory memorandum circulated with the text of the Bill, it includes, in the first place, the provisions necessary to give legislative effect to the decision announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech on 11th May last to give substantial increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions, and also in rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance.  Secondly, <Col N="154" /> it includes provision for implementing the decision announced some time ago to increase the income limit for compulsory insurance under the Social Welfare Acts from £800 to £1,200 a year.  Thirdly, it contains important provisions concerning a new method of assessing means for purposes of unemployment assistance in the case of smallholders in congested areas, and, finally, it provides for a number of miscellaneous improvements in existing social insurance and assistance schemes.  The result of all these provisions will be an increase of £9.53 million in the gross expenditure on Social Welfare in a full year and this represents an increase of 19.3 per cent on the gross expenditure on Social Welfare&mdash;exclusive of administration costs&mdash;provided for in the Estimate for my Department which was passed prior to the General Election and is now before the Dáil again.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a lengthy one and Deputies will note that the explanatory memorandum issued with it is much more detailed than has previously been the case.  I have had this done in an attempt to meet the complaints of Deputies during the course of the debate on last year's Bill that they had difficulty in understanding and following amending legislation of this nature which necessarily must be by reference to the existing Acts.  My aim has been to make clear, as far as possible, what each amendment really does, where the text itself is not self-explanatory. I trust, therefore, that Deputies will find the memorandum useful in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Budget increases on the social assistance side, which it is proposed to bring into operation as from the beginning of August next, will provide an extra 10/- a week for all existing non-contributory old age, blind or widow pensioners whose yearly means do not exceed £26 5s. 0d. while all the remaining pensioners will get an increase of 5/- a week.  It is estimated that some 71,000 persons who are old age or blind pensioners will qualify for the 10/- increase and 41,000 for the 5/- increase.  There are at present just under 99,000 persons in receipt of the maximum rate of <Col N="155" /> non-contributory old age or blind pension so that almost 72 per cent of these will qualify for the new maximum. The remainder, of course, will get the 5/- increase.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that some 11,000 widows will obtain the 10/- increase, that is, 63 per cent of those at present getting the maximum, the remainder getting the 5/- increase.  The maximum rate of orphan's non-contributory pension is also being increased by 5/- a week.  As a result of these increases in pension, it is possible again to extend the scales of means and rates of pension in each case so as to add an additional rate at the minimum of each scale which will be payable to persons previously just outside the means limit for any pension. This means that the scale for an old age pensioner without child dependants will be extended to £156 15s. 0d. and therefore a married claimant without child dependants can have means of £313 10s. 0d. and still qualify for the minimum rate of old age pension. The means limit, of course, increases for each child dependant.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assisance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by 5/- a week for the recipient himself.  A further 5/- will be payable where there is an adult dependant.  This increase in rates of unemployment assistance will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance by equivalent amounts.</P>
    <P>These are substantial increases in social assistance payments both relatively and in the absolute.  They have the added virtue that the greater increase goes to persons in the greatest need as measured by the existing means test.  In addition, of course, the policy of extending the schemes to cover people who were previously just outside the means limit, which has been carried on over the years, is continued.</P>
    <P>The increase in payments in social insurance benefits will become operative at the beginning of January next, and will provide an extra 10/-a <Col N="156" /> week for recipients of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity benefit, widow's contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance and old age (contributory) pension, with an additional 10/- a week where an adult dependant's allowance is payable with the pension or benefit.  These again are substantial increases and represent a major improvement in the scheme.  The extra cost will be paid for, as are all insurance benefits, by contributions from employers, insured employees and the Exchequer.  The increase in the rates of social insurance contributions necessary to meet the employer's and employee's share of the extra cost of these increases, together with the cost of an increase in maternity grant from £2 to £4 provided for elsewhere in the Bill, will be 2/10d. a week in the ordinary rate of contribution for male workers.  This will make that rate 14/8d. a week, which amount will be shared equally by the employer and worker.  Increases in the rates of contribution for other classes will be 2/10d. where all the insurance benefits are insured against, the appropriately lesser amounts where some only of the benefits of the scheme are insured against.</P>
    <P>The effects of increased levels of remuneration generally arising from successive rounds of pay increases over the past few years, on the social insurance scheme have been evident for some time.  Increasing numbers of persons who are employed otherwise than by way of manual labour were reaching levels of pay which were in excess of the limit which made them compulsorily insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  It has been increasingly evident too that many people so affected were anxious to remain in the classes compulsorily insured under the Social Welfare Acts and as they were persons in the classes for whom that scheme was originally devised there were strong arguments in favour of extending the income limit to meet the need of such persons. The Government have, therefore, decided to increase the remuneration limit which, of course, only applies to persons employed otherwise than by <Col N="157" /> way of manual labour, from the existing level of £800, which was fixed in 1958, to £1,200 a year.  The Bill provides that this increase will take effect from a date to be determined by Order and this is necessary in order to give employers and persons likely to be affected, reasonable notice of the change after the relevant provision becomes law.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is necessary to make regulations for the purpose of awarding credited contributions to persons brought back into compulsory insurance by reason of the raising of the limit and the number of these credits will depend on the date fixed for the raising of the limit.  These credited contributions will enable a person brought back into compulsory insurance to qualify at once for disability benefit or unemployment benefit, for example, if he becomes unemployed or unable to work due to illness and otherwise satisfies the conditions for benefit.  They will not, however, count for the purposes of old age or widows' (contributory) pensions as any person going out of insurance by reason of going over the remuneration limit could have maintained his insurance for pension purposes by becoming a voluntary contributor.  There are at present some 6,000 voluntary contributors and it is a surprising thing that more people do not avail of the opportunity to become voluntary contributors when they cease to be compulsorily insurable, in view of the fact that the contributions they pay cover only 2/3rds of the cost of the benefits available.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that there is provision in the Bill to enable future variations in the remuneration limit to be made by Government Order and in such a case it will be necessary that the Draft of the Order be placed before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by resolution of each House before the Order can be made.</P>
    <P>A new and important feature in the Bill which will benefit many thousands of smallholders in the congested areas is the change, which will come into effect on 3rd January, 1966, in the method of assessing income from land under the Unemployment Assistance <Col N="158" /> Acts.  Under the change now proposed means derived from their land by smallholders in congested districts will, in general, no longer be established by reference to the actual number of stock, area and type of crops, etc. on a holding, but by reference to the productive capacity of the holding as indicated by the rateable valuation of the land.  Deputies on all sides of the House will, I am sure, welcome this radical change.  Under this new system all holdings bearing the same land valuation will normally be deemed to produce the same fixed rate of means irrespective of the extent to which the occupiers are in fact working the lands. The object of the change is to make small farmers in the Congested Areas free to work their holdings to maximum capacity, and to participate readily in all schemes designed to increase agricultural output, without being concerned about losing some or all of their unemployment assistance as a result of expanding farm incomes arising from greater effort and enterprise on their part.  Thus under the liberalising effects of the new system smallholders will be able to take full advantage of the many schemes that have been devised for the benefit of the Western areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to confer power on the Government to specify by Order the areas in which the new system will operate.  It is proposed to apply it in the 11 full counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Clare and Kerry, together with the congested portions of West Cork and West Limerick.  Thus the scheme will embrace the congested areas in the widest sense of that term. The areas I have mentioned are substantially the same as the areas which have been selected by the Minister for Agriculture for the purposes of measures he has recently introduced for the development of the West such, for example, as the County Development Teams and Pilot Area Schemes. Smallholders in these areas will, therefore, find in the new freer system of assessing means from land the necessary incentive to enable them to take full advantage of these measures in the <Col N="159" /> knowledge that their doing so will have no adverse effects on their title to unemployment assistance.  Moreover the change will facilitate the Department of Agriculture in their efforts to raise the output of the holdings in these areas.</P>
    <P>The essential features of the Unemployment Assistance Scheme will be unaltered, but in the congested areas income from a holding will be calculated on the basis of £20 a year for each £1 of net land valuation.  The present disregard of 5/- per week in respect of a married smallholder will, of course, continue to operate so that, in effect, the means assessed in his case for a £3 land valuation farm will be £47 per year and £67 for a £4 land valuation farm, and so on.  The means figure thus calculated will stay unchanged irrespective of changes in the output of the farm.  In this way, a person who neglects his holding will lose any advantage in the scale of unemployment assistance payments which he enjoys at present over his more industrious neighbour with a similar valuation.</P>
    <P>Special transitional arrangements are included in the Bill to enable existing smallholder recipients of unemployment assistance in the selected areas to adapt themselves gradually to the amended scheme.  In any case where it would be to their advantage these recipients will for a period of five years continue to have their means assessed as at present on the basis of current values for stock, crops etc., but in no case will the assessment exceed the figure which would be arrived at by calculating their means by reference to land valuation. In the absence of actual experience it is not possible to say with any firmness how many smallholders will benefit from the proposed change or what the additional cost will be.  We have, however, estimated, on the basis of the 1961 Census returns, that the change will affect some 24,000 smallholders in the selected areas including about 8,000 smallholders who are already recipients of unemployment assistance and that the additional cost of the change, on the basis of these <Col N="160" /> numbers, will be in the region of £1 million a year.</P>
    <P>I think I am justified in saying that when these changes come into force in January next there will be no reason why a smallholder in the congested areas in receipt of unemployment assistance should not make an all-out effort to increase the production from his holding by making the maximum use of his skill and energy and of whatever financial and technical aids and advice are available to him and by enthusiastic co-operation with his neighbours and full participation in Government schemes designed to raise income levels in these areas.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear to the Dáil on more than one occasion it has been my policy as Minister to keep the various social welfare schemes constantly under review and where shortcomings, anomalies or other defects become evident to make whatever amendments and modifications are possible to improve matters.  Each Social Welfare Bill introduced over the past few years has, as Deputies will be aware, included provision for a number of such changes, some big and some of lesser importance, but each of them of considerable benefit to the person or persons affected.  In the pursuance of that policy the present Bill includes provision for a number of improvements or extensions of existing schemes.  Section 15, for instance, deals with five modifications of the means test as applied for the purposes of non-contributory old age, blind, widows' or orphans' pensions and will undoubtedly enable a considerable number of persons to qualify for such pensions or to qualify for a higher rate of pension.</P>
    <P>For example, the amount which may at present be disregarded from the earnings of a blind person in assessing his means for the purposes of pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts will be increased by £13 for himself, his wife and each qualified child, that is, a child qualified for the receipt of children's allowances.  Again, the present concession in the assessment of means for the purposes of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' <Col N="161" /> pensions whereby income by way of voluntary and gratuitous payments is ignored up to a limit of £52 5s. is being extended so as to disregard all payments from charitable organisations in the assessment of means.</P>
    <P>Another concession is consequential on the provision in the Land Act, 1965, enabling an annuity to be paid to an elderly or blind person who surrenders a holding to the Land Commission.  It is proposed to ignore up to £3 a week of such annuity in assessing means for old age or blind pension.</P>
    <P>A further concession proposed in the case of applicants for a widow's non-contributory pension is the extension of the present disregard of £39 from earnings from insurable employment in respect of each qualified child so that it will apply also to a widow's earnings from any form of employment or self-employment involving personal exertions.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this group of improvements, comes another concession in regard to the assessment of means for the purposes of widows' non-contributory pension.  It is proposed to limit the amount of a qualified child's means which can be assessed against a widow to £26 where she has one such child and to £52 where she has more than one.</P>
    <P>In agreement with the Minister for Health, it has been decided to improve the position of non-contributory old age pensioners detained in mental hospitals. At present their pensions are appropriated by the hospital authorities towards the cost of their maintenance and treatment but if the RMS in charge of the hospital feels that the pensioner is capable of using money properly the pensioner may be allowed up to 10/- a week out of his pension as pocket money.  Section 11 of the Bill will increase that allowance to a maximum of £1 a week and will also permit the RMS in charge of the hospital to pay, over and above any payment he makes to the pensioner or even where he makes no such payment to the pensioner, on behalf of the pensioner portion of the pension towards whatever liabilities the pensioner <Col N="162" /> may have for rent, mortgages, insurance, etc.</P>
    <P>Two improvements in the children's allowances scheme, are also proposed. One will enable allowances to be paid to State servants, including Army officers, who go abroad in the service of the State or Government, or of the United Nations or other affiliated or similar international body and who bring their children to live with them. The second improvement of the children's allowances scheme while not of very wide application, will be of considerable value to those who do benefit from it.  It will enable double the appropriate rate of children's allowance to be paid, in respect of the survivors of multiple births, other than twins, while there are at least three such survivors.</P>
    <P>Finally there is an amendment of the unemployment assistance scheme which will allow a qualification certificate to be granted with retrospective effect to the date of application thus enabling unemployment assistance to be paid for a period of unemployment prior to the grant of the qualification certificate.  At present unemployment assistance cannot be paid unless and until the person is the holder of a qualification certificate even though he is unemployed and his application for a qualification certificate is under investigation and awaiting decision.  This amendment is in line with that made last year in relation to a revised decision affecting the grant of qualification certificates.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need go into any greater detail at this stage as I feel that the explanatory memorandum will have given Deputies a very good picture of the proposals in the Bill and of their effects.  It will no doubt be helpful to Deputies, however, if I summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side, the total cost will be £4,337,900 in a full year, of which £3,165,000 arises from the Budget proposals, £1,084,000 from the concessions for smallholders in congested districts, and £88,900 from the remaining provisions.  All of this cost will fall on the Exchequer, but the amount <Col N="163" /> to be met in the current year will total only £2,484,100 that is £2,076,000 in respect of the Budget proposals, £350,000 in respect of the smallholders' concession and £58,100 in respect of the remaining provisions.</P>
    <P>The gross annual cost of the improvements on the social insurance scheme will be £5,190,000 of which £5,120,000 arises from the Budget proposals.  Allowing for an increased annual income of £3,900,000 to be raised from the increases in rates of contribution, the cost to be met by the Exchequer will be £1,290,000 in a full year and £668,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>These are very substantial amounts but I think it will be appreciated that worthwhile improvements cannot be effected in social welfare schemes without correspondingly substantial increases in the contributions of employers, insured workers and of the Exchequer.  I am satisfied that this increased expenditure on social welfare is fully justified and that it is a measure of a further big development in the evolution of a satisfactory social welfare system in this country.  I have much pleasure, therefore, in recommending this Bill to Dáil Éireann and I would ask for a speedy and favourable consideration for it.</P>

      <P>Do réir Leabhar na Meastachán sé £35,508,000 an t-suim ghlan atá ag teastáil do'n bhliain 1965-66 le h-aghaidh na seirbhísí as a bhfuilim-se freagrach.  Méadú de £1,608,000 é sin ar an mbun-soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain 1964-65.  Tuigfidh Teachtaí, áfach, go mbeidh breis caiteachais ar sheirbhísí mo Roinne i mbliana de bhárr na méadaithe ins na rátaí a forgraíodh sa Cháinaisnéis.  Tabharfar Meastachán Forlíontach ós comhair na Dála níos déanaí chun an t-airgead breise a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the Estimate for my Department was before the House on 11th March last and was agreed.  Because of the dissolution of the Dáil before the Estimate was reported, it is now necessary to bring it before the House again for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Estimates Volume, the total net provision being sought for <Col N="165" /> Social Welfare for the current financial year is £35,508,000.  This represents a net increase of £1,608,000 on the original provision made for the previous year.  Subsequent to the preparation of the Estimates Volume, however, the Dáil agreed to a Supplementary Estimate of £1,136,000 for my Department for 1964-65, so that the real increase is £472,000.  It will, of course, be appreciated that the figures in the published Estimate are based on present rates of payment, and take no account of the increases announced in the Budget statement. The additional cost to be met in the current year arising from these increases will be covered by a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>
    <P>A comparison of the published figures for the current year and for the year 1964-65 shows that increased provision of £450,000 is being made under Subheads A to D which relate to administration costs.  This increase is due mainly to ninth round and other salary revisions and to increased postal, telegraph and telephone charges.  The increase of £434,000 in respect of social insurance&mdash;Subhead E&mdash;represents the Exchequer proportion of the total estimated increase of £1,267,000 in expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund, the balance of £833,000 being mainly attributable to anticipated increased income from contributions.  Details of the estimated income and expenditure of the fund are shown this year for the first time by way of an appendix to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under the heading Social Assistance &mdash;Subheads G to K&mdash;provision is made for an increase of £989,500.  This is due to the increased rates of payment and other improvements in the assistance services effective from the beginning of August, 1964.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate in March last, I gave a review of the main developments in social welfare matters over the preceding 12 months.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go over that ground again, as the information is available in the Dáil Debates for 11th March.  Of course if Deputies wish to obtain more detail on these <Col N="166" /> matters, or on any aspect of the Estimate, I will readily provide it.</P>
    <P>I now commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Estimate and in discussing the legislation before the House, I think it would be as well if we put it in its proper perspective.  This country, with the exception of one other country, Portugal, spends the lowest percentage of its national output on social welfare in all the OECD countries.  Of our total national output, we in Ireland spend only 5.8 per cent on social welfare payments.  Portugal has a worse record than us, at 2.8 per cent.  Countries such as Austria with similar standards of wealth as we have spend as much as ten per cent of their national output on social welfare payments. Countries such as Italy with a similar income <i>per capita</i> as this country spend approximately 9.7 per cent of their national output on social welfare payments.  It is against this background that we come to discuss the increases announced in the Budget and that have been brought forward in legislation.</P>
      <P>We can point out that not only have we in this country this unenviable record of expenditure on our national income and transfer payments, but that, in fact, there has been a decline in the proportion of our national output on transfer payments under the First Economic Programme and that under the Second Economic Programme the percentage of our national output, it is proposed, will decline further.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am speaking now about transfer payments according to the Irish definitions which include the cost of maintenance and clothing in institutions, items which are not included in the figures given in the OECD statistics. On the Irish statistics the percentage of our national output devoted to transfer payments was 6.5 in 1957 and it declined to 6.4 in 1963.  It is projected to decline to 6.2 per cent in 1970 under the Government's Second Economic Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> We endeavoured in the course of the recent general election campaign to bring these facts to the notice of the electorate and to alert the public to the fact that although this country was, like other countries, benefiting from increases in national output and because we were like other countries in Europe, getting a four per cent growth rate approximately each year in our national output, we were not fairly distributing it.  We pointed out in the course of the election campaign that it was necessary for us to engage in what we believed to be necessary radical reforms in our social welfare code in order to ensure a more equitable distribution of our wealth.  We do not accept the figures set out in the Government's Second Economic Programme and we do not think it was right that the percentage of our wealth devoted to transfer payments declined under the First Economic Programme. For these reasons, we put forward radical suggestions for improvement of our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Government, I think it is true to say without exaggeration, have been bankrupt of ideas for reforms in our social welfare framework.  They have of course, with the increase in the cost of living, increased the weekly payments of social assistance and social welfare but that is not reform in social welfare.  That is trying to make good to recipients of social assistance and social insurance some of the effects of rising living costs.  Only in one area has there been any sign and idea of reform from this Government.  Three years after the Commission on Workmen's Compensation reported, the Minister announced more than 18 months ago in Irish in answer to a question in the Dáil that it was proposed to make changes in the scheme of workmen's compensation.  Then nothing was done for over 18 months and, finally, after the general election, as part of the great campaign for social reform this Government were alleged to be wedded to, the only one idea that came before the country was that the Government were going to change workmen's compensation. On the other hand, we believe <Col N="168" /> it is necessary to see that reforms are made in our social welfare code.  In putting forward the reforms we did, we bore in mind certain characteristics of our Irish society, characteristics which must be considered in working out a proper scheme of social welfare in this country.</P>
    <P>By and large, this country is a country of large families.  It is a country with a high proportion of single people. As a result there are very wide inequalities of standards of living between people with the same income because those who are single enjoy a higher standard of living than does a man with a similar income and a large family.  It has also to be borne in mind that a large proportion of our population is in institutions.  It has also to be borne in mind that there is a big disproportion between rural and urban incomes.  A further factor to be taken into account is the fact that we have a flat rate system of contributions to social insurance, irrespective of the income of the contributor.</P>
    <P>Examining our social structure, it can be said that the statutory welfare services at the present time are divided roughly into two kinds: financial assistance and institutional care.  We have, in fact, no service for people in need in their own homes.  Up to now the State has been regarded as fulfilling its obligations if it gives financial assistance to those who require it and institutional care to those in need of it.  We believe we must go further. We believe that the great gap in our social welfare services at the moment is the fact that we have no domiciliary welfare service available to people in need in their own homes.  The service which we believe to be necessary is one that could be operated from welfare community centres.  It should be staffed by trained social workers, working in co-ordination with the local clergy, the local doctor, the local home assistance officer and the local charitable organisations.  It would help people to cope with the innumerable social problems facing so many in our midst.</P>
    <P>May I give some examples?  One of the things we need is organised home <Col N="169" /> help for the old and infirm in their own homes.  It would be the task of the domiciliary welfare service we propose to organise such a home help service.  Let me say in this regard, and in regard to the other matters to which I have referred, that these ideas are not something we thought up out of our own heads.  These are schemes which operate across the Border in Northern Ireland; these are schemes which operate in Britain and on the Continent.  We think these countries operate schemes which are worthwhile, schemes which should be incorporated here.  As anybody knows, who is conversant with social conditions here, what is needed in the majority of cases is home help for the old and infirm in their own homes.  Such a service could be organised without too great difficulty, because neighbours are always willing and charitable, but there is no system under which properly to organise the help.  In Northern Ireland the home help service operates through the medium of the social worker, who finds out needy cases, and neighbours who are prepared to help. The modest payment made is certainly recouped to the full in the benefits that are obtained.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our social problems which is not catered for here and which, in fact, could be catered for by the domiciliary service we propose is the problem of children in care, that is, children who are separated from their natural parents. At the moment there are too many agencies responsible for the problem of children in care&mdash;local authorities, Government Departments, very frequently a variety of charitable organisations. Because nobody is mainly responsible for the problem of the child in care, it not infrequently happens that children are left in care either in institutions or under foster parents for longer than is necessary.</P>
    <P>In March of last year the figures were 3,405 children in care in institutions. There were only 2,150 in foster care.  I do not know if the Minister has more up-to-date figures, but I doubt if the numbers have changed very much.  It is much better obviously <Col N="170" /> to have children in care under foster parents than in institutions.  One of the ways in which the former could be achieved is by means of trained social workers who would have the task of bringing this desired result about.  We do not, of course, pay enough to our foster parents.  It would be very desirable to increase the payment to foster parents.  Looked at purely in the crude financial light, it would be much better to pay foster parents more and have fewer children in institutions.</P>
    <P>The domiciliary welfare service we propose would also cover an area which is in gross neglect in this country. I refer to the problem of mental health.  In 1961, we had seven persons per 1,000 in mental institutions as against 4.51 in Northern Ireland and 2.12 in Denmark.  Why is this?  Are our people on this side of the Border more mentally afflicted than their brothers and sisters on the other side? It is because we have not got our services properly organised?  I believe the answer is obvious.</P>
    <P>We have in the Twenty Six Counties two trained psychiatric social welfare workers as against 14 in Northern Ireland.  We suggest as part of the domiciliary welfare service that we should have a scheme of trained psychiatric social workers who would deal with the problem of persons mentally ill.  This would work in two ways: first, in preventing breakdown resulting in persons having to enter mental hospitals and, secondly, in enabling persons discharged from these hospitals to keep from breaking down again.  Only yesterday I was talking to someone conversant with the sort of case to which I refer. A patient discharged from a mental hospital was returning to the exact same conditions which caused the original breakdown.  This person is almost certain to go back again to hospital in a very short time.  Trained psychiatric social workers would not, of course, get 100 per cent results but they would ensure we did not have seven per 1,000 of our population in mental hospitals when there are only 4.5 in such institutions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> This service is necessary for other reasons.  People are ignorant of their rights and a great deal of the time of Deputies is taken up with telling people what their rights are and trying to get for people the rights they have and should get anyway without the intervention of either Deputies or county councillors.  It is pitiable to meet people who are ignorant of their rights, people who should have some service available to them to inform them of their rights.  As things are, they have to come to Deputies or county councillors and these have to fulfil this role, probably not at all as adequately as the trained social worker would fulfil it.  We have all come across cases of the kind to which I refer, cases of people who just do not know what institutions there are for the mentally handicapped, people who just do not know what their rights are under the School Medical Attendance Acts, people who do not know what their rights are with regard to housing.</P>
    <P>This is a great need and it is one which the service we have suggested would cater for.  There is of course also great need for co-ordination of the voluntary charitable bodies that are doing such excellent work in this country.  It is not unusual for a distressed family to be visited by the St. Vincent de Paul Society, perhaps by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, perhaps by the probation officer and the home assistance officer.  There is vast overlapping of our services in some areas, and in other areas there is no service at all. The scheme of domiciliary welfare services, such as I have proposed, would in fact ensure that this overlapping would not occur and that there would be regular consultation and co-operation between the different agencies dealing with families in need of care. It would also ensure that those in need of care in places where services were not available would know of them and could get them.</P>
    <P>I have referred to one of the particular facts of this country that has to be taken into account in discussing our <Col N="172" /> welfare legislation, namely, the large size of Irish families.  For this reason children's allowances are something of very great importance in the field of social legislation.  I am very strongly opposed to means tests of any sort.  I am not suggesting we should have a means test in our children's allowances legislation.  But it is, one could almost say, an anomaly that in the field of children's allowances, there is no means test.  The richest person can get children's allowances for his children, whereas in many other spheres of social welfare legislation, rigid and strong means tests are applied.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should bring in a means test but I would suggest for the Minister's consideration that increases in children's allowances are desirable, and it is desirable that the poorer sections of the community should get the benefit of such an increase rather than that it should be given to people more well off.  It seems to me a simple way of doing this would be that, in cases where persons are paying income tax and getting an allowance in respect of children for income tax purposes, these allowances could be reduced by the same amount as the increase in children's allowances. This would have the effect of ensuring that the people in the position of paying income tax would not get any higher payments, and it would mean there would be more money available for the poorer sections not paying income tax.  This is not a means test, but it would be a way of ensuring that the money goes to those most in need of it.</P>
    <P>One further matter to which I referred briefly was the system we have in this country, copied from the British, of a flat rate insurance contribution. The effect of that is to limit the amount of contribution to the level of the lowest-paid worker, to limit the size of the Social Insurance Fund and so limit the amount of benefits that can be paid out of it.  Of course, it has certain advantages as well.  The cost of administration is small.  Only about seven per cent of the total amount goes in administration costs.  But it has certain serious disadvantages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> We have a large range of wage levels in this country.  Of the 145,000 adult male employees in industry, there are 107,000 with £7 per week or less and 20,000 with £16 per week or more. The disadvantage of course is that the fund is being kept at the level of the lowest-paid worker.  I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of linking contributions to earnings.  This is in fact what is done in the EEC countries.  We and Britain are different. We have copied the British system of a flat rate contribution.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks on the Second Reading the Minister expressed surprise at the low number of voluntary contributions to the Social Insurance Fund&mdash;only £9,000.  I do not think any surprise need be expressed at this.  If a worker, be he manual or non-manual, gets over the limit, the amount of benefit he will obtain will in fact constitute an absolutely disastrous decline in his standard of living.  We are now increasing the income level to £1,250 per year.  Take the case of a clerical worker with £20 a week.  If he is a single man, under the present scheme, he is now going to get £2 12s. 6d.  I would imagine most such contributors would think it was not worth their while contributing to such a scheme if their standard of living was going to be so disastrously reduced.  They would probably rather face emigration than try to maintain themselves at the level they would get under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be possible to have a graded scheme in this country linking contributions to earnings and so ensuring there need be no increase in contributions for the lower wage group.  I believe it would be possible to ensure that the middle income group increase would be small and that those with larger wages and salaries, who will have to contribute a larger weekly payment, will in fact get commensurately larger benefits if the necessity for benefit arises through unemployment or sickness.</P>
    <P>This of course will also involve increased contributions from employers. Again, we have to put this question into perspective.  We are inclined to <Col N="174" /> concern ourselves very much with conditions in this country and lose sight of how we really stand.  The contributions in this country by employers as a percentage related to wages is in fact one of the lowest, if not the lowest, in all the EEC countries.  The employers' contribution related to earnings is 2.3 per cent. In Northern Ireland, it is 5.6 per cent; in the United Kingdom, 4.6 per cent; and in the Netherlands, 6.5 per cent. We are in this position of maintaining a flat rate system, which of course gives a certain level to people in the event of sickness or unemployment, but which results in a disastrous decline in the living standards of many insured persons on whom misfortune may fall.  I should like to see a change and I think it would be advisable for the Minister to consider if it would be possible.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the provisions of the Bill, there is one other matter to which I want to refer and which has been referred to quite frequently in the House in recent times on different Estimates, that is, the problem of the mentally handicapped.  We raise it on the Department of Education; we raise it on the Department of Health; and we can raise it on the Department of Social Welfare because in fact no one Department has taken responsibility for it.  In the White Paper published by the Minister for Health when setting up the Commission some time ago, he made the point that it was very difficult to know exactly what Department is responsible.  I know before you try to stop me, Sir, that the Minister has not taken responsibility for this and that you will not find it in the Estimate, but I am going to be very brief.  The Minister has power to provide workshops for blind people and there is special legislation for that purpose.  Therefore, in respect of one category of disabled people, there is a scheme which is working fairly well, of workshops for blind people.</P>
    <P>I want to inform the Minister, in case he does not know, that, as far as I am aware, the health authorities throughout the country have taken the line that they will not provide sheltered <Col N="175" /> workshops for the mentally handicapped. The Department of Health in their memorandum to the Committee set up under the last Dáil stated in very expressed terms that they did not regard it as a function of the health authority to provide these workshops. The voluntary organisations have been struggling for years to set them up and under great difficulty one or two have been set up.  Let us face the fact that the voluntary organisations themselves cannot provide the sheltered workshops we need.  Here is an opportunity for the Minister for Social Welfare, if he wants to take the power.  This has been done in the case of blind persons and I believe it could be done by the Minister if he wanted to do it.  As I say, the Department of Health will not do it, the health authorities washed their hands of it and it is not an educational problem and it could fall under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We, of course, put forward an answer to that problem which I hoped the Government might accept.  We suggested that a separate statutory body should be established which would have responsibility for the mentally handicapped and this body would provide the workshops where they are needed.  In default of such statutory authority, nobody has taken the responsibility and the voluntary organisations cannot take it.  I suggest the Minister should consider whether he might take it up.  It is something which is very urgently needed and something we should try to provide.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be self-congratulatory about the provisions of the new Bill.  A single, non-contributory old age pensioner is going to get £2 7s. 6d. a week to live on.  This is not a princely sum.  I doubt if anybody can live on £2 7s. 6d. a week at present.  Of course a great number of people are in receipt of home assistance and this in itself is an admission that the rate of pensions we pay is inadequate. Studies have been carried out of the dietary requirements of people and the amount of money to <Col N="176" /> be spent on the diet to keep up a proper level of health and it is quite clear that £2 7s. 6d. a week is inadequate for a single person to try to maintain a proper standard of living.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies are as familiar as I am with cases of people who are trying to live on 50/- a week. I know of one case and this man told me that he is not able to afford dinner any day.  He just has not got the money.  He has to pay rent, an ESB bill and various other bills and while he can buy tea and bread and butter, he cannot get dinner.  As I say, we have made some progress and we are glad that the Government have taken the step, for which I think the Opposition are entitled to take some credit, of bringing about these increases in social welfare payments, but I do not think we should be complacent.  The unemployed man in urban areas is going to get £1.14.0 and the married man with three children in an urban area will get £4.7.6 a week to live on.  That does not seem to be a very high sum and in fact to me it seems to be a very inadequate sum and I hope we will be able to improve on this in the near future.</P>
    <P>It has been announced that this 10/-a week is not to apply to all old age pensioners who are now in receipt of the maximum.  A new means test is to be introduced in this Bill.  It is to be regretted that this new means test is being introduced into legislation again.  The further away we can get from this sort of thing the better. It is a retrograde step that the Government decided to re-introduce this differential between old people, such as between one who may have £25 a year and another £27 a year. Obviously, it would not have cost very much to have given the increase to all the old age pensioners, and I do not think that any great injustice would have been done because one old age pensioner happened to have a little bit more out of his income than another.  The increases in the remuneration limit are to be welcomed, but again I would make the point that bringing into benefit people with £1,250 a year is not going to be <Col N="177" /> something they are going to regard with any great favour in view of the low amount of benefit they will get in relation to their income.  This bears out the point that the higher we bring the rate of wage earnings by the contributors, the greater the necessity will be for a graded system.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which is of very great importance.  It does happen and has happened in the past that where we have increased social assistance or social welfare payments of one sort or another, the persons in receipt of social assistance or social insurance who are also in receipt of another payment out of public funds, be it home assistance or some form of pension, have the other payment reduced.  We should ensure that nobody in receipt of home assistance will have that home assistance reduced.  For example, in the case of the old age pensioner whose old age pension is going up by 10/- a week, as surely as we are sitting here, that is going to happen.  The Minister says that this can be left to the local authorities themselves.  I do not agree with that.  We should put it in the Bill. This does not apply merely to home assistance.  There are various other schemes administered by the local health authorities where rigid means tests are applied.  There are disability payments and various other schemes, such as, for example, the special allowance pensions paid to Old IRA pensioners who have to meet a means test.  I know of one case where an old age pensioner got a special allowance pension of £66 10s.  This will be reduced because his old age pension has gone up.</P>
    <P>We could stop that very simply by a three-line or four-line clause in this Bill.  I shall try to draft such a clause. I might not make a very good hand of it and I should be glad if the Minister, with the assistance of his expert advisers, would do it properly.  The position is that with one hand we are giving 10/- a week to old age pensioners and with the other deducting it from home assistance.  It will happen in other areas of our social services as well.</P>
    <P>There are special clauses in the Bill <Col N="178" /> which deal with special cases of applications by smallholders for unemployment assistance.  Of course the general idea is a good one&mdash;ensuring there will be equality of treatment for these applicants.  I should like to know why the Minister is to restrict this benefit to areas he will define by order and why this new scheme should not be operated throughout the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  This legislation will leave it open to the allegation, whether true or not, that political influence will be used as to which parts of the country this will apply, and under section 9, it will be left open to that criticism in a much more violent form. Would the Minister tell the House if any estimate has been made as to what the cost would be to have this applied to the whole country?  He proposes to apply it to 11 counties, among them the congested district areas and other parts of the country not usually regarded as congested districts.  I do not think it would cost a great deal to extend it to the rest of the country.  That would get rid of the criticism of political influence which surely will be made if the Bill remains in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to section 9.  The Minister said nothing about this section in his introductory remarks.  Here we are proposing to do away with a scheme which was very unfair and which worked very unfairly.  We are proposing now to introduce a system by which the means of a smallholder will be determined by the poor law valuation of his holding.  Power is given <Col N="179" /> in section 9 for the Minister, in a specific case, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, to go into all the circumstances.  Why?  We are told the reason is to prevent inequalities and injustices of one sort or another. Under section 4, as drafted, there is no appeal from the Minister. Under present legislation if a person gets a decision from a home assistance officer, there is an appeal.  There will be no appeal under this legislation and the Minister will do what in fact is being provided, in so far as it is being provided in our social welfare code: he is taking power to intervene in individual cases.  He can say to a farmer in West Cork, for instance: &ldquo;You will go back to the old system,&rdquo; while to his neighbour, he will say: &ldquo;You will come under the new system.&rdquo;  The neighbour will have no appeal.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us what injustices and inequalities he will get rid of by section 9?  If the Minister wants to keep it, there should be some means of appeal from his decision such as exists under the code generally. There are a number of other matters to which reference was made by the Minister, such as tidying up and minor reforms of the social welfare code.  I do not know what the reason is for requiring, for instance, a residence qualification for people who get unemployment assistance.  It is by no means unusual for persons to leave county areas and go into towns of more than 7,000 population and have to wait six months before they get unemployment assistance.  I do not understand why it is necessary to have this condition because it certainly causes inequalities.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer very briefly.  The Minister has in fact power to make, and does in fact make, the employment period orders each year which affect the applications of smallholders for unemployment benefit.  This year, as is obvious even to a city-bred person, is a very difficult year for the smallholder&mdash;the hay has been late; there is not a great deal of work available &mdash;and it seems to me consideration <Col N="180" /> should be given to the question of whether the order should be brought into effect in circumstances in which there are people unable to get work and who are cut off from unemployment assistance because account is not taken of variations in weather with resulting variations in employment conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the recent general election did nothing else, it at least focussed attention on the very inadequate social welfare benefits obtaining in this country.  At first this seemed to have been appreciated only by the Labour Party who made it the principal plank in their platform. Fine Gael subsequently took it up and very belatedly the Government Party, a few days before the election, suddenly felt something had to be done to change the system.  Then the Taoiseach made his earth-shaking statement to the effect that Fianna Fáil, too, were interested in social welfare and that something would be done in that respect if Fianna Fáil were returned to office.</P>
      <P>Something, of course, had to be done after the election and we must admit that a small attempt was made to try to right the very bad position in which social welfare recipients found themselves.  We made it clear at all times that if the Government imposed specific taxes for the purpose of improving social welfare benefits, we would support them.  The Government put on the taxes.  Some of them were taxes with which ordinarily we would disagree violently but because most of the money was being applied to social welfare benefits, the Labour Party supported the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us must appreciate that even at present the proposed taxes do very little to remedy the position.  We have the situation in which people are still trying to live on a much smaller amount than the ordinary Member of this House will spend on meals during two days in the city.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever had the good fortune, or misfortune according to the way you look at it, to have had to go to see some person who has not enough money to live on. What would he say if he met one <Col N="181" /> of those people and it was explained to him that the amount of money the Minister spent on a meal would keep that person for two days, if living alone?  The Government are living very high in the clouds if they do not appreciate that.  I think it should be evident now that the cost of one meal in some of the middle-class hotels in this city is one-third of what an old age pensioner will get to keep himself over the whole week.  These are facts which too many people seem to gloss over, seem to forget or to try to forget.  It is about time they were looked at in the fact.</P>
    <P>We know that the Minister has proposed certain increases.  Of course, in the usual way, the increases will operate for assistance sections from August and for benefit sections from next January, despite the fact that the taxes to pay for these increases came into operation on the day after the Budget.  The very least that could be expected would be that the benefits which are to be paid in August would have effect from the date of the Budget.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would not be beyond the capabilities of the Government to find the few pounds necessary to give those unfortunate people the difference between what they will get in August and what they were getting a month ago.  But, of course, that was glossed over: that could not be done: there were too many things which would prevent it from being done.  As a result, the Government took the easy way out and said: &ldquo;We will do it in August.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am a trade union official.  When I am negotiating for my members, I usually try if at all possible to get whatever agreement on wages is made apply to the date the demand was made and, if that is not possible, at least payable from the date the agreement is made.  I think that is only fair. The fact that it is fair has been recognised by the Government because again and again we have had evidence of increases to people who are relatively well paid dated back for six months, 12 months and in some cases for two years.  Yet, the old age pensioners must wait until next August before they get anything if they are <Col N="182" /> non-contributory and, if they are contributory, they must wait until January next.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is a matter which has to be dealt with by the Government in a different way from the way in which they have been used to dealing with it and that this should be the last time any Government would do something like that.  There is no point in saying that other Governments did this before, that this is the pattern.  If a pattern is a bad pattern it should be changed.  I know that the Minister himself has accepted numerous suggestions from this side of the House and I will give him all the credit possible for it.  He acceded to a suggestion some time ago that children's allowances should be put on to old age pensions.  He acceded to a suggestion, and he has it in this Bill, that in future people who apply for a qualification certificate for unemployment assistance should have it paid from the date on which the application is made rather than from the date the certificate is granted.  That being so, is there any reason why the Minister cannot break with tradition in cases such as those I have just mentioned where people are being granted a few shillings extra?  Why should he have to do what was done before? Why must those people wait for several months before they get any extra payment?</P>
    <P>I have noted in the Bill, as we all knew, the suggestion that those who live in the congested areas will be allowed to earn a certain amount of money and that, at the same time, they can use their small holdings.  Why should this be confined to certain areas?  Are we again building up barriers between different people in this country?  In fact, a value is laid on valuation&mdash;£1 poor law valuation is to equal £20.  Why should it be necessary, in addition to that, to say that it will apply only to certain counties designated as being in the congested areas?  People in Cavan who live on reasonably good land and on the Meath-Cavan border will be entitled to qualify and people in Meath who live across the county border, and may be living in the worst land <Col N="183" /> in Ireland, as portion of it is, particularly in North Meath, will not qualify.  Does the Minister not realise that this will set labour against labour? Why have more barriers set up?  Why can we not have one set of qualifications to cover the whole country?</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister has lent his name to the introduction of such legislation, because he must know that it is wrong.  There is no reason at all why he should have allowed it to be introduced.  Even at this stage, he should do something to have it taken out.  When the qualification is there, the safeguard is there.  If the man is living on a valuation which is too big to let him qualify in Meath as well as in Cavan, Mayo and Galway, surely there should not be anything else necessary?  We have the other situation where the man in one of the congested areas can in fact draw his unemployment assistance and work his farm under certain circumstances. Because of the introduction of the qualification certificate, quite a number of people all over the country will be disqualified from drawing unemployment assistance for the duration of the employment period.  Surely the Minister is aware that anybody who can get work will get work and that he will not depend on his employment period to look for that work?  Does he not know that this is a device by which some unfortunate people who are unable to get anything except the dole are in fact thrown on the charity of their neighbours or on the charity of the local authority?  This is the most scandalous thing that has ever been included in social welfare legislation and why it should be allowed to continue is a mystery to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also know that if somebody in Cavan can work his small holding and draw the dole and somebody across the border in Meath is found doing it and prosecuted, as he very well may be, then if the prosecution is proven, he is disqualified for six months.  Why should this extra&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware that if somebody in an area which is not a congested area is found signing for the dole and at the same time works a piece of land, he will be prosecuted by his Department.  The Minister need not tell me that he will not.  I can give him evidence, if he wants it, of cases where this has happened.</P>

      <P>Working his own land.  He is accused of defrauding the Department of Social Welfare when in fact he is doing what is perfectly legal or will be perfectly legal a few miles away in another county and, if the prosecution is proven, he is disqualified for six months.  I think the penalty imposed by the court should be quite sufficient.  When somebody is brought before the court, and a penalty is imposed, why should the Department of Social Welfare take it upon itself to add the additional penalty of disqualification from assistance for six months?  That is something that should not be allowed.  I am sure the Minister considers there is good reason for it, but, on reflection, I think he will agree that this question of dual punishment is unfair.  It is like the case last week of the man who was discharged on a customs charge and who had £600 worth of butter taken from him.  It is another example of bungling by Government Departments who believe they are above the law which was carried out in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made last week to anonymous letters and the Minister seemed to be rather proud that people who sent in such letters usually told the truth.  He said that if somebody reported a labourer as having been working when drawing unemployment benefit or assistance, it was usually found that the letters contained a true statement and for that reason use of the letter was justified.  There has been a recognised code in the civilised world that anonymous letters deserve only to be put in the fire and no Department of State <Col N="185" /> should stoop to using evidence by people who have not the courage to sign their names.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister last week following a debate on the Adjournment about dental benefits.  I want to make it clear that on the whole dentists are a decent lot of people, doing their job properly, but I still believe when somebody tries to cash in on the miseries of anybody suffering from toothache by trying to collect more from that person than he can collect from the Department of Social Welfare, he should be stopped by the Minister from doing so when he has the power to do it.  Without going further into it, I believe it should be dealt with in the only way in which it can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to workmen's compensation.  The Commission which investigated the type of payment of compensation to workmen was set up by Deputy Corish when he was Minister for Social Welfare many years ago.  I understand the report was submitted about four years ago and 18 months ago, in reply to a question in Irish by the then Deputy Colley, the Minister said it was proposed to introduce a State scheme to cover workmen's compensation, but from that day to this all we can get from the Minister is a statement that it is a very complicated Bill and that it is in course of preparation.  It is still in course of preparation and it appears it will be in that state for many months to come.  While this goes on, persons suffering from the results of industrial accidents are getting £4 10s. a week on which they must attempt to live. Worse still, if they have a big family, they receive a supplement from the Department of Social Welfare to enable them to exist and the Minister tells me the Department are not supplementing the private insurance companies.  What are the payments made by his Department to insured workers if not part of the money which should be paid by insurance companies?</P>
    <P>Since the decision to change the system to the Department of Social Welfare was taken, I cannot understand why it should take so long to <Col N="186" /> draft the necessary legislation.  Legislation which was not so important was rushed into the House.  We had three different Succession Bills.  One was found to be unpopular and it was withdrawn; a second was brought in and taken out; and now the third is almost through the House.  Yet, the Minister finds he cannot get the draft of a very important Workmen's Compensation Bill or Industrial Accidents Bill&mdash;whatever he would call it&mdash; introduced.  This codology should stop. The Minister has gone as far as he should be allowed to go and the House should insist that this legislation on workmen's compensation be produced without further delay.  While he is dithering, people who should be benefiting must make do with very inadequate compensation under the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>There are some extraordinary anomalies in the cost of stamps.  It seems to be accepted by the State that if there is an increase in the cost of stamps, the increase must be the same for the workman who may have only £7 or £8 a week as for the employer who may have an income of £10,000 a year from the same job.  Could the Minister not see his way to put the major portion of the cost of the present or proposed stamp increase on the employer?  Even at the present late stage, it may not be too late to consider that possibility.</P>
    <P>For quite a long time, the Minister has been using a system whereby boys and girls over 16 who are entitled to stamp cards must pay the same money for their stamps as if they were adults and yet if they seek benefit, they are only paid benefit at very much reduced rates.  Widows drawing a widow's pension on their late husband's insurance while stamping cards in their own right, if they fall ill, even though they are getting a contributory widow's pension from the Department of Social Welfare, have their benefits reduced by half because of the fact that they have another payment, notwithstanding that the qualification for the original benefit, the widow's pension, has been supplied by the husband over the years and has nothing to do with present payments.  In addition, they <Col N="187" /> must pay the same amount for stamps as those who get full benefit.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand also why agricultural workers who, for many years were prevented from drawing unemployment benefit until eventually a more enlightened legislation changed the picture, have been for some years entitled to draw unemployment benefit as well as disability benefit but a domestic servant we find is still apparently the Cinderella of the country.  She can draw sickness benefit but cannot draw unemployment benefit.  Can the Minister say straight out&mdash;he did not say in answer to the question&mdash;is the object not to starve her into going back to work for somebody not prepared to pay her properly? Is that not why it is being done? Why not face the facts?  Why not give the same benefits to her and for which she is paying, as her sisters in industry are getting?  Over the years we have been allowing things to happen which we would be ashamed to see out in the open and which it is the right of Deputies to bring to the notice of the Minister so that he will not believe that by sweeping them under the carpet, they can conveniently be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Another question discussed on many occasions and to which the Minister seemed to have pat answers is the question of appeals.  Somebody is sick and is examined by somebody from the Department who states that he is not unfit for work.  They do not say he is fit for work, whatever is the importance of the phraseology. If that person continues to be sick and has certificates from the dispensary doctor, the appeal is put back and when eventually held, if the original inspector's decision is upheld, the Minister's office sees to it that the matter will not be further dealt with until the person who is ill either dies or gets back to work.  When I asked the Minister why this was done, I am sure he will recall that he told me that, briefly, it was that when there were two decisions by a Department inspector, it was felt there was no urgency in the matter; in other words, that the second appeal which the insured person was entitled to <Col N="188" /> make was only a &ldquo;blind&rdquo;, that the Minister and the Department had already made up their minds that they were not going to do very much and would leave the unfortunate person as long as they possibly could in the hope that he would either die or resume work.</P>
    <P>In a Christian country, that is a shocking situation and it is something the Minister cannot say he is not aware of because he gave me that reply a few weeks ago.  It appears to be the accepted practice of the State to do this sort of thing.  The Minister's predecessor dealt very severely with dispensary doctors who were issuing certificates to persons if it was considered that they were not sick and very few dispensary doctors will issue a certificate to a person who is not sick.  The fact that a certificate is issued should be sufficient evidence. There must be some reason why a person persists in submitting certificates.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a person was sick for a couple of years and eventually one of the bright boys in the Department of Social Welfare decided that he was no longer sick.  The man, who had a wife and young family, almost finished up in a mental home as a result of illness and worry before a more humane person decided that, in fact, he was sick.  When payment was made, there were two weeks from the time the first inspector had examined him to the time he was subsequently declared fit which would not be paid for until a deciding officer examined the case.  I know of another case where a man was ill for a considerable time and was declared fit for work by one of the Department's inspectors and on that same evening the County MOH had the man X-rayed and sent him to a TB hospital where he has since been seriously ill.</P>
    <P>Accidents can happen and people can make mistakes but there should be a more humane approach to these matters.  It is most unfair that our people who are ill and require benefit should be deprived of benefit because of&mdash;I almost said red tape&mdash;green tape, which is used by the Department now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I notice that in the Bill the Minister proposes to allow something more to persons who are in mental hospitals and who are drawing a contributory old age pension.  Again, possibly the Minister does not know but, if he does not, he should be told that there are instances of people going into mental hospitals and leaving behind them, sometimes, a wife and family.  It is highly irregular that the old age pension book of such a person should be taken by the mental hospital authorities.  The Minister now says that the RMS has the right to decide to give back £1 to people who can spend it, 10/-, which they were formerly getting, or more if there is rent and ground rent and such things to be paid.  I do not think that the RMS is the person who should have that right.  The right should be left with the Department and the appeal should be to the Minister.  I do not see any reason why this could not be done.  As a matter of fact, I do not see why a person who is ill and who goes into a mental hospital certified as ill should have to pay anything at all if he is in the category which is normally covered by a medical card. There must be a reason for introducing this special provision for people who are drawing contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I asked the Minister to consider increasing the period of qualification for contributory old age pension to what is laid down in the Act&mdash;the insured life of the person.  The Minister did, very fairly, increase the period from between 10 to 15 years and from 15 to 20 years if that was more favourable to the person concerned. I see no reason why these cases cannot be traced back to the point where the Department have evidence.  I understand there are photostat copies of stamps put on by persons back to the early twenties and a fairly comprehensive record from 1932.</P>
    <P>I will say this for the Minister's Department, that both he and his officials, with one exception, have been most courteous on every occasion on which I approached them.  Most people who deal with the Minister and the <Col N="190" /> Department have the same story to tell.  Within the law as they are allowed to interpret it, there is no Department of State which will give more courtesy to the general public, and particularly to public representatives, than the Minister's Department and the Minister himself.  There is one exception.  That exception is the type of person known as an investigating officer.  I do not know where the Department get those people.  They are not the same type as the persons working in the Department at any other level.  I have received numerous complaints from people who have claimed that they have been &ldquo;third degreed&rdquo;&mdash;that is the phrase used&mdash;by people whose only job, as far as I know, is to find out from them whether or not they qualify for a certain type of pension.  Occasionally we find these people being most unco-operative.</P>
    <P>There is one case where an itinerant&mdash;some years ago he was a tinker but he is an itinerant now&mdash;was employed by a farmer for many years. He knows where he was born and that he lived in a certain district for a number of years but there are no records available.  Two or three old people over 70 years of age were prepared to say that they knew this man was over 70 years of age.  I thought that in the circumstances, as he had been stamping an insurance card for between 25 and 30 years and as he appeared to be the type of person who was entitled to consideration from the State, he should have got an old age pension.  When I took the matter up with the Department they were not very co-operative.  My impression is that the gentleman who investigated the case first at local level did not like to have his word doubted, did not like to be asked to go back to ask people he had not asked before if they knew the man.  The result is that I got a curt note saying that there is no evidence that this man is over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>Th extraordinary thing about it is that the Department queried the payment of unemployment benefit to this man because, they said, it appeared as if he was over 70 years of age, even though there is a record in the Department <Col N="191" /> to prove, as far as they were concerned, and which they were using for old age pension purposes, that he was not, in fact, over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>A little common sense and a great deal of courtesy on the part of these local officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, of course, logic&mdash;should be forthcoming.  I regret the necessity to have to pick these people out so as to have the matter investigated but they should be investigated fully.  By the use of common sense and logic it could have been proved that this man was over 70 years of age.</P>
      <P>It may be said that that is only one case.  There are others.  I know of a case where a person had been a herd for many years.  He applied for the old age pension.  When his application came before the old age pension committee, there was a report from an appeals officer to the effect that this man's income for the previous year was £1,000.  The man was 72 years of age.  When the appeals officer was asked how he discovered that the man had made £1,000 the previous year, he produced a long list of cattle which the man had bought and sold at a local auction mart in the local town. He had done this for his neighbours and got a few drinks for it.  The value of all the cattle was assessed and his profit was estimated.  A profit of £1,000 was put down against him.  This is the sort of nonsense displayed by some of the Department's investigation officers.  It is rather a pity it should be so, because, as I said earlier, the record of the Department is so good, apart from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I get complaints, as does every other Deputy, about delay in payment of social welfare in the normal course.  In most cases the delay is caused by the fact that people do not fill their certificates properly. They do not sign them or they do not put the correct date on them. When a person is ill and is applying for benefit it is understandable that he may find difficulty in filling forms <Col N="192" /> correctly.  In spite of that, a short inquiry usually has the effect that payment will be made.  The investigating officers are the one section of the Minister's Department who seem to try to justify their existence by acting the tough guy on some poor old person who is unable to defend himself.  It is just too bad that that should be so.</P>
    <P>With reference to the new means test, I notice the Minister has altered it to the tune of 5/-.  In the Budget it was mentioned as £26.  It is now £26 5s. 0d.  That is a small thing but it does have its uses.  It means that the aristocrat who has 10/- a week will escape.  If a person has slightly over 10/- a week he is caught and will not get the 10/- increase.  The extraordinary thing about all this is that when the old age pension was introduced in this country by the British Government, in 1909, the old age pension then for a man who was 70 years of age was 5/- per week and if his wife was 70 she got 5/-also&mdash;a total of 10/-.  The means test was £26, and the farm labourer's wage was between 8/- and 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>So, in fact, a farm worker of 70 years of age, whose wife was also 70 years of age, could get 1/- or 2/- a week more by way of a non-contributory pension than he would get for a full week's work.  Now, in 1965, the Minister has discovered that £26 5s. per year is a big enough amount to disqualify a pensioner from getting the full benefit of the recent increase which had banner headlines in some of the papers reading: &ldquo;10/-A Week For Old Age Pensioners&rdquo;. It now appears that it is 10/- for some, but not for those who have got £26 5s. a year.  The trouble is that the old people in the country still cannot be convinced that they will not all get the extra 10/-.  When we try to explain that there is a little catch in it, they think they are not being told the truth, and are inclined to get angry.  They will be still more angry when they find that we were telling the truth, and that they will not all get the full amount.</P>
    <P>A rather extraordinary thing is that <Col N="193" /> while it is agreed that the old age pensioners will get this 10/- a week&mdash; even the people who will get it in January next, having paid for increased stamps&mdash;and that a dependent adult will also get this 10/- a week, if there are one, two or three or up to a dozen children, there is nothing extra.  I do not know how the people who drew up this scheme live.  I do not know whether they appreciate the fact that boys or girls of 12, 13 or 14 years of age in a working man's house will eat as much as their parents.  Their clothing probably costs more, and their parents would, therefore, require something extra to compensate them for the extra expense.  Unfortunately, the Minister and the Department of Finance do not seem to agree with this idea, and they decided that there would be nothing for dependent children, no matter how many of them there are.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that on numerous occasions I threw bouquets to his Department because of the introduction of contributory old age pensions.  Again I should like to say that I consider that one of the finest things that could have been done.  The regrettable thing about it is that having granted contributory old age pensions to certain people with a certain number of stamps, the Department seemed to consider that the non-contributory pensioners were not terribly important.  A typical example of this is the man who is employed by a farmer.  If he gets board and lodging, a deduction is made from his wages of something under £3 a week for his food and lodgings.  About £2 7s. 6d. of that sum is for food alone.  Yet the old age pensioners have to buy their food, pay their rent, pay for their clothing&mdash;they do not use very much&mdash;pay for their shoes, and pay for all the things which wealthy people require, and they are supposed to do all that on less than that amount.</P>
    <P>If they happen to be ill, they are in the unfortunate position that they have no option but to apply to the local authority for a supplement by way of home assistance.  I do not really know what the situation is in the cities, but I do know what it is <Col N="194" /> in the country districts.  A person living in a country district most certainly does not want his neighbours to know that he has had to apply for home assistance, and if he can possibly do without it, he will not apply for it. There are many of them who do apply because, if they did not apply, they would have to go to the county home.  If they went into the county home the extraordinary thing is that the cost of their maintenance is put at somewhere around £4 per week.  Yet if they stay at home, they are expected to live on between 37/6 and £2 10s. or £3 a week.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any views on these matters.  I do not know whether he believes that the old age pensioner is supposed to live on what the State gives him.  I do not know whether he believes that the local authorities are supposed to pay a supplement to the old age pensioner, but I do know what has to be done. If the Minister thinks it right that the local authorities should do this, he should then inform the local authorities that as a result of the increases, such as they are, they are not to cut off whatever home assistance they are giving to those old people.</P>
    <P>One of the tragedies of modern life is that when people who are members of a trade union or a trade association of one kind or another, succeed in getting a decent increase in wages for themselves, those people who are not in the same position are usually left much worse off.  The biggest tragedy of the ninth round wage increase was the fact that the general increase in prices which preceded, and succeeded it, left the unfortunate pensioners much worse off than they were two years ago.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can rightly say that the percentage increase granted to the old age pensioners and social welfare recipients was more than that which was granted to workers in full employment, but I do not think that percentage increase can be counted as adequate in those cases.  I think the Minister will agree with me that 12 per cent of 37/6 is a very small sum when compared with 12 per cent of <Col N="195" /> £1,200.  I think he will also agree that the person with £1,200 pays the same price for bread, butter, tea and sugar, as the unfortunate person who gets only 12 per cent of 37/6.  There possibly might be some validity in the argument about the percentage increase if those people we are talking about received an adequate amount at the start but even then I do not think that is the way in which their increases should be adjusted.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to assure us that so far as possible, so long as he is Minister, he will ensure that when there are future wage adjustments, similar adjustments&mdash;not similar percentage adjustments but similar adjustments&mdash;will be made by the Department for those who are dependent on the Department for their existence. One of the things which really annoy me is the fact that we in this country seem to be so terribly anxious to forget that the 70 year olds of today are the people who kept the wheels turning in this country for the past 30 to 40 years and that it will be only a few short years until the people who are now in the prime of life will be in the same position unless something is done to improve their position.  It is all right for the people who have big salaries, an assured living and plenty of money stacked away.  Their future is safe, but the majority of the workers of this country who have been living, not in luxury, not even in frugal comfort but who, for years, have been trying to rear a family and keep themselves in decency, know that when the time of their retirement comes, they will have nothing left except what the state gives them.  The realisation of that by everybody might force us to have a different outlook on this whole question of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said last year on a motion which came before this House, that in the case of a national emergency on previous occasions, the State had no difficulty in a few short days, when money was money, in changing a Defence Estimate of £6 million to an Estimate of almost £26 <Col N="196" /> million because of that emergency. There is an emergency now for those old people who are not going to live for ever and whatever they are to get must be given to them now.</P>
    <P>The increases, such as they are, which have been given, are very welcome but the Minister should do everything he possibly can to ease the lot of those people.  He should try to ensure as time goes on that further increases in benefits will be given to those people.  He should try to ensure that the present increases will be granted to those people with effect from the date the Budget came into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to what I consider to be a very important section of the community, the people who have been insured in the past and who are now voluntary contributors. Many of those people, due to the fact that their salaries increased, were forced, not of their own volition, but due to circumstances over which they had no control, to relinquish their status under the social welfare scheme. Many of those people wisely maintained a link with the Department by remaining on as voluntary contributors. I feel many more would have done so if they could have been assured that after some reasonable period of time as voluntary contributors, say, a period of five to ten years, they would qualify for the same benefits as the more active members in the social welfare classes.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of scope for liaison between the Department and the public in this matter.  Few of the voluntary contributors are aware that, under existing legislation, they would qualify, depending on the local authority, for the middle income group. This applies to practically every local authority voluntary contributor.  This can be a tremendous boon to anyone who just passes over the income limits set by that local authority and which would preclude him from being included as a middle income beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the Minister's Estimate which gave me profound pleasure was the fact that he has increased the <Col N="197" /> benefits to parents in respect of multiple births.  This, I feel, is a great step forward and it is proof positive that the Minister has at heart the best interests of those who may be hardest hit, due to various circumstances.  We have had, in my constituency, at least two cases of triplets.  In each case the parents were hard pressed economically to maintain the same standard of living after the arrival of the triplets. It was a pity that the benefits were awarded to them only on the same basis as that for a single birth.  The Minister has, in this new Estimate, made provision whereby these exceptional cases will be treated on a much better and fairer scale.</P>
    <P>As regards criticism levelled at various people in the Department, I reject much of it, as indeed do all of us, because I have had experience with the officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  I found them at all times to be the epitome of courtesy and sympathetically inclined in regard to all reasonable cases.  There are certain circumstances in which they cannot&mdash;nor, indeed, would it be prudent for any Minister to interfere in the internal workings of the Department&mdash;endeavour to adjust regulations for specific cases.  That would be a retrograde step by the Department. The majority of its officials have been most fair to all those people who have had contact with them in regard to their claims.  It must be conceded that the complaints which come to hand do not measure up at all in any sizeable proportion to the volume of traffic and business which is done by this Department, which must be one of the biggest within the framework of the State.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has increased his Vote by over £1 million is a very healthy sign of this country's economy and of the thinking of the Minister and the Cabinet.  The treatment for institutional patients who are recipients of social welfare benefits is again a very welcome innovation. We all appreciate that the pound today will only suffice to buy the modest comforts of many persons who may be institutionally cared for.  I consider that with a lot of co-operation <Col N="198" /> between the local authorities and the Department, much can be done to help out those people who, through adverse circumstances, probably ill health, have been forced to seek a home in institutions in our State.</P>
    <P>Particular reference must here be made to the mentally ill.  They are a section of the community who I feel have, for far too long, been kicked about and have not received the consideration they are entitled to as citizens of this State.  I hope and trust this will be more actively pursued in the future.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people to criticise any Minister but I have heard very little constructive criticism forthcoming so far in this debate.  I trust those who criticise the Minister or the Department will remember that the Minister is charged with a serious responsibility in so far as he must get for us and for the people the best possible value for money spent. Indeed a sum in the region of £36 million for social welfare benefits is quite a sizeable sum when viewed against our national expenditure.</P>
    <P>One other point that might be made is that the time penalty clause which is operating impressively in the claim for disability benefit might be deleted. I think it is unfair and unreasonable to penalise anyone by two or three days in the payment of benefits.  These people who claim disability benefit do not send for the illness.  Indeed it comes to many of them at a time when they are least able to afford it, and certainly when the income of the household is depleted to a considerable extent, they cannot afford any further diminution of their income.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the abolition altogether of this time penalty clause.</P>

      <P>I draw attention to a peculiar situation which I can see arising as a result of these increases. You can have a contributory old age <Col N="199" /> pensioner getting less from 1st August to 1st January next than a non-contributory old age pensioner.  I was always under the impression, in my ignorance, that you either qualified for a contributory pension or you did not.  There was no such thing as partially qualifying, or qualifying for a smaller pension than the full amount.</P>
      <P>I came across a case lately in which representation was made to the Minister. He wrote back as follows:</P>
      <P>With reference to your representation on behalf of &mdash;&mdash;, I am directed by the Minister for Social Welfare to state that the rate of old age contributory pension in payment to &mdash;&mdash; is 38/- a week, which is the rate appropriate to the case of a person whose yearly average number of contributions paid or credited is 24 or more, but less than 30.</P>
      <P>This is the case of a contributory old age pensioner who now has 38/-.  When the non-contributory pensioner gets the increase, he will have 47/6d. and this position apparently will remain unaltered until next January.  The contributory pensioner in this case will have something in the region of 9/-less between August and January than the non-contributory old age pensioner. That is something which should be rectified.  It is something which to me sounds all wrong.</P>
      <P>Another matter which I think this year, for some reason more than any other year, is causing extreme hardship is the unemployment period situation. Two people came to me within the last week and they said: &ldquo;You would not believe it but I have met hungry people in rural Ireland.&rdquo;  It is not possible to get employment and these people are out of employment and they have been cut off for unemployment assistance.  I think this benefit is so small that there is no man able to work who would not work and be glad to get it if there were a possibility of his getting it.  There is something totally wrong about the fact that because a man lives one side of a border he does get it and if he lives at the other side, he does not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> There is something wrong with the social welfare code that allows that sort of thing to happen in a country like this.</P>
    <P>I represent an area which the Minister represents and I have occasion to visit that area fairly frequently and hear about the difficulties of the people.  What invariably amazes me is the amount of hardship suffered through ignorance of the benefits that are available for people.  Somebody else here referred to the need for some sort of way of informing these people of their rights and of the various benefits available to them if they only know where to look for them.  I know that in England there is a voluntary organisation called the Citizens Advice Bureau.  This Citizens Advice Bureau fulfils the need there.  I think there is great need for something on similar lines in this country.  In areas such as Ballyfermot, it is simply amazing the number of people who are suffering severe hardship and who do not know where to turn to get the benefit of these various services which could at least alleviate to a considerable extent the suffering and hardship they are enduring.  This Citizens Advice Bureau is a voluntary organisation and is recognised by the local authorities and the State bodies, and works in conjunction with the various charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy D. Costello who referred to this as some sort of domiciliary service or, at least, something worked in conjunction with a domiciliary service.  I feel many people in this country, because we have not such a service, are forced into hospitals, and into institutions of all sorts, and because of the inadequacy of their benefits and the smallness of their pensions.  In the long run, I think the State would gain considerably by making more adequate provision by way of pension or social welfare benefit of one sort or another.  I know considerable improvements have been introduced on this occasion and they are very welcome.  One provision which is particularly welcome is that which allows smallholders in certain parts of the country to go on working <Col N="201" /> their holding without any danger of losing their social welfare assistance.</P>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with those Deputies who have expressed the view that it is all wrong that this benefit is not general throughout the country. It is quite right to say there are small farmers in every part of Ireland who have excellent land but who have also areas of extremely bad land.  It seems completely wrong to restrict this to selected areas.  There is something completely unfair and inequitable about </P>
    <P>It is a very admirable provision that people should be allowed to go on working and take an interest in their business and in their small farms without the fear of an investigation officer coming along to seize on the fact that they are helping in a small way or, indeed, in some cases passing the time by giving assistance, to reduce their benefits.</P>
    <P>I drew the Minister's attention some months ago to a case in the west of Ireland.  It was the case of a woman who owned a very small rural licensed premises and a small bit of land.  The business was so small they could not afford to pay anyone to help run it, and it and the farm were given over to a married son who had some small children.  The mother got the pension. One day, while her son was out milking the cow, the investigation officer called and found her doing something in the shop.  Her pension was reduced by £1 per week.  That sort of undesirable situation should not arise. It is a practice the Minister should discourage.  When I raised this case on a previous occasion, the Minister promised to look into it.  I have not heard since what happened.  If the idea is to prevent people from taking some interest in life simply because we give them something in the nature of an old age pension, then there is something radically wrong with our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>With regard to children's allowances, every time there is an addition to the family, a new book is issued and, in some cases, there may be as many as half a dozen books presented at <Col N="202" /> the post office for children's allowances. Again, if a child will be 16 in August, a book is issued with all the pages except one for July.  That seems to me quite extraordinary.  What they do in Britain is simply call in the book and change the allowance.  There is no series of books.  The Minister might look into the position.  At the moment it seems to me both cumbersome and wasteful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the position Deputy Clinton has detailed is, in fact, the position that will develop between August and January, then it will be a wholly undesirable development.  It is desirable that people should be encouraged to insure against old age and other disabilities from which mortals suffer.  It seems to be entirely wrong that some classes of social welfare recipients should benefit in August whilst other classes must wait until January.  I should like to hear the Minister's justification for that particular position.  It does not seem to me to be tenable and it is certainly one the Minister should not allow to develop in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister may argue that those in receipt of the contributory pension may, in fact, be earning an income far in excess of what a person would get who is entitled to the maximum non-contributory pension, but that does not provide an answer to offending against the principle that the contributory pensioner should receive more because he has paid for it as against the non-contributory pensioner who has not paid anything.  One could argue for equal benefits for both because those who did not contribute cannot be blamed for that: they simply had not the means to do so.  To put those who contributed at a disadvantage is, in my opinion, an entirely undesirable development.  I shall be interested to hear the Minister try to justify the discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drew the Minister's attention to-day to a problem which exists in Dublin suburbs.  As a man and as a public representative, the Minister is, I feel, well aware of the problem.  It is the problem facing people in Dublin local authority housing estates who are <Col N="203" /> dependent on allowances paid by way of unemployment assistance or benefit, because of disability or for some other reason.  The Minister is well aware that all these benefits are paid on the same day and from an early hour large queues form at suburban post offices, very often long before the opening hour.  Even though extra staff are brought in to pay the allowances, many recipients have to wait an hour or more, sometimes longer, before they get their benefits.  Many of the beneficiaries, because of the inconvenience and the long delays, elect to take payment at some post office far removed from where they live.  They find the expense of a long bus journey and the inconvenience preferable to the hardship endured waiting for hours at local post offices.</P>
    <P>It must be a tremendous strain on the Department having to issue benefits for all the various categories involved on a particular day.  It seems to me these allowances could be paid on different days.  I do not know exactly how the Minister could apportion days; he could do it alphabetically perhaps.  If that were done, there would be a constant stream of applicants daily at local post offices and there would not be the present queueing up of applicants on a particular day, causing hardship to both the <Col N="204" /> applicants and the staff of the post office.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that there is no obligation on any recipient to apply for payment of the benefit on the day on which it is due.  Most of these recipients live from day to day, fighting against the stresses and strains of modern life, and it is inevitable that they must apply for the benefits on the first day on which they become payable.  The problem may not be as great in rural areas where postmasters and postmistresses probably welcome an influx of social welfare recipients.  On most days they would probably have only one or two callers at the post office.  But there is a real problem in Dublin and I do not think the Minister should wash his hands of it.  He should be man enough to admit that the problem exists and should take steps to alleviate it.  The steps are simple.  All that is required is the courage and determination not to allow precedent to prevent improvement. If that is done, there will be an end to the long agonising queues of human misery which form weekly and, in some cases, monthly, at post offices in the Dublin suburbs.</P>
