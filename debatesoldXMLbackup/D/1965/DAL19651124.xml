    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the B and I boat <i>Innisfallen</i> trading weekly from Cobh harbour to Britain is now due for dry-docking; and if he will see that this vessel whose whole income is derived from trading between the port of Cork and British ports will be dry-docked at Verolme dockyard so as to assist employment in the Republic from whence she derives her income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Ltd., that the annual overhaul programmes for their passenger vessels have to be planned well in advance and a strict time-table adhered to which is very inelastic because of the limited availability of suitable relief vessels for these highly specialised ships.  The possibility of carrying out the overhaul of the <i>Innisfallen</i> within the time limits available was discussed some months ago with the Verolme Cork Dockyard Company Ltd. and the Verolme Company are still studying the problem.  Should the dockyard consider that they can meet the requirements of the situation, they will be given the opportunity of quoting for the overhaul of the vessel next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The overhaul could be done at Verolme Dockyard this Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the reply, the arrangements have to be made well in advance and obviously other arrangements have been made. The question of whether they would be able to do the work within the time required is being studied for the next overhaul.  There are two other ships on this line, both of which will be coming up for the same consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be a question about them next week, I expect.  In connection with the <i>Innisfallen,</i> I should like to ask the Minister if it is a fact that this ship, due now for annual overhaul, is going to Dumbarton in Scotland for that overhaul while there are dockyards in this country capable of carrying out the work.  The B and I is now an Irish concern, taken over by the taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government policy statement on development centres and industrial estates, I have set up a senior interdepartmental committee to advise on the fulfilment of that policy, including the early establishment of industrial estates at Galway and Waterford.  At a meeting on 11th instant, the committee received the mayors of the two areas, with the managers and planning advisers.  An Foras Tionscal, which will be responsible for the administration of the estates, was also represented at the meeting.  Agreement was reached on the procedure to be followed in the establishment of the estates and on the immediate steps to be taken in regard to meeting site and other requirements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his attention has been drawn to a report of a court case in which it was stated that under the relevant regulation the owner of a vehicle was not liable for the vehicle's bald tyres; if he will state the relevant regulation; whether it was made by him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant regulations in this case are the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, which I made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  Sub-article (7) of article 16 of these regulations provides that no tyre used on a vehicle shall be excessively worn.  Article 6 of the regulations provides that where a vehicle contravening that provision is used on a public road by a person who is not the owner of the vehicle such owner shall also be guilty of an offence. Paragraph (b) of subsection (5) of section 11 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 provides that it shall be a good defence for the owner in such a case to show that the use of the vehicle on the occasion in question was unauthorised.</P>
      <P>I have no comment to make on the court decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in proceeding with this scheme is due largely to the difficulty experienced by the group in determining the precise number of participants.  The original number was 12, and this was increased to 21 when State grants were allocated in September, 1964.  I understand that the present position is that cash contributions have been collected from 15 persons, only, and that efforts are now being made by the group to increase the number of participants to a total of 26 persons.  I am informed that the group are seeking quotations for materials, etc., and that it is hoped to commence work early in the new year.</P>

      <P>We have no system known as a prisoner parole and rehabilitation system but if the Deputy has in mind the system of temporary release authorised by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 with which a system of pre-release corrective training is associated in Mountjoy Prison, I think that the following information may be what he has in mind.</P>
      <P>There are two prison welfare officers attached to Mountjoy Prison whose particular job it is to look after the welfare of prisoners, keep them in touch with their families, find jobs for them and help their rehabilitation generally.</P>
      <P>There are four officers assigned exclusively to the charge of selected prisoners who are given educational, trades or therapeutic training to fit them for discharge.  In addition, the Governor, Deputy Governor and six other officers devote a good deal of their time to supervising, lecturing, instructing and advising prisoners in the corrective training division.</P>
      <P>Since 1st April 1963, 529 prisoners were admitted to the corrective training division, 31 were subsequently withdrawn owing to unsuitability and after discharge from prison 55 were recommitted.  98 prisoners were granted temporary release on being placed in employment by the prison staff and none of them has come under unfavourable notice since.</P>
      <P>I might add that the penal reform system in St. Patrick's Institution which deals with the 16 to 21 age group includes educational and trades training in which all the inmates participate, as far as their capacities allow.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. J.J. Collins</b> asked the Minister for Justice if he has received any requests to grant an extension of service to members of the Garda Síochána who are holders of military service medals or certificates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In recognition of <Col N="193" /> the national service given by many of the early members of the Force, the older members of the Garda Síochána have already been granted substantial concessions in the matter of the age of compulsory retirement.  All members who joined before 1952 have been given the right to serve up to the age of 63 years, with a further extension to 65 years in the case of those holding either a service certificate, the 1916 Medal or the Service Medal with Bar. The maximum retirement age for members appointed since 1952 is 57 years.</P>
      <P>The question of allowing members to serve up to 65 years provided they are the holders of Medals without Bar has been submitted to every Minister for Justice in the past 20 years. It has not been found possible to grant the concession, as this would not be in the interests of the Force itself or of the proper policing of the country.</P>
      <P>If members of the rank of Garda who are holders of the Medal without Bar were given a further extension of two years up to 65 years, such a concession would also have to be given to sergeants, inspectors and officers, with the result that the Force generally would have a serious grievance in relation to the blocking of promotion opportunities.  Apart from that consideration, police duties require a degree of physical fitness which cannot be expected of gardaí over 63 years of age.  This retirement age is the highest in any known police force in the world; as I have mentioned already the normal retirement age for gardaí is now 57 years.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  I understand that the costs of this orchestra which were attributable to <Col N="194" /> sound radio amounted to £105,700, approximately, in the year ended 31st March, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has met the question I have put down.  Is it reasonable, when publishing the accounts of Radio Éireann or Telefís Éireann, to describe Radio Éireann as having experienced a serious deficiency in revenue when in fact Radio Éireann are carrying the entire cost of the Radio Éireann Orchestra, so called, which would be more properly described as a national orchestra? Would it not be more fitting to segregate the cost of the orchestra and allow the accounts of Radio Éireann to stand on their own so that the public might more correctly estimate the results of their operations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>Are not Radio Éireann distinct from Telefís Éireann?  If the public are to be correctly informed as to the relative performances of the two organisations, would it not be more rational to show the cost of the orchestra apart from the actual accounts of Radio Éireann?

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1965,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Order is to increase from £6,000,000 to £6,700,000 the maximum amount of borrowing by Aer Lingus that may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, as amended by the State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) (No. 2) Order, 1964, and the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Aer Lingus have arranged short-term borrowing in Britain to meet the final payments of approximately £1,250,000 on two short-haul jet aircraft already delivered. This arrangement is subject to the issue of a State guarantee and £636,000 of the borrowing relating to one of these aircraft has been guaranteed under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, bringing the total amount guaranteed under that Act in respect of Aer Lingus to £5,993,000 approximately. To enable a State guarantee to be given in respect of the borrowing for the second aircraft it is necessary to increase the limit of £6,000,000 to £6,700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Companies Bill, 1965 which is at present before the House provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for future borrowings of the air companies and for guarantees by the State of such borrowings so that the machinery of the State Guarantees Act will not have to be availed of in <Col N="213" /> respect of future borrowing transactions by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate that this Order is necessary and, because it is necessary, we agree with it.  Nevertheless, I feel constrained to say that the tendency with regard to State companies generally, and particularly with regard to Aer Lingus, seems to be an upward trend all the time.  Each year more and more money seems to be required. This trend cannot be welcome to anybody, not even to the Government. Could the Minister, I wonder, give us any indication as to whether he has any information from Aer Lingus that, within the reasonably foreseeable future, they will find themselves on the road towards saving, reducing or even paying back something? Otherwise, we shall have to continue this rather chaotic financial arrangement of increasing from year to year the amounts they are enabled to borrow.  I do not think it is a healthy trend but, in view of the fact that the Minister says this £500,000 is required to pay the balance of £1¼ million for two short-haul jets, it would be unreasonable to withhold the money at this stage, but this is not a practice this Party would regard with favour in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not look alarmed.  I think it appropriate to avail of this occasion to say that, in view of the exceptional excellence of the services provided by Aer Lingus, we ought to lean backwards in helping them to make the service even better internationally than it already is.  I sympathise with Deputy Lindsay's views, but I have often felt Aer Lingus were bearing an unreasonable handicap in having to compete with all the other continental air lines with propeller aircraft when most of the other continental <Col N="214" /> air lines had available to them these medium jets.  It does seem absurd to those of us who remember the time when there were available only railways and boats to realise that we have now become so accustomed to air transport that even when travelling a relatively short distance such as from Malaga to Madrid or Paris to Strasbourg, if you have to choose between propellor aircraft and jet aircraft, you are prepared to go to some inconvenience to avail of the jet aircraft and consequent shortening of the actual journey in the air.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of this short-haul jet aircraft was very necessary to give Aer Lingus an opportunity of competing effectively with the very intense competition they have to meet on the continental and British air routes.  In my experience I have found the service of Aer Lingus to be so excellent in comparison with the other air companies of which I have some considerable experience in other parts of the world that I am glad that we can find it financially possible to make available to them this improved equipment so that they may keep the place they have so hardly earned in the intensely competitive market in which they have been called upon to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like on behalf of the Labour Party to welcome this motion by the Government and to say that we find no difficulty whatsoever in supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay a brief tribute to Aer Lingus.  The number of times in recent years I personally have travelled by Aer Lingus is very small but on those occasions I have always found the organisation efficient, the staff courteous and the service in every way such as to commend it.  The main criterion in judging the service of Aer Lingus is the fact that people get to their destination.  The accident-free record of Aer Lingus is unequalled by any other air company in the world and this is the main criterion by which they should be judged.  There is no point in having an air company which can provide cheaper flight, faster flights or more comfortable flights if the accident rate is above what it <Col N="215" /> might be.  In my opinion, judged by that criterion, Aer Lingus are away beyond any other company in the world.  If the borrowing of this money enables them to extend the service and develop further, we are only too glad to give our wholehearted support to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dillon, Deputy Norton and Deputy Lindsay for their comments on this Order.  I should say that Aer Lingus are constantly growing in terms of numbers of passengers carried and in amount of freight taken as are Aerlinte, and for that reason capital must be found for increasing the number of aeroplanes and for providing the necessary equipment, spares and administrative facilities.  For example, Aer Lingus recently spent some £850,000 on an air reservation system in the company's building and the interest on that capital will virtually be met by the savings resulting from a more efficient system of booking.  As many Deputies know, unfortunately, people all over the world over-book for flights and very often people book as many as two or three seats on different flights for the same destination. The air reservations system worked by computer should be able to eliminate some of the cost to Aer Lingus of that kind of over-booking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay will be glad to know, as I am sure he has appreciated already, that the Government had decided that the time had ended for issuing to the air companies direct State capital to be remunerated in fact by the taxpayer and upon which Aer Lingus and Aerlínte were paying no dividends or interest of any kind. The agreement with the Government to provide funds not exceeding £2 million for BAC 111 aircraft represented the last direct capital contribution of the Government towards the air companies.  The remainder of the money, some £5 million, has to be raised by Aer Lingus from their own resources and, if necessary, guaranteed, as is indicated in the case of this Order. The capital requirements of the two air companies in the next four or five years have been indicated to the Government and I think I am right in <Col N="216" /> saying that the air companies are keeping within the limits of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in regard to these capital requirements.</P>
    <P>The House will be glad to know that if Deputies should examine the last accounts of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte they will see depreciation reserves have been put aside, particularly in the case of Aerlínte, over and above those normally decreed in account keeping.  I think a sum of £700,000 was put aside for extra depreciation reserves for Aerlínte and these were indicated in the published accounts.</P>
    <P>So I do not think the capital of the air company is growing beyond their capacity to discharge their financial commitments.  The capital growth reflects the growth of the company.  In this particular case it was resulting from the difficulties that had been experienced in financing public capital programmes.  Aer Lingus have now arranged to pay for this aircraft by deferred payments and these have been arranged with the British Aircraft Corporation and because of that it was necessary to increase the amount of money guaranteed by the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964. The arrangement is satisfactory financially and is good business.  I thank the House for its approval of the Order.</P>

    <P>Amending legislation of a somewhat similar nature was necessary in the case of Aer Lingus and other companies covered by the State Guarantees Act, 1954 and, more recently, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board; and the necessary provision was made in the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964 and the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1965.  In the present case, however, the guarantees which the Minister for Finance may give extend only to payments in respect of contracts for the provision of goods and services and do not extend to borrowings.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill extends the powers of the Minister for Finance in the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962 to enable him to guarantee payments by the Board in foreign currencies and establishes the method of calculating the equivalent in Irish currency of moneys due by the Board in foreign currency.  Rules for conversion follow those in the State Guarantees (Amendment) Act, 1964. Such conversion is necessary to determine the value in Irish currency of the guarantees given by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of subsection (2)  of section 2 of the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962, which prescribes the maximum amount of principal in Irish currency which may be guaranteed at any one time.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the necessity for this Bill and appreciate the technical nature of it and accordingly propose to give the Minister his Second Reading by agreement today.  We are nevertheless, somewhat perturbed, as I have already said in relation to the State Guarantees Order, about the continuing and ever-recurring need on the <Col N="218" /> part of the Board to seek State aid.</P>
      <P>Not so very long ago I was very pleased to see a newspaper headline; &ldquo;CIE saves £½ million.&rdquo;  Whatever good news value that headline might have had is shattered, to my mind, by this Bill because to me it means the necessity for the State to come to the assistance of CIE in its current contracts. I take it this is a question of purchasing diesel engines from General Motors and that it is necessary for the State to guarantee moneys in that regard.  If that is right, I think the situation as portrayed in the newspaper headline to which I have referred is very strange indeed.</P>
      <P>Altogether I think the people of this country are surprised, disagreeably and uncomfortably surprised, as each year passes that companies of this kind which said years back that they only required a certain amount of time to pay their way&mdash;CIE was given a five-year plan some years ago and at the end of the five years, we found that we had to come to its assistance again &mdash; have to come back to this House again and again for support. There must be some reason for that, some reason that prevented the original five-year plan from being put into operation. I would be worried about this because CIE is operating less mileage of railway lines and as this Bill is concerned with the purchase of diesel engines, I cannot understand the necessity for more money to purchase more engines when lesser mileage is being operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is because the cost of replacement is great.  We are all aware that the cost of all replacements and, indeed, the cost of everything else, has risen to a very high degree but there should be something in the planning of companies such as this that would obviate the necessity for coming to the House in such a recurrent manner and looking either for a guarantee or for direct financial assistance. In the circumstances we are prepared to give the Minister a Second Reading of this Bill but we would like some kind of an assurance that the time has now arrived when companies such as this will pay their way <Col N="219" /> or else go into the money market and borrow so as to relieve the burden on the State.  Perhaps I have been expanding my references to CIE but at a time like this when everybody is being asked to tighten his belt and to bear the present financial strain and stress, State companies should do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the Deputy is saying, I would like to say that we are not asking for more capital for CIE.  This comes within the terms of the programme envisaged at the time of the last Transport Act whereby CIE receives an annual subsidy of £2 million for five years and is to be advanced £6 million for its capital programme.  These payments come within the capital programme and do not involve any further advances from public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said that the purpose of the Bill is merely to guarantee by the Government the payments owed by CIE to the General Motors Company of America.  I find it strange that in the year 1965 the Government find it necessary to have this matter rectified because the contract was entered into in 1962.  It is no great tribute to General Motors, CIE or the Department of Transport and Power that the Minister now has to rectify something done in 1962.  I would like to know the circumstances that led up to this matter being discovered.  The principle of guaranteeing the price of goods purchased by CIE is not objectionable to us and I am glad to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the result of advice given to us by the legal authorities that there was an imperfection in the previous legislation and we want to make it clear now that the money could be expressed in dollars. This has been the procedure in a number of such cases.  Perhaps we should have had more forethought in regard to this but we are putting the matter right now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt already with the questions raised by Deputy Lindsay. This House has controlled the total capital expenditure of CIE as between <Col N="220" /> now and 1969 inclusive under which CIE receives a subsidy of £2 million a year and is allowed to borrow capital up to a certain figure.  The provisions of this Bill come within that capital programme.  We do ensure that capital expenditure is not used for unnecessary or extravagant purposes but diesel engines are essential to CIE. Old engines have to be replaced and standards of performance improved. This provision might be described as basic financing for CIE.  It is nothing of a marginal character.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night when I moved the adjournment, I had been dealing with two fundamental changes in the procedure in connection with workmen's compensation which it is proposed to effect by this measure.  I had dealt with most of what I wished to say on the first topic, namely, the transfer of the liability of the employer from his pocket to the pocket of the taxpayers.  There are just a few remarks I wish to make to supplement those observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see why the taxpayer should have to discharge the duties of big firms like Guinness's, Jacobs, Plunder and Pollock or any other industrialists throughout the country.  Certainly what the Minister has stated has not convinced me of the necessity, or even the desirability, of effecting that transfer. I would again emphasise the fact that the Minister's Department are not in any way qualified to do what will be a very difficult task which will require very much more specialised civil servants <Col N="221" /> than he has available at the present time.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the second point I want to develop a little further on the duties that will fall upon the Department and its personnel, consequent upon the taking away of the rights of the workman which it is proposed to effect by this measure.  At the present time and for many years past, a workman injured in the course of his employment had the right to go to court.  We all know the history or an outline of what has happened during that period.  That is relevant in connection with the remarks of the Minister when he said it causes controversy and bad will between employer and worker to have to go to court.</P>
    <P>Whatever may have been the development of the legal relationship between employer and worker in the past, I pointed out yesterday, and I repeat, that there are comparatively few cases that come before the courts of this country arising out of disputes between employer and workman.  They are dealt with expeditiously and cheaply and no workman has ever been deprived of resort to the courts to get justice because he has not had sufficient money.  Solicitors and counsel have always been ready to give their services free, if necessary.  These cases are so well groomed and the procedure is so well known that they can go through the courts in a very short space of time: cases dealing with workmen's compensation, whether they be in connection with the determination of liability or whether that liability having been determined by the court, they arise in the course of the years in connection with questions as to whether the workman is fit for work, whether he is fit for light work or whether he is completely incapacitated. All these matters are dealt with very expeditiously by people who know their job and who are able to do it in a manner satisfactory to both parties.</P>
    <P>It seems to me astounding that these rights are to be taken away from the workman, because under this Bill there is no resort to the courts.  The Minister stated that in certain respects there is an appeal from the <Col N="222" /> appeals officer, who exists at the present time under the Social Welfare code, to the High Court on a question of law.  That is only the question of insurability and nothing else, and the one thing that is unlikely to give any difficulty under the present Bill is the question of insurability, as to whether a man is entitled to be insured or not. That can go to the High Court, but what cannot go to the High Court or any other court is the vital questions as his rights, such vital questions as whether the accident of which he complains arose out of and in the course of his employment.  Inexperienced, untrained people will decide that very difficult issue.  The law books are full of cases from 1906 in connection with such matters.  It does not often happen that there is a dispute as to whether an accident arose in the course of employment or not, but if it does, any junior counsel down the country, in this city or anywhere else will know the legal principles to apply.  He is trained in that and it can be done very cheaply and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that it is a very bad principle to deprive the workman of his right to resort to the courts.  That is what is being done here and I do not see why it is being done.  I am not speaking on behalf of my confreres because they may lose a bit of business here; they will take it up somewhere else.  Although it may be said in a sneering way about my profession or the profession of solicitors, that is not the reason.  The reason is that workmen are going to be deprived of the rights they should have.  I would not like to have any right of mine decided by any civil servant if I could possibly avoid it, because he is not trained for that.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the provisions of this Bill which, if it passes into law, will determine the scope of the duties of and the matters which will have to be determined by the civil servants in the course of investigating these cases. There is no provision anywhere for the workman to come in and make his case.  At the very beginning in the definition section, it is merely stated that the basis of this code in future <Col N="223" /> will be the social welfare code.  I see no justification at all for making workmen's compensation part of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall the history of this matter for Deputies so that they can get it into perspective.  The workmen's compensation and employers' liability legislation started very early on and arose because of a judge-made law that an employer was not liable for the acts or negligence of his workmen. One of these learned gentlemen expressed horror that he should be made liable for the action of his footman causing injury to an underservant in the kitchen and from that gentleman's horror arose the matter of common employment which we in this legislature abolished.  For more than a century the doctrine of common employment, which had its origin in the way I have indicated, brought about the necessity for workmen's compensation and employers' liability codes. There was never a question of a social service code at all.</P>
    <P>There was a residue of matters left for which the employer was responsible in spite of the common employment situation which imposed liabilities on employers.  We have got rid of the doctrine of common employment and workmen can now sue at common law for the negligence of their fellow-servants or of their employers, but still we have the residue of workmen's compensation which in nearly all cases does not give sufficient to an injured workman who, therefore, if he can, will go to common law which, in spite of workmen's compensation, will be available to him under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to take this matter away from the courts but it is still proposed to leave, and properly so, the workers' right to use common law. This right, however, has been eaten into by this Bill.  Such cases are not easy to bring to fruition in courts: they are difficult cases to handle and Deputies who understand that will know the character of such cases.  I got the impression at one stage that the judiciary were trying to kill common law action by workmen after the common <Col N="224" /> employment doctrine had been abrogated by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>At all events, we now find that civil servants, untrained, without any knowledge of this code at all, without any knowledge of the problems that have been met with in day-to-day administration of the workmen's compensation code in reference to workmen's rights, have first of all to ascertain what is an occupational injury under subsection (2).  There, the basic rights of the workman are set forth and provide that every person employed in insurable occupational injuries employment shall be insured under the Act against personal injuries by accident arising out of or in the course of his employment.  That is the workman's right.  It is not to get compensation for injury: he has to prove and establish&mdash;and the Minister so stated in his opening speech&mdash;and the onus of proof is on him, that the accident arose out of and in the course of his employment.  Then you go to section 29 to find out what that means, who is to do it and how it is to be done. There you find the duty imposed on the officials of the Department set forth in great detail and complex language.  It provides that where, in relation to any claim for occupational injuries benefit, it is decided that the relevant action was or was not an occupational accident, an expressed declaration of that fact shall be made and recorded and, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, a claimant shall be entitled to have the question whether the relevant accident was an occupational accident decided, notwithstanding that his claim is disallowed on other grounds.  That is not very clear as it stands and you must go to subsection (5) to find out what is meant.  You will find there that an occupational accident takes place if:</P>
    <P>(a) it arises out of and in the course of his employment,</P>
    <P>(b)  that employment is insurable (occupational injuries) employment, and</P>
    <P>(c)  payment of occupational injuries benefit is not precluded because the accident happened while he was outside the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> You have several decisions there to be made.  The accident must arise out of and in the course of his employment. The employment must be insurable occupational injuries employment. Who is to decide that?  It is to be decided by civil servants who have no legal qualification.  I should not like to have any of my rights decided in that way.  I think&mdash;I raised it in the House before&mdash;that there should be some appeal from the decision under the social welfare code other than the very limited appeal there is on the question of insurability.  If there was ever a judicial power conferred on non-judicial persons this is one if not more.  Civil servants, untrained, are to decide very serious matters in the absence of court procedure, in the absence of any power given to the workman to have his case met or made.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in that section to entitle a workman to go in and get his case made.  I do not care whether he gets a solicitor, counsel or a trade union official, but here he cannot bring anyone in anywhere.  The proposition put to him is: &ldquo;You are or you are not in insurable employment&rdquo;.  That is a most difficult, complex, judicial determination that may be determined and fixed in the absence of the workman. That is absolutely unjustifiable and as far as I am concerned, as long as this Bill is before the House, it will receive my uncompromising opposition and I hope it will ultimately dawn on the Government and on those supporting this part of the Bill that it is unjust and unfair and probably unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I have recited some of the judicial things these civil servants, untrained, have to do.  Then you come along and find they have further matters to decide.  In subsection (3) of section 3 they have to decide what is a contract of service.  Lawyers know the difference between a contract of service and a contract for service.  I should like to know if the Departmental officials in this case have the remotest notion of how these matters are to be determined, of how the workmen's rights are to be determined, not by anything <Col N="226" /> put up on his behalf but by a determining official in the Department.</P>
    <P>Then, in the next section, there is a question of the casual nature of the employment to be determined.  The question of whether the workman comes within the code at all may turn on a decision on this very difficult question. Subsection (4) deals with the occupations that are not subject to the social security code and says that, certain things being taken into consideration, the workman was or was not engaged in employment of a casual nature. That is a difficult thing.  In the last month I have had a very difficult case of a workman whom I was advising, voluntarily, may I say, on the question of the liability of the employer.  The first thing that had to be decided was whether it was casual employment and the second was whether it was about the employer's business.  That is a very difficult matter.</P>
    <P>May I say, incidentally, that I do not know what provisions of this Bill deal with casual work.  One always has to watch, when insuring under the present code against liability for workmen's compensation in respect of casual workers and one must be absolutely sure the policy covers casual workers.  The principal instance that arises is the worker who comes to clean the windows.  Is he a casual worker or under a contract of service within the meaning of sections I have already referred to?  I do not know what provision is made in this Bill for casual workers except to say that they are not within the scope of the Bill if they are working about the employer's house.  If they are not doing that, or other work of a domestic character, do they or do they not come within this Bill?  I do not know.  What shall we do then?  Under the code as it stands, you insure against liability for casual workers; if you do not, you are a fool.  Under this Bill, do we pay 2/1 and 1/6, or both, and also leave ourselves open to liability not covered in this Bill for workers of a casual nature?</P>
    <P>Why are casual workers excluded? I do not know.  They may be caught within the general scope of the measure but at any rate these are matters of a <Col N="227" /> very difficult legal character on which the rights of persons will depend and they will be decided, not after hearing arguments and consideration of all the facts put forward by both sides, but by the decision&mdash;the opinion&mdash;of one person with no liability to give any reasons for the decision.  As I have pointed out repeatedly, an opinion like this is not worth anything except to the extent of the validity of the reasons on which it is based.  One may be told the accident did not occur in the course of one's employment but one is not given any reasons for that.  One will not be able to put one's own reasons forward.  But it is a very convenient thing for a body that has to determine the rights of other persons not to have to give any reasons or arguments on which its opinions are based.  Once you do that, you are open to attack and the less you say the better.</P>
    <P>There are some more things I must deal with.  Section 4 (1) says:</P>
    <P>An accident arising in the course of an injured person's employment shall be deemed for the purposes of the Acts, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, also to have arisen out of that employment.</P>
    <P>Somebody must decide what is &ldquo;evidence to the contrary&rdquo; and that is a very difficult point.  We have at present in the definition of what is an occupational injury giving rise to compensation that it must arise in the course of the employment but here it says also that it can be deemed to have arisen out of the employment, unless there is evidence to the contrary. Somebody may give evidence to the contrary and the worker may know nothing about it.  The decision will be made in his absence.  He does not get an opportunity of hearing it.  That is a very serious matter because this is not the sort of thing that should be determined other than by a court or some person with judicial knowledge.</P>
    <P>The next subsection deals with a series of incidents which would give rise to a claim for compensation.  This is the case where there is a question of what is called larking or negligence <Col N="228" /> or misconduct by another person or by the insured person being struck by lightning, and where the insured person does not directly or indirectly induce or contribute to the happening of the accident by his conduct outside the employment and so on.  It would take any judge, even an experienced one, to determine the facts on that section but the workman will not be given a chance.  I referred last night to the duty that will be in the official mind above all else to protect this Fund.</P>
    <P>I had experience of this myself in connection with unemployment insurance. Officials will be bound to consider all matters in that way.  This serious matter of whether an insured person did not directly or indirectly contribute to the accident is to be decided and the rights of the employee will be decided in his absence and certainly without giving him a full opportunity to make his case.  He will know the decision and will be told. &ldquo;You can appeal if you like.&rdquo;  He will get the same treatment again on appeal unless there is some resort to the court.</P>
    <P>There are other matters of this kind all through the Bill.  The Minister has power to make regulations of a most extraordinary kind almost to the extent of changing the Bill.  I do not know where we are going in regard to bureaucracy.  There was much discussion here about bureaucracy in regard to the budgetry proposals but we shall get in regard to so-called bureaucracy exactly what we want here.  If we do not want bureaucracy we have the remedy in our own hands; if we want it, there is no use in complaining about the results later when we do not take steps to stop it.</P>
    <P>We have most extraordinarily wide powers of regulation of all kinds in this Bill.  Perhaps I should start with section 27 which deals with the prescribed notice of accidents.  Notice must be given in a prescribed time and form by the person claiming insurance and if he fails to do that without good reason, he is disqualified. Could there be any greater exercise of judicial power than the power given to a person to decide these matters? The regulations will do it: The Minister <Col N="229" /> will say what is this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>There have been many cases in the court about failure to give notice of an accident and the workmen's advisers are alerted to the necessity for giving notice and where a client does not give the notice, they have to go in because frequently when a man is injured, he forgets to give notice or thinks somebody else will do it.  Now it will be worse because no judge at present if he can possibly do it, unless there is grave injustice to the employer, would ever permit lack of notice to interfere with a person's rights.  They may be very seriously interfered with here, because failure without good cause to give the prescribed notice will disqualify and that is going to be decided by civil servants and nobody else, and nobody may appeal from that and no reasons will be given. That is not correct.  It is unjust to the workman.  It is only one of the many ways in which the rights of the workman are interfered with prejudicially in this Bill.  There should be resort to the courts in all these cases, which will be cheaper, more expeditious and done by people who know what they are doing.</P>
    <P>You have the regulations in regard to the reporting of accidents by employees.  I do not know what will happen to workmen if they do not do it, if they pass it up without bothering their heads.  As I said last night, this Bill favours the employers.  They have very little to do now.  Under the regulations they are supposed to facilitate the giving of notice of accidents and all that class of thing.  But all that is very easy compared with the liability of a workman who is injured.  He has to give notice of the accident although there may be many people around the place looking at it at the time.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is a section that so far has not been referred to and it requires very great consideration. Regulations made under it may disqualify a person from receiving benefit for any period not exceeding six weeks if he fails to submit himself for examination and so on or fails &ldquo;to observe any prescribed rules of <Col N="230" /> behaviour.&rdquo;  How is that justified? What are the rules of behaviour that will be prescribed?  He may be disqualified by these officials for six weeks, although his family may be starving, if he does not behave himself in the way the Minister says he is to.</P>
    <P>There is no appeal.  Under the present code, a man is entitled to work when he can, to do light work when he is able to do it.  There is nothing to prevent him from getting his compensation or to provide that he will be disqualified if he does not conform with certain rules of behaviour.  In the normal course, if he did not submit himself in the proper way for a medical examination, the court could take other medical testimony and act on that.  But here he is going to be disqualified. That is new.  That is not merely depriving a workman of his rights but imposing new liabilities on him that did not exist before.</P>
    <P>In section 32 we read:</P>
    <P>Regulations may provide for treating a person for the purposes of this Act as incapable of work as the result of an accident or injury when he would not be so treated apart from the regulations, and may also make provision&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  as to the days which, in the case of a person who at any time is or is to be treated as incapable of work as the result of an accident or injury, are or are not to be treated for the purpose of occupational injuries benefit as days of incapacity for work, and</P>
    <P>(b)  as to the day which, in the case of night workers and other special cases, is to be treated for the purpose of occupational injuries benefit as the day of the accident.</P>
    <P>What is the meaning of that?  It means what the civil servants say it means. When that is construed&mdash;as it probably will be&mdash;against a workman, there will be no resort to the courts.</P>
    <P>I have gone only very casually through some of the functions that will be imposed on these inexperienced <Col N="231" /> persons.  The result will be to deprive workmen of existing rights or resort to the court and impose on them obligations that do not exist at present.  That is not justice.  It is not something we ought to do.  It will be in strict accordance with bureaucracy.  That is what we will get if we let them.  Now is the chance to stop that.  There is no reason why the workman should not have resort to the Circuit Court.  It would be done there far more cheaply and quickly than it would be done under the way now proposed.  As it stands, the workman has not resort to the courts other than for insurability.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, what is proposed now is entirely different from what is imposed on civil servants by the Social Welfare Acts as they stand at present. They have very much more important matters to decide and determine judicially affecting a person's rights.  If you have a workman now stated by his employer to be capable of work, that can be determined by the one person who can give a judicial determination. One doctor comes in and says he is fit and another doctor says he is not.  The judge determines between them or gets in a medical referee.  What can happen here is that a civil servant can say: &ldquo;You are capable.  Go out and do it.&rdquo;  You have to go out because the civil servant says it or your compensation is stopped.  You have no right to go before a medical tribunal or anything of that kind.  You must attend at some official place before an official medical man.  You cannot have your own doctor who might say: &ldquo;I do not agree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental right taken away from the workman by this Bill. Are we going to stand for that?  I would be very interested to hear some views on that matter.  At present the workman can have his own doctor and can have very good specialists.  I have seen some of the best specialists in the country come down to court on behalf of very humble workmen.  It is not a question of insurance companies being able to pay.  They can have their own choice of doctor.  Under this they <Col N="232" /> are told they have to go before A, B, C or D, who will have the official view and attitude.  He will be there, first, to keep his job and, second, to protect the fund.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on the question of damages.  Section 38 deals with the matters to be taken into account in the common law proceedings brought by the workmen entitled to do so to get damages.  Why should we interfere with their rights?  They have the same rights in respect of negligence as any other person, if they can bring themselves within the law so far as their employers are concerned. It is true they should not have both remedies.  That is provided for under the present code.  If you get damages, your workmen's compensation can be deducted from the amount of damages to be given.  I fail to understand why this particular provision should be put into section 38.  It is a provision I really do not understand at all.  I understand that, when you tell a judge and jury that the injured person is entitled to a certain amount of damages, he is in the first place entitled to get whatever loss he sustained. That is part of the primary right, but apparently it will not be done here. It is all right to say:</P>
    <P>...there shall in assessing those damages be taken into account, against any loss of earnings or profits which has accrued or probably will accrue to the injured person from the injuries, the value of any rights which have accrued or probably will accrue...</P>
    <P>He got compensation and credit is entitled to be taken for that as at present.  But why put in the other stuff? What is meant by the jargon?  It is almost impossible to know what it means.  It says:</P>
    <P>...there shall in assessing those damages be taken into account, against any loss of earnings or profits which has accrued or probably will accrue to the injured person from the injuries, the value of any rights which have accrued or probably will accrue to him therefrom.</P>
    <P>When you come before a jury looking <Col N="233" /> for damages for injuries, it is assessed once and for all on the last day when the jury come in with their verdict and the judge gives his decision.  You take into account all the loss involved in income, wages, or whatever it may be. How can you ask a judge and jury to project themselves into the future?  It is contrary to law, contrary to justice and another evasion of the workman's rights.</P>
    <P>The next point is a small matter but I mention it to show the lack of consideration and the lack of knowledge on the part of those responsible for this Bill.  Under the Civil Liability Act passed by this House, a right was given though it existed before that time, to dependants of a workman or of any person killed by the negligence or fault of another person to get the expenses of the funeral, debts, and that kind of thing.  What do we do here?  We say that, if a workman gets that under a previous section of this Bill, then something is to be done by way of not giving double payments.  Under section 22 there is, apparently, a right to get a grant of £50 but that is immediately cut down by the second subsection. The first subsection says:</P>
    <P>Death benefit by way of a grant of fifty pounds in respect of funeral expenses shall, subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, be payable in respect of the death of the deceased.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>In any such case as may be specified by regulations, the reference to fifty pounds in <i>subsection</i> (1) of this section shall be construed as a reference to such amount less than fifty pounds as may be specified by the regulations for that case.</P>
    <P>You will not get £50, in other words, &ldquo;in any such case as may be specified by regulations&rdquo;.  John Jones will get £50 but Mary Flaherty will get less, provided her name is put in regulations. Did you ever hear such nonsense? But that is what the section says.</P>
    <P>You find then that a workman has a right to go in common law for damages and under legislation passed by this <Col N="234" /> Oireachtas he has a right to get his reasonable funeral expenses not cut down to any amount.  Then you say that, whatever a workman gets under this, you deduct it.  That is all right, but let us see what it does.  Section 38, subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding section 50 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, in assessing damages in respect of a person's death under Part IV of that Act, account may be taken of any death benefit by way of grant under section 22 of this Act in respect of funeral expenses resulting from the person's death.</P>
    <P>Why should the taxpayers not get the benefit of making the negligent party pay?  You let off the insurance company and you make the taxpayer pay. That is what is here and that is why I point to this as showing a lack of appreciation of the problems being dealt with by this Bill.  A workman is suing on his common law right against a person who is negligent and, under the law, he is entitled to get his reasonable funeral expenses, but the insurance company under this is to get the benefit of what the taxpayer pays under the Bill.  Does anybody think there is rhyme or reason in that?  This is an absolutely ill-considered Bill despite the lapse of three years after the recommendation in both the Majority and the Minority Reports.  This is presented to us as a grand Bill, something worth waiting three years for.  That is the kind of stuff we get and all the time we are taking away the rights of workmen and also imposing additional obligations.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to deal with is the lump sum.  One would think this Bill was something tremendous because it does not give any lump sum.  That shows that those at the back of it know nothing about what goes on in workmen's compensation cases in the country.  The fact that workmen could get something from their insurance companies which they will not be able to get under this Bill was a tremendous instrument and a valuable privilege.  A very valuable right is now being taken away from them.  Under the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="235" /> Acts, there was provision for allowing employers to redeem the weekly payments.  Some people may say that lump sums were frittered away.  Some of them may have been but a great many benefited by getting a lump sum.  They were able to set up in little businesses.  Some of them bought farms.  Some may have dissipated the lump sum but, by and large, it was a good thing and anybody who says the lump sum should be done away with is talking of something about which he knows nothing.</P>
    <P>That was one aspect.  There was another even more valuable than that. There was the workman who got compensation either by agreement with his employer or by order of the court. The compensation dragged on and there was a good deal of worry as to whether the workman was fit for light work or had recovered from his incapacity.  All sorts of questions arose and the insurance company, in the phrase, wanted to get him off their books.  That was a most valuable right for the workman because instead of being harassed by directions to go back and try to work, he could go to his solicitor or counsel and the latter could make a very valuable arrangement with the insurance company to buy the workman off.  The workman got a lump sum.  That has gone.  That was a very valuable right.  Any junior counsel of even a few months' standing could tell the Minister how valuable that was.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Minister comes in here and talks as if he has achieved something wonderful in doing away with this lump sum.  Of course, he does not know what he is talking about. That was a very valuable right and workmen will find to their cost, when they are dealing with civil servants, that they cannot buy themselves off. That has gone.  In case anybody may be under any misapprehension, no settlement could be made at the expense of the workman because the settlement had to go before the county registrar and, if necessary, the Circuit Court judge.  The county registrar might object to the settlement on the ground that the workman was overborne <Col N="236" /> by the insurance companies and their officials or that he was too anxious to settle in order to get some money into his hands.  The county registrar could refuse to accept the settlement and he could bring it before the Circuit Court judge.  That was a very valuable right.  That is swept away now in a paean of praise by the Minister.  He knows nothing about it.</P>
    <P>A man who was injured in the course of his employment could sue his employer in the ordinary way at common law.  He was entitled to do that under an Act passed when, I am glad to say, we were in office.  It was not a question of a man electing to take compensation giving up another right. He had the right to sue the employer at common law and, if he did not succeed, he had the right to retain his compensation.  It was a well-known practice in the legal profession that, when a case did not appear to be as good as it should be, or proof was somewhat difficult, one went to the other side and asked: &ldquo;What will you give us?&rdquo;, and the value of a lump sum equivalent to the workmen's compensation was taken into account. That has gone now.  That is in ease of the insurance company, again in ease of the employer.  It is another instance where the Bill favours employers and is against the workman.  That case of the workman is gone.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we should be thinking that this is a wonderful Bill. So far as it increases benefits, of course it is about time it was done.  So far as it affects workmen's rights, to the extent particularly that it prevents them from taking their rights and getting them adjudicated on in court or by some judicial body, I am uncompromisingly against it and will do everything I can as long as I can to see that it does not go out as not merely a menace to the workman but as a standing disgrace to the Dail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to repeat Deputy Tully's welcome of this Bill and I do so because of the fundamental change the Bill introduces in regard to the position of injured workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, but it is <Col N="237" /> no harm to mention again, that from the point of view of an injured workman, the desire is to be treated on the basis that if he is injured in the course of his employment he should have some proper way of receiving compensation while he is unable to work and that there should be financial provision for his family and that his case will not be, as too many of them were down the years, the subject of legal experiment and of legal battles where the hardship involved for the injured workman and his family was not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is not very much comfort for a married man with a family who suffers injury in the course of his employment to be faced with the situation that his employer has not taken out employers' liability insurance cover and the consequent doubt as to whether the employer will be in a position to pay and to continue to pay even the inadequate amount of workmen's compensation that was laid down.  There were too many cases over the years where employers failed to take out employers' liability insurance cover or where employers were unable to take out such cover except at prohibitive cost and because of these circumstances, a worker who suffered injury in the course of his employment ultimately had to go to the Department of Social Welfare or to the assistance officer for assistance for his family.</P>
    <P>It was for these reasons and because of the delay experienced in dealing with these problems and because of the completely unsatisfactory nature of the existing workmen's compensation legislation that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions campaigned for a modern, more rational and more humane basis for workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>No one from these benches would in any way cast a reflection on the many people in the legal profession who represented their clients capably and conscientiously.  No one casts a reflection on the many people in the legal profession, both solicitors and barristers, who are prepared to act, in many cases with very little financial <Col N="238" /> reward, but there was a problem of delay.  The workman who met with an injury reported the matter to his employer. While it is true that in recent years the number of cases in which it has been necessary to go to court to recover the weekly compensation payable has declined, nevertheless, there existed a certain number of cases where the employer, whether insured or otherwise, might not make the payment of the £4 10s. provided for in the code.  In that case a visit to the Department of Social Welfare was the inevitable consequence for the injured workman, to be registered and to give an undertaking there that if he subsequently recovered compensation, he would recoup the amount advanced by the Department.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill for a system of insurance in respect of injury to workmen is not new.  Such a system has operated for many years in Britain and in Northern Ireland and I have yet to hear of any great volume of protest from those immediately concerned and with whom we should be concerned, namely, injured workmen, against the system.  As far as I am aware, there has been no public outcry in regard to the change from the old concept of workmen's compensation to that now operating in Great Britain and that other section of our country, Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the introduction of the Bill and the general principles outlined here, we are entitled to make one comment arising from a statement by the Minister.  The Minister, in his summary of the situation, stated that during the year 1955 increases had been arranged in the amounts payable under Workmen's Compensation Acts and a Commission had been established in the same year to investigate the position in regard to workmen's compensation generally.  We are entitled to comment, not on the length of time taken by the Commission, because within a year or so of the Commission being established there were changes in the personnel and representation on that Commission by the inclusion of representatives of those who have been doing best out of <Col N="239" /> workmen's compensation and out of the contributions from workmen's compensation, namely the insurance companies.  A few years later, in 1963, the announcement came of the Government's intention to deal with injuries to workers under the Social Welfare Acts.  I have mentioned the inclusion of representatives of the insurance companies on the Commission and I want to say that they delayed the work of that Commission.</P>
    <P>However, the comment that is properly called for from this House is that from 1955 to 1965, a period of ten years, even though the matter was under careful examination and many meetings of the Commission were being held, there was one aspect of the situation which appears not to have got any great attention.  While that Commission was sitting, even though the cost of living was increasing steadily and to some extent wage rates and salary rates were also increasing, the position of the worker affected by the workmen's compensation code remained the same as it was in 1955.  I would like to hear the Minister justify his lack of activity in that regard.</P>
    <P>From 1955 to 1965, the maximum that injured workmen could obtain was £4 10/- per week.  I do not think it will be sufficient to say that the Government were examining the workmen's compensation code during that time, that the Commission would make recommendations and that a Bill would be brought in but that in the meantime the injured worker would have to make do on £4 10/- a week. All concerned in this matter have been heartless in that regard.  The decision to establish the Commission was made at the time Deputy Costello was Taoiseach and Deputy Corish, now the Leader of the Labour Party, was Minister for Social Welfare.  The decision to do this at that particular time, even though the results have been delayed, must bring some credit to the people responsible.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is designed to deal with the position of workers who meet with accidents and it has a <Col N="240" /> number of defects.  It is to some extent limited from the point of view of the fact that accidents do not just happen out of the blue.  Inherent in any approach to the question of compensation for injury through accident must be the question of what steps can be taken to avoid accidents.  The Bill does not deal at any great length with that aspect of the matter, although it may be said that the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in warning people about the prevention of accidents may to some extent deal with the matter of prevention.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the question of compensation, to some degree with hospitalisation, but it leaves the question of rehabilitation, which is ar inherent and essential part of the approach to the matter of injury to workers, in the area of the local authorities.  These people have not been too successful up to the present time in the operation of local health matters.  Deputies will be aware that there is a continuous stream of complaint about the lack of adequate health services and about the need to modernise and improve these health services.  To leave the question of the rehabilitation of injured workers in that area will hardly satisfy Deputies who are interested in this problem.</P>
    <P>On the Bill itself, there are a number of questions that should be asked. Does it cover people like part-time insurance agents?  Will it apply in the case of people who are employed by individuals?  There is an increasing tendency for householders to employ individuals temporarily to do small repairs.  These people are not dealing with builders' contractors as such.  They employ people to do painting, decorating and window-cleaning.  What is the position of people so employed or of the householder who employs them?  Will the householder who employs such a person be required to make a contribution in order to protect that person or will such a person be required to cover himself?</P>
    <P>Reference is made to this matter in subsection (3) of section 3 where it says in paragraph (b):</P>
    <P>Employment, which is neither wholetime as may be defined in <Col N="241" /> regulations nor under contract of service, as a member of a crew...</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to accidents to people going to work?  This is a matter which has been the subject of difficulty for years.  It has always been excluded from the workmen's compensation code.  Take the case of a man going to work on a bicycle or motorcycle at 6 o'clock in the morning in the kind of weather we have been having recently.  If he meets with an accident which prevents him from carrying on his normal employment and from providing for his family, if no one else is involved in the accident he has no case for compensation.  Is he to be treated in the same way under this new legislation as under the workmen's compensation code?  If we are having a new look at the question of injuries in employment we should look very carefully at this aspect.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a worker who is able to get out for half an hour or maybe an hour for lunch.  Because of the length of time available and because of traffic congestion, he has to rush in order to get back to work on time.  If such a person meets with an accident in which no one else is involved, even though it does not happen within the area of the factory, surely his case should be covered in an enactment such as this.  What about the question of injuries that may be suffered by workers in a canteen?  The majority of accidents in the canteen. These workers should not be excluded from the benefits of this Bill, and there are benefits in this Bill.  There is also the question of an accident occurring during an interval from work when the worker may not be on the premises but may be adjacent to the company's premises.  Section 4 (2) (c) reads:</P>
    <P>the insured person did not directly or indirectly induce or contribute to the happening of the accident by his conduct outside the employment or by any act not incidental to the employment.</P>
    <P>What exactly does that mean?  Does it mean, as might conceivably happen, <Col N="242" /> that a man might have a discussion with a workmate outside the factory and perhaps the following day they might be engaged at work carrying a heavy weight and because of the words spoken one of the men might be careless and drop the weight?  Would it cover the situation where due to an argument outside the factory, one of them was not as careful at work as he might have been with the result that his fellow worker received an injury? This section needs some explanation. Subsection (3) of the same section also requires careful examination.</P>
    <P>There are many sections in the Bill which could possibly be better dealt with by way of a discussion on Committee but there is this question.  Why limit the payment under the injuries clause to 26 weeks?  Is it because that is what applies in Britain or in Northern Ireland?  If that is the position, then let us also consider the rates of benefit that apply in Britain or in the North and the rates of payment that are made there as well.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the scheme is set out very clearly in the Minister's brief and there is no need to deal with it at this stage, but where a person dies as a result of an accident the payment of 24/- to the parent of that person appears to be very meagre indeed.  There is also a reference to compensation to married women who may be maintained by their husband and who meet with an injury.  In the case of widows and single women the compensation is the same.  If a married woman is a worker within the meaning of the Act and is working full time, why, if she meets with an accident, should the disablement sum be reduced?  If consideration is to be given to the total income of the family, there is here a case to be examined when the question of payment for injuries arises.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to look at the position in this respect and ascertain whether there is any justification for the payment of a reduced amount when the worker is a married woman.</P>
    <P>I should like also to get clarification in relation to women or others in part-time employment.  The Minister indicated that people who are on short <Col N="243" /> time would have their payments reckoned on the basis of the normal wages paid in that industry.  Does this apply to cases where part-time employment is a feature in the particular industry.  Does it mean that injured workers in such industries will be paid on the basis of the actual payments in the industries to similar workers?</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to express on my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, a welcome for this Bill which at least goes a considerable way towards dealing with a number of deficiencies as far as injured workmen are concerned.  There may well be a case to be examined in relation to the need for appeal machinery for injured workmen or for the setting up of a medical referee system.  I should like here to remind the Minister that in relation to the working of the various Departments, including that of Social Welfare, Deputies have a right to raise matters which come to their attention and to take them to the Minister.  Where workmen affected by the Bill may not be treated equitably, Deputies have a right to raise the matter publicly and demand a full investigation. At the moment, if a workman takes a case for workmen's compensation and the employer is not insured or has gone bankrupt and out of business, he may not get any payments and he has absolutely no recourse.  He can have the most highly paid legal representation but it is of no avail in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>What is to be the position of the many workers employed by firms who carry their own insurance? Are such people to be allowed to insist that injured workmen must come in even if not fully fit to work, or will they be allowed to have such workmen treated under the heading of illness, and transferred to social welfare payments?  The Minister is right &mdash;I do not often like to agree with him&mdash;when he says there have been a large number of cases in which lump sums have been awarded to the detriment <Col N="244" /> of the workmen.  There are many cases where workmen's compensation has been inadequate.  Married men with families have run into increasing debt because they have obtained only £100, £200 or £300 by way of a lump sum.</P>

      <P>It is very seldom measured in thousands.  In many cases where this has occurred the families have been in great need after a few months and there is no further compensation for them.  The position could arise where, because of their history of accidents, workers would find great difficulty in securing reasonably-paid employment.  In such cases lump sums have no great merit and we have all had experience of cases in which inadequate lump sums were accepted and where the families were in dire need after a few months.  While we feel that the level of the benefits provided in the Bill could stand some further examination, we agree that the sections concerned can be discussed and amended.  As I have said, the general principles of the Bill are welcomed. It should be of value to the people mainly concerned, those who are injured arising out of and in the course of their employment and who, up to the present, obtained benefits which were utterly inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill as a piece of progressive legislation and a forward step in the field of social justice.  The Minister is to be congratulated on it.  It is time the worker got this consideration of being treated as a human being rather than a digit by the Minister's Department and other Departments.  The Bill gives this consideration to workers and their families in times of stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first saw the Bill, I was aware that there would be a rush to the wailing wall by some members of the legal and medical professions and representatives of the insurance business.  All these will try to defend their own interests.  The Bill itself brings some contentment to the workers and as one who has worked in the shops, I am <Col N="245" /> satisfied that contentment is necessary and it comes not before its time.  In times of stress or accident, the worker goes through a period of great concern for himself, his family and his future. There have been defects in previous legislation from the points of view of both employer and employee.  Sometimes the employee is reluctant to proceed with a case.  The security provided by the Bill will let the worker know that he can be independent and have the means of survival at his disposal.</P>
    <P>One would think from Deputy Costello's contribution that there was nobody but the legal profession to save the workers.  We are well aware of the very many able members of the legal profession who performed great service in defence of the workers but nevertheless his suggestion that no worker or person in difficulties would be obliged to have cases undefended because there were many young counsel and young solicitors only too able and willing to take up these cases, does not conform to my experience.  I have never met them.  I am quite sure many unfortunate people I know who had accidents in the course of employment were unable to meet them. In any case if the young counsel are available, they would be inexperienced while the insurance company would have the benefit of personnel of long experience and specialisation in this field.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Larkin indicated, the previous Act was amended and a Commission set up by Deputy Costello and his Party.  It is true that they brought in the amending Act in 1955 giving weekly compensation of £4 10s., and certain other benefits and then set up the Commission.  The fact that the Commission was set up showed clearly the division of opinion between Fine Gael and the Labour Party at the time. The Commission was probably set up as a result of Labour's insistence.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of the Bill is to provide better benefits at more reasonable cost to the employer for the insured worker and his dependants. Compensation for an employment injury will henceforth be a social <Col N="246" /> service rather than an obligation on individual employers.  That is necessary and desirable.  In 1955 the Minister for Social Welfare set up the Commission to examine the matter. Deputy Costello had many things to say about the Commission.  He placed great importance on the fact that the majority of the Commission reported in favour of the present system.  Why should they not?  Apparently he blamed the Government for rejecting this advice.  Surely it was clear even in 1955 that the Majority Report would be in favour of retaining the existing system.  Surely the insurance representatives on the Commission would suggest that the present system is adequate because it served their interests best?</P>
    <P>It was also to be expected that representatives of the professions involved in administering the present system, medical and legal representatives, would favour retention of the present system. The employers' representatives naturally resisted the encroachment on private enterprise even when it was clear that to provide similar benefits for the workers would be more expensive for the employers.  The workers' representatives, however, saw the matter from the point of view of the workers; in other words, from the social welfare point of view.  Surely this was the correct recommendation, that a new system on the lines of the present Bill should be adopted.  I can well appreciate the desire of the medical and legal professions and of the insurance companies who now see their footing going, to dig in and indicate in some way that the Bill does not meet requirements and will in itself inflict hardship on the workers in some cases.</P>
    <P>Many of us who worked in industry are only too well aware of the great difficulty that exists regarding lump sum payments.  Some people benefit by them in starting up small shops or other such enterprises as indicated by Deputy Costello but the great bulk of injured workmen accept lump sums after prolonged negotiations.  They would settle for anything when the case is long drawn out and they are under pressure from shopkeepers, hire purchase companies <Col N="247" /> and others whose bills they are unable to meet, and no doubt many of the legal profession drew out some of the cases for the sake of the &ldquo;cut.&rdquo;  It is desirable to have that section deleted and compensation given in another form.</P>
    <P>Insurability is now being met by the employer, and rightly so.  It is right that it is being met on a broad basis.  If each individual employer were to meet the requirement of the Bill by insuring in the previous manner, it would be necessary for some of them to meet prohibitive costs charged by the insurance companies because of the difference in hazards of employments. Some employments have greater hazards than others.  The insurance companies allow for these things and set premiums which possibly might be beyond the reach of the employer.  Of course, the unfortunate workman who meets with an accident would suffer.</P>
    <P>That the awards will be available at the earliest possible moment is something that those concerned with the workers and the workers themselves will certainly welcome.  It is necessary for them to meet their day to day commitments without having to think whether the case will be a success or not.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings or the threat of legal proceedings have cost many a man his job or stopped the advancement of other members of his family in those concerns.  We are all aware of this.  I am certain members of the Labour Party are aware of it. A person is injured and proceeds for compensation.  Other members of his family who would normally follow on the employment were denied it.  The new provision eliminates the undesirable situation.  In the case where some employer is negligent or fails to provide the proper protection, the employee will now be able to get compensation without this threat to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The Majority Report of the Commission indicated that from 1927 to 1959 less than 9/3d. out of every £1 found its way into the pockets of the <Col N="248" /> injured workman.  They had to pay the profits of the insurance companies and of all the other people concerned. Under the present Bill it is estimated that 18/- out of every £1 will go towards the compensation of the worker. That is almost double the amount under the previous legislation.</P>
    <P>Everybody will welcome the application of the flat-rate contribution collected by a single stamp with the existing social insurance contribution.  That eliminates the large-scale administration that would be necessary under any other system.  It dispenses with a multiplicity of insurance companies and others dealing with the situation and getting their profit.</P>
    <P>Another desirable feature is that the Bill will cover employed persons under 16 and over 70.  They are not insurable under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>One section the Minister should possibly take another look at concerns the onus of proving that an accident occurred in the course of employment. The section says that will lie with the claimant to benefit but he will not be obliged, as at present, to show beyond doubt that it arose out of his employment. While the matter is reasonably open, I am not very happy about the &ldquo;beyond doubt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision of cover for apprentices attending technical schools and other training centres is very desirable. Deputy Larkin spoke about this question of cover while travelling to or from the place of employment.  I think the worker should be covered when travelling to his employment.  I have known of many accidents which occurred adjacent to the employment.  I hope the Minister will examine this more fully and possibly give an indication why travel to the employment is not covered.  When a person leaves his house with the intention of going to work and meets with an accident, I think it should be deemed to have occurred at his place of employment in cases where no other compensation is open to him.</P>
    <P>The amounts of benefits included in the Bill are a great advance on those provided in the 1955 Amendment Act. While they may not be all we would <Col N="249" /> like them to be, they are a considerable advance on what we had for a long time.</P>
    <P>Another desirable section is that whereby a person permanently incapacitated can now earn up to £104 a year.  These people will now be able to occupy their minds at some sort of business and earnings up to £104 will be disregarded.  The fact that a permanently totally disabled person can receive amounts up to £15.13.6. is something we all welcome.</P>
    <P>The funeral grant of £50 instead of the £15 now in operation is also to be welcomed.  Deputy Costello's concern for this £50 is really unnecessary.  The giving of medical expenses is also something to be appreciated.  In the past when a person met with an accident during the course of his employment, whether he was an insured worker or whether he had a medical card, he nevertheless had to meet medical expenses.  Therefore, the section giving cover for the necessary medical expenses will meet with the approval of all.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see included also that, if a man is not in full-time employment at the time an accident occurs, the earnings of other workers in similar employment may be taken into account in calculating the earnings.  That will be welcomed by those in part-time or short-time work.</P>
    <P>In general, there is little opponents of this Bill can be in disagreement with in relation to the benefits, whether they go far enough or not, apart from the fact that certain people and certain groups will not benefit as a result of the change over indicated by the Minister. This certainly represents a major advance in social services and a completely new look in regard to industrial injuries.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated. I believe this Bill will receive the approval of all those who from time to time will be unfortunate enough to meet with injury and those who are guarding them.  The Labour Party have spoken at length and given their approval to the Bill.  They are well aware of the position in relation to unfortunates who meet with accidents. <Col N="250" /> I am sure their word goes a long way in this vast field.  They know all the problems in relation to the medical profession, the legal profession and the insurance companies, just as I do.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the thought he has put into this Bill and on the provisions in it in relation to apprentices and those over 70 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill seeks to rectify the omission of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to their social obligation to injured workmen by increasing the payments under workmen's compensation from £4 10s. to the amount set out in the Bill, we in this Party welcome it.  When one considers that there has been no increase in workmen's compensation since 1955, although the cost of living has skyrocketed over the same period, one is inclined not to congratulate the Minister on what he is now doing but to castigate him for not doing it sooner.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must now part company with the Minister and the Labour Party in their approach to this legislation.  I speak as one who has been more closely in touch with the administration of the workman's compensation code than any other Deputy because in the Circuit Court in which I practise more workmen's compensation cases are dealt with than in any other circuit in the country.  In fact, statistics reveal that over half of the entire workmen's compensation cases heard are heard in the Cork circuit.  I have watched the operation of workmen's compensation under the present legislation.  I have closely studied it because that was my job.  I have studied the spirit and the manner in which the Act was administered by the court and the manner in which the sections were interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who comes here to speak on a Bill of this magnitude and importance should study that code and its operation before coming in here to speak in vague, general terms.  Anybody who has studied the approach of the courts to workmen's compensation cannot but be struck by the fact that the courts were acutely aware that the workmen's compensation code was a <Col N="251" /> code in ease of injured workmen and the interpretation of the Acts both by the Circuit Court and by the Supreme Court, to which an aggrieved workman had the right of appeal, was invariably benign.</P>
    <P>As an instance of the manner in which the courts both here and in England interpreted cases, I should like to draw attention, particularly the attention of the Labour Party, to one of the leading cases.  A workman died whilst turning a nut with a spanner. The question before the highest court in Britain was whether or not the death of the workman was due to his work.  Did it arise out of and in the course of his employment?  The case was heard in 1910 and it was decided the accident arose out of and in the course of his employment, although there was a conflict of medical evidence and evidence that the man's heart was in bad condition before he ever turned that nut with a spanner. That case has been followed consistently by both the British and Irish courts.  It has set the whole tenor of the approach of the courts to the administration of workmen's compensation code.</P>
    <P>This Bill is put before us as a piece of enlightened legislation.  What does it do?  It is dressed in the most gay bunting.  The Minister said yesterday it is a wonderful thing that, if a workman's accident is proved to have arisen in the course of his employment, it will, until the contrary is proved, be deemed also to have arisen out of the employment.  That means absolutely nothing.  That gives no new assistance to the workman because the number of decided cases in which the decision went against the workmen is minimal. But, even under the proposed legislation, the presumption that the accident arose out of the employment is rebuttable presumption.  Those of us who know the manner in which social legislation is administered by the Department know full well that if they can rebut the presumption that the accident arose out of the employment, then they will bring every force to bear to rebut that presumption. <Col N="252" /> Let us examine now the circumstances in which that presumption could be rebutted.  The workman will not be represented by any trained mind.  He may not even be there himself when his case is decided.  Some nameless, faceless people somewhere will some time sit down and say: &ldquo;Let us decide now whether the presumption that the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment has been rebutted&rdquo;.  That decision will be reached, irrespective of any submission that the workman might make to those deciding his fate.  Let us remember that this is very important social legislation. Those of us closely in touch with the workman's compensation code realise how very important it is to a man who has lost the power to earn a living that his right to gain compensation for losing that power should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has told us that the Labour Party subscribe to the new legislation because it is more modern. The fact that legislation is more modern does not mean that it is more acceptable.  He has told us it is more rational.  I do not see any evidence that any section of this Bill is more rational than the provisions enshrined in the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended by the 1948, 1953 and 1955 Acts.  Is it more rational that a man who claims that he has some rights against an employer should be denied the right to plead that claim and that his claim should be decided by people without legally trained minds, in his absence and without his having the right to have evidence in support of his claim brought before the tribunal by people trained to bring such evidence before such tribunals?</P>
    <P>Is it not more rational that a workman should have the right to go before an independent tribunal such as a Circuit Court judge and plead his case there than that he should have to send in a number of forms to an unknown gentleman in Dublin?  Is it not more rational that in the event of appeal, the workman should have the right to go to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, than that, if the Minister decides against him in the first instance under the new code, he <Col N="253" /> should appeal to the Minister?  On the ground of rationality, I again appeal to the Labour Party to have a second look at this Bill because I believe that unwittingly they are doing something for which they will afterwards feel very sorry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned that abolition of the workmen's compensation code as we know it in Britain and Northern Ireland evoked no great outcry in Britain or Northern Ireland. That is probably true but that does not mean that it did not impose many great injustices on workmen in Britain and Northern Ireland.  More is the shame on people who represent labour interests in Northern Ireland or in the British Parliament if they did not make an outcry.  I feel that the Labour Party in this instance have a split mind, that they are so glad to see the emergence of the nationalisation of at least one section of an industry, in other words, the nationalisation of a section of the insurance industry, that they are afraid to oppose the Bill on the rational ground that it is taking away from the workman his rights to plead his case in open court.</P>
    <P>I know from Irish doctors who practise in Wales, where more workmen's compensation cases came before the courts than in any other part of Great Britain, due to the mining industry in the area, that many workmen have greatly regretted that they no longer have that right, which they had under the former workmen's compensation code in operation in Britain and that they now must have recourse to a Civil Service tribunal in circumstances very similar to those obtaining here at the moment in the case of people claiming disability and other such benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred the House to the danger of Government by regulation which is enshrined in this Bill. Time and again I have regretted the increasing tendency of the administration to take from this House, from the elected representatives, the right to legislate.  The regulations under this Bill can be of the most oppressive nature.  Regulations of all kinds can be introduced which will hinder the <Col N="254" /> workman in his right to obtain compensation or which will impose upon him oppressive requirements before he can be paid compensation.</P>
    <P>There is in the Bill provision for the making of rules of behaviour by regulation.  Similar rules of behaviour were made by regulation of the Department of Social Welfare for people claiming disability benefit and I should like to draw the attention of the Labour Party to one of these rules of behaviour.  This is the way a man must behave whilst he is beholden to the Department of Social Welfare for disability benefit: the rules of behaviour prescribe that whilst a person is being paid disability benefit, he may not leave his house without leaving at his home detailed particulars of every place he is going for every moment of every 24 hours of every day of the week.  If the Labour Party feel that by giving the Government an opportunity to impose similar rules of behaviour on people looking for workmen's compensation, in preference to the present code, they are entitled to it but I draw their attention to the fact that under this Bill these rules of behaviour can be imposed on a person seeking workmen's compensation under the new Bill and I counsel them to join with us in our complete objection to such a course.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill is dressed in its most attractive garb.  The fact that the workmen's right to a lump sum goes by the board in this legislation is glossed over.  The Minister said yesterday: &ldquo;Thanks be to God,&rdquo; that it is a great thing; that it was a terrible thing for a workman to get a lump sum.  Apparently, the average workman is deemed incapable of dealing with a lump sum.</P>
    <P>As one who is probably more closely aware of the manner in which the Workmen's Compensation Act operates than most members of the House, I should like to say that the average workman who gets a lump sum gets it because he has some definite plans for using that lump sum for his own betterment and that of his wife and family.  Time and again, when representing workmen, I asked them what they would do with £2,500 if <Col N="255" /> they got it by way of compensation, they would reply that they would buy a little shop or start a little business, that they had had a trade and would go back to it and could teach the wife to help.  The essence of thrift has been shown by most of these people who got lump sums.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Larkin to talk of amounts such as £100, £200 or £300 by way of lump sum.  Last year I asked the Minister if he would state the amount of money that had been paid by way of lump sums over the previous five years under the workmen's compensation code.  The sum represented by lump sums, leaving out the large number of weekly payments, was nearly £2½ million over a period of five years.  The Department of Social Welfare, in effect, says that that £2½ million that was given by the large modern insurance companies and the employers generally over the past five years will never be given again; that is one sum the workmen will never get their hands on.</P>
    <P>Any of us who know anything about the workmen's compensation code cannot but appreciate the therapeutic effect of the lump sum.  Some of us are inclined to be cynical and say that once these people get a lump sum, their incapacity is finished.  It is true to say that in the case of a lump sum, the fact that incapacity has no longer to be pleaded has an effect on the mind of the average person, to the end that that person recovers much sooner than he ordinarily would.  I have in mind the case of a young person who wanted to get married.  A sum of money was offered to her and her medical adviser stuck a needle in the palm of her hand and she did not even wince.  He said that if she got the lump sum within a few months, she would jump if the needle was stuck in her hand.  That is what happened.  Her mind was relieved of the responsibility of having to plead illness and immediately she got the lump sum, that illness disappeared.  We are doing away with that now.  If a person wants to continue in benefit under the new legislation, he will have to continue to be incapacitated.  That is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> I have already referred to the inroads of bureaucracy on the rights of this House.  Deputy Costello also referred to that earlier in his able discussion of the demerits of this Bill.  I should like to refer the House to the fantastic proposal of section 32 of the Bill which says that the Civil Service may, by regulation, take away any part of it.  If we are going to enact legislation like that, then let us come in here and look at the one section of every Bill containing that particular power and then go away and not waste our time in the enacting of legislation enabling the Civil Service to undo everything or most of what we have done.  This Bill is not a good Bill and it is important that the House should give it most serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Labour Party to approach this Bill from the point of view that the most solid safeguard a workman can have is that his rights will be upheld and will be upheld not just by himself but by minds trained to uphold them in tribunals which have consistently looked upon the workmen's compensation code as a code enacted for the protection of workmen who have met with this misfortune.  We should not drive these workmen into the same position as the many people who come to Deputies of all Parties looking for disability benefits or for something to be done to hurry up payments from the Department and for various other benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has other objections to the Bill and he spoke about the delays in relation to the existing Acts. I do not know where Deputy Larkin found these objections but there is no foundation in fact for them.  The workmen's compensation code provides the shortest route for the workman to the courts.  If the workman is aggrieved by the finding of that court, the appeals procedure provides the shortest possible route to the Supreme Court, the highest court in this State. Deputy Larkin spoke about cases going on for a long time and being litigated and he wants to put the workman in the position that he cannot litigate his case, in the position that his case cannot go on for a long <Col N="257" /> time because it will be knocked at departmental level.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Labour Party to consider carefully whether it is a good thing that a workman should be unable to fight his case at length and if it is a legitimate objection, fight it for a long time.  The Labour Party should consider whether it is better that the present code should be scrapped so that the workman can get the shortest possible shrift from the Department or whether he should be in a position to fight for his rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just concluded has thought fit to lecture the Labour Party on their attitude towards this measure.  We regard that as something of a compliment to the Labour Party in that this measure would never have been brought before the House, were it not for the fact that a Labour Minister for Social Welfare in the person of Deputy Corish, our present leader, was the first to announce the formation of a Commission to deal with this matter of improving the workmen's compensation code.  It fell to the lot of the Labour Party to build the platform of this legislation and another Government have built the structure on that platform.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of concern to us that it took so long to implement the report of the Commission.  It was in 1955 that Deputy Corish first forecast that a body would be set up for the purpose of making improvements in the workmen's compensation code.  A long number of years elapsed before a measure to that effect was brought into this House, ten years in fact.  It is now put forward with a flourish of trumpets and Fianna Fáil are purporting to be the guardians of the right of the worker in this context, but one cannot forget the long years of privation, suffering and misery which thousands of workers endured in the ten years since this measure was forecast. In the interim period, we had these unfortunate workmen expected to maintain themselves, their wives and families on £4 10s. per week.  There has been no increase whatever in the level of workmen's compensation payments in the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> Imagine the colossal increase which has taken place in the cost of living in that period.  This Government were in power for the past ten years and they tagged along between commissions and inquiries, between majority and minority reports for ten years before they thought of bringing in this measure.  In the meantime thousands of workers have had their pretty high standard of living dragged down to a subsistence level as a result of inquiry on the job and protracted illness, and were expected to exist on £4 10s. per week.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments made by the previous speaker, we as a Party are entitled to resent any attempt by Fine Gael spokesmen, especially the last speaker, Deputy Barrett, to lecture us on what we ought to do in respect of this measure.  This Party do not require to be lectured by any side of this House as to what they ought to do concerning legislation.  I want to assure Deputy Barrett and his colleagues that this Party have been primarily responsible for founding this measure. They pressurised this Government on every possible occasion to bring it forward. We are entitled to welcome something of which we were the originators. Our Party have been examining this measure and will be bringing forward important amendments designed to improve it.  It is our intention to ensure that this measure will bring the maximum benefit to the people directly concerned.  I think I am entitled to say that in this matter we are not concerned with vested interests.  We are concerned directly with the people involved, the working classes who may sustain injury or contract illness as a result of an accident in employment. These are our primary concern.</P>
    <P>There are anomalies in the present code which I hope the Minister will take steps to remedy.  There has been the problem from time to time of deciding whether an ailment was an industrial ailment or non-industrial, mere sickness.  We have had this difficulty, for instance, in respect of miners, and much has been done to remedy that matter in the Bill concerning miners which passed through this House in recent times, but this problem <Col N="259" /> is still arising, and I should like to bring to the Minister's attention a case with which I had to deal only this week.</P>
    <P>It was the case of a workman who fell ill, and the matter is now before the Minister's Department.  He went to the doctor, who diagnosed the ailment as a rash and put &ldquo;rash&rdquo; on the certificate which was issued to the Minister's Department claiming social welfare disability benefit.  The Department of Social Welfare declined to pay benefit and sent down a query for confirmation in connection with the ailment specified in the doctor's certificate. The man went back to his doctor and asked him what he could do about it.  I should say the doctor concerned was also the factory doctor and he took up the attitude that it was a rash of some kind.  The man's condition grew progressively worse and he had to be hospitalised.  When a certificate was required from the hospital, the doctor in charged diagnosed his ailment as dermatitis and specified &ldquo;dermatitis&rdquo; on the certificate which he issued to the Department.  This led to further confusion, and in the meantime no payment of any kind was being made to the man and his family.  There are a wife and nine children involved.</P>
    <P>This man was eventually cleared from hospital and when he returned home, he again went to his local doctor for a certificate.  The local doctor was about to put &ldquo;rash&rdquo; on the certificate again and the man pointed out that he was in difficulty with the Department of Social Welfare, that this business of &ldquo;rash&rdquo; would not suffice and that the other doctor had stated he had dermatitis.  The local doctor agreed that it was a form of dermatitis but he would insist on putting on the certificate that it was non-industrial dermatitis.</P>
    <P>Clearly this doctor felt he had some obligation in loyalty to the firm and to the insurance company, and in the clear knowledge that benefit was going to be held up and that a decision could not be made, would not specify that it was plain dermatitis.  That problem has not been resolved and the <Col N="260" /> Department of Social Welfare are saying: &ldquo;We think this is an industrial disease contracted on the job and we refuse to pay disability benefit&rdquo; and the firm or the doctor concerned with the firm decline to state that it is an industrial disease or dermatitis. While this battle is going on between the Department of Social Welfare, the insurance company and the doctors concerned, with their conflicting certificates of illness, this man and his wife and nine children are suffering acute hardship.</P>
    <P>Be it said to the credit of the Department of Social Welfare that they have now said they will pay the balance of the amount between workmen's compensation, which is at present £4 10s. and the amount which he would derive for himself and his wife and nine children under the social welfare disability benefit scheme.  As a result he is getting about £3 on which he is expected to live and maintain a family, and of course he will have to lower his dignity to the extent of seeking home assistance.  Those of us who are close to the needs and hardships of the working classes realise that these are the problems with which we must contend.  Our Party will be seeking to amend this measure so as to place the onus on someone to state clearly what &ldquo;ailment&rdquo; is without any shilly-shallying on the part of any vested interest.</P>
    <P>We believe that the prevention of accidents is the ideal solution to this problem and for that purpose another Labour Minister, the late Deputy Norton, brought into this House the Factories Act regulations which were designed to prevent accidents occurring and it is a matter of distress to us in the Labour Party and in the trade union movement that an insufficient number of workers have taken an interest in that Act.</P>
    <P>While there is power under that legislation to set up factory committees, not enough workers or their trade unions have taken sufficient interest in the setting up of these very necessary factory committees to safeguard themselves in case of accidents and indeed to improve general conditions on the job such as the provision of adequate <Col N="261" /> heating, ventilation, space and so on. While we accept a certain amount of condemnation for not inculcating in our people a sense of their responsibility in this respect, the Minister's Department must also bear a share of responsibility.  We understand that the number of factory inspectors appointed is far too small to do effectively the job involved.</P>
    <P>It may be true to say that the number of inspectors does not exceed 20&mdash;I understand it to be 16&mdash;and the Minister can correct me if necessary. Having regard to the hundreds of thousands of industrial workers and the many factories, large and small, I submit that the number of inspectors is totally inadequate and that it must be increased out of all proportion if the necessary investigation is to be made into factory premises and if there are to be necessary consultations with factory managements and workers' representatives.  I ask the Minister to do all he can in this respect by increasing the number of factory inspectors.</P>
    <P>After prevention, our next concern is adequate compensation.  This measure provides reasonable compensation in the circumstances, though naturally we should like to see it higher.  It does not compare very favourably with compensation rates in Northern Ireland and Britain.  While we agree that the adult payments seem to be comparatively reasonable, the allowances for wives seem to us to be very small.  Certainly, the amount payable to widows is extremely small.  I should like the Minister to tell us in this respect whether he is taking into account the widow's pension for which a widow would normally qualify.  In other words, does the amount payable under this measure take into account the widow's pension and benefits that would accrue to the widow, or would she be entitled to claim the widow's pension on top of the figure stipulated here?  If she is to be denied a widow's pension, the amount here is infinitesimal and would do nothing to maintain a widow and her children in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>We are concerned, too, that payments will continue for only 26 weeks. <Col N="262" /> This seems to us to be too short a period and we are concerned about what will happen to the injured person afterwards.  We presume he will automatically qualify for social welfare benefits if still indisposed at the end of 26 weeks.  That is also a matter for clarification by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy John A. Costello referred to the right of workmen to avail of the courts.  It is a matter with which my Party are concerned.  We have considered every aspect of the Bill so that it can be improved on.  The right of workers to proceed to a higher authority is something that will be given the utmost consideration by our Party and suitable amendments will be tabled on that score in the days ahead.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy, speaking personally, about the proposal to leave the final decision in respect of appeals in the hands of officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  It is a matter of some concern to me that the decisions of the appeals officers will be final and binding.  There seems to me to be good case for having a higher authority involved.  That being so, I agree with Deputy John A. Costello that the courts, which have done such valuable work in this respect and which have given such very fair and sizeable awards in the past to unfortunate workers and their dependants, should not be set aside in important matters of this kind.  I am not unmindful of or ungrateful for the efforts of legal men who have worked conscientiously and assiduously to bring justice to unfortunate workers who sustained injuries, many of them serious. Many of these workers went through a lot of suffering and privation and it fell to the lot of the legal profession to secure justice and adequate compensation for loss of employment and inability to continue work.  It is not our intention to cast any aspersions on these honourable gentlemen and what they achieved.</P>
    <P>Our primary concern is to improve this measure as it affects the people at whose improvement it is aimed. Knowing the mind of the Department of Social Welfare with which I have had to deal during the past number of <Col N="263" /> years, I can say that they could not be said to be progressive.  With all due respect to the Minister, they are somewhat archaic and outmoded and their attitude of mind at times would seem to be contaminated by concepts of doles and niggardly means tests. We do not want that kind of concept to infiltrate into a measure such as this and that is why it is desirable some higher court of appeal should be available instead of leaving decisions, which will be final and binding, in the hands of officials.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we have this House as a national forum to reveal any flagrant defects or injustices which might occur in the administration of this legislation, but that is not good enough.  It is only when the damage has been done and great hardship and suffering have ensued that we should take such matters into this House.  We want to ensure that decisions taken as a result of this measure will be fair and impartial.  We want justice not merely being done but seen to be done.  In such circumstances it may well be necessary to give the people affected the right of appeal to the judiciary.</P>
    <P>I had not intended to say so much. My concern was to ask the Minister in particular to remedy the anomalies to which I referred earlier in regard to the diagnosis of illness and the placing of responsibility on somebody, be it the Department of Social Welfare or the employer or the doctors or the legal profession or whoever might be involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad something is being done in the Bill regarding rehabilitation of disabled workers.  I wonder to what extent this rehabilitation scheme can be dovetailed into the proposals of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his measure concerning retraining of operatives arising from redundancy.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that aspect of the matter and tell us the kind of rehabilitation he has in mind, the kind of compensation and the extent to which it will impinge on the proposals to be submitted by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, as indicated in his <Col N="264" /> recently published manpower policy programme.</P>
    <P>We were rather concerned about the allegations made by some Fine Gael spokesman here today and the aspersions cast on our Party as if we were being negligent or guilty of some dereliction of duty whereas we feel intensely proud of this legislation. We agree it can be improved and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that will happen and our amendments will come before the House in due course.  I repeat that our responsibility as a Party in establishing the platform for this measure in 1955 by the action of the Minister for Social Welfare then, Deputy Corish, our present Leader, was to provide a new workers' charter for injured workers.  We could not be expected to have regard to all the vested interests involved.  Our primary concern was then and now is and always will be fair play for the workers who may have the misfortune to sustain injury on the job with resultant privation and misery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In proposing to discuss this Bill, one feels one is dealing with a legislative iceberg because most of what it proposes to do is still beneath the surface buried in regulations it is proposed to make later on when this becomes law.  I think there are 18 cases where it is said regulations will be introduced to deal with various problems.  When enacted, this legislation will mean changes for the employers, particularly for the workmen and perhaps for the insurance companies but in view of the fact that the insurance companies must still cover the common law cases, they will still get their pound of flesh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the injured workman, a few minor points strike me. The first concerns the notification of accidents.  A worker who is seriously injured will notify his accident but one who receives a minor injury may not do so.  He may be in the habit of getting minor injuries and may be one of those who do not feel like running to the foreman or to the office every time he gets a minor injury.  But as time goes on he may develop some disease or disablement as a result of <Col N="265" /> this injury and when the regulations are drafted I would strongly urge the Minister to give particular care to the time he prescribes for workmen to notify injuries.</P>
    <P>In the change over from workmen's compensation to this new social welfare benefit a problem will arise in deciding when a man's disease or disability began.  The various sections from nine to 23 now state that it covers disabilities or diseases arising on or after the date the Act comes into force. I believe this does not go far enough and that it should cover diseases or disabilities diagnosed after the coming into effect of the Act because there are diseases that may be present before that particular date but which may not be diagnosed until afterwards and the workman may be in a position of having to decide to take action under the old Workmen's Compensation Acts and may not find himself able to do so successfully.</P>
    <P>In that connection the first disease one thinks of is pneumoconiosis which will be diagnosed by X-ray and some expert looking at that will say: &ldquo;This man had this trouble for the past year or two and does not come under this Act&rdquo;.  The workman may not be aware of this until he has been diagnosed and may not be able to offer much evidence on the point. This should be provided for in the legislation so that diseases or disabilities diagnosed after the Act should be covered by the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 26 covers payments to medical advisers of injured workmen.  At present most workmen come under the medical card heading.  But as the section stands it says it is proposed to pay the man whatever he is entitled to under the Health Acts.  A man with a medical card if he goes to a dispensary doctor or avails of the regional consulting services is entitled to those services free but some workmen when earning a decent wage may have a private doctor and when injured would like to continue going to that practitioner.  Bills will be incurred in those circumstances and I feel the legislation should cover such bills.</P>
    <P>Down the country where I work it is not unknown for people to come to <Col N="266" /> the city to seek specialist advice on their complaints.  Under this legislation their medical fees will not be covered in these circumstances.  They may be told that the service will be free if they avail of the local service.  They may not wish to do that and I feel that this also should be looked into.  For a person working in an area such as mine one of the most important things to decide is the definition of disability and unemployability.  If a man in rural Ireland, who may have spent 20 or 30 years in a particular occupation, is injured, I think we should know definitely how that disability will be decided.  A man in the city may not be able to continue his usual occupation but it may be possible to get him other work that he will be able to do just as easily and the remuneration for which will be just as good.  He will be at no great disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas the situation will be much different: the work will not be there for the man.  He may be able to do certain skilled work, but it is not there for him in any circumstances. Whoever has to decide this will have to take a very wide view of it.  In the case of workmen in rural areas you may find that the disability allowance may be a very small percentage.  Much the same thing applies to the question of unemployability, which I find it hard to grasp at all.  The Minister must take those things into consideration when these decisions are eventually being made.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 17 is very interesting.  I wonder how it appeared in this legislation at all or why it should appear.  I would be interested to know if the question were asked in the House how many widows were deprived of their benefit because of that subsection.  It would be much more important for the Minister to take power to pay the benefits going to the wife and her children directly under certain circumstances, particularly under the circumstance where the injured workman may be inclined to drink or gamble his weekly allowance. That does not occur very often but, when it does, it becomes a tragedy for the family.  If the Minister has not already the power to do so, he should take that power now.</P>
    <P>Another small matter in the Bill is <Col N="267" /> the case of the widow who will get children's allowances if her husband's son or stepson or grandchild continues to live with her.  This section should go further.  It should also give the allowances to this widow if she has staying with her an orphaned child under age or a niece or a nephew of herself or her husband.  I am aware of this problem. There are three widows in my area, two of whom have orphaned children. One of them would come under this legislation if it were enacted at the particular time.  I feel the number of times this will arise will be very small, but that is all the more reason for covering those particular cases.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dowling, seemed to be pleased that the doctors and the legal people are moving out of this legislation, but to my mind the doctor and the solicitor will still remain in their capacity in this legislation.  I am absolutely certain the doctor is going to be in it even more so.  Under the present Social Welfare Acts no matter what document comes from Dublin to a patient the first person to see it is a doctor.  He must give his advice on it. This legislation is certainly going to mean more work for the doctors, more documentation, more records.</P>
    <P>I am also sure the Social Welfare Department are not unaware that in many cases already people seek the advice of solicitors in their particular problems.  They will continue to do so. I think it will be necessary for them to do so at the beginning.  They will want somebody to advise them what their rights are under the new legislation. I am of the opinion that, much as the House might dislike it, the State should provide some fees for them in those cases.  They will be involved in some expense in these matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to a case of his down the country which prompts me to ask the Minister what is going to happen to the certifying surgeon under the new legislation.  In Deputy Treacy's case the man to decide the problem is the certifying surgeon.  I would like to know from the Minister will this man still continue to operate. It is not a very lucrative position but <Col N="268" /> it is important to know whether it will continue or not.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, it is not out of place for me, a non-legal person, to pay a small tribute to the judges who in the past have acted in and decided cases under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  Any time I appeared before them I always thought they were conscientious, sympathetic and very patient men.  I think I, as one who appeared before them very frequently, should take this opportunity of putting that on record.  I hope the Department of Social Welfare will deal with this problem in the same manner.  If they do, the workman will be very satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of Deputy Gibbons and his critical analysis of some of the provisions in this Bill is a welcome one.  It is welcome to the Minister just as it is to other Deputies.  I, for one, would like to compliment the Deputy on his contribution. Legislation going through this House can only be improved if all of us in our respective Parties examine it and endeavour to improve on it. There have been certain criticisms voiced against this measure from Deputies in these benches, and I think in a number of respects this Bill is open to criticism.  I hope the Minister's approach to the Bill is that it will also be open to amendment on Committee. While there is criticism to be voiced of this measure, the Minister may accept that our approach in these benches, and the approach of most Deputies to this measure, is not one of hostility but a desire to have a measure, whether by retaining the existing framework or adopting the framework proposed by the Minister, that will effectively protect the interests of the injured workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say for the benefit of Deputies, particularly those who were critical of lawyers, that, while I am a lawyer, I certainly do not regard myself as having any vestige of vested interest in retaining the present workmen's compensation system.  I rather imagine very many lawyers find themselves in the same position as I do.  I have been in practice for 25 years.  I have done a fair share of workmen's <Col N="269" /> compensation work, but it is never work that I would look to to make my fortune, and I do not think any other lawyer looks at it in that way either. The point I want to make is that from the workman's point of view the workmen's compensation code is an extremely valuable one.  Were it not for the existence of that code, in a very large number of cases of accidents arising in connection with the person's employment, the injured workman would be entitled to no compensation whatever.  Under the workmen's compensation code as it exists at the moment injured workmen, certainly in the large majority of cases of accidents arising in connection with employment, accidents arising out of and in the course of one's employment, are now covered.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the existing code.  We are entitled to have regard to the fact that in other countries the system has been departed from and has, so to speak, been put on the stamps, as is proposed under this Bill; but the code, as it exists, with all its defects, with all the criticisms that may be directed against it, is one that has proved of very considerable value to workmen.  The reason I emphasise that is that, that being so, and I believe it is so, there is all the more reason why Deputies should give very close and very careful scrutiny to any proposals which seek to get away from or to alter radically the existing position.</P>
    <P>As I see the proposals which the Minister has put before the House, there are six or seven major proposals in this Bill.  In the first place, it is proposed to abolish the present system of claiming and paying and the liability for workmen's compensation.  When this Bill becomes law, the employer will no longer be liable for compensation. That will be taken over by the Department of Social Welfare.  In the second place, and this is where any difference of opinion of a major sort is likely to come to the surface in connection with these proposals, entitlement to compensation in the future will not be determined by the circuit court, will not be determined by the <Col N="270" /> courts at all, but will be determined by the Department of Social Welfare. There will be no appeal to the courts except in certain exceptional circumstances. Thirdly, in future employers will be compulsorily liable to pay contributions in respect of the employees for the purpose, of course, of entitling the employees to compensation.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is of some importance under the proposals in the Bill is that certain factors at present existing, which disentitle a workman to compensation under the existing code, will be removed.  I think that is a welcome improvement.  Again, the categories of persons entitled to compensation will be broadened.  There are other features of the Bill but these are the principal features and, as I say, any sharp division of opinion that is likely to arise will arise on the proposal that, in future, the courts will not be entitled, even if workmen feel they would prefer to have their cases submitted to the courts, to decide whether a workman is or is not under the law entitled to benefit and entitled to compensation. Here we are asked to adopt a proposal whereby the State will be the sole arbiter as to whether or not a person is entitled to compensation and the State will also be a party to the proceedings.  The claim will be made against the State and the State will decide whether or not that claim is justified.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment wedded to the idea that only the courts can decide on matters of this kind, that the existing code of workmen's compensation is the only code likely to be satisfactory and likely to be fair to workmen, on the one hand, and to employers on the other.  But I find it very, very difficult to believe that a system can operate equitably and fairly to all concerned if one and the same person acts as judge and defendant.  That is what the Minister is asking for here.  That is the system the Minister is asking the House to adopt.</P>
    <P>I have the very greatest respect for the fairmindedness and the capabilities of the Irish Civil Service and its personnel but it is making things a little difficult for civil servants in their capacity as employees of the State to decide <Col N="271" /> whether or not, in the event of a dispute, the case against the State should be sustained.  Here the Minister is asking us to adopt that suggestion. If there is a general desire to get away from the present system, to get away from the courts, to get away from the delays that some people say are involved in the procedure through the courts, I believe it should be possible to find an alternative system, based, if you like, on the stamps, as we are proposing in this Bill but which will not leave it entirely to civil servants to decide whether or not a claim is to be met.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to consider between now and Committee Stage some alternative scheme. Alternatives do exist.  If we want to get away from the courts, it should be possible to set up some type of independent tribunal to which an aggrieved workman can appeal rather than accept the system envisaged in this Bill under which a decision is made by a civil servant and is appealed to another civil servant.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider the merits of setting up some type of independent tribunal to which a workman who is dissatisfied with the decision given by the civil servant can appeal.  I believe that could be done.  I believe it would be workable.  I believe it would have the merit, if it is regarded as a merit, of taking workmen's compensation cases away from the court.  It would certainly have the merit of getting away from the proposal under which one and the same person would be both defendant and judge.</P>
    <P>This measure is also open to the criticism made here that it is, in fact, legislation by regulation.  Practically every section and subsection is dependant on ministerial regulations. One of the bad features of the Bill is that, even where regulations will be made, there is no positive obligation on the Minister, or anyone else, to make the regulations.  It is put in in a purely permissive way.  Instead of providing that the Minister shall make regulations or that regulations shall <Col N="272" /> be made, we find, running through practically every section of the Bill, &ldquo;regulations may be made&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Minister may make regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I look at the page open in front of me.  Section 23 subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Regulations prescribing any disease or injury for the purpose of this section may provide...</P>
    <P>It does not say what the regulations shall provide but what they may provide. Again, under subsection (4) provision may be made by regulations for determining the time, and so on.  Subsection (6) of the same section provides that regulations may provide for certain things.  Section 24 which deals with supplements to workmen's compensation payments, starts off by saying in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>Regulations may provide for conferring on persons...</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) starts by saying:</P>
    <P>Regulations may also provide... And subsection (3) says:</P>
    <P>Such regulations may further provide...</P>
    <P>The whole thing is dependent on regulations.</P>
    <P>We are being invited here to adopt this legislation in blinkers to a very great extent because, while the Minister may be in a position to give the House his mind and his ideas as to what regulations will be made and to what extent permissive sections will be operated, and I assume the Minister will make every effort to give that kind of information to the House, nevertheless, until the regulations are made, no Deputy will be aware of precisely what is in them.</P>
    <P>The point has been made from these benches and it is one to which I would also like the Minister to give some consideration as to the desirability of introducing some graduated scale of both benefits and contributions.  All of us will appreciate that where you have a flat rate of benefit and where you have the flat rate applied to different classes of workmen, some of whom may be very much more highly paid than others, it is a very much greater hardship on a highly paid workman, <Col N="273" /> or reasonably highly paid workman, to drop down to whatever scale is applicable than it is for a more lowly paid workman to drop down to the same level.  In the first case the gap between the pre-accident earnings and the flat rate paid is very much greater than the gap between the pre-accident earnings and the amount paid in the second case.  It would be well worth investigating the possibility of introducing a system which would genuinely minimise the hardship caused to workmen as a result of an accident by providing some system whereby there would be a graduated system of payments and, in return for that, if the workmen's compensation code in future is based on a system of contributions, it would be reasonable to suggest a graduated system of contributions also.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in particular which I should like to ask the Minister to deal with more fully.  It is in connection with section 31 which deals with disqualifications for injury benefits or disablement benefit and suspensions of proceedings.  This section is also permissive so far as regulations are concerned and provides that regulations may provide for disqualifying a person from receiving injury benefit or disablement benefit for any period not exceeding six weeks, or for suspending proceedings on any claim for, or on any payment of, injury benefit or disablement benefit, if the person fails without good cause to do any of a number of things.  Paragraph (d) mentions one of these things: &ldquo;to observe any prescribed rules of behaviour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what that means or what is intended by it, what rules of behaviour it is intended to prescribe.  It seems to me to be a very wide description, to contain very wide powers which, if harshly exercised, would result in disentitling workmen for possibly trivial reasons from receiving benefit for a period up to six weeks.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister at least to consider seriously between now and Committee Stage whether or not it would be possible to allow an appeal <Col N="274" /> to some body or tribunal other than a civil servant in the case of a workman who is aggrieved by the decision of the deciding officer or appeals officer proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is undoubtedly a progressive move and something which anybody who thinks seriously about workmen's compensation must welcome because it proposes or suggests improvements on the present position.  Mention has been made of what brought the Bill about and who brought it about.  It would appear to me, having listened to Deputy Barrett this evening, that he certainly does not know where he is and has been away from the happenings for many years, particularly in relation to workmen's compensation.  He conveniently forgets that day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, an organisation called the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been demanding that something should be done in relation to workmen's compensation and that simultaneously the Labour Party have been doing the same thing.  If you like, the Labour movement have been crying out for something to be done by way of improvement in workmen's compensation legislation.</P>
      <P>This was brought very forcibly to a head on the occasion of the last general election.  The people clearly indicated their desire to have improvements carried out in social welfare benefits and other such matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett talked about delays and the fears as to what will happen in connection with this Bill.  He then proceeded to talk as if this Bill were the property of the Labour Party, which it is not.  The Labour Party will undoubtedly table amendments with a view to improving the Bill but the Bill is not the property of the Labour Party. Deputy Barrett said that the Labour Party had fear about delays.  He talked about the progression from the Circuit Court to the High Court to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that there are no people who know more about the intricacies or the disadvantages of the <Col N="275" /> workmen's compensation code existing at the present time than trade union officials.  They are very conscious of the delays that have been experienced and continue to be experienced by workers who have to avail of legal machinery in order to obtain their entitlement. I know for a fact that in some cases, as there are in all professions, there have been good and bad. I have known lawyers who have worked earnestly in connection with matters of this kind.  On the other hand, I have known cases where they did not work so earnestly and have delayed and were the cause of delay through forgetfulness or being too busy looking after other business.  Compensation claims are not as remunerative as other business might be.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in relation to the Bill which I should like to ask the Minister to consider.  I am concerned about what the Minister says on page 26 of his brief in regard to a deciding officer and an appeals officer. I am concerned as Deputy O'Higgins has indicated he is concerned, about the decision being left to one man. This is not good enough.  We must try to make the people engaged in this exercise, employers and workers, realise that this Bill is being brought in with a view to having benefits provided for everybody who has to be absent from work through injuries caused by accident.  There is nothing wrong in setting up a court of referees made up of representatives of employers and workers and there would be nothing wrong in having a High Court judge to preside over such a body.  I would be glad of the wiping out of red tape as far as legal machinery is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to observe that there will be less control on the part of the insurance companies.  In the existing situation, the insurance companies appear to be doing their utmost to prevent a workman getting compensation. This will no longer be the case but we cannot at the same time leave it to the Department to give satisfaction. At the moment there are numerous complaints about the Department's present system with <Col N="276" /> regard to benefits and, if the new system is going to be left to the Department to operate, we will have a peculiar situation.  Does this Bill mean that we are to have a specially trained staff in the Department to administer it, people who will know their job and who will do their best to give a satisfactory service to the people?</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to the person who is being trained for any particular job has been played with under the existing legislation.  I would like to know what is to happen to the person who is being trained for a particular type of employment and is not employed by any particular employer.  Take the example of the catering workers.  There is a council which operates training schemes in various parts of the country and young boys and girls undergo training under this scheme.  They are not regarded as being employed and I would like to know whether, if they meet with an accident in the course of their training, they will be covered.</P>
    <P>I feel that whenever this Bill becomes an Act the Minister should arrange for a simplified description of the Bill to be given as a handout so that people will know their obligations and their entitlements.  There are far too many public lawyers when it comes to workmen's compensation.  A man meets with an accident and, while he is unable to work, he is able to amble down to the local pub and have a chat and he will meet people who will advise him that he can get thousands in compensation.  That may lead to an awful lot of trouble and it would be useful if we had some arrangement whereby the worker would be advised of his entitlement and the employers of their obligations.</P>
    <P>On page 22 of his speech, the Minister referred to certain other diseases required to be covered by international conventions but not now covered by the Workmens Compensation Acts and he says these diseases will receive immediate consideration.  Am I to understand that all the diseases covered by the international Conventions are to be covered under this Bill?  Deputy Treacy talked about the importance <Col N="277" /> of safety measures.  This is something that has a lot to do with workmen's compensation.  If we are to get this message of the need for care across to everybody, we will have to get to the people more.  The trade unions and progressive employers have been playing their part in that connection but we will not make much progress until we have more factory inspectors to see that the regulations are carried out.  I would suggest a get-together between the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter because the number of factory inspectors is far too small.  They are so few that they could not attempt to do a successful job.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said that deciding officers will have the assistance of the medical officers of the Department of Social Welfare in dealing with medical matters. I would ask the Minister to have another look at that.  Does he intend to have a new set of medical officers appointed to his Department or will it be the same type of person as sorts people out as far as social welfare benefits are concerned?  You can ask any supporter of any Party here what he thinks of the set up of having to go before a doctor in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons talked about the expenses of doctors and surgeons and yesterday in this House we were talking about choice of doctor and we had an indication from the Minister for Health that under new proposals which he is bringing in, we will have a choice of doctor.  That does not fit in with the Minister's speech concerning the payment of expenses to doctors and surgeons.  He said the payment will be consistent with their present entitlement under the old Act.  Now the Minister for Social Welfare must know very well what his colleague, the Minister for Health, is going to do with regard to choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>This Bill also indicates that there is a limit to benefits.  That is understandable because all these things must be paid for.  This is a progressive measure but it is not everything that one would desire.  We in the Labour Party would like to see more benefits <Col N="278" /> being extended to our people, particularly having regard to the fact that even with this Bill there will still be people in need, and the amount of compensation will not take care of all the needs.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Treacy, indicated that there would be a limit on the period of payment.  I should imagine that will not be so.  If a person is out of work suffering from an injury sustained at work, he will be covered by workmen's compensation and I presume I am right in thinking there will be no question of a limit of 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>There will be amendments to the Bill, as there is need at all times for improvement.  I would ask the Minister to give further consideration to the matter of benefits affecting widows and their dependants, and to bring in a suitable amendment.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who has read this Bill or even read or listened to the Minister's speech must agree that this is something that requires careful handling, and cries out for specially trained staff to administer it.  As this is a progressive move, we should have another progressive move so that the people outside will realise the Department of Social Welfare is not the barrier they think it is.  Too often people say to me: &ldquo;If you, go before the Departmental doctor, his attitude at all times is: &ldquo;I am going to get you back to work as fast as I can because you are costing too much money'.&rdquo;  We must remove that idea from our people's minds.  There must be a different approach to people in this regard. It must be realised that they have problems not only in respect of their injury but in respect of their dependants. We must not run away with the idea that the benefits given under this Bill will rid them of their problems. There will still be the situation that a man with dependants who is out of work through an accident at his work will be receiving less than if he was working.  This is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers, practically every speaker, who welcomed this Bill, and I congratulate the Minister on the forward <Col N="279" /> look the Bill shows.  On page 28 of his speech, the Minister mentioned that financial assistance would be forthcoming for research into accident prevention schemes.  Any Deputy with any knowledge of industry, whether it be light or heavy, will appreciate the necessity for striving to prevent accidents, and we do know that on the part of the vast majority of workers and employers, there is a couldn't-care-less attitude towards accident prevention.  The fact that there are very few safety committees in industry shows how little we care about this. While there is a national industrial safety organisation, an excellent body doing very good work, we have not got the message across to people that accident prevention is far more important than paying out compensation. I believe that if the Minister presses for research into accidents, he will save a lot of money and also a lot of human suffering.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also for the fact that it measures up, or almost measures up, to some of the European standards set up by the International Labour Office.  The Minister must be complimented on striving to bring our social services up to the standard of those in Europe, which in many cases are far ahead of ours.</P>
      <P>Having said that much about safety, I should like to comment very briefly on some of the provisions in the Bill. Up to now the compensation paid was very low, so low that workers were very often tempted not to report an accident because if they did, it meant being sent home, or going to hospital, and the loss of their weekly income. Many a man has for this reason failed to report an accident to his employer, with the result that the injury became aggravated and he lost a lot more than he would have lost, had he reported the accident in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the benefit is to be increased.  It will not lead to a rash of accidents but it will mean that if a man is hurt and needs treatment, he will be able to see about it knowing that the payment of workmen's compensation <Col N="280" /> has been increased.  The Minister has stated that he is prepared to amend the regulations under the Social Welfare Act so that disability benefit will be payable concurrently with workmen's compensation.  This is a tremendous step forward.  It will relieve the man or woman not only of worry about his or her physical condition but also of worry about what will happen to the family if the weekly income ceases.</P>
    <P>I listened to Members who are lawyers from the far benches and who said that up to this the outlook of people who administered the Act was weighted in favour of the worker.  To anybody who has been involved with people working in factories, this is an amazing statement, because their whole outlook was that it was weighted in the very opposite direction, against them.  They dreaded reporting an accident, seeking compensation, the whole thing dragging on for months, while all the time hospital bills would be mounting up and in the end, when they would get compensation, they would very often owe some of the money coming to them from the local health authority in order to tide them over this period.  Although the injury might not be very serious, it could have upset his family so much that he would have been tempted at the time to accept the lump sum and finish the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Somebody said here we did not trust working people with regard to getting lump sums, but that is not true.  Perhaps Deputy Mullen hit the nail on the head when he said there were a lot of public house lawyers knocking around who would tell a man about the thousands he would get; he would believe it for a while and when he realised he would not get that much, he would settle for anything just to get some money into his hands.  In this respect the Bill is a great improvement, and in increasing the benefits, the Minister has made a tremendous stride forward.  On the point of the Department being the judge in cases, I think a big saving in time and money will be made.  I do not say this because I have an anti-lawyer bias but because I believe it is a much more businesslike <Col N="281" /> way of dealing with these matters and that it will benefit injured workmen tremendously.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to prevent an injured workman taking a civil action against an employer.  To refer once again to the prevention of accidents, perhaps we need more factory inspectors but we certainly need more industrial awareness that accidents can be prevented.  Far too many people are killed and maimed each year by sheer carelessness.  While we deplore death on our roads, we do not take sufficient notice of accidents in industry.  Admittedly, there are not as many as on the roads but undoubtedly far too many accidents are occurring in industry which could be prevented by care and attention.  I hope the Minister will pursue this matter of research into accident prevention and that where either an employer or employee is found to be grossly negligent, he will be dealt with sufficiently severely.  All this would help to prevent accidents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My Party have indicated, through Deputy James Tully, our support for this measure but in a Bill which we have advocated for so long, we shall be introducing amendments which we think will alter it more in the direction we should like to see it work.  Up to now we have felt &mdash;the Minister made reference to it in his opening statement&mdash;that this area was too much a matter for court action and that it was not considered sufficiently from the point of view of a necessary social service for workers in industry.  If industrial relations are framed to make for the best possible harmony and accord between employer and worker while the worker is healthy, the same should apply when the worker is injured in the course of his employment.  It is not good ground for employer-worker harmony if the worker must have at the back of his mind this idea that if anything happens, he will have to depend on the tender mercies of lawyers and solicitors to help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel this Bill is a more rational way of dealing with some of the things that happen too often, men injured in <Col N="282" /> the course of their employment.  It is true&mdash;Deputy Tully mentioned it&mdash; that prevention of injury in a man's employment is still essential and necessary.  It is still necessary to see that injury in the course of employment does not occur too often. Unfortunately there are too many firms in this country who do not do quite as much as they should in this matter of promoting safety on the industrial factory floor: there are still too many machines unguarded.  I feel the factory inspectorate have not been fashioned efficiently enough.  Of course, as individuals they cannot be accused. It may mean their service is not extensive enough and many of us in the trade unions hear that their visits are too infrequent or that the employer is notified beforehand.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see that the powers of the insurance companies are being pushed back.  We are glad to see vested interests have been pushed back and that in some sense the priority in this Bill is the individual who is injured&mdash; that all our contributions through this Bill will be biased in favour of the man injured at his work.  In regard to any risk in phrasing, we think it is better to take that risk if our direction is clear&mdash;that it is in the interests of the injured worker.  Perhaps we can get some improvement in the appeals section and certainly we shall not shed any crocodile tears on this side for any diminution of freedom that means less litigation for the individual.  Under the old Act we have found that the exercise of those rights proved a very expensive commodity for the worker.</P>
    <P>Improvements to this Bill through amendments we shall suggest will be in the spirit of the defence of the individual worker.  Any of us who have attended trade union conferences during the past 20 years will have heard workers advocating an improvement in workmen's compensation legislation, and year after year has had to report no progress.  Assuming some of our amendments are accepted, we hope we will be able to report progress on this occasion.</P>
    <P>We are proud on this side of the House that the leader of our Party <Col N="283" /> had a principal part in the creation of the Bill now before us and that the first moves towards getting a modern scheme of industrial injuries legislation were taken by him.  We are glad also that the Minority Report of the Commission, substantially that of the Congress of Irish Trade Unions, was the one accepted.  Our attitude has been set out by Deputy Tully.  Our amendments will be framed to protect, even more than in the Bill, the rights of the injured worker.  I am unhappy to see that the three-day waiting period is still in the Bill.  This has been the subject of conference after conference. That this three-day period should be retained is a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>If the good health of his industry, of his factory, depends on an efficient work force, an employer must accept as an obligation that his workers, injured through no fault of their own, are looked after.  I hope some of our suspicions will not be confirmed in the phrase &ldquo;accident arising out of and in the course of his employment&rdquo;. Deputy Tully pointed to some possible improvements in phraseology and the interpretation this clause in the Act receives in other countries.  We may consider that the phrase &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of his employment&rdquo; is a bit cumbersome, that it may retain in the legislation quite an area of dispute which would not be there if the phrase were simpler.</P>

      <P>I thank the House in general for the reception given to the Bill.  It was obvious that most Deputies appreciated the Bill is a very great step forward in social welfare legislation. It was not very easy to interpret the attitude of the Fine Gael Party as such.  Deputy O'Higgins stated that their approach was not one of hostility and I must admit that the personal contribution of Deputy O'Higgins was a very reasonable one, that it did not show any hostility.  However, I would suggest to Deputy O'Higgins that he might some time read the speeches of other members of his Party, and in particular those of Deputy J. A. Costello and Deputy Barrett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> It is very hard to believe that we had not in the debate something of a re-enactment of the type of discussions that must have taken place at Government level prior to the setting up of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.  I do not think anybody has had any doubt that the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Corish, knew very well the type of change that was desirable in regard to workmen's compensation.  The spokesmen of the Labour Party have said there has been considerable experience of the operation of a similar scheme in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that the experience of the workers' representatives has been quite satisfactory, that there was little, if any, complaint. I should be very surprised if the Minister for Social Welfare at the time when this Commission was set up did not appreciate fully that it was a change similar to that being made now that was required.</P>
    <P>I was accused on a number of occasions in the House of trying to put some blame on Deputy Corish as Minister for Social Welfare for the delay in making the change.  I never intended to do that but I did imply that it was the predominance of the Fine Gael mentality in the Government of which he was a member that prevented this obviously desirable change being made and substituted a Commission instead which did a very thorough job and brought out, as was to be expected, two different reports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello's speech was a really amazing performance or, at least, I found it so.  It was quite obvious to me that the Deputy must have thought that by setting up this Commission in 1955, he had disposed of the danger of this change, which I think was surely inevitable under any progressive Government, for some considerable time to come.  It was obvious from the whole tenor of his speech that he has still not got over his chagrin that that manoeuvre was not successful because of the fact that the report of the Commission was received by a Government who were able to make up their own mind.  The fact that he based practically the whole of his <Col N="285" /> attack on this Bill&mdash;and surely it is obviously an attack&mdash;on the really silly charge that this was a transferring of the burden of workmen's compensation from the employer to the taxpayer shows, I think, that he was still affected by unreasoning anger because this change is being made and this obvious aspect of social welfare is now being brought into line with modern concepts of social security.  It should be perfectly clear to anybody who has been able to look at the Bill in a calm and unprejudiced way that not one solitary penny of the cost of this scheme will fall on the taxpayer.  The scheme will be financed by means of the contributions which will be paid in the form of the social insurance stamp by employers and employers only and it is intended that this special Occupational Injuries Fund will be entirely self-supporting and that no part of the cost will be met by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will be some increased cost of administration in the Department of Social Welfare but this will also be met out of the Occupational Injuries Fund which will be financed by employers' contributions. Therefore, Deputy Costello's attack on the Bill, being based in the main on this misconception, means that the greater part of his speech is nonsense.</P>
    <P>In this debate we have seen something of the different faces of the Fine Gael Party or, perhaps I should say, we have seen the real face of Fine Gael under the mask of the rather cynical document that was drafted for election purposes, described as &ldquo;The Just Society&rdquo;.  Except for Deputy O'Higgins's contribution I could see no trace of the new mentality and the new approach to social welfare in particular, which it was attempted to convince the public underlay the production of that document.  This debate makes it quite clear that the Fine Gael attitude to social welfare has not undergone any genuine change.  The public in the election realised that document was purely election eyewash.</P>
    <P>It appeared to me that Fine Gael were to a certain extent trying to have it both ways: they were trying to make <Col N="286" /> it appear, on the one hand, that they were not actually opposing this improvement in our social welfare legislation in the manner of dealing with occupational injuries and diseases but at the same time there appeared to be a determination to salvage as much of the existing system as possible.  So far as I can gather, despite the bitter nature of some of the Fine Gael speeches on the matter, they do not intend to oppose the Bill on this Stage but it was obvious that some Fine Gael members hope to retain for their profession some of the share of the cost of this aspect of social welfare which was theirs up to now.  Certainly, there was every indication that Fine Gael do not appreciate with any degree of enthusiasm as Deputy Fitzpatrick put it, in what Deputy Costello described as an understatement, that this change is essentially an arrangement to ensure that, apart from administrative expenses, the full cost of occupational injuries and diseases will now be entirely for the benefit of the workman.</P>
    <P>I was not the only Member of the House who saw something incongruous in regard to the vivid picture painted by Deputy Costello of young solicitors and barristers rushing around the country seeking to take up workmen's compensation cases free of charge.  I do not suggest that lawyers are any more mercenary than any other professional people but I think the main attraction of workmen's compensation work is the fees that are involved.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of what appears to be the objective of conserving as much as possible of the present system, Deputy Costello made what I consider a scandalous attack on the officers of the Department of Social Welfare when he said that their main consideration was and is to protect the fund at all costs.  He said he himself had seen this phrase on many files in his time in Government.  He must know full well he did not complete the phrase.  He left out the most important part of the phrase he has seen on documents.  The objective was that the fund should be protected from fraud.  Does Deputy Costello say this is a reprehensible principle or that there should not be <Col N="287" /> an effort to ensure that the Social Insurance Fund, which is contributed to by workers, employers and taxpayers, is utilised only for the purpose of providing recompense for workers in respect of the different contingencies insured against under the Social Insurance Scheme?  It is obviously in the interest of all concerned&mdash;workers, employers and taxpayers&mdash;that the fund should be safeguarded from fraud, but there is no attempt to deprive the workers of their full rights.  It was rather bad practice on the part of Deputy Costello to try to convey that very wrong impression of the approach of officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>So far from creating a position such as Deputy Costello suggests will be created, the effect of this Bill will be to ensure that there will be a completely objective decision in these cases. The workman will no longer have to depend on his good or bad luck in obtaining the services of legal advisers who can or cannot outwit the experienced specialists who will invariably be employed by insurance companies in these cases.  Naturally, the insurance companies are concerned with ensuring that no money will be paid out except in accordance with their strict liability under the law.  Decisions will now be purely factual and objective. They will not any longer depend on the ability of what may be an inexperienced lawyer to overcome the wiles of a seasoned practitioner with a specialised knowledge of this subject.  There will be no person or body with a particular interest in trying to arrange that compensation will not be paid.  If Deputies insist on suggesting that the officers of my Department will act with ulterior motives, the fact is there will be no State contribution in regard to benefits under the Occupational Injuries Fund.  In the case of a workman who is unfit for work it will normally be a question of whether he qualifies for disability benefit under the general Social Insurance Scheme or for benefit under the new Occupational Injuries Scheme.  As I say, there is no State contribution to the Occupational Injuries Fund but there is to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> A number of speakers on the Fine Gael side told us that invariably the result of decisions in the courts was to ensure that the benefit of any doubt went to the workman and that there was a general disposition to favouring the workman if at all possible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kyne may have a better recollection than I have of the number of times he had to put down a question to me about a particular case of an Irish seaman working on a British ship who was not awarded workmen's compensation simply because of the fact that there was nobody who knew sufficient about the matter to bring to the attention of the court the fact that there were reciprocal arrangements in that regard.  It took a long time to get this case reopened and settled satisfactorily.  It is not a fact, despite what Deputy Costello said, that every young barrister and lawyer throughout the country can see his way round these Acts practically blindfold. He went on further to state that this was a very specialised and involved subject.  It is quite obvious the specialists were those who normally act for insurance companies; and as far as the workman was concerned it was a matter of luck whether he happened to get a legal adviser who was well informed in this matter or not. The only interest of the officers of my Department in this matter will be to see that justice will be done to the worker making the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised of the long time that has elapsed since the maximum rate of workmen's compensation was fixed.  I was not very long in office as Minister for Social Welfare when the long awaited Report of the Workmen's Compensation Commission became available.  It is a fact that that took over six years.  I do not blame Deputy Corish for that at all. I realise his difficulty in the matter.  It was reasonable, in view of the fact that the Commission had been sitting so long, to wait for its Report.  When I got its Report, I do not think there <Col N="289" /> was an excessive delay in bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Majority Report recommended the continuation of the present system. When I got the Report, I read it and formed the opinion that the proper action was to bring in the type of change I am proposing to the House now.  In other words, that was directly against the recommendation of the majority of the Commission.  I read the report again and studied it before I finally decided that that was in fact what I should do.  I think that was a wise thing to do.  My Department had to study the report and, before I finally made up my mind, I naturally awaited the views of my Department. Other Departments had to be consulted. They did not delay excessively but their approach to the matter was not, perhaps, as expeditious as that of the Department primarily involved. There was a certain amount of delay necessarily involved in that advisable preliminary procedure.</P>
    <P>When I finally made my decision, I had to go through certain procedure. I had to submit the matter to my colleagues and ensure that I had a good case to put before them.  I decided it would be better to get a decision in principle first before drafting the heads of the Bill because it was a fundamental change I was proposing.  I got a decision in principle and then work on preparing the Bill started.  I do not think the delay has been excessive in view of all that had to be done.  As I say, this is a fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Most of the other points raised can be dealt with, I think, more satisfactorily on Committee Stage.  Deputy Fitzpatrick or Deputy Tully asked me what would be the position of the worker whose employer fails to pay contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is there are no contribution conditions.  If a worker is covered by the Act, he will be eligible for compensation.  There are penalties for employers who do not stamp their workers' cards and the <Col N="290" /> same enforcement machinery we have at the moment will implement this scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are no contribution conditions prescribed.  Noncompliance action will, of course, be taken against employers who fail to fulfil their liabilities.  Exception was taken by some Deputies to the fact that we have provided a flat rate of contribution for all types of employment. I think that is one of the attractions of the Bill.  The principle of spreading the risk is generally accepted now in all social insurance.  Some of the most important industries in the State, some of those most vital to the national economy, are those which are highly risk rated&mdash;agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining, building and construction work generally.  A flat rate of contribution is, I think, a justifiable principle; the more sedentary and less hazardous employments should bear some of the cost of this overhead, an overhead which was excessive in the case of a number of these very important industries.  Although this will mean that some of these employments will be subsidising the risks that exist in other employments, nevertheless the contribution in respect of any worker will still be fairly small and the relief given in some cases will be a great deal more than any increased charge on other industries.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not referred to the special hardship allowance.  Why is it left out?  Would he make a comment on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The special hardship allowance has not been explained at all because it does not appear in this Bill. It exists in Great Britain and Northern <Col N="291" /> Ireland.  First of all, I should explain this disablement pension and the question of injury benefit being limited to 26 weeks.  Injury benefit is the first benefit payable under this Bill.  It is paid in respect of incapacity for work. It is payable for 26 weeks at the rate of 115/- personal allowance and the usual allowances for dependants.  At the end of that period, if the disablement still exists, this new benefit of disablement pension is payable.  That will be at the rate of 115/- with no allowances for dependants, but it is not related to incapacity for work.  It will be payable if the worker has suffered some loss of faculty but is still able to work.  If he is not able to work then he will be eligible for unemployability supplement or ordinary disability benefit so that his position at the end of the 26 weeks, if he is still incapable of work, will be that there will be an increase in his total benefit of the amount of the personal allowance under disability benefit, an increase of 52/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This special hardship allowance in Great Britain and Northern Ireland operates as follows: It applies only to a weekly rate of disablement pension of less than 100 per cent and, in cases where it is less than 100 per cent, the amount is increased by a special hardship allowance if, as a result of loss of faculty arising from injury at work, the beneficiary is incapable, and likely to remain permanently incapable, of following his regular occupation and is incapable of suitable work of an equivalent standard, or if he is continually unfit for his regular occupation from the time when his injury benefit ends. The maximum allowance is 54/- but the sum of the allowance and the disablement pension may not exceed 135/- being the weekly rate of pension of 100 per cent rate, and within these limits the rate of the allowance is the difference then between the standard rate of remuneration in the beneficiary's regular occupation and that in any suitable occupation which he is able to follow.  That special hardship allowance was introduced on the Committee Stage of the Bill in Britain.  The essential feature of the allowance is that the <Col N="292" /> allowance, together with the pension, cannot exceed the maximum rate of the pension and the result is that persons with grave disability derive little or no benefit from it and the supplement is of any significant value only to those with relatively slight disablement.  A major objection to the provision of this allowance is that persons with limited disablement who are able to resume employment with some reduction in earnings would be compensated both for loss of faculty and loss of earnings within a £2-14s. limit while persons more gravely disabled would receive little or no compensation for loss of earnings.</P>
    <P>Another criticism is that, since the amount of this allowance would fall to be reduced, if the person's earning capacity should increase at any time following his loss of faculty, the payment of this allowance would be a serious disincentive to the workman's efforts to rehabilitate himself.  The administration of this allowance would be exceptionally costly and this is the one thing that would really give rise to considerable and interminable disputes. There would be the difficulty of determining equitably not only the beneficial pre-accident earnings but also the potential post-accident earnings and of adjusting these calculations where necessary by reference to the worker's prospects of advancement and other wage increases appropriate to his employment.</P>
    <P>I should say that the difficulties in arriving at an equitable determination of earnings under the existing workmen's compensation scheme led the majority of the commission to consider flat rate benefits instead.  So that the administration of this special hardship allowance would be both costly and practically impossible, certainly impossible to do it satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, which was considered in this House as a Bill towards the end of the last session, the income limit for the inclusion of non-manual workers in the social insurance scheme was raised from £800 to £1,200 a year.  This increase came into effect on 6th September and, without any further legislation, it extended eligibility for certain health services to the widened class of insured persons, and their dependants.  The health services concerned are those known as the &ldquo;middle income group&rdquo;<Col N="294" /> services and include the hospital and specialist services, the maternity and infant care service and the mental treatment service.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make similar changes for the other categories included in the group of persons entitled to avail themselves of these services.  Under section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, as amended in 1958, persons not in insurable employment but with a family income of less than £800 a year&mdash;I will from now on refer to these as the self-employed&mdash;are entitled to the services in question. So are farmers whose land, with the buildings, is valued at £50 or less. Dependants of those in these categories are also eligible.  Justice obviously demands that the change in the insurance limit should be reflected in a corresponding change in the limit for the self-employed.  Hence it is proposed by section 1 of the Bill to substitute a limit of £1,200 for the present limit of £800 for the self-employed.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to make another change as respects the self-employed which will eliminate a disadvantage from which they suffer at present in comparison with insured persons.  In calculating the yearly means of a self-employed person, there is added to his own means, not only the means of his wife but also the greater part of the means of any unmarried son or daughter living in the household.  We can well understand the motive behind this provision.  Sons and daughters, particularly when they have, as yet, no family commitments of their own, should in ordinary charity be expected to help their parents in providing the necessaries of life, including medical treatment.  However, in practical operation, this provision has given rise to anomalies and difficulties.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam go bhfuil cóipeanna eile ag teacht. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an gluaisteán briste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, I would emphasise that it applies only to the self-employed. An insured person, as such, <Col N="295" /> is eligible for these health services, irrespective of what his unmarried sons or daughters may be earning.  Thus, you could have the position where a jobbing tradesman, working on his own account in a small way, would be excluded from eligibility because he had, say, two working sons living with him while they themselves, if working under a contract of employment, would be insured and would be eligible. Secondly, while we can all agree that sons and daughters should be willing to help their parents, it must be conceded that there are often circumstances when they would find it hard to do this for understandable reasons&mdash; for example, a girl might be saving to get married, or a boy might be attending a night course to get a qualification or degree at a technical institute or university, with the expense which that involves.  Looking realistically at these factors, it seemed to me that it would be only equitable to change this rule for assessing the eligibility of a self-employed person, so that the means of the unmarried sons or daughters in the household would no longer be taken into account.  Accordingly, subsection (3) of section 1 makes a change in section 15 of the 1953 Act so that, in future, only the person's means and any means his wife may have will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the farmers, it is not quite as simple to decide what to do to keep them reasonably in line with the insured.  In 1958, when the limits for insured persons and for self-employed were raised from £600 to £800 a year, no change at all was made in the limit for the eligibility for farmers.  The reason for this was that what was being done then for the other limits merely represented a rough compensation for the fall in the value of money between 1953 and 1958.  A man who had £600 a year in 1953 was, roughly speaking, as well off as one with £800 a year in 1958.  Therefore, the object of the change in 1958 was merely to restore the limit for eligibility in real terms to what it was originally in 1953.  It was not, therefore, necessary at that time to make any change for <Col N="296" /> the farmers since a £50 valuation farm was taken as being equated to an income of £600 in 1953, and, therefore, a farm of the same valuation would obviously be equated to an income of around £800 in 1958.</P>
    <P>This time, however, it is different. The change in the income limit for insured persons and others from £800 to £1,200 a year does more than compensate for the fall in the value of money since 1958.  If we were only to make such a compensation, then the limit would merely be increased from £800 to about £1,000 a year.  The change to £1,200, therefore, represents an increase in real values of about 20 per cent.  In justice, therefore, a similar increase is due for the farming community. Hence it is proposed to raise the valuation limit for farmers from £50 to £60.</P>
    <P>Deputies may ask why we should now be making a real change in the criteria for eligibility for these services when this was not done in 1958.  The answer is that, between 1953 and 1958, the relevant medical costs&mdash;and, in particular, hospital costs&mdash;did not change very much.  In recent years, however, costs have gone up considerably. For example, the charge in a public ward in a Dublin teaching hospital has increased from 6 guineas to £17. 10.0. a week since 1961.  The reasons for these large increases in cost are complex.  They reflect increases in remuneration for hospital staff, the provision of better and more complicated equipment in institutions and general improvement in the scope and quality of services, as well as increasing prices.</P>
    <P>As a result of these increasing costs, it has become more difficult even for persons who are quite well off to budget to meet the costs of hospital treatment. The Government considered, therefore, that it would be equitable to make some adjustment so that a higher proportion of the population could use the hospital and specialist services and the other relevant services under the Health Acts.  Hence, under this Bill, the limit is to be raised to £1,200 a year and the adjustment I referred to is to be made for the farmers.  The <Col N="297" /> effect of all these changes will be to increase the proportion of the population entitled to avail themselves of these services from an estimated 85 per cent to something over 90 per cent. I should stress that over 90 per cent of the population are not now getting entirely free medical services.  The effect of these changes will be to increase the proportion of the population entitled to avail of these services from an estimated 85 per cent to something over 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that I have had discussions with representatives of the Irish Medical Association and of the Medical Union on the proposals in this Bill.  The Association and the Union were understandably perturbed lest the changes should adversely affect some of their members, particularly those who, as well as participating in the health authority services, have private practice in the higher income group.  I pointed out that at present it is not possible to know how exactly this change might affect their members, bearing in mind that many in the group now being brought into eligibility might prefer to continue to go to hospital as private patients.  This should apply particularly to those covered by voluntary health insurance.  I told the deputation that if, when the picture becomes clearer, it appears that they have been adversely affected, to a substantial extent, by the change, I will not be unsympathetic towards arranging some compensation by way of adjustment of their remuneration from public funds.  Whether this will be necessary, and the extent to which it will be necessary, can only become known after the changes proposed in the Bill have been in operation for some time.</P>
    <P>In a communication received within the last few days, the Irish Medical Association has told me that it was opposed to a comprehensive medical service on the principle that the profession would be expected to give free service to individuals who are capable of making provision for themselves without significant hardship and that this opposition applies equally to the extension as now proposed.  It is as well that this statement of the policy <Col N="298" /> of the Association should be on the records of the House.  I agree with the views of the Association in regard to the giving of free service to those able to provide it for themselves without hardship but I disagree with them that this principle is violated by the changing of the income limits proposed in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not affect the fundamental pattern of the health services. It affects only the limit for eligibility for hospital services, including mental hospital services, the specialist services and the maternity and infant care service.  However, in the light of recent references in the House to a free for all comprehensive service, I think that I should emphasise that when this Bill becomes law about 90 per cent of the population will be entitled to receive, from health authorities, full hospital care in public wards and complete out-patient specialist services.  All medical fees, drugs, medicines, nursing, radiology, pathology and other services for such persons in public wards are paid for by the health authority.  The only payment which may be required of such a person would be by way of the charges which the health authorities may make in certain cases.</P>
    <P>These charges may be made only on persons in the middle income group and in no case can the charge for intern treatment be higher than 10/-a day.  I would emphasise that this is a maximum charge which is made only in a small proportion of all the cases where charges are made.  The charge for out-patient services also applies only to the middle income group and is at the rate of 7/6 for X-rays and 2/6 for other attendances.  As many Deputies will know, from their own experiences, by far the greatest financial worry that can arise in medical care is in the arrangement of hospital treatment. As I have mentioned earlier, the cost of this treatment had increased very much in recent years and it is obviously necessary that the State should organise this comprehensive service for the very high proportion of our population which is entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that the income limit for insured persons in non-manual <Col N="299" /> employment has increased already and that the increase for self-employed persons proposed in the Bill has not yet come into effect, there may be some confusion on the exact definition of the groups entitled to the hospital services at present.  I am afraid that, until this Bill comes into operation, some such confusion seems inevitable but, when effect is given to the Bill, I propose to arrange that local health authorities will revise their information leaflets on these services so as to have available, to members of the public, up-to-date information on eligibility, on where the services are available locally and on how to go about using them.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not, of course, affect in any way the present law on determining eligibility for what we describe as the lower income group health services. The most important of these is, of course, the general medical services provided through district medical officers. I have mentioned that this service, and the determination of the group eligible for it will be particularly dealt with in the proposed White Paper.  I mention it now merely to emphasise that, for the present, there will be no change in the existing law which states that eligibility for that service is determinable by the local health authority, in each case.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House for a Second Reading.  I hope Deputies will agree that it makes opportune and necessary adjustments in the standards of eligibility for the services with which it is concerned.  I apologise to Deputies on the opposite side of the House that I did not have copies of my speech.  I hope to have them shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Particularly speaking, the object of this Bill appears to be to change the definition of the middle income group for the purposes of the Health and Mental Treatment Acts.  I approve of the Bill.  The proposal is to qualify for specialist and hospital services, etc., all people who are now insurable under the Social Welfare Acts, that is, all manual workers and non-manual <Col N="300" /> workers whose income does not exceed £1,200.  That is clear and there is no problem about that.</P>
      <P>The next category is self-employed persons.  As the Minister has stated, the upper income limit there is being increased from £800 to £1,200.  I agree with that, and it is clear enough.  It is also proposed that in ascertaining the income of a self-employed person, the income of the person concerned together with the income of that person's spouse only will be taken into account, and the income of an unmarried son or daughter will be disregarded. That is a move in the right direction because heretofore the notional incomes of unmarried sons and daughters were calculated against the parents when in very many cases the parents were not reaping any benefit from those unmarried sons and daughters and indeed in some cases they were more a liability than an asset as regards income.</P>
      <P>Before coming to category C, I should like to know from the Minister into which category a parent with a small income with a son on a farm with an £80 valuation will fall?  Will that person&mdash;we will say a father who has transferred the farm with an £80 valuation to a son and retained an annuity of £200 a year or less&mdash;fall into category C?  Or will the means of the son, the unmarried son in that case, be calculated against the parent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

That may be new to the Minister but it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can assure the Minister that in some cases medical cards are issued on that basis. The next category is category C, that is, people in the opinion of the health authority, deriving their income wholly or mainly from farming.  At the present time those whose poor law valuation does not exceed £50 fall within the middle income group, and the Bill proposes to increase the poor law valuation to £60.  From now on farmers whose income does not exceed £60, with land and buildings, will fall within the middle income group and will be entitled to institutional and specialist services at reduced rates.</P>
      <P>There is one thing in that definition with which I disagree.  The poor law valuation which is taken into account at the present time and which will be taken into account when this Bill becomes law is not the poor law valuation of the land, which is really the earning factor, but the poor law valuation of land and buildings.  I want to urge on the Minister that that provision is inequitable.  It is inequitable not through the Minister's fault but because the present rating system and the present system of valuation are inequitable. It can be that a farmer with a farm with a poor law valuation, on land, of £50, with good outbuildings which were built 20 or 30 years ago but which, nevertheless, are quite substantial buildings with a poor law valuation of £9 and a total valuation of £50 will qualify for the benefits conferred by these various Acts.  He has been lucky if he has got away with a small valuation on buildings.  The rate collector has not drawn the attention of the county council to it and the council have not listed his buildings for valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the farmer with the same £50 <Col N="302" /> valuation on land, living in the same parish, who is unfortunate or fortunate enough to add a bathroom and in some way to draw the attention of the rate collector or the county council to his house, has his buildings revalued and instead of having a £9 valuation, he has perhaps a £19 valuation, though his buildings are not in any way better and are perhaps less extensive.  He could have a valuation of £19 and therefore be deprived of the benefits of these Acts, which means he has to pay through the nose for everything.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that until such time as we get a rational and equitable system of valuation for the purposes of the Rating Acts, the valuation of buildings should be disregarded. A very strong case can be made for that.  As the Minister knows and as Deputies know, the valuation of land is static.  It cannot be changed.  It was valued under Griffiths Valuation about 100 years ago and there it stands and cannot be moved.  By and large it is fair enough.  However, the valuation of buildings can be changed at the whim of the rate collector whose duty it is to list buildings for valuation.  In making this case, I speak from experience, from local knowledge and from general knowledge of rural Ireland.  I say without fear of contradiction that there are buildings or sets of buildings throughout the country comparable in every respect and you might have a £5 valuation on one set and a £15 valuation on the other.  Indeed it could be worse than that.</P>
    <P>I presume the idea of taking the valuation of farmers into account is to try to arrive at the income of the farmers. By and large it is the land that produces the income.  In certain exceptional cases buildings could produce an income.  I cannot urge too strongly that a provision which takes the valuation of land and buildings into account in arriving at the means of a farmer is unjust, not so much on the ground that buildings cannot produce wealth but on the ground that there is no system whereby all comparable buildings carry the same valuation.  That is the ground on which I base this argument, on which I ask the Minister to have <Col N="303" /> another look at this definition and exclude the poor law valuation of buildings in arriving at the income of farmers.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I approve of the provisions of the Bill.  We could have a long discussion on the health services on the occasion of this Bill because it proposes to provide money to run the health services.  However, we had a discussion on the health services during Private Members' Time in the past couple of weeks.  We have heard the Minister&mdash;I was going to say &ldquo;confess&rdquo;: it would be a confession if he were responsible for the state of the health services at present; as an individual he is only a short time in the office of Minister for Health&mdash;admit that the health services were totally inadequate in many respects and that such things as the health card were a joke.  There is no purpose, therefore, in having another long discussion at this stage on the shortcomings of the health services, particularly as we have been promised by the Minister a White Paper before Christmas.  The Minister for Agriculture last year sent a Christmas card to practically everyone in the country.  I am glad the Minister for Health, on assuming office, is going one better and sending us before Christmas, as he has promised, a White Paper setting out his proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; covering all the people in the country, not 85 or 90 per cent.  I find it difficult to follow the Fine Gael health scheme which is without a means test and yet eliminates 15 per cent but is free for all. The Labour Party want an absolutely comprehensive health scheme to which all citizens contribute in some form and from which all receive equal benefit. There may have to be gradings according to ability to pay, as I think I mentioned in speaking last week, but the general object of our Party is to secure a complete, free-for-all health scheme.  Any improvement such as this, little and late as it may be, is still welcome.</P>
      <P>We accept the Minister as having a new and fresh idea as compared with his predecessor.  He has promised this White Paper before Christmas and the only regret I have in connection with it is that he has indicated this should be a talking point.  I hope this talking point or the discussion that will arise when the White Paper is issued will not go on and on as the Select Committee on the Health Services did.  We shall not take very much part in it if there is to be any attempt to delay something really happening in health services in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's good will; I think he is quite sincere and I believe that if it is left to him he will produce a very much improved health scheme but I fear what the Cabinet may say. There are only two things on which I want to comment and one is the IMA view which the Minister has indicated will be in opposition.  If so, people like the IMA have been met before and will be met again.  While organisations of all sorts are perfectly entitled to put forward their views the will of the Irish people must come before either the IMA or any other group and I am quite sure that if the Minister needs the support of the Labour Party in fighting any group that attempts to defeat the wishes of the House, he will get that support from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that with this amendment some 90 per cent of our <Col N="307" /> people will be covered for hospital services. That is a pretty good figure.  Is it worthwhile leaving out the other ten per cent?  Have we not almost full coverage for all citizens?  Why are the Government baulking at covering the last ten per cent?  The IMA said they object to giving these people treatment that they could afford for themselves. The Minister also said in his statement that many of those who are not now included in the 90 per cent may not avail of the services and is it not quite true that if you cover the whole population most of the ten per cent would not avail of the services?  They would want private beds, private wards and a particular type of hospital and even a particular type of doctor.  If you give complete free coverage in the health services it is quite possible that the ten per cent now left out would not avail of it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the voluntary health scheme is anything wonderful.  I have had experience of cases in which a person had the misfortune to become sick and the voluntary health organisation refused to cover this illness in the following year.  I do not think it is a very good service or that anybody can suggest that it is.  If a person is unfortunate enough to get some disease that is likely to recur he will not get cover or if he does, it will be at an excessive charge.  It is something like the method used by insurance companies in the case of car risks&mdash;they charge excessive premiums or in some cases refuse cover altogether.  I cannot understand why the Minister has baulked at the last ten per cent when now, by his own act, he has brought coverage up to 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will vote for this but we feel that enough is not being done and we intend, within the rules of the House, to put down a number of amendments in an effort to widen the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this Bill has arisen by virtue of the fact that a certain section of people have lost benefit as a result of increases in wages and salaries.  It now appears that health is one of those aspects of our lives in <Col N="308" /> which we expect much State help and we here and those outside the House are fully aware that health is very vital, so much so, that I think it behoves every Member of the House to support the Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to another section of our people which will be affected by the Bill.  Numerically it is a very small section, in no way vocal, but it is a very important section and plays a very important part in the health services. I refer to the consultants of our voluntary and public hospitals and I am glad that the Minister has not forgotten them.  It is not necessary to tell the House that those people receive their remuneration, first from the hospital by virtue of the hospital appointment they hold.  This is subsidised by the consultant's private practice and the latter is allowed because the hospital salary is so small that they need outside income to bring their salary in some way up to what is worthy of the calling of people of their skill and experience.</P>
      <P>Practically all of them had to leave the country to acquire this skill and experience.  All of them could have stayed in the foreign countries where they worked but they returned to this country, bringing their skill and experience with them.  This is one of the most patriotic things an Irishman can do&mdash;to bring back his learning, dedication and skill to this country for the benefit of its people.  We as individuals appreciate this very much.  Deputies, who represent all the individuals of the country, should indicate to the Minister that, if the occasion arises, we would like to show our appreciation to them.  The only way we can show it is by seeing that they do not lose financially by the extension of the medical services.</P>

    <P>There is a lot of talk about health services and the improvement of health services.  From what has been going on across the channel in the past few months, I feel you are going to reach a stage in this country at which you will find you have excellent services but may have no one to run them. Anybody interested in the problem should make himself acquainted with the terms offered to the doctors in <Col N="309" /> England at present.  If we have to compete with those terms, the Minister and the Department of Health will be faced with a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Discussions about health services remind me at times of the farmer who found his work getting difficult and decided, if he bought a horse, it would be easier.  He had not much experience of dealing with horses. When he got the horse, he found it was an excellent animal but it was dear to keep.  Then he decided, if he could bring the horse down to a state where he would not have to feed him, he would be getting on excellently.  He gradually reduced the diet offered to the horse.  He was informing the neighbours every day that the experiment was working excellently but eventually he had to confess to them that, just when the experiment was a success, the horse died.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that is the position we must watch.  We must make sure our horse does not die when our services are developed to a certain extent.  I am aware of the anxiety of the Minister to produce a workable health scheme and I feel certain he will not forget any section of the people working it and using it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate we have to wait for cycles of five or seven years to bring the various ceilings for State benefits of one kind or another into line with current money values.  What we need is some more comprehensive system so that, when there is a move forward in income rates, when there may be a national wages agreement or some recognised increase in income levels, the ceilings for social benefits, unemployment insurance and health services might likewise advance automatically. We were discussing earlier today and yesterday the provisions for workmen's compensation.  We have the appalling situation where we have had to wait for many years to bring the paltry £4 10s. up to something having some relationship to current wages. That should not have been allowed to develop.  Likewise here we should not have to wait seven years to raise the ceiling from £800 to £1,200.  Although perhaps we are making some compensation <Col N="310" /> by moving forward a step further than the money values of 1958 might require, I somehow feel that, unless we overhaul the system and have a different approach to this problem, in another five or seven years, we will be behind time once again&mdash; unless in the meantime we have the kind of health service Fine Gael have been advocating for years, notwithstanding the Minister's statement that he does not know anything about it, or so he pretends.  If his predecessor removed the Fine Gael memorandum from the Custom House, I trust he will be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act for removing what had become a State document.  The Department of Health should concern themselves more with that than engaging in propaganda of an undesirable kind such as they have in some respects in recent years.  Then we might get the kind of health service the country requires.</P>
      <P>We in Fine Gael welcome some provisions of this Bill.  For instance, we think it is a step forward to remove out of assessment the income which children of a family receive.  We know that in practice the amount which junior members of a family hand over to the person in charge of the home is only a very small proportion of what is earned.  I am glad to see a more realistic appreciation of this.  As the Minister correctly pointed out in his introductory speech, we do not penalise insured persons in respect of the income of their dependants.  Even if their family income should be double, treble or quadruple the insurable ceiling, we do not prohibit people from entering into or contributing to insurance by taking from the benefits of insurance.  Such people are much better provided for because they are insured.  Therefore, it is a step forward, even though rather late in the day, that we should not take the income of children into account in the present case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fitting on an occasion such as this that we should be reminded of the tremendous increase in the cost of hospitalisation. Over a short period of four years, the cost of taking care of a person in a public ward has trebled.  That <Col N="311" /> is not entirely attributable to the causes the Minister suggested.  Even if it were attributable to them, it indicates how important it is to provide assistance towards meeting the cost of medical care outside of hospitals.  We have one of the highest, if not the highest, hospitalisation rate in Europe.  The reason is&mdash;the Minister knows this and I hope he will take cognisance of it in the preparation of his White Paper&mdash;we are putting people into hospital because it is possible under our archaic system to provide them with subsidy in respect of medical assistance received in hospital when we cannot do it outside of hospital.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance scheme has been a resounding success, even though it was attacked not only by the Minister's predecessor but by the Minister and his colleagues in that Party when introduced.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board appreciate that, even under that excellent scheme, there has been a tendency to send people to hospital in order to receive some kind of assistance towards meeting medical costs, even though it might be possible to treat the people at home. But, if they had been treated at home, it would have required payment for each visit from the doctor and full payment for all drugs and medicines received. Conscientious doctors, concerned about the welfare of their patients and their ability to meet medical costs, have deliberately denied themselves the opportunity of earning money from sick people by sending them into hospital, where the money was received by other people.</P>
    <P>As long as we maintain such a health service, we will have the same tendency. We had it in the voluntary health insurance scheme in which there has been the greatest goodwill and cooperation. The same thing is operating in our public health services and it is to be hoped that we will appreciate this and have a sensible health scheme. It is much cheaper to maintain people outside public institutions.  That is common case.  It is cheaper to maintain people at home and if we would provide subsidised medicines and drugs and medical care outside hospitals, we <Col N="312" /> would save the State a great deal and, at the same time, do a great service to sick people.</P>
    <P>One would think from the Minister's presentation of the case that no levy is to be made on anybody.  That is not so.  It is not a question of 90 per cent of the people getting a free-for-all health service.  They will be required to pay for it when they are sick and when the money is not coming in.  They may have to pay less than £17.10.0 a week but they will be called on to pay 10/- a day when there is no money coming in.</P>

      <P>I have a note here which says that health authorities have an option to make a charge or not in any particular case and to decide on the amount of any charge made within the 10/- per day limit.  It has been estimated that in a recent year no charge was made in the case of 60 per cent of people in the middle income group and that only half of those in the remaining 40 per cent were charged more than 5/- a day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister now extract for me the figures for Roscommon and Leitrim and I will bow to him if I am wrong?  These averages mean nothing.  They are no comfort to a man who is dying and has to deny himself the necessary medical treatment because he cannot afford it. It is no comfort to him to know that on the national average more people are doing better than he is.  That is the kind of thing that sickens me. We are told that various figures are not important because various averages can be extracted.  They are of the greatest significance to any person suffering pain and who cannot afford necessary medical assistance.  I am concerned with human beings and not with national averages or national percentages or the variations in the interpretation of the law as between <Col N="315" /> one area and another.  We are concerned with human beings and all Irish men and women, as human beings, not because they belong to any county, are entitled to the best that society can give them.</P>
      <P>I shall now deal with the question of the Minister's fundamental approach to the health service.  He says he agrees with the views of the Irish Medical Association which have been expressed to him.  I quote from the Minister's brief:</P>
      <P>In a communication received within the last few days, the Irish Medical Association has told me that it was opposed to a comprehensive medical service on the principle that the profession would be expected to give free service to individuals who are capable of making provision for themselves without significant hardship and that this opposition applies equally to the extension as now proposed.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he agrees in principle with the Medical Association but the Minister contends that the extension that is suggested in this particular piece of legislation will not offend against that principle.</P>
      <P>We feel that society has a clear obligation by the application of modern sophisticated techniques to collect from people who can afford to pay a reasonable contribution so that all people who are ill or injured can call upon the society to which they have made contribution to assist them when they need medical benefit.  We make no apology to the Minister or the Medical Association or anybody else for that fundamental approach of ours.  We do not think it is degrading, we do not think it is injuring the self-respect of individuals, to develop here a society in which all will help everybody, in which all will work together so that the weakest can have the same medical benefit as the strongest whenever the afflictions to which we all are heir come upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May we emphasise that Pope John XXIII emphasised the moral obligation that rests on all societies to apply these techniques?  If the Minister <Col N="316" /> wishes to take his stand with those who are opposed to the development here of a society of mutual help he will be deservedly in a minority whenever our society appreciates this obligation and does something to fulfil it.</P>
    <P>One does not wish to extend this debate beyond the immediate purposes of this Bill except to the extent that the Minister in his opening statement may have provoked such discussion.  We in Fine Gael are glad that this Bill is going as far as it does go.  We wish it would go very much farther but, as it is a small step, even a tottering and unsteady step, towards the just society in which we believe, we are generally in favour of it.</P>

      <P>We of the Labour Party, of course, welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.  There is some confusion in the House as to what is meant by a comprehensive health service.  The Labour Party mean by a comprehensive health service, which we would like to see introduced, a service which would be paid for directly out of the Exchequer.  Fianna Fáil have one idea of a comprehensive health service; Fine Gael have another.  We of the Labour Party say that a comprehensive health service is a health service where the full facilities of the medical services are available to everyone in the country and the charge is a direct charge on the Exchequer.  That is what we understand by a comprehensive health service which, of course, as I have said, we would like to see introduced. This Bill is, in a very small way, leaning towards that.  It represents an extension of the existing inadequate health service.  I see that the Irish Medical Association is opposed to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not be receiving it free from the medical profession.  He would in actual fact be paying for it.  I cannot see anything logical in that statement that has been quoted.  An income of £1,200 per annum is not a very big income nowadays having regard to the high cost of living.  Imagine a man who must go to hospital and pay £17 10s. per week <Col N="318" /> out of an income of £24 a week.  It would cripple him financially.  Imagine a man with two children in hospital for the removal of tonsils, as commonly happens, paying 14 guineas a week. Those who are not covered by the existing service must pay 14 guineas for a child over one month.  That is why I say the extension of the income limit for the purposes of the existing health services to £1,200 a year is overdue because the cost of hospital service is prohibitive and it is impossible for the group on the fringe to provide medical services for themselves.</P>
      <P>For years past the Voluntatry Health Insurance Board have opposed giving any benefits to persons who would like to remain at home.  Their rule was that in order to avail of the service, insured persons must go into hospital.  As a doctor, I fought them on this issue for three years.  Now, suddenly, when they see this extension of the medical service, they rush into print and say they will offer benefits to persons who remain at home because they are afraid of losing this group who will benefit under the health services.  A few years ago they told me it was impossible to do it.  Now they are prepared to help out.  They think they could do it now because they know that otherwise they will lose the group of people who will benefit under this extension.  The voluntary health insurance scheme certainly needs overhauling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the change in the rule for assessing eligibility of a self-employed person so that the means of unmarried sons or daughters in the household would no longer be taken into account.  We have this problem arising time and again.  It is not a question of what a son or daughter earns; it is what actually goes into the home that matters.  This morning I went to see a patient who is in quite bad circumstances.  He could not get a medical card because he has two sons working.  They each contribute £2 10s. towards their keep. There is no law under which they can be compelled to pay more.  It is, perhaps, unfortunate that they do not realise their responsibilities; but that is the general pattern.  A son may <Col N="319" /> earn £12 per week, but that does not mean that he gives up £12 per week at home.</P>
    <P>We approve of this provision.  It is said that the Irish Medical Association is opposed to it.  There are a great many general practitioners in the Association and, for my part, I cannot understand why general practitioners could be opposed to it.  It will not affect them.  They will not lose anything by it.  Perhaps some consultants will, but then the Voluntary Health Insurance helps those.  It would be too much to ask a man earning £24 a week to go privately to a surgeon and pay the cost of an operation or specialist services.  I think it would be very difficult for such a man to meet an expense like that unless he had voluntary health insurance.  And voluntary health insurance helps the consultant.  The general medical practitioners, who form the majority in the Irish Medical Association, will not, I believe, be adversely affected by this extension.</P>
    <P>This is a move in the right direction. We welcome it.  We would wish it went a little further.  I believe the Minister honestly wants a comprehensive health service, though I was inclined to think differently at one stage. I do not think a comprehensive health service would involve any tremendous charge on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>We do not think insurance contributions would be sufficient to cover the comprehensive scheme we have in mind.  We believe a comprehensive health service should be a direct charge on the Exchequer, as it is in Britain.  I refer to the scheme introduced by Aneurin Bevan.  That is the ideal.  Any abuses that might arise initially could be overcome, as they have been overcome in Britain. When there is talk about dissatisfaction with the health services in Britain, it must be remembered that it is not the people who are dissatisfied.  That is most important.  The health services are available free to everyone in Britain.  They are paid for by the Exchequer and the more you have, the more you pay.  That is the way it should be.  That is what we mean by a comprehensive health service.  We do not think insurance contributions could pay for it.  The Labour Party would never agree that insurance contributions would pay for such a service. We believe it should be a charge on the Exchequer.  When we speak of a comprehensive health service, we mean a free health service for everyone.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to deal with all the points raised, but there is just one matter I should like to stress.  It is in reference to a point raised by both Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Ryan.  The cost of hospital treatment has increased considerably, <Col N="321" /> but it should be borne in mind that, even though a man may have an income of over £1,200 a year, the charge for maintaining him in hospital can be at a substantially reduced rate. The provision is there in the 1953 Health Act, section 15 (d).  There have been cases in which people over the limit have suffered very grave, and sometimes continuing, hardship from the point of view of costs.  The possibility is that in the future people with £1,300, £1,400, £1,500, £1,600 a year, and maybe more, will be able to prove undue hardship under section 15 (d) which says:</P>
      <P>Persons not specified in the foregoing paragraph who, in the opinion of the health authority, would be unable without undue hardship to provide institutional and specialist services for themselves or their dependants.</P>
      <P>That will still apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister knows that anyone outside the normal range pays £14.14/- a week for a child and £17.10/- for an adult per week. A man with £20 a week pays that at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the hardship clause has been availed of on very many occasions, but I also admit there are people who do not know of the existence of this hardship clause.</P>
