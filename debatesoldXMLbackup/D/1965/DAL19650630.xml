      <P>I outlined the subject matter of my talks with Captain O'Neill in my reply to questions addressed to me in this House on 10th February last.  I have nothing to add to that reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this is a suitable matter for discussion between the two Governments? He is doubtless aware that 15,000 signatures have been collected in Derry in protest against the siting of the new university in Coleraine.  The Northern Ireland Labour Party and other groups in Stormont have raised this question.  His colleague, the Minister for Local Government, will tell him about the depressed state of that part of the country.  It would be in the interests of the north-western area if such a university could be sited in Derry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: I understand that two of the five mines in County Laois are now working but that the other three are still closed.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 15th June regarding the steps being taken to alleviate the anthracite producers' difficulties.  It is too early to assess the effect of these steps on the operations of the mines in County Laois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware of the widespread alarm amongst residents in North Great George's Street, Dublin following the collapse of a building on the 24th June last, and whether he will make a statement on the matter as people living in the North Great George's Street-Mountjoy Street area feel that the method of assessment leading to a building being condemned is not sufficiently thorough with the result that people continue to live in tenements which are potentially dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the <Col N="210" /> Deputy is referring to the collapse of the back wall of premises at 34 North Great George's Street during a high wind last Thursday.  I understand that, prior to collapse of the wall, the corporation had determined that the premises were unsuitable for occupation and had the roof removed and that, immediately following the incident, the corporation had the adjoining house, No. 33, de-tenanted as a precautionary measure.  The corporation have no evidence of widespread alarm amongst other residents in the area.</P>
      <P>The general survey of defective buildings in the city, being carried out by corporation staff which has been specially augmented for the purpose, is progressing and immediate action is taken as defective buildings are encountered.  The corporation are satisfied that the present arrangements are adequate and, in fact, they have received criticisms that their standards are over-strict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know when the last inspector went down to this area and found there was no widespread alarm.  I do know there was widespread alarm there last Thursday evening.  If the Minister will get some other official to check up what the recent feeling is, he will find it is as I have suggested in this question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he will give the number of applications received by the town planning department of Dublin Corporation for the erection of supermarkets since the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 came into operation; and whether the planning department take into account the plight of small traders affected, many of whom are being driven out of business as a result of the indiscriminate spread of supermarkets which are often backed by foreign capital.</P>

      <P>I am informed that since the 1st October, 1964, the date of coming into operation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, Dublin Corporation received applications for permission for the erection of five supermarkets and for construction of eight shopping centres each of which included a supermarket.  I am advised that the effect which supermarkets may have on other traders in the vicinity is not a consideration which may be taken into account by the planning authority in considering such applications.  I should add that the conversion of existing shops to supermarkets would in many cases be free from planning control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to gather from the Minister's reply that if existing traders in an area where it is proposed to erect a supermarket, which must affect their returns, make representations to the planning authority with regard to the erection of the supermarket, these representations will be ignored?  Is that the implication of the Minister's reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>I have received a report from Waterford County Council stating that the council have decided not to proceed with the Modeligo regional water supply scheme and that a sub-committee, appointed to deal with the water supplies of the county, have recommended to the council that the residents of the Modeligo area should be encouraged to undertake group or private water supply schemes and that the position be re-examined in the course of a few months.  The report further states that formal consideration of this recommendation was adjourned to the next meeting of the county council.  Further to the Deputy's previous question, the costs <Col N="215" /> incurred by the council on the Modeligo scheme are stated in the report to be £2,673 15s. 9d.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think it alarming that a piped water supply scheme in a pretty advanced stage should be sabotaged in favour of a group water supply scheme as a result of a deputation being received from a certain organisation?

      <P>I am not sufficiently well versed in the matters that brought about this report to reply to the supplementary questions of the Deputy, but I would point out that the formal consideration of the recommendation in the report was adjourned to a later meeting of the council which has not yet taken place.  If the mind of the council is in any way reflected by what the Deputy has said, it may well be that the recommendation might not be adopted but I am not in a position to give an opinion at this stage as to whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing to do so.</P>

      <P>A request from the Clonmel Corporation on the lines in question was dated 30th July, 1964, but it was not indicated specifically that it was by way of motion by the corporation.  The request was not acknowledged while it was under examination, but when the corporation renewed their representations they were informed on 2nd March, 1965, that the matter was receiving consideration. The proposal was subsequently discussed at a meeting between the county manager and officials of my Department. Following on this discussion, I am communicating my views on the matter to the corporation.  I do not consider it would be useful to meet a deputation from the borough council at this stage because no question of allocation of a main road improvement grant to any road authority can arise until the allocations for 1966-67 come up for consideration at the end of the year.  I am, however, prepared to consider any specific representations which the corporation may make to me as to the use, where appropriate, of Road Fund moneys in the redevelopment of the borough area under the Planning and Development Act.</P>

      <P>These halls are licensed under Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  That Part of the Act has effect in any area only where there is in force a resolution of the appropriate local authority, in this case Dublin Corporation, for its adoption in relation to that area.  A resolution may relate to the whole of the administrative area of the local authority or to any part or parts thereof and it may be rescinded.  Applications for licences in respect of individual premises are dealt with by the District Court.  The court is obliged to have regard to certain factors when dealing with an application, among them being the number of existing licensed halls in the locality and the kind of gaming proposed to be carried on.</P>
      <P>The Act itself sets limits to the stakes and prize-money and it prohibits the operation, in licensed amusement halls or elsewhere, of slot machines that pay winnings direct to the players.  The Act empowers the court to attach conditions to licences restricting the kinds of gaming that may be promoted, etc.  The Garda check to ensure that the provisions of the Act and any conditions attaching to the licences are observed and they have from time to time prosecuted licensees for offences under the Act.</P>

      <P>They do not actually close offices except on the occurrence of vacancies and then only where the retention of the office is clearly uneconomic.  In this case, the subpostmistress died last March and none of the immediate relatives was interested in running the office, and in fact it was not possible to get anybody to run it and it was automatically closed without a protest from the area. That was in last March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proportion of the population covered by medical cards has remained stable at about 29 per cent for some years, which would indicate that, generally, in considering applications for medical cards health authorities <Col N="226" /> have made due allowance for changes in the economic situation, including the effects of any increases in the cost of living.</P>

Would the Minister be good enough to issue a statement indicating that dependants of Army privates, and even of corporals, are entitled to medical cards?

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in a reply which I gave in the House on 16th instant, the immediate aim is to establish at St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin, a centre to provide on a nation-wide basis a mass screening service for the early detection of cervical cancer using the technique of cyto-diagnosis.  The information available to me at the moment suggests that, for a population of our size, such a service can be organised effectively and economically on a centralised basis and that regional centres are not necessary.  I do not contemplate, however, that the Regional service operated from the Regional Hospital, Galway, should be absorbed by the St. Kevin's Hospital centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage it is not possible for me to be specific as to when a countrywide service will be available, but I would hope that as soon as a cytologist is appointed at the St. Kevin's centre, rapid progress will be made. If that hope is realised, there would <Col N="229" /> be no necessity to organise, for hospital staffs, special instruction in the technique of cyto-diagnosis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in view of the connection between cigarette smoking <Col N="230" /> and cancer, he will initiate a campaign in the primary, secondary and vocational schools to educate the pupils on the health hazard involved in contracting the habit and so avoid the danger of another generation of cigarette smokers becoming addicted to the habit in ignorance of its harmful effect.</P>

      <P>There is such a campaign at present.  Each year copies of my Department's leaflet for young people entitled &ldquo;Starting to Smoke?&rdquo; are distributed in all schools, primary, secondary and vocational.</P>
      <P>Last year, when the report of the Advisory Committee to the United States Surgeon General was published, a summary of the Committee's findings and of other investigations was sent to every teacher in the country by my predecessor with a request that this risk to health be continuously impressed on young people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  At least 21 days notice shall be given of the hearing of any appeal by the Special Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear, in dealing with this amendment, that this is not something that has been my <Col N="239" /> personal experience.  Rather, my personal experience has been to the contrary.  I am told by accountants who are dealing with the question of appeals regularly that in recent years it has become a practice that, at the end of a week, a Thursday or a Friday, the accountants concerned are informed that the cases with which they are concerned have been listed for appeal at the beginning of the following week.  I know the Minister will at once agree that that is a highly undesirable practice if it does occur. At the very least, there should be some understanding, if there is not statutory provision, that an appeal could not be listed, except by consent, without an adequate period of notice. Accordingly, I move that 21 days notice be a statutory period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the purpose of the amendment.  I understand that the practice is that no appeal is heard unless at least ten days notice is given.  I have consulted the Revenue Commissioners about the implied suggestion and, I think, the express suggestion made on Second Stage by the Deputy, that such short notice as he has now referred to has in fact been given from time to time. They said they were unaware of such cases and that the inspectors are specifically required to give the ten days notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the extension of the ten to 21 days statutory notice, I understand that in some cases it suits the appellant, the taxpayer, better. Take, for example, the person who has business outside the State.  If his appeal would come in not lower than a 21-day period, it might be to his inconvenience.  In some cases, I understand that appellant taxpayers require a shorter period, certainly a period shorter than 21 days, possibly a period shorter than ten days.  I believe it is better to leave it flexible if only for that purpose but perhaps for other purposes as well and on the strict understanding that the ten days will be strictly adhered to.  Furthermore, as I believe is the case, if the ten days notice is not sufficient, the inspectors are usually amenable to an extension <Col N="240" /> of the period.  I suggest that, in all the circumstances, it would be better to leave it flexible and not to tie it down to a statutory 21 days.  It might affect the convenience at least in some cases of the appellant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 10 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956 (No. 47 of 1956) is hereby amended as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>`the definition of &ldquo;goods&rdquo; shall include day old chicks produced within the State'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I moved a similar amendment to the Finance Bill in 1964.  There are additional reasons now why I think this amendment should be accepted.  When speaking on this amendment last year, I explained that this was an industry that gave considerable employment in the west of Ireland and in other parts of the country, especially to small farmers who were producing eggs as hatchery supply farms and again at the hatchery itself where the chickens were hatched out for export and there <Col N="241" /> were packaging and carriage, and so on, to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In 1964, the export of day-old chicks was in the region of £300,000.  This is a considerable export.  I am sure the Minister is aware that, during the past year, this industry has gone through a great deal of difficulty and has lost heavily because of the closing of the Border, due to fowl pest.  It is only with extreme difficulty that the industry is kept going at all.  In fact, it is in serious danger of closing down altogether.</P>
    <P>I warned, when I moved this amendment previously, that there was danger of the principal firm engaged in this export industry leaving the country, if they did not get certain facilities, and moving up to the north of Ireland. Already, that has happened with portion of their business.  I greatly fear that if the Minister does not accept this amendment, he will lose this industry altogether.  The poultry industry generally in this country has run down to such a degree that soon we shall have no poultry industry, if we do not take more of an interest in it than we are taking at the present time.</P>
    <P>I said that last year the export value of this industry was approximately £300,000.  One firm alone exported about 80 per cent of its day-old chicks.  I fail to see, and the Minister's predecessor failed to give me any reason, why, for instance, mushrooms should enjoy this tax relief, while, at the same time, the day-old chicks industry is not allowed it.  I appeal to the Minister to take a look at this.  There are many people dependent on the acceptance of this amendment, many smallholders in the west of Ireland and others throughout the country who are benefiting at present but who will cease to benefit if we lose this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as competent as Deputy Clinton to deal generally with the poultry industry, but, as he appreciates, no doubt as well as I do, there is a difficulty in any event by reason of the deficiency payments by the British Government to British farmers in poultry production as in many other agricultural <Col N="242" /> production activities.  I think that is the root difficulty of our poultry industry here.  The day-old chick industry is, perhaps, something different. The relief of taxes on profits earned by exports was introduced initially to assist industrial undertakings as such and it was a very worthwhile relief for which I give due credit to Deputy Sweetman.  It did give considerable impetus to our export industry. The intention was to confine it to industrial production proper because it was felt that it was through industrial production that we could help our balance of payments problem and increase employment generally.</P>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the case made by Deputy Clinton in so far as he cited the two cases, the fish farm products and the products of concentrated mushroom growing, but when these were introduced initially no doubt whoever was Minister for Finance at the time&mdash; probably Dr. Ryan&mdash;must have been conscious of the pressure that would be on him and on future Ministers to extend the scope still further.  To extend the scope now to day-old chicks would give grounds for an extension of the scope of export tax relief to other forms of agricultural production, even those forms in respect of which subsidies are paid by the taxpayer.  I am afraid that in order to hold a line somewhere, I must reject the Deputy's amendment, at this stage at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is&mdash; whether correct or not&mdash;that if the proposal for the poultry plant in Bandon had gone ahead, it would have done so on the undertaking that broilers would be exempt.  If that is so, it is really difficult to understand why we give relief to the mushroom industry where there is no industrial process and give it to the products of fish farms where there is no industrial process, why we had decided to give it for broilers and decided to exclude day-old chicks.  It does not make sense. The Minister should be really concerned about the fact that there is a distinct danger of losing this industry altogether, an industry that last year <Col N="243" /> earned something in the region of £300,000 and something which the <Col N="244" /> country, especially at present, cannot afford to ignore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The allowance against income tax in respect of a dependent relative or relatives shall be £100 in respect of each such relative.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the allowance <Col N="245" /> for a dependent relative remained at the same level for many years.  In 1956, it was increased by £10.  In the meantime, costs have risen considerably and expenses of all kinds, not merely those included in the Consumer Price Index, but the general expenses involved in maintaining individuals, have increased.  Many years ago the allowance in respect of children and the allowance in respect of a housekeeper were raised.  In the case of a dependent relative, the allowance was increased last year to £60, as compared with the £50 which had operated for approximately ten years.  There is no doubt that the same case for increasing the dependent relative allowance can be made as was made in the case of either children or a housekeeper. Since the allowance was last fixed, there has been a very steep increase in costs of all sorts.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is much need really to stress the point because everybody is familiar with the well-known circumstances surrounding living costs and the cost of maintaining a relative.  There seems to be no justification for a differential between a dependent relative and a housekeeper and, for that matter, though there is a slight difference, children.  We believe that the allowance should be increased now to £100.  That would be reasonable, taking into account present day price levels and the changes which have occurred in prices since the allowance was last increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must oppose this amendment, mainly on the ground of what it would cost.  I appreciate the arguments made by Deputy Cosgrave that costs have increased considerably in the years since 1956 when the allowance was raised from £50 to £60; but so have incomes generally and, while that is in ease of the Revenue, it is also in ease of the taxpayer.  Because of the difficulty in raising taxation otherwise in order to provide for this relief, I must resist the amendment; it is difficult to see where else the money could come from just at this stage.</P>

      <P>It would be difficult to isolate this allowance from all the other allowances given.  I do not think it would be possible to isolate this particular one.  If a case can be made for this particular allowance, a case can equally well be made for all the others.  In the circumstances, I was able to avoid any increase in income tax this year&mdash;something I was very glad to achieve&mdash;and I think it is not unreasonable to leave matters stand now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's last point, it seems to me he is echoing a view we heard more than once expressed by his predecessor, the view that it is more desirable to stabilise the standard rate of tax or, perhaps, reduce it, than it is to increase the allowances.  The Minister has said that, if costs have increased, so also has income.  The fact is that none of the personal allowances or reliefs has kept pace with inflation.  It is not normally easy to compare one year's money with another, but it is particularly easy this year to compare the £ today with the 1938 £.  Our £ today is worth less than 6/8 in 1938 values.  Personal allowances and reliefs have not kept pace with that decline in money values and the effect of that is that there are <Col N="247" /> people in the tax net now, with dependent relatives, who were not in the tax net in 1938-39.  It is surely very important to keep these allowances and reliefs in pace with inflation.</P>
      <P>There is another point I want to make particularly in relation to dependent relative allowances.  Other forms of dependency provisions, annuities and such like, which qualify for tax relief would very probably be abated if this amendment were accepted.  Take the case of a feeble-minded son or daughter, aged 25 or 30 years, who does not qualify for the child allowance or the £120.  All the unfortunate parent will get for such a dependant is the miserable, inadequate allowance of £60.  That implies that such a dependant can be maintained for less than 3/6 a day.  That is absurd.  I suggest it is very important now to remove the sense of grievance and injustice which rankles in the hearts of so many taxpayers.  An allowance of £60 for a dependent relative is almost useless.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the premise that, because the allowance is £60, the parent is expected to keep the child on that £60.  The purpose of allowances is to make it easier for people to raise families.  I agree that the higher the allowance the easier that is, but there is no justifiation for suggesting that, because the allowance is £60, the presumption is that the parent can keep the child for the year on that £60.  I should like to increase the allowance.  It would be in ease of many people, but it would be difficult to keep pace every year with the falling value of money.  In no country has pace been kept with the falling value of money in this respect.  I should be very pleased if I could do what is asked but the Budget has to provide for a certain amount of money and reliefs given have to be made up elsewhere. Just at this stage I do not see where I could find compensation for any further relief in this respect.</P>

      <P>It seems to me the speech just made by the Minister <Col N="248" /> is one of the worst counsels of despair ever heard in this House.  The Minister has acknowledged that the value of money will go on falling year by year and he is going to do nothing to soften that.</P>

      <P>Surely that is an illogical approach.  If, in 1956, it was thought desirable to make, and the economy could afford, an allowance of £60 in respect of a dependent relative, that was intended to make the allowance an allowance in terms of real money.  If, in the past eight years or so, however it occured, the value of money has dropped, or been allowed to drop, surely that cannot be said to justify now a <i>non possumus</i> attitude on the part of the Minister for Finance? I could understand it if the Minister were defending a dependent relative allowance fixed last year, or the year before, or at some fairly recent point in time.  The Minister might well say then that the fact that the cost of living has risen in the intervening period of 24 months, or whatever it may be, and the value of money has dropped is too difficult a factor to be considered right now in relation to the level of the allowance.</P>
      <P>Here, however, we have a rate which was fixed in, I think, a Budget introduced by Deputy Sweetman in 1956 and it has not been touched since.  We all know that in the past eight or nine years, there has been a dramatic fall in the value of money.  That is one of our troubles, whatever the cause may be; we will discuss the cause in another context shortly.  I would urge in these circumstances that the Minister should do something in respect of this small section of our community and this very definite social problem.</P>

      <P>There is just one point on that.  While I cannot but <Col N="249" /> admit there have not been any increases in these allowances since 1956, nevertheless the basic rate of tax in 1956 was 7/6.  That has now been reduced to 6/4.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Minister to have regard to the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission on this matter.  We all know the previous Minister for Finance rejected most of the recommendations in the several reports of the Commission. He was notoriously conservative in his approach to income tax reform.  The Commission is on record as recommending that this allowance should be parallel to the child allowance. I mentioned a case a few moments ago of the feeble-minded son or daughter of 25, 30 or more who does not qualify for a child allowance of £120.  It surely costs a parent more to keep such a feeble-minded child than it does to keep a child under 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>We must instil some measure of equity into our tax code.  It is an old maxim that equity is a stranger to income tax.  That state of affairs has been too readily accepted for far too long.  There are now approximately 250,000 people paying tax in this country and grave injustices are being perpetrated under our tax code.  I urge the Minister, if he cannot see his way to accept this amendment currently&mdash;I admit I am a little shocked to hear it would cost £750,000&mdash;to look at the matter more closely next year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an individual has been involved in expense in respect of illness the amount of such expense shall be deducted from or set-off against any income for the year of assessment of such person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which we tabled on previous occasions, and we table it now again in this Dáil.  Its object is to allow a situation under the income tax code in which medical expenses arising from illness occasioned to the taxpayer in respect of that year's assessment will rank as an allowance for income tax purposes.  It is perhaps not generally understood that, in relation to medical expenses or any payment in respect of illness, the first and only concession made in that regard was made by Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance.  In order to assist and encourage people to make provision with regard to illness, he allowed as an income tax allowance premiums paid in respect of schemes of health insurance.  That has been of benefit to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here with the type of case where perhaps there is not adequate cover in respect of illness or no cover at all.  We are concerned with cases where there may be in the home a situation of chronic and persistent illness requiring treatment which is not covered by the present scheme of voluntary health insurance.  There are many cases of people with, for example, the affliction of diabetes or <Col N="251" /> some chronic illness of that kind who are, day in and day out, week after week, month after month, involved in consistent expense for the provision of drugs and medicines, which never seem to drop but always to increase in price.</P>
    <P>Expenses of that kind for high-priced drugs and medicines&mdash;apart altogether from expenses in relation to medical attention&mdash;do not rank for allowance under the income tax code. Deputy P. Byrne mentioned that equity and income tax do not usually go hand in hand.  That may have been the situation in the past.  But at least some people in this House are endeavouring to achieve a just society and move towards it.  Certainly, in a more just society, an allowance would be made in respect of expenses of this kind caused to taxpayers without any fault of their own, either by reason of their own illness or that of some member of their family.  Some move should be made to meet this situation.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have tabled this amendment on other occasions.  We have always been met by an expression of ministerial benevolence, which in fact achieves very little.  The Minister always said: &ldquo;I would like to be able to do that, but unfortunately it would cost me some money and the state of the finances would not permit it.&rdquo; Therefore, each year it was staved off until next year.  Here we are discussing the first Finance Bill in this 18th Dáil.  I hope the Minister, when he stands up, will not say to me: &ldquo;Well, I would love to be able to do this, but perhaps it will have to wait for another day, the next Budget, perhaps, or the Budget afterwards.&rdquo;  That has been what we have been told for many years back.  We do feel there has been sufficient notice of a demand in this regard to have expected some signs of ministerial activity in relation to it by now.  I would urge that the Minister should come some way to meet us on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to reply to an argument like that when the Deputy anticipates what I might otherwise have said&mdash;that I <Col N="252" /> would like to do this but, having regard to the cost, I find it difficult to do it.  I will say it.  I would like to be able to do it, but possibly not to the same extent as is sought in this amendment.</P>
      <P>This is a very wide amendment.  It refers to an individual involved in expense in respect of illness.  It does not say what kind of illness.  Under the amendment, any expense any person would be involved in in respect of any illness would have to rank for an allowance, and I am sure the cost would run into some millions.  It is true this amendment was moved on a number of other occasions and the Minister resisted it, even though he said, as I have said, it would be desirable if it could be done.  But it should be done on an equitable basis. The fact is that the person who pays only a very small amount of income tax or no income tax at all would not benefit from this amendment.</P>
      <P>If such a person were not covered by the medical card scheme or were not a member of the Voluntary Health Scheme, the fact that he pays no income tax would not give him any benefit.  The man who pays a lot of income tax would get considerable help from the State, even to the extent, I am informed, of 69 per cent of his medical bill.  If I accepted the amendment, I would be giving relief to the well-off and no relief to the not so well-off.  I regret that for those reasons I have to resist it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to look more closely at the amendment, and if he is not satisfied with the wording of it, assuming, as I do assume, his genuinenss in the remarks he has made, if the amendment requires tightening up, Deputies on this side of the House will go out of their way to meet him.  The Minister thinks the wording of the amendment too wide.  If there is any indication from him that his Department is prepared to give way at all along this line, it will not take five minutes to agree an amendment which will meet the Minister's point of view and the point of view of most Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> Would the Minister be prepared to agree in principle that if an amendment is moved limiting the concession to the person himself, or to a member of his family or a dependant, that would narrow the field?  The Minister is probably aware, in his personal capacity, that this question of medical and hospital expenses is one that creates a real fear and dread in the minds of many heads of families throughout the country.  We are not talking of the well-off, nor are we talking of the particularly badly off who are catered for under the social welfare schemes.  We are talking of the middle man who has not enough money to save up for hospital expenses or to join the Voluntary Health Scheme.  That is the type of person who would benefit from acceptance of this amendment and the Minister would be doing a very great service if he would indicate that he would accept the amendment, even in a limited form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the plea made by Deputy O'Higgins.  We are not committed to the phraseology used in the amendment, and if it were possible to agree on wording which would limit the amendment or which would cover more closely defined categories, we would accept it.  While the Voluntary Health Scheme provides very valuable and useful assistance for people who are members of it, it has, as at present operated, certain limits.  A person has to go to hospital and spend a certain period in hospital before he can benefit from it.  The result is that even certain X-ray examinations, which would not in the ordinary course be done in hospital, are now done there in order that they can be paid for under the Voluntary Health Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has stated, there are many types of illness of a chronic nature which require treatment by drugs and medicine but for which a stay in hospital is not necessary. There are cases where people have to use certain prescribed medicines over a protracted period and the expenses involved in the purchase of these medicines can become a very <Col N="254" /> considerable burden on them.  As has been stated, that is one of the greatest dreads which face people who are not covered by our social welfare schemes or who are not entitled to free treatment. A person may well be a member of the Voluntary Health Scheme but, because of the nature of his illness, is not required to spend a period in hospital.  As long as that illness lasts, and some of them may last for a long time, that person is obliged to make very heavy payments for drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>One of the worst features of such illness is that the person suffering may not know how long the illness may last.  We are all aware of how expensive drugs and medicines are and very often, even if these drugs and medicines are effective, they place a burden on the person who has to use them that is very heavy indeed.  We do not mind redrafting this amendment or asking the Minister to get his draftsmen to do it, so that it might be confined in a manner that would meet the Minister's requirements.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which has been discussed over a number of years and every year that passes confirms the views expressed that a very heavy burden is thrown on people who have to use drugs and medicines for illnesses which do not require them to go to hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has adduced the weakest possible argument against the amendment when he says that he will not do a good which would be conferred on many because he cannot do an equal amount of good for everybody.  There is no piece of legislation ever passed by this Oireachtas or by any other parliament in respect of which it could be said that it conferred the same amount of benefit on everybody.  It is impossible for a human parliament to apportion the same quantity of benefit to everybody and it is wrong for the Minister to say that he will not do good for some because he cannot do the same amount of good for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The justification for income tax as distinct from other forms of taxation is that it is a tax imposed upon a <Col N="255" /> portion of a person's income which is surplus to the amount necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  It is a tax on that portion of a person's income in respect of which he has a certain discretion as to the manner in which it be expended or distributed and the manner in which he expends or distributes the income is something not related to the necessaries of life but to providing a better standard of living or a more comfortable standard of living for himself and his dependants.  But it clearly cannot be said that a man has a discretion over what he is to expend on the relief of human misery.  Truly it cannot be said that he has a discretion as to the amount of money he will expend on necessary medical attention.</P>
    <P>I can see that the argument may arise even between doctors as to whether an intensive course of treatment would be necessary, or a mild one, or whether an operation would be necessary or whether a course of medicine would suffice.  There are certain medical reliefs which are necessary for the relief of pain, certain medical reliefs necessary to prevent death, and any money expended on these categories are not, under our tax code, deductible when the Revenue Commissioners come to collect the tax on a man's income.  That seems to be entirely inequitable and indeed to paraphrase Deputy P. Byrne, equity and income tax are strangers.  That should not be so certainly in relation to a matter so vital as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his opposition because he says the greatest benefit would be conferred on a person paying the greatest amount of income tax.  Such people would benefit, unless the amendment were tightened up to prevent that, but certainly it should be possible to insert into our code that relief be given to people in a certain bracket of income or taxation. Take the case of a man who may have necessary medical expenses in one year amounting to £60 or £100. Such a man may be called on in the same year to pay income tax of similar dimensions.  Clearly, it would be of substantial assistance if his income tax <Col N="256" /> bill were to be remitted altogether or reduced by one-third or one-half, or some proper proportion.</P>
    <P>The people who could benefit greatly by the amendment we suggest are the people who are deprived of any benefit under our existing health code. They are people who cannot afford the colossal burden of medical treatment or care which we have to bear in this day and age.  There are very many cures available today which are simple but costly and many families who deprive themselves of drugs or medicines which could provide the necessary and quick relief simply because the amount of income left after taxation does not permit them to do so.  In some cases people allow their health to deteriorate so much that ultimately they have to give up working and go into hospital.  In many cases such people may become a charge on the public purse because the costs of their illnesses are such that they are not able to pay the bill.  If people were encouraged by a significant relief in the payment of income tax to provide themselves with medical care at the proper time, it is reasonable to expect that the Exchequer might benefit in the long run by being relieved of the substantial burden imposed at present because we encourage people, under our present code, to neglect themselves until their state of health has so deteriorated that they become a burden on the public purse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not yet been adverted to that this amendment springs from Recommendation No. 12 in the Seventh Report of the Income Tax Commission and all of the difficulties involved in providing an allowance for special circumstances, such as envisaged by this amendment, were fully considered by the Commission. It is worthy of note that the Revenue Commissioners went on record before the Income Tax Commission as being opposed to this amendment.  Theoretically, income tax is a non-discriminatory tax which does not take account of special circumstances.  It is because of doctrines such as this that this appalling position exists, of the <Col N="257" /> great disparity between our tax code and simple equity.</P>
      <P>The Government in the Second White Paper on Direct Taxation set out their attitude to the Commission's Recommendation in the following terms, and I quote from paragraph 39 of the White Paper:</P>
      <P>The possibility will be examined of framing a scheme which would be administratively practicable and at the same time would effectively confine the relief to cases of the kind contemplated in the recommendation.</P>
      <P>That Second White Paper was laid before the Oireachtas in April, 1963, over two years ago, and it is time for the Minister to tell us just what researches and investigations have been made by the Revenue Commissioners into the practicability or otherwise of this amendment.  A few weeks ago the Voluntary Health Insurance Board issued a circular to all its subscribers, of whom I am one, pointing out that the charge for a bed in a public ward in a Dublin hospital has recently been increased to 17 guineas per week.  Up to a few years ago you could get a private room in a hospital for less than 17 guineas per week.  I mention that to emphasise to the Minister the appallingly high cost of illness today.  You cannot go into the chemist with a prescription and have a bill of less than 12/6 or 15/- in these days.</P>
      <P>The proposition is a simple one and a Christian one which has previously commended itself to all sides of the House.  Indeed, when I proposed an amendment similar to this but in somewhat more restricted terms some years ago, it was criticised by a number of speakers from the Government side as being inadequate to the situation and as not being sufficiently broad.  One of those speakers is now a Parliamentary Secretary.  I would urge the Minister between now and Report Stage to have another look at this matter and to tell us in what respects we can modify the proposal in order to make it more acceptable to him and to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i>: Originally the principle that some reliefs should be given for expenditure on medical bills received recognition when the Voluntary Health Scheme started. Some allowances, I understand, are made in that scheme as regards taxation. It would be highly desirable, now that expensive drugs have become much more expensive, that that principle should be continued.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. Byrne mentioned the cost of beds in voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  The actual cost of a bed to a hospital in Dublin is between £20 and £30 per week and local authorities are now paying £17 10s. per bed per week to the Dublin hospitals.  Were it not for subvention from the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes during the past three years, the cost of beds would be much higher.</P>
      <P>Everybody realises the cost of drugs at the present time, particularly antibiotics, the cortisone preparations, drugs that have to be given over a prolonged period for diabetes.  Some concessions should be given in regard to these preparations.  A Deputy from this side of the House a week ago left Leinster House, went down to see a medical consultant and got a bottle of medicine the size of my thumb.  It cost him £5.  I mention all this to bring home to the Minister and to Deputies in general the extraordinary costs of these modern drugs.  Every day the cost seems to be increasing.</P>
      <P>The section is loosely worded and I should be obliged therefore if the Minister would tell us whether he would be prepared to give some concession in regard to institutional bills and domiciliary bills.  If he is not prepared to allow for such bills <i>in toto,</i> he might be prepared to give some concession.  There should not be any abuse in this respect as regards institutional bills.  I would ask him to consider giving a concession in respect of one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's expressed objection to the amendment is that if he gave this concession, he would not be giving corresponding reliefs to people who do not pay tax.  I would remind <Col N="259" /> him that the people who do not pay tax get their medicines free nowadays. Thirty per cent of the population, through the dispensary system, get free drugs.  Therefore, no injustice would be done to them if a concession were given to the other 70 per cent who have to pay for their drugs.  Of that 70 per cent, 55 per cent have to pay for drugs for domiciliary purposes.  I ask the Minister to consider giving such concessions.  He seems to have taken up a rather resistant attitude, but if he indicates that he will reconsider the matters I have mentioned, there would be no difficulty in redrafting the wording.</P>

      <P>On the question of the wording of the amendment, I have pointed out that it could be of very wide application.  Even if it were more tightly worded, I should still adopt the attitude I am now adopting. When a similar discussion took place last year or the year before, a similar attempt was made by Deputies opposite, and even then it was resisted. On the point made by Deputy M. J. O'Higgins, it is not so much a matter of helping the very high income group and giving no corresponding help to the low income group.  A person in the higher income group would be considerably assisted under a proposal such as that suggested in the amendment, whereas a person who does not pay income tax would not get any assistance whatever.  If such a person did not qualify for other benefits, he would have to pay every penny of the cost.  In the middle income group, people do not qualify for free or semi-free treatment.  Take a man with £1,450 a week with six children.</P>

      <P>Indirect tax from this man who does not pay income tax is used to pay part of the medical expenses of the other man&mdash;up to 69 per cent in some cases.  It is not a difference between the small man and the big man.  It can arise equally between men of rather moderate incomes.</P>
      <P>I gave an instance of a man with £1,450 who has children, who does not pay income tax.  The man with the same salary without children pays income tax and under this proposal he would get relief to the extent of £25 out of each £100 he would be obliged to pay in medical expenses. Deputy Ryan suggested a person has no discretion in illness.  He has some discretion in so far as he can choose the location of his treatment&mdash;a public or a private hospital&mdash;and he could equally well vouch the fees he would have to pay in the very expensive hospital and the taxpayer would have to relieve him under this proposal.  I do not wish to make play of the wide use of the word &ldquo;discretion&rdquo; but there is that degree of discretion in the case of illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reference to a suggestion by Deputy P. Byrne, the recommendations of the Commision on Direct Taxation were to the effect that something should be done for people who met with exceptional difficulties in this respect.  The Government's comment was that they would examine the possibility of framing a scheme which would be administratively practicable and would confine relief to the cases contemplated in the Commission's recommendations.  There has been a lot of examination of these recommendations and the possibility of their implementation.  I must admit I have not read&mdash;I have not had time&mdash;all the documentation on this matter.  Neither have I had time to study them in connection with the amendments which <Col N="261" /> appeared a couple of days ago.  I am advised that it is in very technical detail and that a considerable degree of work or, as Deputy P. Byrne said, research, was put into the possibility of implementing it.  There are many reasons.  There is the difficulty of defining &ldquo;serious illness&rdquo;; there is the important matter of the cost to the Exchequer; and there is the necessity to maintain the viability of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  I think Deputy Sweetman himself adverted to that in some detail whether from these or the other benches, I do not know, when this matter was discussed before.  It is important that we maintain the viability of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and that we do not do anything that would discourage people from becoming members of it.  I should like to say, in reference to what Deputy T.F. O'Higgins said earlier that Deputy Sweetman, when Minister, gave some relief and that that was the only relief given to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, that the former Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, gave some relief by relieving the profits of the scheme.</P>

      <P>To my mind, at all events, the Minister at the outset of his remarks gave some very peculiar reasons or arguments against this proposal. I understood him to say that if there were desire on this side of the House to limit or further to narrow the proposals here, it would not make any effect on his mind.  He then went on to say that a proposal of this kind, <Col N="262" /> even a narrower proposal or proposals, had been considered by his predecessor for a number of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give it as a reason.  I mentioned it as a historical fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is merely a historical fact, that is that, but, as an argument, I fail to understand it.  The amendment appears to me to fall in line with certain proposals I have made in this House, with no degree of success, over a number of years but which I had reason to believe and some time ago had reason to believe did recommend themselves to certain highly important persons in the country. I made the case here for people like myself, merely as a type.  I contrasted the position of people like me, self-employed professional people who have no asset except their body, brains, energy and health&mdash;they live on them and make their money on them&mdash;with the position of business and industry.  I said it was proper, and indeed that justice demanded, that something be done and some arrangement be made for that particular purpose.</P>
      <P>We find here, year after year, appeals being made for business and industry for depreciation of their machinery.  To my personal knowledge, over the years, that was fought by the Revenue Commissioners and by the then Minister for Finance but ultimately concessions were given for depreciation of machinery.  The people for whom I am speaking cannot renew our machinery but we had to get something for depreciation of our machinery which is our brains and our health.  I have asked over the years that consideration be given to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of people outside find themselves in that position.  They are not rich people; they are not even well-to-do people.  They are people who have to make provision for themselves out of their own resources, energy and savings.  It is rather difficult. Most of them have to make arrangements to look after their health by joining some organisation such as the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme which has been available to <Col N="263" /> them only in the past few years and would never have been available to them if the Minister's Party had had their way.  They had to make provision for that.  They had to make provision for very appalling expenses that might come upon their families and, above all, they had to make provision in the event of their death.</P>
    <P>Speaking by and large, they could do that normally only by effecting policies of insurance.  Policies of insurance have been effected on the life of a person in various conditions and whatever the conditions, they have to pay a very heavy premium every year. At the end of that period&mdash;when the person dies or when the policies become payable on maturity&mdash;they find, as we have found here, that the amount of money they get has been divided almost by three.  You get a small amount of income tax allowance. At the end you find that by reason of depreciation in the currency, the money you paid in premium all your life is worth only about one-third of its face value.  On top of that again, and this is a matter I intend to resume on another section of the Finance Bill, you find that that depreciated residue of the policy on your life is being further depleted by the large and increasing demands of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The people for whom I appeal are entitled to some relief.  This is an occasion that gives me, at all events, the opportunity of making another appeal on their behalf.  As long as I have been here, I do not think I have ever let a year go by without making this particular case on behalf of self-employed people as contrasted with business and industry which have got increasing allowances for depreciation of their machinery and plant.  A self-employed person cannot, in the ordinary way, get what an industrialist or a businessman can get.  But he can get it by giving him some allowance for the fact that, as year follows year, even though he is in health, his machine is depreciating.  It is one way in which that class for whom I strongly appeal could be met with some degree of justice.  It is a matter <Col N="264" /> that this amendment gives me the opportunity of raising again.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the appeal I have made is reasonable and ought to be met by the people in charge. I had hoped to do it before I left office but unfortunately we left too soon and we had got only a bit of the way.  I have not been able to make any of the subsequent Ministers for Finance do it.  Here is an opportunity to consider it.  I am not sufficiently presumptuous to imagine that any Minister for Finance will be persuaded by the arguments, however praiseworthy, I may make on such an occasion but the Minister has, for instance, the backing of the Income Taxation Commission, as Deputy P. Byrne mentioned, and surely that is something that ought to carry weight?</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that he has just come into office and has not had time to read up the matter.  From the point of view of the Minister, that is reasonable but, then, this has been out for some time. Have the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners been giving any consideration to this matter in the meantime?  Even if this amendment appeared only in the past few days, why are the Department of Finance and Revenue Commissioners saying, in effect: &ldquo;We do not agree with this&rdquo;?  It would take only a few minutes.  The Minister is a barrister and I know how much he can absorb by ear without getting a file on the matter at all.  Has anything like that taken place or have the Revenue Commissioners or the Department any view on this recommendation which has been in the Department for some time?  Making all due allowance for the fact that the Minister is new to his Department, I know, by reason of his profession, his capacity for absorbing information.  I know what it is like to stand outside the door of a court, to be given information and then to go into court after such a conversation.  I think the Minister would be quite capable of appreciating the points which were made either for or against it by the Revenue Commissioners.  I think, therefore, it is due to the House that when this case is made on this amendment <Col N="265" /> and when it is a reasonable one, at least he should have some reasons to bring up in reply to the recommendation by Deputy P. Byrne.  I have little hope that my recommendation will be accepted.  I have made a number of speeches in this House about it and perhaps eventually somebody will do it.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that the amendment asks too much.  It is just and right that all the expenses attendant on an illness in a family should be allowed as an expense on income tax.  I see no reason for saying we will allow 50 per cent or 75 per cent.  Commonsense dictates that if it is just to allow it, you allow all of it. I am not impressed by anything the Minister may say about its benefiting a man who has been involved in considerable expense and who may have an income that enables him to meet it. It is only right that it should be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the necessity of having regard to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and the need to maintain its viability.  The Minister cannot sell the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme to us.  We started it and it would not be there but for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am saying that the Minister may assume that the Party who table this amendment year after year are well aware of the position of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and have fully considered this matter and the likely effect.  We are satisfied and those who have examined this matter&mdash;if anybody&mdash;at the behest of the Government must be satisfied that this will in no way affect the operation and success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  It appals me somewhat that with the great resources available to him &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and all the income tax authorities, all sources that are quick enough, God knows, to act if there is any little loophole in the income tax <Col N="266" /> code&mdash;those who advised the Minister when the Budget came to be prepared had not even alerted him in regard to this particular proposal, which is no new gimmick but something that has been advocated here year in year out by the main Opposition Party, which was considered by the Income Tax Commission and in respect of which there is a report or recommendation by that Commission.  What does the Minister say here today?  He says that he became alive to the research on this subject only when this amendment was tabled.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has a great deal to do and to think about, and I suppose at times a great deal to worry about, but that is why he is supposed to have a Department to assist him and a bureaucracy available to him.  Why did somebody not advise the Minister in a matter of this kind? They were quick enough with Resolution 18 (c) which was slipped into this House but no attempt has been made to brief the Minister on this particular proposal.  We should not even have heard anything about the matter, were it not for this amendment, apparently.  That is not good enough for the Dáil or for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to have a situation in which we speak here in the nation's Parliament advocating something and when the debate is over, it is forgotten? The file has been opened and is closed and dusted and put on the shelf in final form and that is the end of it. Surely if there is any basis for yearly stocktaking in relation to finances and the taxing system, one good argument in its favour must be that there should be an examination from time to time as to the equity of the system and the nature and extent of the allowances available?  It is hard to understand where there is a case, as we have now, in which a particular proposal has been advocated for years and considered, not by any political body or anything of that kind but by an independent body set up by the Government and where that body has recommended its adoption and the Government some three years ago said: &ldquo;Yes, we shall do something&rdquo;, that, nevertheless, a new Minister for Finance <Col N="267" /> comes in, brings in his Budget, prepares his Finance Bill and is not even briefed in regard to this proposal. He says he became alive to it only when this amendment appeared. If that is to continue, there is very little use in our advocating these proposals here.</P>
    <P>We regard this as elementary justice, something that any society seeking to provide more equitable conditions for its people would have seen in operation a long time ago.  But, apparently, the Minister is adopting an attitude of intransigence in this regard.</P>
    <P>He said one thing which I cannot allow to go without comment.  He said that Deputy Sweetman was not the only person who did something in relation to the cost of illness.  He mentioned his predecessor, Dr. Ryan. Just for the record, I want to remind the House that when I was Minister for Health and Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance in the last inter-Party Government, I had included in the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill a specific section excluding the earnings of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board from liability to income tax and other associated taxation.  It was not a provision that should have appeared in a Health Bill and that fact was brought to my notice and the section was then removed from the draft of the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill, on the undertaking that it would be incorporated in the following Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the situation.  By the time the Finance Bill came to be introduced, Deputy Sweetman was not there to do it and the Bill was brought in by Dr. Ryan.  Both Deputy Sweetman and I raised this matter on that Finance Bill in 1957 and we raised it again in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961 and in 1962.  Eventually, in 1963, the section was put into the Finance Bill of that year.  And now the Minister comes into the House and says that Deputy Sweetman was not the only man who did anything about voluntary health insurance taxation, <Col N="268" /> that Dr. Ryan provided this relief for the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  I do not thank him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put it in that way at all.  I just mentioned for the record that Dr. Ryan had made this provision.  I did not go into the history of it but in fact I would have thought that Deputy O'Higgins, being the person who conceived the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, would have thought of such a relief for it by way of taxation.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy J.A. Costello, I naturally would have respect for his argument in this matter but I think he is referring to something slightly different in seeking certain reliefs.</P>
      <P>Certain relief is allowed for the professional man, no matter what way he is employed; his depreciation allowance, of course, is nil so far as his own machinery in earning power is concerned and I think I can say that Dr. Ryan did something in giving certain relief to self-employed people who provide some form of superannuation scheme for themselves, relief on the premiums.  I think more should be done, all right, because I can appreciate, having been self-employed, like Deputy Costello, as he said, that there is grave risk for a man who has no other place to turn to, a man like that who might lose his capacity, mental, physical, or otherwise, through no fault of his own.  Nevertheless, this is not what we are dealing with here. But there is always one cogent argument for a Minister for Finance, no matter how reasonable the case made from the other side, no matter how compelling it is, no matter how much in sympathy with the case he may be, that is: where is the money going to come from?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in reply to Deputy O'Higgins, I do not think he was quite fair when he interpreted my remark as meaning that I became alive to the problem when the amendments were put down.  He was not being quite fair to the officials; nor was Deputy Costello being quite fair <Col N="269" /> to them either in suggesting that they did not brief me.  They did, of course, brief me.  They gave me a reasonable synopsis of the case made for it and a reasonable synopsis of the difficulty they would have found in applying this particular relief</P>
      <P>The main difficulty is, of course, as I have said, the cost, but there are many other things involved.  I think I mentioned earlier the assessment of what a serious disease is and then there is assessment of what allowable expenses are.  There are many headings under which one would have to examine what allowable expenses are, for example, the cost of an attendant for a blind man, the cost of nursing for the aged, board and lodging in hospital or convalescent home.  There are many things that would have to be taken into account and it is not easy to define in such a way as to ensure that the expense involved would be calculable in any particular year.</P>
      <P>I am not making an excuse, and I do not intend to do so at any Stage of this Bill, that because I have been so short a time at the job, I do not know anything about it.  If I were here for another five years, I would not know all there is in a Finance Bill.  But I want to repeat that there has been a great deal of investigation into the suggestions by the Commission on Income Taxation and because of the great deal of investigation, there has arisen the tremendous amount of documentation to which I have referred and which I did not have time to read since the Finance Bill came before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to write this proposition off for all time, but I will say quite candidly that on the other hand, I would not like to create the impression that I could do something between now and Report Stage.  The farthest I could go&mdash;and the Deputies will appreciate that I have some sympathy with it&mdash;is that between now and next year, perhaps, I could have another look at it.  A Finance Bill is unlike many other measures that come before the House.  It must come every year.  We have Hire Purchase Bills and other kinds of Bills and the <Col N="270" /> Minister can say that he will look at some proposition &ldquo;the next time&rdquo; and the next time may not arise for five years.  The next time in a Finance Bill always arises the next year.</P>
    <P>The farthest I can go at this stage is to say that between now and next year, I will have a good look at this thing to see to what extent it is feasible, not only from the point of view of definition of serious illness, definition of the types of expenses which could be allowable, but from the point of view of that very important matter from the point of view of the Minister for Finance: what the cost is likely to be.</P>

      <P>I was about to express my appreciation of the fact that the Minister, at least in my regard, in relation to the points I have put forward, expressed sympathy.  I think it was not merely verbal sympathy. I am further compelled to express appreciation of his expression of his intention of giving at least sympathetic consideration to the present proposal.</P>
      <P>I want to make one other remark on this Bill.  The Minister gave the usual stock reply: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  Every Minister for Finance does that but finally and eventually money is found for everything that is wanted.  I want to point to one place where money could be found, or could have been found, for something like either my proposal or the proposal in this amendment or a modification of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you look at Part VIII of the Third Schedule, you will find&mdash;and I am reading from the explanatory memorandum&mdash;that the effect of that is to save as respects certain instruments <Col N="271" /> the £25 per cent rate of stamp duty on acquisitions of land by non-nationals. That was put into the Finance Bill.  This is the first occasion, reading the Finance Bill, that we find this proposal anywhere set forth.  My recollection is&mdash;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that there was no mention either in his Financial Statement or in any discussion of Resolutions of the proposal to abolish this £25 per cent duty on non-nationals. It comes here in the Finance Bill for the first time.  I suggest it is bad practice for the Minister for Finance not to have mentioned this proposal, not to have drawn the attention of the House in his Financial Statement to the fact that he was going to abolish the £25 per cent rate of duty on non-nationals.</P>
    <P>That was a proposal that gave rise to considerable controversy in the House and outside.  There may have been people who wanted to abolish or reduce the stamp duty but the general view was, so far as it did give effect to very vocal opinions on this matter, that it was desirable in the public interest that these non-nationals should be further restricted.  I understood that the whole idea of the £25 per cent was to restrict non-nationals. There may have been debate as to the advisability of doing that or not.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that something is going to be given away in the Schedule to the Finance Bill which was not told to the House or the people by the Minister in his Financial Statement.  That was a departure, in my submission to the House, from practice.  The people ought to have been told through the Financial Statement that this was to be given up and that, therefore, some additional tax or some alternative tax would have to be secured in order to balance or to provide for the loss incurred by abolishing this £25 per cent duty.</P>
    <P>As this is a matter I intended to raise later on in the House and will raise in its appropriate place, will the Minister tell me, or tell the House, if not now, at some stage, what will <Col N="272" /> be the effect of abolishing this £25 per cent tax upon non-nationals in reference to purchases of and dealings in land?  What amount of money is involved?  The House is entitled to that information.  The House should have been given that information when the Minister's proposals for taxation were being considered.  I do not see why the Minister should put in the provisions about taking additional revenue from estate duty on widows' pensions and at the same time abolish this tax on non-nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I reply briefly to the Deputy?  The purpose of the £25 per cent rate of stamp duty on land purchased by aliens was to be a deterrent and it was found to some extent that it was not a sufficient deterrent. Certainly, there were speeches from the opposite side indicating that land was being acquired at a considerable rate by non-nationals.  Therefore, the £25 per cent duty was not a deterrent.  Subsequently, the Minister for Lands, in the 1965 Land Bill, now an Act, took adequate powers and, therefore, the power taken as a deterrent in the Finance Act was no longer necessary.  I cannot say offhand what the cost is or what is the income that would have been obtained by this £25 per cent stamp duty but I do not think it would be considerable, certainly nothing in the context of the kind of relief that this amendment would seek to obtain.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Would the Minister consider some concession at least in respect of chemists' bills?  I put that to him because, when these reliefs were first advanced some years ago in relation to medical expenses, we did not have a turnover tax.  That has since been applied to medical requisites.  Curiously enough, if a drug is required for a human being, tax has to be paid on it, but, if it is required for an animal, no turnover tax is applied to it.  People involved in medical expenses today have to pay a considerable tax on the drugs and medicaments prescribed for them, a tax which was not there four or five years back.  The reason for some relief now is all the stronger because (a) pharmaceutical drugs have become so expensive and (b) the people on whose behalf we are seeking a concession have already paid tax.  On these two grounds I appeal to the Minister, if he is not prepared to deal <i>in toto</i> with medical expenses, to consider in particular chemists' bills.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where an individual has been involved in expense in respect of illness the amount of such expense shall be deducted from or set-off against any income for the year of assessment of such person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> I may be wrong, but I do not know whether or not it is the intention of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins to allow every single penny paid in respect of ill-health.  I assume that means that every time a doctor is called in and a fee of 15/- or a guinea is paid, that may be deducted for the purposes of income tax.  Every Aspro purchased, every drug, every prescription will be a deductible expense.</P>
    <P>We must, I think, ask ourselves a few questions if we are to vote on the amendment as it stands.  I am concerned about the cost as well.  I did not hear the Minister, but he is probably not in a position to say how much this will cost.  This will affect a substantial number of people, well over 60 per cent.  I am certainly in favour of coming to the assistance of people who can be regarded as having heavy medical expenses.  I do not know whether or not that has been specified.</P>

He has in his office seven reports from the Income Tax Commission, a Commission established by Deputy Sweetman, when he was Minister for <Col N="275" /> Finance, which reported several years afterwards to the Minister's predecessor, Dr. Ryan.  He also has two White Papers that were circulated.  I would urge the Minister to have another look at all the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission.  I have no hesitation in saying that Dr. Ryan's approach to these recommendations was ultra-conservative.  There were many good recommendations which should have been implemented.  They should be implemented now.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at them.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of this amendment as it stands.  It would be open to all sorts of abuse and all sorts of evasion of income tax generally.  Who is to decide when a person is ill and when he is not? Think of all the difficulty in relation to small bills from chemists or doctors' fees.  The way to provide for serious illness is through insurance. That is the only method.  Insurance should cover everybody on a fair basis, irrespective of whether his income tax assessment is big or negligible. Insurance is the only way in which liability can be covered.  I could not support this amendment as it stands.  Insurance is the proper way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is our view, too, but the point is that insurance has been in operation for only a certain number of years and the financial resources of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are not sufficient to meet the position.  Quite a number of people are obliged to meet their own heavy expenses.  Only hospital expenses are met by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Those who suffer from chronic illness and who require drugs or medicines are obliged to meet the cost of these themselves. The amendment could be restricted to some reasonable allowance as a set-off against income tax.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of that.  He would probably do it on rum. The insured person under social welfare gets only 50 per cent of his contribution taken into consideration for income tax purposes.  There seems to be a weakness somewhere in the Bill. There is also a weakness in the amendment. Perhaps, as Deputy Corish said, the Minister would agree to have a look at the section to see if something could be done to meet the wishes of the House.  That might possibly provide an answer.  As it stands at present, the suggestion appears to be a free-for-all.  I would not be in favour of that but something should be done to cater for those who are not covered by voluntary health insurance.  There are a number of people who, through no fault of their own, are afflicted with chronic illness who will not be accepted by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Again, because of the tremendous increase in hospital charges over the past 12 months, the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme does not go near covering the entire amount, particularly if a long illness is involved.  Taking those points into consideration, there is a good deal of merit in the amendment.  Perhaps, for that reason, the Minister might have another look at it?</P>

      <P>I also said, while I could not give an undertaking that between today and Report Stage I could do something, I would have a look at the whole scene to see what might happen between now and next year.  The reason for that is that we will have a Finance Bill every year anyway. Whether I will be there or not, somebody else will be there to have a look at it.  That would give a reasonable opportunity to see what the snags are, and they are many.  As Deputy Sweetman pointed out to Deputy Tully in regard to headaches and sore toes, the recommendations of the Commission were that the expenses should be not less than £50 per annum per person, up to a maximum of £300.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Before section 10, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  An individual who is a widow and who has the charge and care of any child of hers and who, in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Acts makes a claim in that behalf and makes a return in the prescribed form of her total income, shall for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of her assessable income for the purpose of income tax be allowed a deduction from the amount of her total income whether earned or unearned of a sum equal to one-fourth of the amount of that income subject to a maximum deduction of £500.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple proposition indeed. It is designed to give some measure of relief to widows having the care of children.  It is an established principle of our tax code that earned income up to a certain stage is taxed at a lesser rate than unearned income.  Currently, the standard rate of tax is 6/4 in the £; and the earned income rate for salary and wage earners, business people and pensioners is 4/9 in the £ on total income up to £2,000.</P>
    <P>Last year, in sections 2 and 3 of the Finance Act, the Minister very properly decided that the time had come to extend the reduced rate to old persons, to an extent, and to persons in receipt of small incomes up to £450, also to an extent.  I would suggest to the Minister that, in these days of rapid inflation, he, the Revenue Commissioners and all of us have a very strong obligation indeed to widows and fatherless children.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter because in the past two years no fewer than three close acquaintances of mine were cut off in their prime, leaving large families of young children. There was a time when the person of whom Deputy J.A. Costello spoke, the self-employed person or salary earner who provided insurance for his wife and children in the sum of £5,000, was doing pretty well by them. Nowadays, with the astronomical cost of living, that is not the case.  It is only <Col N="280" /> too true that widows and fatherless children are left in very dire straits.</P>
    <P>We are going to fight that particular case with the Minister in regard to death duties later on.  At this stage I want to say to him that the person who leaves £10,000 insurance to his widow to provide her and a family of young children with an investment income is, in equity, due the same right of a reduced rate of tax as she would have if she were in receipt of a similar income from a superannuation scheme or pension scheme of which her husband had been a member. Pensions are taxed similarly to wages and salaries.  They are treated as earned income. They are given this right.  The widow with three children with an income of £1,000 a year, trying to provide them with secondary education and hoping to put them through university, is surely most deserving of our very active sympathy. At present she is taxed at the rate of 6/4 in the £ on all her taxable income. She pays the sum of £83 a year in income tax.  She would not have to pay that tax if, instead of being in receipt of an investment income, she was the beneficiary of a pension scheme.  It is as simple as that.  I would plead with the Minister to accept this amendment in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would create a very specially favourable situation for a widow and a widow is not necessarily in an unfavourable situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> other taxpayers. At the moment a widow does get certain favourable treatment over and above what single people get and the amendment would put her in a very favourable position altogether.  A widow has a personal allowance of £259 which is £25 more than a single person gets.</P>

She is also entitled to an allowance of £100 for a housekeeper and, if she reaches the age of 65, she will be given the age allowance which amounts to one-fourth of earned income up to a maximum of £150.  The <Col N="281" /> Deputy's amendment would give her the equivalent of earned income relief on unearned income up to £2,000 which is putting a widow in a specially favourable position, in a much more favourable position than she is in at present.  She enjoys a certain favourable position at the present time and for that reason I must resist this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the housekeeper allowance. Take the case of a widow with an income of £1,000 a year.  How could such a widow bring up a family and still be able to pay a housekeeper?  As everybody knows, domestic staff in this country now cost from £4 to £5 a week so that the person of whom I speak could not employ domestic help. In this country, where we cherish the large family, it behoves us to take out of our legislation all the British laws that we have kept in it.  The average family in Britain is 1.3 children and if a father there dies at the age of 45 years or thereabouts, he leaves 1.3 children.  In this country a father of that age would leave five or six small children.</P>
      <P>He would have hoped to give these children a secondary education and to send them on to the university.  The widow whom he leaves would hope to do likewise but how can she do it on an income of £1,000 a year?  This is a Christian proposal, a proposal for the relief of widows having the care of children.  For goodness sake, let us get away from these British horrors that we have kept in our law so long.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before section 10, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922 shall be amended by the addition of the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>`(10) No direction shall be given under this section in respect of any accounting period after 1 year has expired from the date of the submission of the accounts of the company to the Inspector of Taxes'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that section 21 of the Finance Act of 1922 was drafted to provide that where, in a private company, sufficient of the profits were not being distributed, the Revenue Commissioners could make a direction that the profits would be subject to tax, and particularly to surtax, in the same way as if they had actually been distributed.  That section is being used at the present time, I regret to say, in a manner in which, if it were used in private life, there would be a very unpleasant word to connote what was happening.  I am not sure that it is being used with the knowledge or consent of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Letters are never written but in telephone conversations which take place in certain circumstances, the investigation branch of the Revenue Commissioners are telling people that it is proposed to go back for a period of from 12 to 20 years for the purpose of giving a surtax direction under Section 21 of the Finance Act of 1922. That conduct is absolutely outrageous and the person making that suggestion knows it is outrageous.  It is made only for the purpose of setting up a background and the next sentence in the conversation generally is: &ldquo;What would you think of setting for such and such a figure?&rdquo;  If that sentence were used outside, in ordinary language it would be described as blackmail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make sure that this going back over the years, so that people never know when there is to be any form of finality, will end now once and <Col N="283" /> for all.  I accept that there must be a reasonable time in which the Revenue Commissioners must consider whether they will make a direction or not, but it is outrageous that in a family business which is being carried on <i>bona fide</i> in the belief that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the accounts, they should suddenly have someone suggest that because of something that happened years back, it is now proposed to go back for a period of from 12 to 20 years.</P>

      <P>Last night when the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with the problem which faced recipients of children's allowances, old age pensions and other pensions in Dublin suburbs and who are obliged because of the present system to attend in person at the local post office to receive their payments.  I referred to a reply by the Minister for Social Welfare in which he refused to alter the system of payment because he said he was not satisfied that any hardship was imposed on the recipients by the operation of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I received a reply from the Minister for Post and Telegraphs giving details of the number of money orders paid weekly and monthly in some suburban post offices in Dublin, and particularly in my constituency. The figures given by the Minister disclosed this appalling situation, that in the suburb of Ballyfermot, 4,600 money orders in respect of children's allowances are made payable on the one day and in the week in which they become payable in the same district, there are as many as 430 other orders in respect of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions. There you have the situation that in <Col N="284" /> a place like Ballyfermot, in which there are only two post offices, some 5,000 money orders will be cashed by people dependent on public assistance in order to make ends meet.  It is true to say that many families in Ballyfermot depend to a great extent on children's allowances in the same way as many other people would depend on other forms of social assistance in order to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the number of evictions from Dublin Corporation houses would be legion, if it were not for the children's allowances and were it not for the fact that people are able to set aside money intended for the benefit of children towards the payment of rents in local authority houses in Ballyfermot and elsewhere.  The extent of the problem is shown by the reply of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that over 5,000 money orders have to be paid out at local post offices.  Of course there is no obligation on the recipients to attend for the cashing of their orders on the day on which they are payable, but as the majority of these people are urgently in need of this money, they must avail of it as soon as it becomes available and as a result they attend in person to get the money as soon as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it takes to cash these orders but assuming that some time must pass between the inspection of the book, the imposition of the stamp, the affixing of a signature and the paying out of the money, I suppose it is reasonable to assess an average time of 30 seconds.  Perhaps that is being conservative and possibly it would be a good deal more, but even allowing for 30 seconds, it is going to take over ten hours to pay out these orders, so that when we see the size of the problem, as given by the official figures, we get some realisation of the problem.  The system obliges many mothers to attend at local post offices for two or three hours on children's allowances day in order to obtain payment of this money which they urgently need.  I cannot see that the continuance of that system is justified any longer and I believe the State should be able to pay these <Col N="285" /> allowances in some more simplified way.</P>
    <P>Other suburbs are no better situated than Ballyfermot.  We find that in the Crumlin area, there are 2,380 children's allowances to deal with; in Crumlin Road, there are 1,610; and in Drimnagh, 1,888; in Rathmines, there are 1,799; in Terenure, 1,504; and in Walkinstown 2,470.  These are only orders for children's allowances and in some of those areas, particularly a place like Rathmines, you have a higher density of old age pensions and in Rathmines you have, in addition, 302 old age non-contributory pensions, 278 contributory, and 271 widows' and orphans' pensions.  The problem may not exist in a small rural village in which the number of people in any townland in receipt of these pensions might not exceed 100 but it is a problem which is multiplied out of all justification in many of the post offices in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would beseech the Minister to see that the unnecessary system of requiring personal attendance at the post office is done away with.  I cannot see that it can provide any security at all for the State.  It cannot ensure that only the recipients entitled to it receive the money.  There is no official in a Dublin post office which pays out something like 3,000 allowances in a day who could possibly know the identity of the people attending.  It might be of some assistance in a small rural community where every person would be known to the subpostmistress, but it has no validity in any area in which the number of allowances paid out in any day exceeds the 1,000 mark.  It would certainly assist the old age pensioners and the parents of young families if the Department of Social Welfare would do the sensible thing and make whatever money orders they issue negotiable elsewhere, without requiring this unnecessary imposition on people's time and physical capacity.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare code is really only sufficient to help people maintain a day to day struggle for existence.  It does not provide, as it ought, a standard of living befitting human beings.  A <Col N="286" /> number of sociologists and dieticians have recently carried out extensive surveys to calculate the costs of a minimum diet for people in Ireland. Their figures, which they emphasise are related only to the diet which is barely sufficient to prevent malnutrition, show that to provide food for a child of between eight and 12 years of age, you need to expend between £1 10s. 0d. and £2 a week; to provide food for a child between 15 and 20, you need to expend something like £3 to £3 10s. 0d. a week; and to provide food for an adult, a sedentary adult, if such a creature is notionally possible, requires something like £2 10s 0d. a week, less for a female and more for a male.  However, the sedentary adult is a rare being.  There may be such among our septuagenarians but in most other cases more than that is needed to provide food for those people.  The figure would be between £2 10s. 0d. and £3 per week. Anything under that figure results in malnutrition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of under-nourished people in the country, according to those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are hundreds of thousands under-nourished if one accepts those figures and one is coerced into doing so because of the qualifications and the background of the people responsible for them.  That being so, we have no reason to feel complacent about the amount of our national resources we allow for social welfare.  Even among our working community, there are many people suffering from malnutrition.  The people who are working, however, have a relatively higher standard of living than some social assistance recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures I have received from the Minister indicate that there are 15,000 children in respect of whom the State pays 5/- a week by way of social assistance.  Those children are of parents who themselves are receiving incomes inadequate to prevent malnutrition in themselves.  Thus, we have parents under-nourished and children <Col N="287" /> under-nourished.  Whatever may be the cost of providing the minimum diet to preserve our people from malnutrition in all walks of life, we have a social obligation to do it.  We in Fine Gael do not shirk it and that is why we welcomed whatever improvements were given in the Budget and are being given in this Bill.  We regret that the Government did not take their courage in their hands and go the full way to provide the necessary relief for those less fortunate people.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city, more than 1,250,000 free meals are provided every year.  We talk about the affluent society in which we live and are led to believe we are enjoying a degree of prosperity never experienced before.  In the middle of that, in this wealthy city, we have to provide 1,250,000 free meals every year. Free meals are not provided on certain days and therefore many people have to go without them.  Many people who would enjoy them are suffering from malnutrition and are unable to walk the mile or two miles to get these free meals.  If they lived close by, the good nuns would take the hot meals to them under a table napkin.</P>
    <P>The result is that we have in this city thousands of people who are grossly under-nourished because the State will not provide the bare minimum to have them fed properly.  It is a fact that every winter old people die in this city for two reasons&mdash;malnutrition and cold.  There are cases on record where the temperature of rooms in which old people have been found dead has been below freezing point, notwithstanding the assistance the State provides in the form of a free bag of turf each week.  More than 14 per cent of the old people in this city live alone.  It is a strange thing and it may seem contradictory that old people living alone in a city are lonelier than old people living alone in the country, where different forms of social visits obtain.  Old people living alone in blocks of flats in cities are terrifyingly alone.  Such people depend exclusively on whatever assistance the State may give.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> That is why we in Fine Gael have been advocating a higher rate of assistance for old people living alone. Throughout the country, according to the 1960 census, 10.4 per cent of people over 70 years of age live alone. When you take the number of old age pensioners at 151,200, one can see the extent of the problem.  More than 15,000 old people live alone, depending on the miserly old age pensions we allow them.  Three thousand of them receive, in addition, some public assistance, but 3,000 out of a total of 151,000 is an extremely small proportion. These people are to be pitied when one considers what they are allowed out of the growing wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>We have no reason to be smug about the pittances we allow them. One bag of turf, allowed each week during the official winter, is a pitiful contribution towards the relief of the suffering of those unfortunate people. It does not last more than two or three days.  The result is that the unfortunate people, underfed as they are, because of the pitiful nature of this fuel allowance, are obliged to cloak themselves in whatever rags they have or to stay in bed for days on end, unable to feed themselves or to provide themselves with heat.  It is pitiful to see week after week old people in Dublin pushing along their bag of fuel in a pram.  They cannot afford to pay the few pence to get somebody to do it for them.  Sometimes it means a walk of between two and four miles, beyond the physical capacity of such old people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister and the Department should take another look at this free fuel scheme to see whether it would be better to provide a more generous allowance to old age pensioners so that they could buy their own fuel instead of depending on the present scheme which imposes such appalling hardship for such an utterly inadequate relief.  The walk these old people have to undergo to get their pitiful bag of turf home from the depot involves severe pain for them. The real benefit of this fuel scheme is therefore negligible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I shall return for a moment to the question of diet.  What can an old age pension buy for people in Dublin dependent on it as the sole means of keeping body and soul together?  The diet of such people consists of bread, margarine, tea and potatoes.  I have heard Deputies unfamiliar with the problems of such old people in Dublin laugh and snigger when we try to tell them their story.  I repeat that thousands of families in Dublin live on such a diet at the present time.</P>
    <P>This is not 1845.  It is 1965, and the affluent society we assume exists should not tolerate a situation in which even one family is obliged to live on such a diet.  There are many families that are regarded as problem families.  They seem unable to assist or to better themselves.  They seem lacking in the initiative, drive and enterprise necessary to obtain employment or to keep employment, if they obtain it.  One of the facts of war which we hear recited from time to time is that prisoners of war who have received an inadequate diet, even where they have not been subjected to cruelty, suffer lassitude, withdrawal and depression.  I am sure we can all think of old people and not so old people who are suffering from lassitude, withdrawal and depression.  We are inclined to assume that this condition is attributable to old age and to nothing else.  I wonder if we should not examine our consciences.  If we do, I think we shall find that much of this depression of old age, much of this withdrawal, much of this indifference of poor families, is due to the appalling conditions which we oblige them to accept.  In this situation, I feel that we must, if we are to be a Christian society, accept the responsibility of bearing the burden of providing a better social assistance scheme for these less fortunate people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at long last in the Social Welfare Bill, taken steps to increase the compulsory insurance limit from £800 to £1,200.  Is it not unfortunate that it has taken from 1958 until 1965 to alter this limit? I am not sure precisely how many wage rounds there have been in the <Col N="290" /> intervening period.  I am told that the total number is four.  I think I am not erring on the wrong side when I say that incomes have certainly increased by more than 20 per cent since 1958: I think the figure is very much higher. Would it not have been a simple thing to provide that, in any national round of wage increases, certain other increases would at the same time be taken into account?  If we are to have a system of national wage agreements, one would hope that, out of the appalling and sorry mess in which the country now finds itself because of the Government's lack of leadership and initiative in the matter of incomes, some good will come.  Would it not be possible to provide in an incomes policy, where income levels generally are increased by a national agreement, that the limit of compulsory insurance should increase step by step?  This is the way to avoid the disparity which has grown between 1958 and 1965 in the matter of compulsory insurance.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that some 6,000 people have continued to pay voluntary contributions towards the insurance scheme but the Minister has not given us the number of people who moved out of the compulsory insurance limit.  In order to assess the significance of the figure of 6,000 people who remained as voluntary subscribers, one would need to know the number of people estimated to have moved out of the compulsory insurance limit over the past seven years.  I should be very glad if the Minister would give us that figure when replying to this debate.  In order to avoid the undesirability of people who were insured moving out of the insurance limit, we should be able to graft on to any future national wages agreement a provision whereunder the compulsory insurance limit will move forward step by step.</P>
    <P>Again, we think it desirable that the contribution to be paid for unemployment insurance should more realistically be associated with the level of income which a person may have while working.  We believe that the benefit paid to a person who is unemployed should be related, not to the <Col N="291" /> lowest common denominator, such as we have at the present time, but to a percentage of the income which the person was receiving when working. Quite clearly, a person who was earning £20 a week will suffer a great deal more under the present system when unemployed than a person who was earning only £9 or £10 a week.  It seems that the wise thing to do would be to ask for a greater contribution from a person with a greater income and, when such a person is unemployed, to provide him or her with a better level of unemployment benefit than that which now operates.</P>
    <P>These are things which should be part of a national incomes policy and one should not divorce an incomes policy on the one hand from benefits to be paid to people while, on the other hand, they are not working.  One would like to see the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture in closer association so that the problems of people, whether they be working or otherwise, would be regarded as one unified national problem and that we would try, by a proper welfare code which would permeate every activity of the national life, to provide a scheme which would be in tune with the needs of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see that the Minister has in this Bill dealt with the problem of the congested areas.  We think he is taking a move in the right direction but we do not think it meets all the requirements of the depressed areas. There are people more familiar than I am with that particular problem and I shall not chase it any further. However, I would join with those who expressed regret that the Minister has introduced as a principle into our social welfare code a geographical means test.</P>
    <P>I think the justification for the provision of reliefs in respect of our western seaboard and other places is that people should not be discouraged from improving their holdings and from providing a better standard of <Col N="292" /> living for themselves by depriving them of financial benefits which are at present available to them, if, as a result of their labours, they improve the standard of their holdings and the standard of their families.  That is a desirable thing.  Certainly, on this side of the House, we accept and encourage that principle.</P>
    <P>There are very many cases in the so-called more sophisticated areas of this country, which are not regarded as depressed, of people dependent on various forms of social assistance who ought to be encouraged to do something for themselves by way of providing an income additional to whatever is paid out in allowances.  Take, for instance, people in receipt of disability allowances.  There are many people in receipt of such allowances who are not capable of performing a full day's work but are capable of working for a couple of hours a day either in their own homes or elsewhere. However, our code at present will penalise such disabled or partially disabled people, if, by their own lawful pursuits, they improve conditions in their homes by undertaking a couple of hours' work here and there.</P>
    <P>There are some cases in which people get an opportunity from some rehabilitation institute or other to do some class of work but the work must be done secretly, and if an inspector from the Department is thought to be in the district, the work will be locked in the cupboard and all signs of labour concealed from the probing eyes of the inspector, lest he should arrive and as a result regard the person as being no longer disabled and therefore not entitled to benefit.  As the Minister has accepted the principle of encouraging people to get up off their knees and help themselves, we think he should extend it further and not confine it simply to those officially classified people.</P>
    <P>We are sorry that the Minister is delaying so long in providing improvements in the workmen's compensation code.  We are led to believe the cause of the delay is that the Minister is introducing a comprehensive Bill to <Col N="293" /> deal with all kinds of injuries and diseases arising out of occupations, but again, we have on that account another example of the many injustice that can arise when our social welfare code does not keep in pace with income and money changes in the economy.</P>
    <P>The limit of £4 10s. as the maximum payable under the workmen's compensation code was fixed ten years ago&mdash;perhaps it is 11 now.  It bears no relation to what a working person earns today but if a man is injured in an industrial accident or an accident in the course of his occupation, the maximum he gets now under the workmen's compensation code is £4 10s.  This may be added to by some payments from public assistance. In some of these cases, argument may arise about the eligibility of a person for workmen's compensation and the people have to depend on whatever is paid out in home assistance in order to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>The ironic thing that has been happening for some years is that such people consult solicitors sometimes about their cases and in the usual process of the law, it takes several months before the cases come before the Circuit Court and are dealt with and ultimately, if the person is lucky, there may be an award to him of £4 10s. a week.  The worker is thrilled and thinks all the worry he had in undertaking the litigation is justified as he has at last got an award under the workmen's compensation code, but the next thing is that he gets a bill from the social welfare people, as a result of getting the award in court which he succeeded in getting because of his own determination and sacrifice, and the money he has received in the meantime must be repaid to the Department, the local authority or whoever assisted him in the interim.</P>
    <P>Again and again it happens at present that workmen who undertake the risk of litigation do so only for the benefit of the public purse.  Many of these people are only wasting their time, and if they did not bother consulting a lawyer, they would still get <Col N="294" /> the same assistance from the public authority.  It seems entirely unfair that the State should maintain the maximum under the workmen's compensation code at £4 10s. when the net result of it is that nobody except the State benefits in very many cases.</P>
    <P>We had to wait several years before any degree of justice was done to widows and dependants of persons who made undutiful wills and we had to wait because the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, spent such a terribly long time bringing in a scheme to do the wrong thing.  Even when he brought it in with the benediction and collective responsibility of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil, they had to amend it and we have had it in this House in some way or another for the best part of a year.  Here, with workmen's compensation, we are facing the same problem.  Misery is being suffered by hundreds of workers who have to depend on the £4 10s. because the Department, the Minister and his colleagues in the Government are trying to do too much in the wrong way and instead of bringing in three, four or five years ago a Bill to increase the £4 10s. to £8 or £9 a week, they have been trying to devise some way of showing what geniuses they are by changing the whole system.  Their minds are incapable of appreciating what the workers have to suffer with the limit of £4 10s.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long more it will take the Minister to introduce the Bill: he promised recently it would not be very much longer.  We are now facing the long recess and even if the Minister were to introduce the Bill this session&mdash;of that we have no guarantee&mdash;there is no prospect of its becoming law until some date which, I suppose, would be appointed by the Minister, in 1966.  In these circumstances, we believe the Minister should introduce a one-paragraph Bill providing that the maximum of £4 10s. payable to insured workers will be increased in the very near future.  If this is not done, we are continuing to punish unnecessarily many innocent people who are suffering at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> Recently, in reply to a question of mine, the Minister disclosed that as far back as 1949, in the days of the first inter-Party Government, representations were made to the British Government begging them to provide that where British pensioners were living in this country, increases which were payable in Britain to pensioners of similar status would be paid to the pensioners here.  On 2nd June, the Minister said here that he did not feel that further representations by him at this stage would serve any useful purpose. The British Government have done nothing since 1949 to 1965 in this respect but we feel that no harm could possibly come of it if further representations were made at this stage, and we beg the Minister to use every avenue available to persuade the British authorities to do the decent thing by their own pensioners living among us.</P>
    <P>We pay our pensioners living in Britain and elsewhere the same level of pension as they would receive at home and it seems entirely unfair that the British Government should leave their pensioners in such an unsatisfactory position for such a long time. There is a new administration in Britain and one has reason to hope they have a keener social conscience than their predecessors and we think that a useful purpose might be served by making strong representations to them on this matter at this juncture.</P>
    <P>As the Minister unwillingly conceded when I pressed the matter earlier this month, the cost of living here has changed, and not for the better, since 1949, and if the British are of opinion that it has stood still, we shall not blame the Minister if he tries to disabuse them of that silly notion.  Anything he can do in that regard would be very much appreciated by the British pensioners living here.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill contains a number of desirable improvements in the social welfare code, although some of them may seem a bit Gilbertian. We find, for instance, that the Minister, <Col N="296" /> under section 14, is increasing from £2 to £4 the rate of maternity grant.  One would like to know the cost of administering the maternity grant and how much is paid out under the maternity grant each year. Just what significance has a payment of £4 by way of contribution towards meeting the expenses of an event such as maternity?  It would not even pay for the beer to celebrate the child's arrival.  It absolutely bewilders me that the solemn institution of the State can continue to have such a social assistance scheme grafted on to our social code.  I wonder is it even worth retaining.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The £4 would not even pay for all the minerals if the parents and all the relations drank minerals.  I wonder is it worth while keeping it?  Would it not be better, if a girl is in insurable employment and she marries, to pay her something substantial by way of restitution of the payments that she would have made since the time she entered into insurance?  It would be worth while doing that but the cost of doing so would be too great.  I would certainly like to hear the Minister justify the payment of the £4 maternity grant for such an event as maternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section which provides that in the case of a multiple birth other than twins, double the rate of children's allowance will be paid in respect of each child of that birth is a very welcome section, because, quite clearly, persons who have more than one child at any birth have their expenses multiplied.  It is always possible in a family of more than one to have &ldquo;hand me downs&rdquo;, to clothe the younger children in the cast-offs of the elders.  It is also possible to wheel a number of children about in the one pram as long as they succeed one another year after year but it becomes a physical impossibility when three or more are born at the same time.  The expenses in regard to school books are multiplied when three or more children <Col N="297" /> have to be supplied with identical school books in any year.</P>
    <P>This provision is a step in the right direction but I wonder whether it is sufficient in the case of quadruplets. I doubt it very much.  One can only hope that we will learn by experience and that if need be, a larger amount will be paid in years to come.</P>
    <P>Any other matter in relation to social welfare can be dealt with on the Social Welfare Bill which we will examine more carefully on Committee Stage.  Before I resume my seat, I would express the hope that the Minister would deal in his reply on this Stage with the problem which appears to be about to arise between August this year and January next year where a person who is in receipt of a contributory old age pension will receive less than many people who are in receipt of the maximum of the non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton last night referred to the case of a person who is in receipt of a contributory pension who will receive 38/- between August of this year and January next year, while persons in receipt of the maximum non-contributory old age pension will receive 47/6d.  One would like to hear whether the Minister will put down an amendment on Committee Stage to cure that situation or, if it is a case that somebody has been misled with this information, I should like the Minister to enlighten us.  If the situation will be as we have reason to believe it will be, it is entirely undesirable.  It should never be permitted to happen, no matter what the convenience of the Exchequer may be, in any year.</P>
    <P>One would hope, therefore, that the Minister will put down an amendment on the next Stage of this Bill to cure that situation and to ensure that nobody in receipt of a contributory pension will receive less than a person in receipt of a non-contributory pension. This is an amendment which, if put down from our side of the House, might be ruled out on the ground that it was imposing a burden on the Exchequer and therefore something <Col N="298" /> that nobody but the Minister could table.  If it be so, it imposes a severe responsibility on the Minister to table the necessary amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put forward a few points in connection with this Bill.  First of all, I should like to compliment the Minister on the provisions with regard to a new method of assessing means for purposes of unemployment assistance in the case of smallholders in congested areas, in so far as actual production from the holding will not be assessed but a nominal income of £20 per £1 of valuation only will be assessed.</P>
      <P>I am sure many members of the House who have had experience of unemployment assistance committees will support the recommendations and representations I am making to the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are two employment period orders that operate each year.  Their purpose is to exclude certain persons resident in rural areas from receiving unemployment assistance.  The first employment period order operates from mid-March of each year to the beginning of November and it excludes from the receipt of unemployment assistance occupiers of land whose land valuation exceeds £4.  I am trying to make the point that provision is made for persons in the congested districts up to £4 valuation but persons above £4 valuation cannot come under the scheme, although they may be just as deserving of unemployment assistance as those now to be brought in.  While this employment period order operates they are ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>For part of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>For part of the year.  I have said that the first employment period order operates from mid-March of each year to the beginning of November and excludes from receipt of unemployment assistance occupiers of land whose valuation exceeds £4, resident in non-municipal towns and rural areas.  The second employment period order operates from mid-January to the beginning of <Col N="299" /> November of each year and excludes from unemployment assistance persons without dependants resident in non-municipal towns and in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The operation of those two employment period orders, in effect, militates to a great extent against the very welcome provisions the Minister has brought in dealing with the congested areas.  There are many families in the congested areas whose valuations vary between £4 and £6 who are entitled to the same concessions as persons under the £4 valuation will receive when the scheme comes into operation and I would recommend and suggest to the Minister that the two employment periods which operate in rural areas in respect of persons over £4 valuation and persons without dependants should be revoked.  If that is done, it will save many a Deputy many a headache.  Over the years we have found in the congested areas cases deserving of the most generous treatment by the Government and the most generous help from central funds but, yet, while these employment period orders remain, the whole scheme, which is so very welcome, will be nullified.</P>
      <P>I would say in all seriousness to the Minister that he should meet the points I have made because I have met borderline cases over the years. Let the Minister, in his generosity and in his dynamic approach to social welfare, divide these two employment periods.  If he does so, he will do a real service to the large number of smallholders still left in the congested districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make.  I am glad there is to be a modification of the means test.  I hope the Minister will send out a special communication to social welfare investigation officers telling them to adopt a more human approach towards applicants for social welfare benefits.  I do not condemn them all, but I have had experience of investigation officers who tried to improve on the third degree in their method of investigating the means of simple <Col N="300" /> country people.  When the young Gardaí leave the Depot after training, they are told by the Commissioner to be courteous to the people.  The Minister should give the same advice to a good many of the investigation officers operating at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that no provision has been made in this Bill in relation to the earnings of part-time fishermen.  During the recent election, Fianna Fáil candidates in my part of the country went around telling the unfortunate part-time fishermen that their earnings would no longer prevent them from drawing unemployment assistance. These part-time fishermen are very severely hit by the method of assessing their means in calculating unemployment assistance.  I am referring particularly now to salmon drift net fishermen off the Donegal coast who are employed for approximately five to six weeks in the year.  Very often these men earn very small sums.  They may not be fortunate in having a successful fishing harvest.  Their expenses are heavy, but, in calculating their means, their gross income is assessed for the purpose of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, during the season, they do not prove unemployment, despite the fact that it is night fishing they are engaged in and they would be available for work during the day.  Consider the position of a fisherman engaged in salmon fishing in the month of June and part of July.  His brother emigrates and earns possibly anything up to £600 or £700.  He comes back home and he can draw unemployment assistance for the remainder of the year.  His earnings in Scotland, England, or anywhere else, are not taken into account in assessing his means. If he were a part-time fisherman, however, engaged in fishing for six weeks in the year, and if he were fortunate enough to make £200 or £300 during that period, this sum would be assessed against him as means and he would be debarred from drawing unemployment assistance, or he would be entitled only to reduced unemployment <Col N="301" /> assistance for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know that since last year a certain amount is disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the part-time fisherman should be treated in exactly the same way as his brother who goes abroad and earns £600 or £700 for eight or ten months and then comes home and draws the full unemployment assistance.  His income from fishing should not be assessed as means.  I cannot for the life of me understand why fishermen must be singled out.  Take the carpenter, who is not in insurable employment, who earns £40 a week.  If he becomes unemployed, he can draw unemployment assistance and his earnings are not taken into account in assessing his means.  The unfortunate fisherman is singled out.  He is victimised for his hard work.  I would ask the Minister to introduce a section in this Bill excluding the earnings of fishermen from the assessment of means in relation to the payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has raised the income for insurance from £800 to £1,200.  I suggest, however, that in defining income, he should define it as net income, and not as gross income.  The Minister has stated on several occasions that, where a person receives remuneration which includes a specific sum in respect of expenses, that specific sum is not taken into account in assessing his net income for the purposes of the Act.</P>
      <P>I know many cases, but I shall single out one.  Take the case of the sub-postmaster who must provide out of his gross salary a sub-office, lighting, heating and staffs.  These are essentials.  Unfortunately, when he is paid his salary, he is paid a gross, inclusive salary.  The Minister, like his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, knows that that is not his true salary.  What he expends on the essential services and amenities he must provide are assessed for income under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I know of one particular case in which a subpostmaster was employed in insurable employment from 1953 to 1957.  His gross salary then exceeded £800 but, out of that gross salary, he had to provide accommodation, lighting, heating and assistance, which brought his net income down below the £800, the ceiling under the old Act.  In this particular case, the Minister refunded the contributions for the four years from 1953 to 1957 but declared him ineligible for the contributory widow's pension and the contributory pension scheme.  I understand he will now come in again under this Bill because the ceiling is raised to £1,200, but he will have to re-enter the scheme and pay a higher contribution. I am afraid he will get no credit for the years in which he was in insurable employment.  That is unfair.  The Minister should consider this matter and should amend the Bill now by defining income as net income and not gross income.  If he does that, he will certainly do a great deal of good. He will bring into the scheme a number of people most anxious to join it.</P>
    <P>I would also like to criticise, more on the Estimate than on the Bill, the Minister's Department.  The delays in the Department of Social Welfare are unbelievable&mdash;the delays in paying unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and the various other social services to which the people are entitled.  Even the delay in paying an old age pension when the person reaches the statutory age is unbelievable. In my opinion, the Department is top heavy.  I appeal to the Minister to decentralise his Department.  He could do it.  If he would make payable through the local exchanges disability benefits and dental, optical and maternity benefits, he would be doing a considerable amount of good. Unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are already paid in this way.</P>
    <P>At present, if one wishes to draw disability benefit, the application is made through the local employment exchange.  But it eventually comes to Dublin, where you have a staff officer and, possibly, ten young girls filling in <Col N="303" /> forms.  The staff officer authorises payment. All this could and should be done much more expeditiously in the employment exchange.  Those little girls employed in Dublin at £6 or £7 a week would be much better off receiving the same sum down in rural Ireland or urban Ireland, where they could live much more economically, and we would thereby be decentralising government much more than we are at present.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to look into this and pay disability allowances, dental, optical and maternity benefits through the local exchanges. They are initiated down there.  The medical certificate is procured there.  It is sent to the local officer, and from him it comes to Dublin.  All Dublin does is to check it over, issue the pay order filled in by one of these little girls and sent by a principal officer to the applicant down the country.  That is all time-consuming and a delaying action which causes considerable inconvenience to the unfortunate applicant.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I think the Minister's Department is top-heavy.  I am going to quote an example.  On 25th May last I asked the Minister the number of unemployed on the register at Dungloe, County Donegal, on 14th May 1937.  He gave me the number as 2,749.  I then asked him the staff employed in that exchange in 1937, and he told me the staff was two employment staff officers, 14 employment clerks, 11 temporary clerks and one cleaner&mdash;a total of 28 for 2,749 unemployed.  On 18th May I asked the Minister the number on the register at Gardiner Street, Dublin.  I was told the number was 3,227, only 478 over those registered in Dungloe, Donegal, in 1937.  But what is the staff employed at Gardiner Street? It is: one assistant principal officer, one higher executive officer, seven clerk-typists, five temporary clerks, one blind telephonist, five messengers and six cleaners&mdash;a total of 64, 36 more than were employed in Dungloe to cater for 470 fewer people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Can the Minister give any explanation for that?  I cannot understand it. Back in those days, in addition to paying unemployment assistance, vouchers had to be issued for free beef, as it was then known.  That entailed considerably more work than is necessary to-day.  In addition, those were the early days of unemployment assistance and every man's means had to be investigated before the qualification certificate issued.  I cannot understand how the Department can stand over the employment of 36 staff more to cater for 478 more people than were catered for in Dungloe in 1937.  The highest officer employed in Dungloe in those days was an employment staff officer.  To-day we have an assistant principal officer, one higher executive officer and nine staff officers. If any person can explain to me why that should occur, I would be glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>On the question of staff, there is a matter regarding their salaries to which I should like to refer.  The staff in the Department of Social Welfare are recruited in two ways.  They are recruited through open competitive examination or, alternatively, they are recruited in another manner, such as from temporary staff.  When you have spent so many years on the temporary staff, you are permitted to sit for an examination and you may become permanent.</P>
    <P>The people who join the staff of Social Welfare through open competitive examination are placed on a differentiated scale.  Single men reach their maximum when they receive £600.  But those who were temporary staff but became permanent are not on a differentiated scale.  They may go up to the maximum salary payable to a married man recruited through open competitive examination.  Very often a junior clerical officer in the Department of Social Welfare recruited from the temporary staff may have as much as £4 10s. per week more than a member of the staff recruited through an open competitive examination.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister may say that those recruited through an open competitive <Col N="305" /> examination qualified for a marriage allowance when they married and that those who were recruited from the temporary staff did not so qualify.  That was correct in those days.  But to-day the position is that those recruited from the temporary staff now receive the marriage allowance and there should not be any differentiation against those who were recruited through competitive examinations. I would appeal to the Minister to do justice to those people who entered his Department through open competitive examinations&mdash;the most difficult method of getting into it&mdash;and to see they are put on parity with those recruited in the other manner. We hear a lot these days about decentralisation.  Here the Minister is given a golden opportunity of putting into practice what has been preached down through the years.</P>
    <P>In the Bill itself I like this method of assessing means on small farmers, but I wonder is it going to be of the benefit to the small farmers of Donegal the Minister thinks?  I know in my own part of the country farmers&mdash; if one could describe them as such&mdash; who own four or five hundred acres of mountain land that never grazes a sheep.  Unfortunately they are rated on it, generally on an average of 1/- an acre.  They never derive one penny benefit from it other than what they receive when they let some of it to cut turf.  Up to the present no means have been assessed against them but now, whether they use the land or not, the fact that they are rated on it is going to hit them.  An investigation officer pointed out to me the other day three cases where unemployment assistance is going to be reduced because of this new method of assessment the Minister has introduced.</P>
    <P>During the general election, Fianna Fáil candidates told the people in the congested districts that it did not matter whether they were fishermen or small farmers because that would not be taken into account as an assessment of means.  That is not the picture painted in this Bill.  This Bill is something which does not justify the promises made to the people in the <Col N="306" /> congested districts by Fianna Fáil candidates when they were seeking election.  A much more equitable solution could be found for this problem of assessing means.  Unemployment assistance for the people in the congested areas should be looked on as a social service and given to them unless they are in insurable employment. Self-employment as fishermen or as small farmers, if we can call them such, should not be taken into account in assessing means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins attacked the investigation officers.  I have often attacked them myself but I think now that it is not fair that we should attack them. The investigation officers are carrying out their duties on the instructions given to them from Aras Mhic Dhiarmada. In the country we can always tell when there is going to be an increase in social welfare by the manner in which the investigation officers receive instructions to investigate means.  For the past four or five months, they have been busy going around these areas reassessing the means of these unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister one case, a case in which a man called Hugh Mulkern, of Keeldrum, in Gortahork, has received no unemployment assistance on three occasions since last November because they say that he will not give an account of his means.  I have written to the Department on three different occasions and asked them what information they want.  This man has no means.  The investigation officer has called on him three times but all we want from the Department is a list of the queries which he wants Hugh Mulkern to reply to.  If the Minister wants a certificate of permission to examine bank accounts or Post Office accounts, we will give it to him.  If he wants permission to count the hens in the man's byre, we will let him do so. If he wants to count the man's cattle or sheep, he can do so, but he cannot count them because the man has got neither cattle nor sheep.  What information does the Minister want?</P>

However, I am continually writing to his Department&mdash; I write at least five letters per week&mdash; to know why unemployment assistance is not being paid to these unfortunate small farmers residing in the congested areas.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that when this Bill is passed, it will be administered in the spirit in which it was introduced here, and that if benefits are accruing to these people, they will be paid to them, and that further investigations will not be carried out to reduce the benefits which should normally flow from this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having read the Bill and having read the Minister's Estimate statement, I would agree with the increases in the social welfare benefits generally.  I do not agree that they should begin in August.  I think the payment of these benefits should have begun shortly after the Budget but apparently August is the commencement date.  There is another problem to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention, that is, the problem of communication, the problem of letting the people know what they are entitled to.  I conducted a short survey in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency recently in which I spoke to some 20 people, some of whom are in receipt of social welfare benefits and some who are not in need of them.</P>
      <P>In that survey I have found 100 per cent gross ignorance of the whole setup of the social welfare scheme.  The responsibility for that lies on the Minister's Department.  These people do not know what they are entitled to. There are, for instance, dental benefits, optical benefits, medical benefits and unemployment benefits, all of which are inter-related in one way or another.  Some are covered by the Department of Health and some by the Department of Social Welfare and we owe a duty to the people to inform them about these benefits.  Information is what they want and lack of information leads to speculation.  This is a very sad state of affairs and the answer to it, as I said before in relation to other Departments, is an information campaign.  One of the Minister's leading officials could, for instance, appear on television and explain to the people exactly what the whole thing is about, educate the people on social welfare.  They are entitled to this.  The Minister could speak on the radio, or he could institute a campaign of pamphleteering, setting out what the people are entitled to.  This is a problem of communication and, as I say, the people are entitled to be informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the old people, I must say that the Minister has treated them well.  Possibly next year <Col N="309" /> there will be a reconsideration of the position in relation to their benefits.  I think, however, that we have fallen down somewhat in relation to our provisions for old people.  One of their great problems is loneliness and boredom. There are many people living in this city in the most desperate conditions and I feel that the Minister's Department should have people employed full-time to examine the position and to make sure that these people do not live lonely or unhappy existences.  The Government, and the State in the final analysis, have responsibility for these people.  Ideally the old people should live with the family.  We hear of families not being in a position to afford to keep their old people and the answer to that, in my view&mdash;again it is a question of priorities&mdash;is a system of grants from the State to the family to support the old people.</P>
    <P>In certain instances families say that they do not want to keep their parents and here we come to proposition No. two, that is, to place these old people in flats and let them live together and help one another.  Failing that, we must again revert to that great institution, the old people's home.  These homes are run by various religious institutions which, in my view, are doing a first-class job.  That is the third proposal and this should be done only as a last resort.  The State should come in and take responsibility.</P>
    <P>We have heard references to the collection of children's allowances and of old age pensions by old people.  It is undignified that these people should have to queue and produce documents to some assistant.  The queuing is the undignified part.  The Minister should re-examine this position.  The people should be entitled to receive their benefits&mdash;benefits, by the way, to which they are entitled as citizens and as members of the nation&mdash;and to receive them in a dignified manner. Finally, I should like to say that in my short experience of dealing with the Minister, I have found him to be courteous and his Department helpful in every respect.</P>
    <Col N="310" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In Deputy Andrews's speech, we have evidence of a new mind.  It appears to be a fresh mind and I trust he will always keep that approach.  I do not think that anybody could say that he was anything but objective.  Certainly he was humane in his approach to the problem of social welfare and I should like to congratulate him on the short but very rich contribution he has made.</P>
      <P>I think we are wont, in the majority to think about social welfare in the context of the types of proposals contained in this Bill, all of them good proposals.  We are inclined to think in respect of people who are sick, in terms of sickness benefit, of people who are unemployed, in terms of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, and in terms of children's allowances, old age pensions and those matters for which provision is made in this Bill.  Many people are blind to the fact that there is still a great degree of poverty amongst those who do not qualify for any of the benefits contained in our social welfare code.  I am referring particularly to those people who have to suffer the indignity of having to apply in the last resort for home assistance from a local authority and who have to subject themselves to a much stricter means test than would be imposed by any Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not got direct responsibility for the payment of home assistance, or for raising the amount of money required to pay it, but he has an overall responsibility, and I am sure he accepts it, for overall poverty.  I had occasion to mention this before in this House.  There are thousands and thousands of people who, because they have to depend on home assistance, have a total income of anything from £2 per week down to 15/- I wonder if our system of home assistance payments, at present the responsibility of the various local authorities, is a fair or humane one. In my experience, it is not.  That is the fault, not so much of the Government or the Minister for Social Welfare as of those people who are elected to these councils as public <Col N="311" /> representatives of the ratepayers, and practically every householder is a ratepayer. They are very mean in their payments of home assistance.  Many of us are inclined to blame the home assistance officer because he does not pay out a little more.  He cannot pay out any more than the various authorities give him, and in the majority of cases, they are very niggardly.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider&mdash;not in this Bill&mdash;whether or not there should be established another form of assistance outside the type of assistance we have in the general social welfare code because while some local authorities may be generous, there are others who are very mean.  Many members of public assistance authorities seem to have a passion for reducing rates and not counting the cost.  I would say it is unchristain for members of public assistance authorities, in an effort to present a good picture of a reduction of rates, to cut one of the most deserving portions of their bill, home assistance.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>Before section 10, but in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922 shall be amended by the addition of the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(10)  No direction shall be given under this section in respect of any accounting period after 1 year has expired from the date of the submission of the accounts of the company to the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As Members of the House may be aware, and as the Minister most certainly is, section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, was enacted for the purpose of enabling the Revenue Commissioners to charge supertax as it was then, surtax as it is now, on the undistributed income of certain companies. It was aimed primarily at an <Col N="312" /> economy such as that of Britain and not so much at the type of economy we have here, where inevitably there is, I might say, such a preponderance of private family companies.  These private family companies obtain the capital they need increasingly over the years by ploughing back into the business the profits from the business.</P>
      <P>That is necessary partly because of the view taken over the years in various Finance Acts, by various Ministers, that the appropriate measure of depreciation is depreciation calculated on the initial cost of the goods and not the cost it would be necessary to pay for replacement of goods or machinery.  It is a fact which cannot be gainsaid that by far the greatest number of our private companies have got the capital they needed to cope with the depreciation in the value of money by ploughing back their profits into the businesses.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I can appreciate there is a necessity for a provision such as section 21 to cover the case where the provisions of the Companies Act have been used not for the purpose of building up the financial strength of a manufacturing or other company but purely for the purpose of tax avoidance. I am not interested in such cases. I am interested in the cases where the profits have been ploughed back into businesses for the purpose of making the concerns more viable in the inflationary conditions in which we live.</P>
      <P>My objection to the method in which section 21 is operated is to the machinery rather than the phraseology of the provision itself.  It seems to me that when a company delivers its accounts to the inspector of taxes&mdash;I cannot remember whether that is automatically considered a delivery to the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the inspector of taxes should within a fixed period be able to determine whether he felt the capital ploughed back in a particular case was properly ploughed back or whether he felt it should be paid out in dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is appropriate to pay it out in dividends, then, of course, the Revenue Commissioners would get surtax, <Col N="313" /> perhaps, in respect of the dividends that were paid.  If, on the other hand, it is appropriate to plough the money back into the business, we should get development of that business in the way the national economy requires, and I think the Minister will agree that if it were not for the amount of capital ploughed back into various businesses, particularly into family concerns, in that way, we should not have anything like a viable economy now or at any future time.</P>
    <P>I understand from accountants&mdash;this is not a matter with which solicitors have any specific contact, unless it appears to be in their clients' interests&mdash; that a new technique has been growing up.  The official concerned telephones to the accountants dealing with the matter and says: &ldquo;Yours is a case in which we feel a direction should be given under section 21 going back over several years&rdquo;.  I should, perhaps, explain that under the Care and Management Acts in relation to taxes, the Commissioners have a specific function in this matter, apart from the Minister.  This is the only case, to my knowledge, in which it is appropriate to refer to officials rather than the Minister because the Minister is not permitted under the Acts to intervene in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I am advised the position is that in recent times the personnel concerned will threaten a surtax direction over a period, going back for 20 years in some cases, even though during that period assessments have already been issued and the tax on those assessments already paid.  The method of dealing with this is, as I have said, the telephone&mdash;nothing is ever put in writing.  The official says on the telephone: &ldquo;This seems an appropriate case for direction going back over a substantial period&rdquo;, and having, by that means, created an atmosphere or background, he then says: &ldquo;If you pay so and so, I shall not proceed to recommend to the Board of the Revenue Commissioners that a direction be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amount involved, of course, varies in individual cases.  Previously I have used the very strong word <Col N="314" />&ldquo;blackmail&rdquo;.  That is what this would be considered in private life.  I understand that where the taxpayer sticks out his neck and says: &ldquo;I will not be browbeaten in this matter&rdquo;, a direction is never issued.  It seems to me, therefore, it must be a very odd type of case in which a Government Department threatens to make a direction and when the taxpayer stands out against them, no further action is taken.  It shows, as I have said, that in relation to all taxation, there must be finality somewhere.  I suggest, as has been suggested by one accountant to me&mdash;he has cases in which the Commissioners have threatened directions going back for 20 years&mdash;that this is quite indefensible.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, I propose that the Commissioners be allowed a year in which to make up their minds what to do.  I do not suggest a year after the end of the period in question because that could be defeated by the company concerned not furnishing the accounts in time, but a year after they have got the accounts is plenty time for the Commissioners to consider the matter.  It would enable the company concerned to know exactly where it stood.</P>
    <P>I stress there is no suggestion in the amendment that the Minister should not get any taxes which it is felt should be paid at present.  On the contrary, I can see a case being made against this amendment that more directions might be made.  I would be prepared to put up with that for the sake of getting matters settled within a year, but the situation in which a person does not know over a long number of years where his company stands militates against modernisation and adaptation.</P>
    <P>I must say I understand that the method adopted is not peculiar to this country.  I happened to be in London recently.  I inquired from a big firm of accountants there whether the British Revenue operate rather in this way of making a big threat and then taking something very substantially less in order to avoid a fuss.  I was told that they did, though of course their direction legislation is entirely different <Col N="315" /> from ours.  It does seem a pity that when we copy British legislation and British practice, we should copy their bad points in a case such as this, rather than some good ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has of course correctly stated that the purpose of section 21 is to avoid permitting a company to get out of certain obligations.  The purpose of the section is to cope with these devices which, in effect, are avoidance devices one hesitates to use the word &ldquo;avoidance&rdquo; as against &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; but these are avoidance devices in most cases.  I understand that Deputy Sweetman's amendment would nullify the effect of the section which operates in such a way that if a company is doing fairly well and distributes none or very little of its profits and says, in effect, to the Revenue Commissioners: &ldquo;We are holding back these profits for the purpose of development, for necessary expenditure on the development of our company,&rdquo; and if that continues for a year or two years, the Revenue Commissioners do not take action because they realise it might take some time to build up a reasonable amount of money in order to enable the company to engage in that type of development.</P>
      <P>It is only if so many years have passed and no development has taken place that the Revenue Commissioners say that apparently this is an attempt to avoid payment of surtax because the profits are being put away somewhere and are not being distributed. If they had been distributed, they would be taxable in the ordinary way. The Revenue Commissioners are entitled to ask them what they propose to do.  They are entitled to say to the company: &ldquo;You say you want to develop but no development has taken place.&rdquo;  In such circumstances the inspector of the Revenue Commissioners is entitled to make a direction and, in so doing, he may say: &ldquo;You owe so much&rdquo;, where we have surtax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice, as I understand it, is that, after a certain number of years&mdash; certainly not going back 20 years, I <Col N="316" /> believe, in any case; it may have happened in an isolated instance but certainly not as a general rule&mdash;the inspector says to that company: &ldquo;You have not distributed your profits; you have not carried on with your development. Therefore, I am entitled to make a direction.  On the other hand, if we can come to a reasonable settlement, I shall recommend acceptance of the tax on the basis of that settlement.&rdquo; Deputy Sweetman said he would prefer the inspector to make frequent directions rather than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I understand that a reasonable approach is made by the inspector and by the Revenue Commissioners generally to this method.  I think it would not be in the interest of the taxpayer or the company if a direction had to be made.  I believe that in recent experience of the present officers, no direction has in fact been made.  One assumes, therefore, that a reasonably satisfactory settlement has been come to.</P>

      <P>There is a reasonable proviso in it as far as the company is concerned.  The section has a proviso which says that, in determining, for the purpose of the application of the section, whether or not a proper distribution has been made to the <Col N="317" /> shareholders, regard must be had to the reasonable financial requirements of the business and to the amounts which must reasonably be set aside by way of reserve towards its maintenance and development.  Therefore, they are statutorily required to have regard to these things.  I suggest that the acceptance of this amendment would nullify the effect of section 21 of the 1922 Act and would therefore enable and facilitate this avoidance device by such companies.</P>

      <P>We oppose this section.  We opposed it as part of the Budget Statement and the Budget Resolution produced by the Minister. We feel that the tax this section imposes is, in the present state of the economy, an unwise tax, a tax which, in effect, can have a very unfavourable result in regard to the distribution of goods and the distributive trade.  Any taxation of that kind is, we think, unwise. Deputies are aware that there is at present an awareness in the Government <Col N="319" /> in regard to the problem of rising prices.  That problem is a matter to which we have directed public attention for some considerable time past.  It is worth recording that from these benches not so long ago it was pointed out to the Government that if they proceeded with a certain new percentage tax, the result would be a new spiralling of prices.  Our views at that time were not accepted by the Government.  This tax on petrol again is a tax on distribution but it will not and cannot have the disastrous effects of the other type of taxation but nevertheless it is a new charge, a new element in costs and will add to rising prices.  Therefore we oppose the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I can make immediately.  I take it Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion is that we should relieve petrol in some way when it is used for the purpose of industry, business or other related purposes in the interests of the economy. It would be very desirable to do that at any time as it would tend to keep down the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is something that has never been done, even in the 1956 circumstances, similar to the circumstances that might now obtain.  There were at least three occasions, I think, during the term of office of the inter-Party Government, when the tax on petrol was increased and on none of these occasions was any rebate or remission given for the type of purpose the Deputy now has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a certain built-in relief already in the system in the case of kerosene, tractor vaporising oil, diesel oil, and lubricating oil which are relieved of any duties except in cases where these oils are used in road vehicles.  The oils in question, when used for purely industrial purposes within a factory, are relieved, but when one comes to contemplate relieving petrol and diesel oil for road purposes, one is faced with a tremendous problem.  It is possible that previous Ministers for Finance contemplated giving some relief on petrol and diesel oil when used in road <Col N="320" /> vehicles but realised the almost absolute impossibility of administering such a relief.  I need not tell the House that such a relief would be open to tremendously wide abuse.  In the circumstances, not only having regard to precedent but I can quote precedent on it, I do not think I could accept the opposition to the section which I believe is for the purpose I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() This section shall not apply to hard-pressed tobacco.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to implement the viewpoint we expressed on the occasion of the Budget Statement. We were anxious then to ensure that the increase in the tax on tobacco would not extend to hard-pressed tobacco.  I am aware that there is a preferential rate in respect of hard-pressed tobacco, but, as I understood the Minister's statement on the Budget, the increase in the Budget applies to both ordinary tobacco and hard-pressed tobacco.  This amendment is not, perhaps, very suitably drafted but its object is to exclude hard-pressed tobacco from the tax.</P>

      <P>Surely I must have said: &ldquo;Not all pipe smokers are wealthy people.&rdquo;  If I said what Deputy Sweetman has quoted me as having said, I agree with him that it would <Col N="325" /> be a nonsensical remark.  I am sure I never said it.</P>
      <P>To come back now to the substance of the amendment, Deputy O'Higgins has acknowledged that the amendment, as drafted, is defective.  It is defective to the extent that the duty is chargeable on the leaf and not on further processing stages.  The amendment, as drafted, would not therefore achieve the purpose the Deputy wants to achieve.  However, that is a small point.  I appreciate that what the Deputy wants to do is that I should have an amendment drafted that would achieve the same purpose. As I said on the occasion of the debate on the Budget Resolution itself, a considerable number of well-off people smoke hard-pressed tobacco.  It is, as we know, the ordinary plug tobacco.  Not only is more plug tobacco smoked than flake tobacco, but 85 per cent of all tobacco smoked is plug tobacco.  This is something I found very hard to believe.  I questioned the Revenue Commissioners on it and I am fully satisfied their figures are correct.  There must be in that 85 per cent a considerable number of people who could afford more than plug tobacco.  I do not blame people who are comparatively well off opting for plug tobacco as against ready-rubbed tobacco because, even with the increase in duty imposed by this section on both plug tobacco and flake tobacco, there is still a differential of about 1/7d. per ounce in favour of plug tobacco.</P>
      <P>That is a very considerable concession. While in one Budget at least brought in by my predecessor, he did not increase the duty on plug tobacco proportionately with the duty on flake tobacco, nevertheless I think an increase is justified, having regard to the great number of people who can afford to buy the other type of tobacco who smoke plug tobacco and having regard in particular to the still very wide difference in cost per ounce between plug tobacco and flake tobacco.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated on the day after the Budget that there were to be discussions with the wine importers about the manner in which the Financial Resolution was going to fall with equal severity on cheaper wines as on the dearer wines and that the increase in duty therefore was going to be a flat rather than a percentage increase.  I should be glad to know the results of those discussions. I gather from the fact that the section of the Bill is in its present form that there was no agreement on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it did not come to the point of agreement.  There was no agreement or otherwise.  I am informed that the secretary of the appropriate association, the Wine Dealers Association, telephoned the Revenue Commissioners in response to the interjection I made when Deputy Sweetman was speaking on that day, when I intimated that the Revenue Commissioners would be glad to meet the Wine Dealers Association to see whether any more acceptable form, that is, acceptable to both sides, could be worked out.  Following that inquiry, the Revenue Commissioners invited the Association to come and talk with them but they have not yet come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider putting an extra tax on <Col N="330" /> Chateau wines where, say, the duty would be ten per cent whereas at the moment putting a 1/- on a bottle of wine costing 4/- or 5/- amounts to a 25 per cent increase?  Surely the Chateau wine could take a higher tax than the 1/- per bottle?  Would the Minister not consider doing it himself? The carafe wine which is sold and bottled here has at least some labour content but the Chateau wine is imported bottled.  There is a company to do that in France, or in whatever country it comes from.  If carafe wine were kept lower, there would at least be some employment in the bottling and also in the Glass Bottle Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that there are two things to be considered.  The trade must be considered but the consumer must be considered.  The effect of this additional taxation has been quite substantial on the cheaper wines but because of the manner in which it has been imposed, it has not been of any real consequence on the dearer wines. That seems to me to be a bad principle of taxation in relation to this matter and the Minister should endeavour to devise some way in which, while getting exactly the same amount of money, the tax would fall more equitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider another aspect of the case?  I understand that levy has been imposed on continental wines as a whole.  I am sure the Minister appreciates the difficulties this country is facing to-day in regard to the balance <Col N="331" /> of payments.  One of our opportunities for developing an export trade is in regard to whiskey to the Continent of Europe and on the Continent of Europe over the past three or four years there has been a growing consuming public for whiskey.  Is it not a fact that if we impose this tariff, there may be a <i>quid pro quo</i> as a result and we may find it increasingly difficult to export whiskey to the different centres on the continent?</P>
      <P>The purchasing power of people in Europe has considerably increased over the past few years, as the Minister knows, and wherever you get an increase in the purchasing power, you always have a demand for a particular product.  In this case, it has been a far experience that there has been a far greater demand in Europe for whiskey than there was before.  Therefore, are we not in effect asking these Governments to impose a tariff on us, as we are imposing on them?  With regard to the tariff imposed, it seems to me to be an open tariff as it is imposed generally on continental wines as a whole.  Would the Minister like to indicate whether this imposition is on French wines, Italian wines or on German wines, or is it on all continental wines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say that it is not really important whether or not the duty is levied on cheaper wines as well as on expensive wines.  In point of fact, the content of employment given in bottling wines is negligible and not a matter of great consequence, nor will the imposition of a 1/- on a bottle deter people from buying it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take a bottle of wine which cost 4/6 before the Budget.  That will be up now by 1/- to 1/3.  I do not think that an increase of 1/3 on 4/6 is going to deter anybody from buying the wine.  In my view, this is not a very seious matter.  It may be that it has gone up in some cases considerably more.  That is the responsibility of the <Col N="332" /> licensed trade and not of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can guarantee nothing because the licensed trade is inclined to multiply and item of revenue which the Minister has sought here.  I feel that the increase of 1/- does not interfere with the wine trade one way or the other.  There has been a lot of talk about something which is of little or no importance.  It should also be borne in mind that most of the wine bottled is not Chateau bottled wine but is cheaper wine which is imported and bottled here.  In order to get the same amount of revenue from the more expensive wines, it would be necessary to increase the duty very considerably on the expensive wines.  Really in this instance there has been much ado about nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the actual bottling of wine, as in beers and spirits, labour has a very big share. All one has to do is to go into one of our modern breweries and see the proportion of the labour content absorbed in bottling as compared with the actual brewing.  Anyway, we cannot manufacture the product in this country.  We have not got Irish grapes with which to make Irish wine.  The best we can do is give as much employment as possible in the bottling.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton made the point that there should be a concession in respect of the cheap wines bottled here and that a greater tax should be put on the more expensive wines.  He did not suggest that the overall amount of tax on the commodity should be reduced. His submission was that it would have been more sensible to impose a greater rate of duty on the more expensive wines not bottled here.  His suggestion is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If it helps employment to some degree, I feel we should do so.  Of course, there is the attraction of Chateau wines at all times. Like some of the Deputies who spoke, I have no interest in selling it in any way.  There is a difficulty in so far as imposing different rates of duty on different categories of wine is concerned. At the moment we have four distinct categories&mdash;not exceeding 25 per cent proof spirit, exceeding 25 per cent proof but not exceeding 30 per cent, between 30 per cent and 42 per cent proof, and then sparkling wine in bottles.  The last mentioned is confined to champagne.  I understand that in Britain they have abolished the separate categories and now have only two main categories.</P>
      <P>It was on those lines that I was hoping we could have some consultation with the wine dealers to see if we could have a simpler categorisation, resulting, perhaps, in a lesser impost on the cheaper wines.  When these consultations did not take place, I decided to stick to the original proposition of a flat rate of 1/- per bottle, including a margin for turnover tax. As Deputy Norton pointed out, the flat rate was not adhered to in all cases.  The margins which have been taken in the sale by the glass or half-glass worked out in the order of 1/9d. per bottle increase and the wholesalers, in Dublin at any rate, have increased the price by 1/6d. per bottle.  Others have adhered to the increase of 1/-per bottle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde suggested there might be some retaliation against Irish <Col N="335" /> whiskey on the continent.  I do not think that is right.  I hope the Deputy in his travels does not give them bad ideas.  I share with him the hope that Irish distillers will take into consideration the increased consumption of whiskey on the continent.  We all know that, because of its maturing time, whiskey ties up capital for considerable periods.  In that way it is unlike other commodities which can be disposed of quickly after manufacture for cash.  That does not apply in the case of distillers.  I am not, however, completely absolving them from not making sufficient effort to cash in on the continental market where there is much wider scope for Irish whiskey than the Irish distillers think.</P>

      <P>Dealing with wholesalers, my experience has been that even after the Budget, from stocks, wines were freely available at pre-Budget prices.  After the Budget they were freely available at 1/- per bottle more.  There is no evidence that any large proportion of wine wholesalers took advantage of this.  The Minister may have other evidence but it is only fair for us, if we believe that evidence to be incorrect, to say so here.  The Minister indicated only what he has in his brief.  I believe there has not been extra profit taken.  In the possible advent of price control, it is only right I should say that here.</P>

      <P>It is not what is in my brief.  As the Deputy knows, after the Budget, there was a formal announcement by the licensed trade of an increase of 2d. on the glass of wine, sherry and so on.  Taking a bottle of whiskey at 10¾ glasses, that represents 1/9d. per bottle as against the 1/- that was justified.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be talking about one part of the licensed trade.  The licensed trade in Ireland is composed of a very large number of people.  As well as that, there are different organisations. Therefore, when the Minister talks about the increase&mdash;which, I take his word for it, was made&mdash;he should make quite sure he does not say that the whole licensed trade did that.</P>

      <P>I think I have as much experience of the retailing of the licensed trade in this city as Deputy Belton or anyone else.  When I said that the wines had gone up more than 1/- a bottle, the point is that the general wholesale price in Dublin city has been increased by 1/2d., which is 1/- plus 2d. extra put on by the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not do so.  By the time it gets to the retailer, the general increase is about 1/6d.  These are facts, irrespective of what one individual might do.  This is the general trend.  I did not suggest for a moment that the wholesalers had put up the price of wine by 1/6d. or 1/9d. I think that, by the time it gets to the public, it has gone up by the duty, plus 50 per cent.  If Deputy Sweetman gets the figures about the imports in cask and bottle, I imagine he will find that about 80 to 90 per cent of the wine brought into this country is brought in in cask.  In order to get the same amount of revenue by increasing the amount of wine brought into this country in bottles, it would be necessary to increase the duty on that particular small section very considerably. I think it would be impracticable <Col N="337" /> and would kill that type of trade.  I do not think it is putting any great hardship on anybody when a bottle of wine which cost 4/6d. now costs 5/10d.  I stand over that figure, irrespective of what the licensed trade may think.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister quite appreciated what I meant.  The position at the moment is that in the wine trade generally in Europe, there is a tendency to slight over-production and there is considerable difficulty in marketing.  I do not know what our trade agreement with France is.  The Minister probably knows more about it than I do.  However, I understand that we take wines from them in return for the sale of other produce. If we impose a tariff here on wines&mdash; and I consider that the major portion of wine consumed here in Ireland, in spite of what Deputy Norton says, is French wine&mdash;I should like to feel sure that it will not in any way affect any agreement we have <i>vis-à-vis</i> France and not necessarily only France but other European countries, too.</P>
      <P>A conference has been held over the past few years under the auspices of the Council of Europe at which an attempt has been made to liberalise the sale of wines and spirits and alcoholic commodities.

      <P>It would be most unlikely.  We are in balance, to our great disfavour, with other European countries.  It is hardly likely that they would retaliate for a small imposition of this nature, especially when comparing the position with 1949.  In 1949, we had an import of about 450,000 gallons while this year we have an estimated import of 850,000 gallons, an increase of almost 100 per cent.  It is hardly likely that they would take action against us.  It must be in their interest, if there is a surplus of wines, to get markets for them.  We are an increasing market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well. The purpose of these amendments is to deal with the proposal in the Bill which is designed to increase the impact of estate duties and death duties as it affects gifts made <i>inter vivos.</i> Under the law as it stands at present, and as it has been for the past 55 years, since the Finance Act of 1910, the position is that if a person makes a gift in his lifetime to another, and lives longer than three years after the no death duties attach to the property which he has given to the beneficiary. This provision, which is recognised in the law in relation to death duties, one must assume, has been recognised because there is a social need. It is regarded as a desirable thing that the older people coming towards the end of their lives should hand over and pass on their property to younger people and should encourage the transfer and disposition of property into more active and energetic hands. It is well to recollect that originally, after the idea of estate duty or probate duty, as it was once called, became part of the taxation system of Great Britain and was consequently carried over into our law, the period was 12 months.  If a person made a gift <i>inter vivos</i> and lived more than 12 months, no liability for death duties attached.  That was extended in 1910 to three years and it has remained so since.  The proposal, therefore, in <Col N="340" /> this Bill to extend the period for a further two years is, against that background, a very drastic proposal.  It is one in which there is quite definitely a reversal of what was regarded as an accepted fact for so long a period.</P>
      <P>We must discuss this proposal in the light of the fact that whatever the position may have been over the past 55 years, whatever the requirements may have been socially in 1910 and since, it is certainly true to say that in Ireland of 1965, there is more than ever before a growing and urgent need for activity and energy in relation to the use of the resources of the country, and when we find, as we do, that this and every other country finds increasing competition and a very dramatic increase in world population, it certainly is not the time to make it more difficult for older people who desire to benefit and set up their young folk by transferring their property to them or doing something of that kind.  It is, therefore, in that sense and because of that that we oppose the proposal contained in these sections to extend this vulnerable period, the period in which a gift is vulnerable to estate duty.  We oppose the proposed extension by two years to five years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has tabled an amendment which would be consequential upon a rejection of this amendment and we may deal with that later, although I observe that the Minister has proposed to meet Deputy Sweetman in relation to any consequential amendment, but at the moment we are discussing the amendment designed to preserve the three-year period because we believe it is necessary in present circumstances that that period should be retained.</P>

It seems to me that the submission made to you, Sir, by Deputy O'Higgins at the beginning was, with all respect, the correct submission.  If we accept the principle of the five years in section 24, then I think the principle of five years in section 18 must follow Are we discussing section <Col N="341" /> 24 or section 18?  The amendment is an amendment to section 18, but I think the Minister will agree that section 18, in respect of this particular aspect of it, should follow the general line that is going to be laid down in section 24.  I want to be quite clear&mdash; it does not matter which way it is done&mdash;that in discussing the period in section 18 now, I am not going to be restrained from discussing the period in so far as it governs the wider issue in section 24.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to section 24, which is the master section in relation to the extension of the <i>inter vivos</i> gift period, I should like the Minister to give in clear and categoric terms what he expects to get out of this extension (a) in terms of duty, (b) in terms of economic worth, and (c) in terms of social benefit.  As regards the last, I gather from what he said before that he believes this might have the effect of making older people give away their property at an earlier stage.  I disagree categorically with him on that.  It will have quite the other effect, that people will think it is not worth while doing so.</P>
      <P>As regards the amount that will be involved in the section, I have absolutely no idea in terms of money but I believe it will be negligible.  As regards the economic effect, I think it is going to be an irritant, that it will quite substantially effect a further difference between the law here and the law in Northern Ireland.  There is already a very substantial difference between our death duty legislation and death duty legislation in the North and to do anything to extend the differential that exists is something which, in my view, will do us very considerable harm.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that, leaving apart legacy and succession duty, in respect of which there is no duty payable in Northern Ireland, we have here to get to an estate of over £100,000 before our rates of estate duty are lower than or equal to the rates in Northern Ireland after one has passed £10,000 estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the estate of a man who dies leaving £12,500, the Northern Ireland rate of estate duty is two per cent less than it is in this country and neither legacy nor succession duty is charged there.  The rate varies very <Col N="343" /> substantially indeed, but, taken across the board, as I say, you have to get up to the enormous estate of over £100,000 before we equate to the Northern Ireland rate of death duties that are payable.  While what we have to pay here varies between three per cent and four per cent more than would be payable up there in estate duty for an estate of similar size, and they have no legacy duty, no succession duty, they have there only a three year gift <i>inter vivos</i> period.  We are making the differential even more unfavourable to us again here by increasing it to five years and I do not know why we are doing it.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of avoidance. The section may contain some answer to the avoidance measures but the extension of the period from three years to five years is not being done by the Minister for the purpose of preventing avoidance.  It is being done, I believe, purely because, parrotlike, it is felt that we should follow the British pattern in London.  If we are going to follow any outside pattern, surely it is better to follow the pattern in Belfast than the pattern in London in this respect?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not, as far as I can find out, make any effort to defend the proposal on the basis of its being necessary to gain substantial additional revenue.  In the introduction of a new feature like this&mdash;call it, if you like, the extension of a feature that is there already&mdash;there is an obligation on the Minister to make it crystal clear, not merely to this House but to the country as a whole, why he wants to extend this period and what is to be gained from it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not here in the House when the Minister was replying on last Thursday and, as he is aware, we have not yet got Thursday's debate and therefore I am relying on hearsay as to what he said but I have not been able to find anyone who was able to relate to me that the Minister gave any reason for the extension of this period and I think the Minister ought to give a reason now.</P>

So, if I am correct in thinking so, surely this is an improvement by 15 per cent on the law as it originally stood?  Am I incorrect in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am against section 24 as it stands and I am in favour of the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Higgins, for a number of reasons.  The effect of section 24, as drafted, is to extend the estate duty net and extend it considerably. I do not think that it is in the interests of the country as a whole. Thinking people here for some time past have come to the conclusion that we should encourage wealthy foreigners to come and settle here and spend their money here.  This section will have the opposite effect as it now stands.  Under this section we will be putting people dying here on a less favourable basis than those dying in Northern Ireland.  On this topic of gifts <i>inter vivos,</i> we will be placing them on the same level as people remaining in England.  Therefore, there is nothing at all to be gained or there is no hope of encouraging people from either Northern Ireland or England to come here in order to gain the benefits of more favourable estate duty laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I object to the section as <Col N="345" /> drafted and I am in favour of the amendment because I think the section is, in effect, retrospective legislation.  I know that it only affects people who die after the passing of this Bill and I also know that where the gift was made three or four years before the passing of the Bill, it will not be affected.  But, what about the man who, two years ago, in all good faith and having been fully advised on the law as it then stood, made a gift of fairly substantial property to his son and dies a month after this Bill becomes law?  He is going to be caught.  That is retrospective legislation because it is saying to that man, &ldquo;When you made your deed two years ago the law was that three years were sufficient to exempt you from estate duty but we are now going to say that, although you thought that would be the law in three years time, from the date on which you made the settlement, it is not the law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A man who, two years ago, transferred substantial property to his son would have incurred substantial expense in doing so.  He would have paid substantial stamp duty.  He would have paid considerable legal expenses. If I am correct in my thinking, the State will hold on to the stamp duty and still force him to pay estate duty, just as if the deed had never been drawn or the stamp duty had never been paid, notwithstanding the fact that he lives for three years from the date on which he made the deed two years ago.</P>
    <P>I say that is unfair.  I go further and say it is unjust.  I certainly think it is nothing short of retrospective legislation. If this section is brought into force, and I can see no good reason for bringing it into force, we shall be taking a retrograde step.  I think we should be getting away altogether from estate duty.  We should be preparing to abolish it rather than going ahead, as is suggested here in this section, preparing to further enlarge the net and collect more estate duty. If this section is necessary, if it is insisted upon, then it should affect only gifts made after the coming into operation of this Act.  Otherwise, it will be retrospective legislation.  I have heard retrospective legislation denounced <Col N="346" /> not only from these benches but by Deputy Booth, and other responsible Deputies, on the opposite side of the House.  A stand should be taken now against this and the Minister should be compelled to withdraw the provisions of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree fully with Deputy Fitzpatrick on this particular point, though I am, as he knows and the Minister knows, very much opposed to full-scale retrospective legislation.  I am not as opposed to this extension of the period from three to five years on that particular ground, but I still see no good reason for the introduction of this proposal. As I said on Second Reading, it is more than noteworthy that the Minister has not given any estimate of the probable increase in revenue as a result of this extension in the period in relation to gifts <i>inter vivos.</i>  The only information available to him was that the total value of gifts <i>inter vivos</i> which became taxable in the last accounting year was something in the region of £400,000.</P>
      <P>Now, the death duty payable on gifts of that value would probably not exceed £10,000 which, to my mind, is a negligible figure in such a Budget. If we go on then to the Minister's suggested amendment, whereby the rate of estate duty will be scaled down during the third, fourth and fifth year, we find that the duty for the third year is reduced by 15 per cent.  If my figures are anything like correct, and the estate duty in the last accounting year on gifts <i>inter vivos</i> was about £10,000, this amendment of the Minister would reduce that figure probably to about £8,000.  It is reducing the receipt to the Revenue.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Against that, we have a possible increase in revenue at a slightly reduced rate for the fourth and fifth year.  This seems to me to be far too problematical for us to consider it seriously at all.  I do not see that there is any indication that it will increase the revenue in any way. It will undoubtedly increase the cost, <Col N="347" /> the trouble involved and the expenditure of time in the administration of estates and the calculation of estate duty.  I would earnestly plead with the Minister to reconsider this at this stage, not only on the grounds I have mentioned, but also on the ground put forward by Deputy Sweetman, of the desirability of keeping ourselves as nearly in line as possible with Northern Ireland.  This is not a time at which we can discourage people with capital from coming to live and even to die here.  We want capital.  We should encourage it.  I am afraid this kind of proposal will act as a discouragement. If there is any categorical reason why this provision should go forward, I would be fully prepared to go with it, but, as it stands, it seems to me we are still awaiting a really cogent reason for it, and I would hope that, between now and Report stage, the Minister would reconsider the whole thing and give us some indication that he might be prepared to leave the period as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>I am indeed very pleased that Deputy Booth spoke on the other side of the House before me because he made the very plea to the Minister that I now propose to make. As a rural Deputy, it is important, I think, that we should know what really happens in agricultural life.  This section proposes to increase from three to five years the period within which a person must dispose of his property in order to avoid payment of death duties.  The Minister has stated that the only reason for the provision is to bring us into line with neighbouring countries.  Circumstances in this country are peculiarly different from those of our neighbours in that we are peculiarly an agricultural country.  I appeal to the Minister now, in company with Deputy Sweetman, my colleagues on this side of the House and Deputy Booth on the other side, to reconsider this section from the point of view of our being, in general and in particular, an agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other spheres of debate here, we have argued that farmers hold on to <Col N="348" /> their possessions too long and take too long to bequeath their property to their children.  In the name of commonsense, will this section help to improve the present position?  If the Minister believes it is desirable that we should keep in line with neighbouring countries, I suggest to him that, as an agricultural community, and for the sake of logic, we should give to our farming community the same facilities by way of abatement of rates as people in neighbouring countries enjoy.  That would be a very wise step.  I appeal to the Minister, as a Corkman and as, I hope, a sensible man&mdash;there are very few here who are not sensible&mdash;to delete this section.</P>

There is no element of retrospection in this Bill in relation to death duties generally.  Death duties, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, are applicable as of the date of death following enactment.  The proposition here generally is exactly the same as hitherto.  There is no new element whatsoever in this Bill.</P>

When we come to these sections, I hope to demonstrate to the House that there will be considerable reliefs in that context.

There is this social aspect to it: a person who, by the sweat of his brow, earns money is obliged to pay tax on it but the person who falls into property by way of a free gift should also be obliged to pay tax on that property.

Let us assume that it goes, as it generally does in this country, to a widow with dependent children.  How can they possibly pay estate duty out of their share?  They will not have any ready cash.  An estate of £10,000 is not a large estate in these days.  We are not dealing in this country with people who have an estate of £75,000 or more.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Deputy but I had a sequence of thought mapped out and due to the many questions asked I have forgotten it.  Take the case of a big estate and somebody lops off a big proportion of it, say, up to £100,000, then the rate of duty decreases.  If a person takes a goodly slice off that estate, it depresses the value of the estate and also depresses more than proportionately the amount of duty the State can get from it.  By treating the gift as <i>inter vivos,</i> the State gets its fair share of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the question of attracting foreigners into this country.  As I said in my reply to the Second Reading debate, I was rather attracted by the suggestion that we were cutting our own throat with the estate duty knife but now I do not think it follows at all.  Not only must a person coming to this country change his residence but he must change his domicile as well.  And that is only one aspect of it.  He must also change his investments to get them into this country and there is no certainty that he will do that.  We may not have the same widespread opportunities here for the investment of large sums of money as such people would have in other countries so there is no certainty that they are going to invest their assets here.  The people who follow low tax rates have no particular affinity for any one country over another.  There is no certainty that the abolition of death duties here would attract that kind of wealth to this country, particularly that kind of wealth that could be used for the economic development of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other argument that these death duties are estimated to be worth over £4 million.  It might be a question of live horse.  The grass might never grow and these investments might never come.  Then we would be obliged to make up for the <Col N="352" /> £4½ millions we would have to find for the Exchequer by way of taxation in other directions.</P>
    <P>To pursue that point one step further, we are still, even with these extensions, much more favourably placed as far as death duties are concerned than most other European countries and certainly than the United States.  In practically all the other European countries, they operate a gift tax, apart altogether from an inheritance tax.  The exceptions to that in Europe, the countries that do not operate a gift tax as well as an inheritance tax, are Belgium, Norway and Portugal.  By and large, all the others have death duty impositions much more onerous than we have.  Their gift <i>inter vivos</i> period in some cases is up to ten years, and in some cases they have this gift tax operating as well. In fact, they have it in most cases.</P>
    <P>In addition, they have the capital tax, which we have not got.  I do not think, even with this extension to five years, with the other provisions in the Bill, we are putting ourselves in an appreciably worse position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries to the extent that we are going to divert capital and investment or that we will fail to attract capital and investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not in relation to this discussion anything in the nature of what we normally understand as being anti-avoidance.  This is a straight issue as to whether the period of time is to be five years or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement that Northern Ireland has no differentiation in relation to blood relationship as we have here could be allied, I am afraid, to his remark about pipe smokers and tobacco.  There is only in Northern Ireland, Britain and here, and only ever was, one type of differentiation in relation to blood relationship, and that is in regard to legacy and succession duty.  There never was any blood relationship differentiation in estate duty.  In Northern Ireland, they have had the good sense to abolish legacy and succession duty.  It is true to say, perhaps, they have no blood relationship differentiation because <Col N="353" /> they have abolished the tax altogether.</P>
    <P>We have an additional legacy duty and succession duty category of five per cent for brothers and their issue and ancestors and ten per cent for strangers in blood.  Apart from that lower duty and because of the absence of legacy and succession duty, an estate between £10,000 and £12,500 with us here bears six per cent estate duty and with them up there, bears five per cent; an estate between £12,500 and £15,000 with us bears eight per cent duty, and with them bears six per cent duty; an estate between £15,000 and £17,500 with us bears ten per cent, and with them bears seven per cent; an estate between £17,500 and £20,000 with us bears 12 per cent, and with them bears eight per cent.  As I said, right up to an estate of £100,000, their estate duty rates are between three per cent and four per cent lower than ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one correction. From £85,000 to £100,000, we are three per cent less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly right.  I should have said up to £85,000, and not up to £100,000. But that is not the whole story by any means.  We are an agricultural country.  A very large part of the property that here suffers extra duty consists of agricultural land.  Agricultural land in Britain and Northern Ireland has a rebate of 45 per cent of the duty involved.  In Northern Ireland, as in Britain, agricultural land is taxed at only 55 per cent of its value.  I will admit quite frankly that I did not realise until the other day, when I was having some discussions on the Second Reading of this Bill, that the agricultural land rebate which applies in England applies also in Northern Ireland.  It means, therefore, that if one takes into account the agricultural land rebate, the differentiation is far greater than the three per cent in estate duty I have spoken about, is greater because of the absence of succession and legacy duty and the five and ten per cent categories, and that there is in fact no comparison in relation to death duties <Col N="354" /> between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties.  There is an overwhelming advantage for anybody in going to settle up in the North.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister should accentuate further that very unpleasant differentiation there is against us.  We have a position here at present in which agricultural land has risen in value to such an extent that a farm of 100 acres in Deputy Norton's constituency and mine is worth perhaps £20,000.  I am speaking of a residential farm with very good buildings into which a lot of money has been put.  If the equivalent were taken in Northern Ireland, it would be valued at only £12,500 and, accordingly, would qualify at the five per cent rate.  Down here it would qualify at the 12 per cent rate.  That is assuming, which of course is nonsense, that there is no stock on the land at all.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to death duties is that we have gone step by step wrong with the people in Belfast and the Minister is accentuating that and making it far worse now in this Bill.  I do not believe for one instance that the percentage of the anti-avoidance amount that the Minister is going to collect by the extension from three to five years will be anything worth while in considering the total Budget and the total amount to be raised by this Bill.  I do take the view, and in this I want to express myself as categorically opposed to a view I heard the Minister express last Friday night, that we need all the capital that we can get in here.  We must get all the capital we can get in here and to suggest that anybody can live away from here if he does not like our laws and take his capital with him is cutting off our nose to spite our face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not going to get that capital.  We should do it by an extension of the provisions of section 21 of the Finance Act, 1956, which was a tentative first trial but which has proved successful in attracting money to many of the new issues.  We should do it to ensure that we are not taking money out of agriculture at the same time as the general budgetary bill is trying to pump money into agriculture. <Col N="355" /> It is quite indefensible, with the pattern we have here of the head of the family naturally wanting one of his children to succeed him in the family home, that we should have a higher rate absolutely for death duties in respect of that home and that we should also refuse to give the 45 per cent remission which agricultural land is given in the North.  There is no excuse for it; it is regressive and retrogressive, and it is going to mean in the long run that people, where they have the option, will settle on the other side of the Border and utilise the capital they bring for the benefit of the extension of that part of the country rather than for this part.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear: this is not only a question of a rich man bringing in his money.  We all know that in many cases where a factory is to be set up depends upon where the mainspring of that factory, if it is a proprietary business, wants to live.  He is obviously going to choose the place which suits him better from the point of view of his personal fortunes as well as from the industrial point of view.  This is not the time or the place to argue the comparison between our industrial incentives and those they have up there, but it is the place to argue in relation to the personal incentive and the Minister is making it a personal disincentive towards getting that capital, that know-how by the extension in this particular section.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points made about our farmers being in a worse position <i>vis-à-vis</i> death duties compared with farmers in the North of Ireland, one must take the whole economic being of the farmers into account in this respect.

      <P>We have 65 per cent at least abatement of rates on agricultural land in this part of the country and this is a not inconsiderable help, but farmers, no matter how much money they make from their land, do <Col N="356" /> not have to pay income tax.  They are taxed under Schedule A which is related to the valuation put on the land, under a system which is nearly 100 years old.  The farmers here are in that very much more advantageous position than their counterparts north of the Border.  When it comes to the question of attracting big estates to this country, people with a lot of money, whose investments would be of value to us, first of all, no matter who invests money in our National Loans or similar securities have their investments tax free anyway, but when it comes to attracting big estates, we are still in a very favourable position.

However, it is well to remind the House that in Britain there is a similar rebate of duty in relation to ordinary business and business property.  In England, in respect of the property of a businessman which passes on death, the duty is 55 per cent of the normal rate.  That does not apply here.  Here, not only is there the liability for income tax in life but for the full rate of duty on death.  That is a factor that should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, Sir, that we have ranged into a discussion on this provision which would, perhaps, be more appropriate on other amendments.  I shall get back to the amendment before the House&mdash;that the liability to estate duty in relation to gifts <i>inter vivos</i> should be confined to a period of three years.  In that respect, I do not think the Minister has in any way answered the point which we suggest is a social need at the moment. It has always been desirable, but more so now than ever before, that there should be encouragement by State policy to have property passed or <Col N="358" /> transferred from old hands into young hands.  That has always been recognised but is more applicable now than ever before.  The Minister has not attempted to deal with that.</P>

      <P>The Minister's view earlier that the extension to five years was desirable is, I suggest, entirely incorrect.  This will dampen down transfers of property and this, in turn, will have a very bad, far-reaching effect.  The Minister went on to say it was only right that since a person who earned his livelihood by the sweat of his brow was taxed, a person who gets a gift of property should also be taxed.  That is an argument which suggests that all gifts should be taxed.  We have not got to that stage yet and I do not know whether in the next Finance Bill the Minister will bring in such a proposal. However, we cannot deal with it here because it is not the law, nor is it an accepted viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Nobody suggests that merely because a person gets a gift, he should pay tax or duty on it.  In relation to transfers of property, the question we have to consider and bear in mind is whether the disposition of property should be encouraged or not. It appears desirable, if you are to get a smoothly running economy, a sustained effort of production on the farm or in business, that people should freely be encouraged, by family settlements, by proper, sensible arrangements made in the vigour of good health, to arrange things to the general satisfaction of the social unit, be it in the family or in business.  This should be done at a stage which can be best decided by the people who run the farm or the business.  They are the people who can best decide when a transfer of management should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we encourage that, surely it is in the best interests of the nation.  We shall be mobilising national effort into better production, so badly needed at the moment.  In this section we have a residue from the last century, a pettifogging taxation system enshrined in <Col N="359" /> the earliest death duty provisions, now revived in the Ireland of 1965 when our circumstances rebel against this mode of taxation.  I cannot add anything more.  It must be obvious to a large number of Deputies that this is a retrograde step to the last century. In the Finance Bill of 1965, we are inserting a bit of pure Victoriana.</P>

      <P>While Deputy O'Higgins was speaking, I worked out figures in respect of a very ordinary case here and in the North.  A residential farm of, say, 120 acres in the midlands would be worth £120,000. The stock on that would, at present prices, be worth £6,000.  Furniture, implements and perhaps a little working capital would amount to £3,000&mdash; a total of £130,000.  Duty payable here on that family unit would be £5,400. Duty paid on the same family unit in the North would be £2,100.  The Minister is taking £3,300 more out of that family unit, a farm of about 120 acres in Meath or Kildare, than would his counterpart in the North.  The figures I have given are not exaggerated in the least.  They speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman's point is of more general application than the amendment before us, so I do not propose to follow him on it at the moment.  On the points raised by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, I still adhere to the point of view I expressed the other day&mdash;that the extension of the three-year period to five years would stimulate a quicker transfer of property from a father to a son or other member of the family. As I feel sure Deputy O'Higgins knows, the expectation of life is getting longer fairly steadily.  People nowadays reaching 60 or 65 years feel they have at least another five or ten years.  If they are to allow younger people to enjoy gifts <i>inter vivos</i>, they will be encouraged by the five-year period to give the younger person an earlier opportunity to apply new ideas, fresh thinking, to the running of the farm or business.  I still adhere to the point of view I expressed earlier that far from slowing down the transfer of farms or businesses at a sufficiently <Col N="360" /> early stage, this provision will stimulate it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i>: The Minister has said that in extending the three-year period to five years, we are only keeping up with other countries.  It is a five-year period in England but there is no guarantee that it will be so in Northern Ireland soon. Our ideas should be more modern in this respect than those of either England or Northern Ireland.  We have embarked on a policy of law reform but I think it is a policy of law reform for the sake of reform&mdash;that we are merely following what is going on in other countries.  That is not good policy.  We should reform our laws here to suit our own needs and not slavishly follow what is going on in England.</P>
      <P>A typical example of slavishly following other countries is the Succession Bill which came into the House without the Minister knowing what was required to suit the needs of the country.  Section 24 is yet another example.  Therefore, I think that the Minister's case on that is unsound.</P>
      <P>The next thing the Minister said is that this is a gift and that, because it is a gift, a person should pay a tax on it just as he would pay a tax on some money he earns.  The case we are talking about here, by and large, is a gift from a father to a son&mdash;the handing on of a family farm or family business by the father to the son.  I think that should be encouraged and not penalised.  I think it is altogether different from a gift from a complete outsider to a stranger.  Would the Minister be prepared to make any concession in the case of a transfer from a father to a son or from a husband to a wife?  Does he want to catch in this net the gifts of family farms or family businesses made by fathers to sons or by husbands to wives?  I think that, if he does, he is wrong.  He is following a bad example if he follows that of countries such as Northern Ireland and England which have not the same conditions, as Deputy Barry said, as prevail here in rural Ireland.</P>
