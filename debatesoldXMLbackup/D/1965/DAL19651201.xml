      <P>As already indicated in replies to previous questions on this subject, the building, overhaul and repair of their vessels is the concern of the Board of Irish Shipping Ltd. It is the Board's policy to have their vessels built or repaired at Irish shipyards whenever it is feasible and economic to do so.</P>
      <P>I have ascertained from Irish Shipping Ltd., that no orders for new vessels have been placed by them in the past three years.  Verolme Cork Dockyard and Harland and Wolfe have been asked recently to quote for a new vessel which the company propose to acquire.  Liffey Dockyard do not build vessels of the size required.</P>
      <P>Tenders for repairs, necessitating drydocking of ships, were invited from Liffey Dockyard Ltd., on 22 occasions, Verolme Cork Dockyard Ltd., on 31 occasions and Harland and Wolfe, on three occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies given by me to previous questions on this subject in which I explained that, in order to ensure that available capital is conserved for productive purposes, it was found necessary to discontinue the issue by the Agricultural Credit Corporation of loans for certain unproductive purposes and to cancel loan offers for such purposes where the offers had not been taken up within the time stipulated by the Corporation.  Such offers must be regarded as dead and fresh applications would clearly serve no useful purpose as long as the present policy continues of restricting loans to productive purposes only.  It is not possible to say when the Corporation will be in a position to resume the issue of loans of the kind at present discontinued.</P>
      <P>The question of the length of the period during which a loan offer remains valid is, of course a matter for the Corporation.  I would again refer the Deputy, however, to my earlier replies mentioned above, in which I explained that I had put the Corporation in funds to the extent of £1 million more than had been settled in the Capital Budget and that I foresaw no possibility of putting them further in funds for the purpose which the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure sets out the background to the restrictions on capital expenditure, including capital for agricultural and industrial credit, which the Government has been obliged to impose. <Col N="693" /> The Deputy will observe from paragraph 20 of this document that, while the Government regard agricultural credit as warranting special consideration, the Corporation was asked to confine credit facilities to projects of a directly productive nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 22, 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that there is at present any need for a general review of the powers and procedures of local authorities in regard to the taking in charge of private housing estates.  The position in this regard was fully examined when the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, was being framed, and provisions were included in that measure giving planning authorities effective powers to ensure in future that private housing estates are properly completed.  In particular, under section 26 of the Act, they are empowered when granting permission, to impose conditions requiring the giving of security for the satisfactory completion of proposed developments (including maintenance until taken in charge by the local authority of roads, open spaces, carparks, sewers, water mains and drains). Section 35 of the Act empowers them to take enforcement action against defaulting developers and, if necessary, to undertake the works required themselves and to recover the cost from the developer.  By exercising the new powers conferred on them by this Act, planning authorities can now <Col N="698" /> ensure that there will be no further cases of uncompleted estates or of delays in the proper completion of estates such as those mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I am informed that these delays were due to default on the part of the developers or, in some cases, financial difficulties or death of a developer.  The local authorities have power to take private estates in charge when they are offered to them, but a decision on such an offer is a reserved function.  The local authorities have naturally been reluctant to take in charge estates which have not been properly completed because the expense of bringing works up to the necessary standard would fall on the general body of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>From reports I have received from the local authorities in the Dublin area, I am aware that since the 1963 Act was brought into operation a full survey of uncompleted estates has been carried out and the local authorities are making every effort to secure that outstanding works are completed.  In some cases, they have initiated the enforcement procedure under the 1963 Act.  Other cases are being examined to see if the procedure can appropriately be applied.</P>
    <P>As regards grants I am prepared to consider the allocation to residents' associations of grants under the Amenity Grants Scheme administered by my Department, for the provision or improvement of open spaces or other projects of an amenity nature coming within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position if a building company which was developing an estate has since gone into liquidation and the scheme has not been completed?  What action can the Minister's Department take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the types of case I have mentioned that was throwing up difficulties, and at this juncture all I can say is that it would appear that a local authority would have to take it over, do whatever had to be done, and apply to the rates for the wherewithal to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of <Col N="699" /> the Minister that that will be done in the immediate future, or is it a matter which will continue for another ten or 15 years?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, further to a reply of 11th November on the subject of the reduction of a widow's non-contributory pension to the widow of a garda, he will state fully the reasons why this widow was issued with a pension book at the wrong rate; and why her pension is now being reduced <Col N="704" /> on account of alleged overpayment by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of a pension book at the wrong rate to this widow was due to a clerical error in my Department.</P>
      <P>A refund by the recipient of any overpayment of widow's pension is required by section 57 of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935.</P>
      <P>I may add that having regard to the various communications which this pensioner, and the Deputy on her behalf, received from my Department in connection with the revision of her pension, and in particular the fact that the notification she received concerning the failure of her appeal against the decision to reduce her pension also notified her of the amount of pension awarded, it must have been perfectly clear to her that an error had been made in sending her a pension book at the higher rate and that she was not entitled to cash the orders therein.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to consider, where overpayments have been made to social beneficiaries as a result of clerical errors in his Department, that as a general rule the overpayments would be recovered at the rate of one shilling a week, admitting that that might be a protracted operation but recognising that the correction of these errors can be a very heavy burden on the pension recipient if it has to be paid over a short period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I appreciate that where they are due to a clerical error, we should be as lenient as possible, but in this case it was perfectly clear that the pension book which was issued was the incorrect rate and the person concerned was well aware of that fact. There is no doubt whatever about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The overpayment was due to the fact that her Garda widow's pension was increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not.  Her appeal against the reduction of the pension was disallowed, and it was <Col N="705" /> stated quite clearly both to her and to Deputy Spring that this was so.  She had in her possession a definite statement of the correct amount of pension which had been awarded to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper reports of the statement to which the Deputy refers.  I am aware that there are still delays in the Land Registry despite constant efforts to eliminate them.  These delays are due to the difficulty in maintaining the necessary clerical and technical staff strength, and to the inadequacy of augmented copying equipment, to cope with the continually increasing volume of business.</P>
      <P>It is expected that competitions for the recruitment of Male Clerical Officers and for Mapping Draughtsmen will be held shortly and will, with the improved salary scales, make it possible to bring the staff strength up to requirements in the New Year.  It is also expected that new and more efficient copying equipment which has been ordered will be in operation early in the New Year.  In the meantime everything possible is being done by the working of overtime to keep delays to the minimum.</P>
      <P>I think it as well to mention that many delays complained of are due, not to any shortcomings in the Land Registry, but to shortcomings in the applications submitted and to delay on the part of applicants in answering necessary queries issued.  Some business is, by its very nature, necessarily slow and this applies particularly to applications for First Registration.  It is conceivable that such an application could take up to a year to complete.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that I am keeping in constant touch with the situation in the Land Registry and that everything possible is being done to eliminate all avoidable delays.</P>

      <P>I believe that the public are fully aware from the many statements already made that the question at issue in this dispute which affects 180 male night telephonists out of a total of 2,060 staff employed on telephone operating, is simply whether the Post Office Workers Union or the Irish Telephonists Association&mdash;the break-away group&mdash;should in future be recognised as representing male night telephonists.  This question is clearly one for discussion between the <Col N="719" /> union and the association and I have repeatedly suggested that progress can best be made by such a meeting, under an independent chairman.  The Post Office Workers Union has stated that it is prepared to attend such a discussion but the association has refused to do so and has likewise rejected all proposals made to it by the panel of Civil Service staff associations.  Unless the association alters its attitude, no progress is possible.</P>

This is the principle involved; otherwise it is fragmentation.  The whole principle of trade unionism is involved in this; it is not this section alone.  If we are to retain the confidence of trade unions we have to stand by them in what they are doing.  I am not convinced by anything that has happened so far that the Post Office Workers Union, which is an old-established union with almost 8,000 members, is not quite capable of looking after the interests of all the telephonists, let alone the small section of night telephonists.

I am interpreting the second part of the question as referring to persons in receipt of institutional assistance, that is shelter and maintenance as distinct from active medical treatment.  There is no specific number of beds reserved for such patients.  The number varies but, on average, there are about 690 patients in this category in St. Kevin's Hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1st May, 1965, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 1,660 female and 172 male untrained teachers in national schools.  Of the total 1,191 were lay teachers and 641 were religious.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of untrained teachers has been discontinued since 1958.</P>
      <P>Accordingly the number of untrained teachers is being steadily decreased each year as those teachers on retirement are being replaced by trained teachers.</P>
      <P>Many of the untrained religious are merely novices who normally do a few years teaching in an untrained capacity before entering a training college.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is carrying out a full investigation with a view to determining the future arrangements for the provision of suitable educational facilities for the children living in the area of Culleens, Ballina, County Mayo.  Pending the completion of that investigation, further consideration in regard to the building of a new school has been postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this school is one of the best two-teacher schools in Ireland and the people in the area are definitely anxious that it should be kept there,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of both points, since the Deputy has made them very forcibly to me, but I would point out that the matter is at present under investigation.  No decision has yet been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, while matters like this are under investigation, the children must continue in cold, insanitary conditions in Culleens school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that, if the school were to be replaced in the ordinary way, the children would continue in the present conditions for a considerable time; and, if there were a proposal to transfer the children to another school, this could be implemented very much more quickly and the children would be in more favourable conditions much more quickly than they would be if we proceeded with the building of the school.  That is not the only factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that if the children of this area were transferred into Ballina, which is the only place to which they could be transferred, that would mean overcrowding <Col N="733" /> in Ballina and would involve the building of extra rooms there?  Is the Minister not aware that in his Department at the moment there is an offer to build a two-teacher school much nearer to Ballina than Culleens school or does one end of the Department not know what the other end is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the first part of the Deputy's question.  It may be that the Deputy can see a proposal only to transfer the children to Ballina, but there are other possibilities which are being investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is under investigation at the moment.  It is being dealt with in conjunction with the school authority and, in due course, whatever arises out of investigation and consultation, the Deputy will no doubt be aware of it before the matter is finalised and he can make any representations he wishes.  But I should not like him to think that the only possibility is transfer to Ballina. With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.  This illustrates a point I have been making here and elsewhere that each case is treated on its merits and, in the case to which the Deputy refers, the position was such that the decision was in favour of a two-teacher school.  There are such cases.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that section 14 should cover such a case but some years ago a recommendation was issued on behalf of the Minister to all county managers requesting them to regard as being automatically entitled to inclusion on the medical register every person in receipt of the full old age pension, but only in some cases was that circular acted upon, and in many instances people who are in receipt of full old age pensions are not included in the medical register.  We are concerned here with legislation and it is very little use for the Minister to suggest that we should give him particulars of cases that come to our knowledge and that he will look into them.  I know from bitter experience what is the value of the Minister looking into these things, if there is no legislative power to enable the Minister to do something about it. There is no power under existing legislation to enable the Minister to do anything about these things and there is no appeal from the decision of the county manager.</P>

I am concerned to see that in relation to people who are in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions, the local authority will not have power to exclude them from the medical register.

The Minister has asked that he be supplied with instances of non-compliance but we are living in cuckooland if we are content with the assurance that the Minister will look into such cases.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy is perfectly correct.  Deputy O'Higgins, as far as I can recollect, issued back in 1956, not a directive but a recommendation. I issued a recommendation some months ago as well to county managers.  It is preposterous to be talking about eligibility and so on if we have such cases of old age pensioners being refused medical cards.  I hope under the proposals which are coming before the Government next Friday to spell this out in no uncertain manner, if the Government accept my recommendation.</P>

These people have been refused medical cards because some other members of the family have a certain level of income.  Anybody who has to go through a stringent means test to qualify for an old age pension should be automatically entitled to this, without having their eligibility subject to a means test of the family.</P>

      <P>I do not like to act as a sore thumb in this matter but what the Minister has just said does not satisfy me.  The question I asked when I came here today was when did the Minister anticipate that further legislation in relation to health matters might be introduced.  He had not a clue.  What he is saying now in effect is: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  The fact is that there are at the moment many old age and widow pensioners who are in need of medical attention, who have no means, who have satisfied the social welfare side of the State that they have no means.  They are in receipt of the full pension and they cannot get the services of a dispensary doctor.  What the Minister is saying is: &ldquo;I am hopeful that the proposals we are now going to bring to the Government next Friday will be approved by the Government.&rdquo; So what?  Eventually they will be included in a White Paper and some time, if these people do not die&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that it is reasonable, now that we are amending the Health and Mental Treatment Acts, to introduce an amendment at this stage.  It can be done without difficulty, an amendment to provide that any person who is entitled to the full old age or widow's pension should be entitled to inclusion in the medical register.  Why can it not be done? What is the difficulty about doing it? The Minister's Department has been alerted to the need for this for the past nine years.  The Department has <Col N="742" /> been aware of the problem for the past nine years.  There has been no one who has not been aware of the need for the inclusion of these people&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;in the medical register.</P>

If the Minister holds out his right hand to the civil servants on his right and if they can produce figures for him of the numbers of old age and widows' pensioners who are not included in the medical register, I shall be very glad to see them.  I assure the Minister that in the midlands which I represent, it has been the consistent rule of the county manager not to include such people.  This applies in many counties. The Minister says there are not many. How does he know?  I would say the honeymoon is now over.  The Minister is no longer the new boy, not having had enough time to face up to his responsibilities.  I would remind him that his Government were elected last April on an undertaking to bring in social legislation in conformance with a just society.</P>

That simple step to improve our health services&mdash;goodness knows, it is the tiniest thing&mdash;we cannot get from the Minister for <Col N="743" /> Health, and he has no legislative proposal in mind to do that.  Apparently, so far as he is concerned, after he has talked to the Government next Friday and if they agree with his point of view, some time, some day in the future, after he has brought this to the White Paper proposal stage, old age or widow pensioners can hope for legislation to have them included in the medical register.  If that is an indication of the new deal for sick and poor people in this country, God help Ireland.</P>

      <P>He did it very well but unfortunately he made many sweeping statements.  The Deputy had his recommendations in 1956 urging county managers to grant medical cards automatically to classes such as old age pensioners.  With that we are in thorough agreement.  The unfortunate thing is that Deputy O'Higgins had the opportunity then in 1956 of ensuring that this was written into legislation.  He failed to do so, and there is no point in talking about what has not happened in the past nine years.  I hope the only difference between him and me is that I am going to do something about it, and the next question is when.  I cannot say when. I am a member of the Government, with collective responsibility.  I cannot be jumping up, announcing when I will do this and when I will do that.

I may say that we have done an examination.  We have got statistics from various counties and we are satisfied that this mal-interpretation is not so widespread, fortunately. Nevertheless, as long as there is one case of injustice, steps will have to be taken to remedy it.  I shall send that directive out to the county managers as quickly as possible.</P>

The Minister says there are only a few cases.  If there are only a few, why cannot we here amend the Health Acts by including an amendment to provide for this simple, tiny measure of relief&mdash;that the few old age and widow pensioners who will be unjustly treated by county managers shall be entitled to be included in the medical register for this purpose?  Ministerial assurances and promises of great things in the future do not cod anyone any more.  They will not satisfy the needs and requirements of poor people.  Here we are legislating in regard to health and there should be no difficulty about including an amendment at this time. The Minister can do it.  If he is sincere, surely he can do it.  Surely he will not be sacked from the Government for moving an amendment to provide medical assistance for such people? Can we not proceed on that basis and have the amendment moved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why this Bill was delayed so long.  I <Col N="747" /> feel sure the Minister appreciates the point I am trying to make.  The Minister for Social Welfare, in the Bill through which he increased the social welfare benefits, included a section raising the insurability limit from £800 to £1,200.  We thought that the Bill from the Minister for Health would be introduced at the same time because during the past few months&mdash;since the Minister for Social Welfare raised the insurability level&mdash;people have suffered by not being included in the middle income group for the purpose of daily maintenance in hospitals.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister for Health was very liberal in one case to which I drew his attention in that he deemed the person to be in the middle income group, though his salary was more than £800.  The Minister for Social Welfare introduced his measure in June and here we are, five months afterwards, in the position where people have to pay more than 10/- per day in hospital fees.  I think the Minister should take steps to ensure that any money so paid during the months between the introduction and passing of the Social Welfare Bill and the enactment of this measure should be considered for refunds.  It must have been the intention of the Government and the Minister for Health to have that change made long before now.  People have been charged more than 10/- per day, up to £1 and 35/-, or whatever the charge is for those deemed to be in the upper income group.  I would ask the Minister to consider anything that has been charged over and above 10/-per day to people up to £1,200 per year.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I wish to raise a point somewhat different from those already raised.  In this Bill we are increasing the number of people in the middle income group. The number up to the present date is 1,600,000 people, to which we are going to add perhaps 266,000.  Up to this the lower and middle income groups comprised about 85 per cent of the population and when this Bill becomes operative, these groups will comprise about 95 per cent of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is a figure not so easily estimated because not alone have you increased the means from £800 to £1,200 and the valuation from £50 to £60, but there is another aspect more difficult to estimate, that is, the elimination of the income of sons and daughters from the total income evaluation.  The work will be carried out by the same medical people as have been doing it heretofore, broadly institutional specialists in various local authority hospitals and what we call voluntary specialists in the city hospitals.  It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that the increase from £800 to £1,200 is really only equivalent to an increase to £1,000, taking into account the depreciation in the value of money.  I am aware that the Irish Medical Association expressed agreement to the increase from £800 to £1,000 and therefore they are keeping level with the decrease in the value of money.  Presumably they would agree to a corresponding increase in valuation, however that would be estimated, but it seems to me that all the Minister is offering to the public is something extra which costs him very little but he is offering it at the expense of the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> I do not know what representations they have made to him or if they have made any.  If they have not done so, they are not doing their job.  I do not know what arrangements the Minister has come to with them about this matter.  Obviously, we are asking the specialist profession to take on extra work for the same remuneration and to accept what is, in effect, a reduction in their own incomes at a time when we are giving status increases costing £4 million to many of our State employees.  I would ask the Minister if he has come to any agreement on these matters.  I presume he has taken the situation into consideration.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because some few years ago when the income limit was raised from £600 to £800, it was done on somewhat the same lines as has happened now.  First, a social welfare measure was introduced raising the insurance stamp and then this followed as a secondary measure.  The same thing is happening now.  On the last occasion, when the limit was advanced from £600 to £800, no immediate arrangements were made to compensate the medical consultants who had their income reduced as well.  It is true that the various men employed by the local authority hospitals did have some increase in salary and probably some advance was given to the men in the voluntary hospitals.  I am not quite clear on what basis they are paid at present.  I should like to hear from the Minister what arrangements he has come to in the interests of social justice with the various consultants in the two broad categories, local authority institutions and voluntary institutions, to compensate them for the undoubted loss of income this will mean to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have read my speech on Second Reading.  I pointed out I had a joint meeting with the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union, of one of which, I am sure, the Deputy is a member himself.  I pointed out to them that, when the picture <Col N="752" /> becomes clearer and if they had been adversely affected in their earnings to any substantial extent by what I proposed to do now, I would not be unsympathetic towards arranging some form of compensation by way of adjustment of their remuneration from public funds.  I have a written communication from the Irish Medical Association on another matter.  The Deputy can rest assured it would be inequitable that any action of mine should make professional people less well off than they were before such a measure was introduced.</P>

      <P>I do not think we are achieving very much in view of the fact this has to be discussed again at another time.  In passing, however, I should like to say I had a question to the Minister the other day for written answer.  Anybody who checks the details given will see that the amount of money involved is so terribly small that the Minister might possibly consider the complete removal of these charges.  The amount per county is very small and the total amount appears to be roughly £500,000.  If that is so, I do not know what we are arguing about and holding up the extension of treatment to all our people.  Apparently, the full 10/- can be collected from only a very small number.  The total for the whole country was £161,310 up to 31st March last year in respect of the Health Act and £33,510 in respect of the Mental Treatment Act.  Having studied all the figures, the Minister might consider the complete removal of the charges.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) proposes to increase the eligibility on a poor law valuation basis from £50 to £60.  On Second Reading, I pointed out to the Minister that I thought a poor law valuation test which included buildings was unsatisfactory, for the simple reason that the method of valuing buildings is completely unsatisfactory. You have a position now where one set of buildings may be valued at £3 and certain buildings comparable in all respects may be valued <Col N="753" /> at £10 or £15.  That is a fact that cannot be disputed.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister&mdash; and before developing it any further I should like to hear his views on it&mdash;that he should confine the poor law valuation to the poor law valuation on land, which is fixed and has been fixed for about 100 years and cannot be changed without an Act of Parliament.  Buildings are revalued, on no known principle.  If you do repairs and are lucky, your buildings are not revalued, but if you are unlucky, your valuation may be doubled or trebled.  I should like to have the Minister's views.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Hardly ever.  I base my argument, not <Col N="754" /> so much on the ground of productivity, as on the ground that it will work a grave injustice.  I could tell the Minister of some farmers who extended their buildings extensively perhaps 20 years ago and those buildings have never been revalued, whereas another farmer who extended the buildings perhaps last year or the year before may be unlucky enough to have been listed for revaluation and will be valued out of this section.  If all farm buildings were valued on the same basis and were revalued immediately any extension was made to them, then I would not have any real ground for complaint, but, as I say, it is being done on a hit and miss basis at the moment.</P>
      <P>I would even go further and say that&mdash;I am not attributing any political reason to it&mdash;you could have a rate collector who just might overlook some particular person's buildings and not list them for one reason or another. That happens.  I would say that a farmer who expended a considerable amount of money on building a dwelling house for himself might run into debt in so doing and might actually be worse off than his neighbour who was prepared to live in the old house and hold the money in the bank.  A very good argument can be made on the basis that I have suggested for taking into account the valuation of lands only.</P>

There might be a high valuation put on that if he modernised the shop front and a person who is running an old shop with a residence overhead who never carried out any improvement would have a low valuation.  It is not this section which affects this position; it is the entire inequity of the existing rating system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The principal object of this Bill is to secure a more rational and effective use of the time devoted to parliamentary financial business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> It will, perhaps, be as well if, at the outset, I deal briefly with the present procedure for the consideration of financial business in this House.  The annual parliamentary financial cycle begins in February or early March with the debate on the Vote on Account which takes place in advance of the publication of the Estimates Volume and covers many aspects of Government financial policy.  This Vote provides approximately one-third of the amount required to run the public services during the succeeding financial year and thus enables these services to be maintained while the individual Estimates are being considered by the Dail.  The annual Central Fund Bill is passed in March. That Bill authorises the Minister for Finance to issue from the Central Fund the amount granted under the Vote on Account.  With the introduction of the Budget in April or May a further debate on Government financial policy takes place in which a great deal of the ground covered in the Vote on Account debate is again traversed.  The Budget is followed by the Finance Bill which gives statutory authority to the taxation proposals announced in the Budget and affords a further opportunity to discuss financial policy. Meanwhile the individual Estimates are considered by the Dail and, as the amount provided in the Vote on Account is only sufficient to cover expenditure for the first four months of the financial year, the Dail must deal with all the Estimates by the end of July at which time the Appropriation Bill, which provides statutory authority for the Estimates, is introduced and passed.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements which I have just outlined may be criticised on two grounds.  First is the fact that there are, in effect, three major discussions of Government financial policy within a space of about four months&mdash; namely on the Vote on Account, the Budget and the Finance Bill.  This inevitably produces a certain amount of overlapping between the debates.  Of the three, the Vote on Account discussion is the least effective.  It takes place, as I have said, in February or early March before all the information required for a comprehensive and <Col N="759" /> informed debate is available.  This information, comprising details of Government expenditure and taxation proposals together with the general statistics regarding the state of the economy, is contained in the Estimates Volume, the Budget proposals and the various publications issued at Budget time.  It is clear, therefore, that a fully effective debate on Government financial policy cannot take place before the Budget is presented.</P>
    <P>The second disadvantage of the present system is that the Dail must dispose of all the Estimates by the end of July.  This can cause acute pressure of financial business in the summer session, because the Finance Bill must be enacted by the beginning of August; there have been complaints that the time available for discussing that Bill is unduly restricted.  In practice, there is usually a great rush to clear the Estimates in time.  This is clearly an undesirable state of affairs and the position is, of course, aggravated if major non-financial legislation is before the House at the same time.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to improve that situation.  In the first place, it will no longer be necessary to introduce a Vote on Account in February or March.  This will mean that more parliamentary time can be devoted to the discussion of other business, including Estimates if so desired. Furthermore, by increasing the amount which may be issued from the Central Fund before the passing of Estimates by the Dail, the Bill will provide sufficient funds to enable the supply services to be maintained until about December.  Thus, the consideration of Estimates can be extended into the autumn session; the pressure of business in the summer session will be eased and more time will be available for discussion of the Estimates.  The Appropriation Bill will be introduced, as hitherto, after all the Estimates have been considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In lieu of the annual Vote on Account and Central Fund Bill, it is now proposed in section 2 of the present Bill that the Minister for Finance be authorised to issue from the Central <Col N="760" /> Fund, in any year from 1966/67 onwards, an amount not exceeding four-fifths of the amount appropriated for each particular service in the preceding financial year.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for the adjustment of this four-fifths provision according as individual Estimates are passed by the Dail.  Thus, if the amount of an Estimate exceeds four-fifths of the amount appropriated for the same service in the preceding year, the amount authorised to be issued under section 2 of the Bill will be increased by the amount of the excess when the particular Estimate is passed by the Dail.  Similarly, if an Estimate is less than four-fifths of the previous year's appropriation, the issues authorised under section 2 will be reduced.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to cover issues in respect of new services which were not included in the Appropriation Act of the preceding year, together with existing services for which the Estimates were passed by the Dail before the commencement of the financial year to which they relate. These latter would be Estimates which were passed by the Dail in accordance with the revised procedure introduced in 1964, whereby selected Estimates may be taken before the Estimates Volume is published.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that, in March of each year, the Minister for Finance will lay before the Dail a statement of the amounts he will be authorised to issue in the following financial year under Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill.  This statement will be in substitution for the present Vote on Account White Paper.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives the Minister the borrowing powers hitherto granted each year in the annual Central Fund Act.  Section 7 provides that, for the purpose of determining the amount the Minister is authorised to borrow under any Act, amounts which have been repaid within 12 months after the date on which they were borrowed shall be disregarded.  The need for this arises from the fact that some short-term borrowing takes the form of Exchequer Bills which are repaid and renewed every three months.  At present such <Col N="761" /> borrowings are regarded as cumulative and the statutory limit could be reached merely because they are renewed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to facilitate the Dail in dealing with financial business. It will not involve any lessening of Parliamentary control over public expenditure.  Dail approval of Estimates will still be required under section 2 of the Bill which stipulates that issues are subject to the proviso that, during the year, the Minister for Finance will ask Dail Eireann to grant supply for that service in respect of the year.  Furthermore, the Bill will preserve the existing rule that expenditure on a new service cannot be incurred until the Dail has approved that service.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House as a worthwhile attempt to secure more informed and effective discussion of Government financial policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in recommending this Bill to the House, has stated that it will not involve any lessening of Parliamentary control over public expenditure.  It must be our concern to be satisfied fully in that regard.  It is of the utmost importance that the procedure, with regard to the examination and control of public expenditure, which often appears cumbersome and devious, should not in the interests of speed lead to a relaxing of control. I am satisfied that the Minister can justly say that what is proposed in this Bill will not involve any lessening of the necessary control this House should exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not underline the point, but I should like to make it, that Deputies will, as a result of recent experience, appreciate that at times under our existing procedure we may create a situation in which time does not permit of the exercise of proper control in relation to expenditure and financial matters generally. Only in this financial year we had for discussion here a Finance Bill containing many provisions of such a nature as to arouse justified anxiety amongst many Deputies.  The House was put in the position, however, that the details of the Bill had at times to be discussed <Col N="762" /> against the clock.  I know that to some extent procedures were complicated this year by the dissolution of the last Dail and the election of this one, but, even so, it can happen under existing procedures that towards the end of the summer session, time may run out and it may not be possible to discuss properly important legislative provisions. For that reason, I believe there is need for reform in our procedures and I think the proposal in this Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It follows from what the Minister has said&mdash;I should like to clarify it&mdash;that under the new procedure envisaged the Minister will, before the end of March in each year, indicate the existing services in respect of which he proposes money will be supplied and that, in effect, will take the place to some extent of the list hitherto contained in the Vote on Account.  Is it envisaged that at the same time the Minister will indicate the nature of new services or will that await a later stage in the new financial year? Will it be possible under the new procedure for this House fully to debate general Government policy?  I want to ensure that that right will be in no way restricted.  It does not appear that it will but it does seem that complications may arise in the other House in this regard.</P>
    <P>At the moment in Seanad Éireann there is only one annual debate in which general Government policy can be discussed, that is, the debate on the Central Fund Bill.  The debates on the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill in the Seanad are confined purely to taxation matters and it does appear that the Seanad may now be deprived of an opportunity of having a general review of Government policy.  It is of the utmost importance if Parliament is to function properly, that the right of members of Parliament to review Government policy should not be in any way restricted.  I am satisfied that what is proposed here is necessary and that it will not impinge on the rights of Deputies to control and investigate Government policy but it does appear as if some steps may have to be taken in relation to the procedure proposed in this Bill as it applies to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party approves of the proposals contained in this Bill.  We have felt that the discussions on many matters relating to finance seem to be duplicated and triplicated in the present procedure. We have had the Vote on Account, the Budget and the Finance Bill. These have given occasion for the debates on general Government policy but Parties in opposition have also sought adjournment debates on which to debate Government policy.  These have taken place at the end of the autumn session and the end of the summer session.</P>
      <P>It has been true that when we come to speak to the Vote on Account in March or February, we have not had full information before us and it might be a good thing for the House if the main financial debate of the year were to take place on the Budget.  We would then be considering not alone Estimates and expenditure but also the national income, as well as the methods by which we were going to finance our expenditure.  As far as we of the Labour Party are concerned, we believe that all this duplication and triplication should be done away with and that we should have one main debate on the Budget proposals.  At that time all the facts are known and, apart from the information given by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, we also have that very valuable document &ldquo;Pre-Budget Statistics&rdquo;.  All that information is lacking in February or March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were concerned, when we first saw the proposal, that four-fifths of the preceding year's appropriation should be allowed to the Minister for the services.  We thought this was a pretty big sum.  It is indeed a pretty big sum but we decided that if this measure is to be effective, it has to be four-fifths.  One-third would take us to July but, bearing in mind that August, September and a good part of October are the recess months, it would have to be four-fifths to bring us up to December.  If we are to postpone Estimates to the autumn session the time allotted would probably have to be a week or two in October and <Col N="764" /> possibly all of November, so that four-fifths of the appropriation is a good precautionary amount.</P>
    <P>In years gone by when we came to July and August, we found that a good many important Estimates had not been debated.  The practice adopted was that the Estimate was passed on the Minister concerned giving an undertaking to bring in a token Estimate for £10 or so in the autumn. In that way time was taken up discussing Estimates in the autumn session which should have been devoted to legislation and the practice of deferring discussion on these Estimates was not effective.  The Government must take a lot of responsibility for the need for this change in the procedure.  In May, June and July, the pressure by the Government to get legislation through is very heavy and now we find that we have time to spare.  The Government have tried on occasion to browbeat the Opposition into passing legislation in a rapid fashion in order to enable the House to recess late in July or early in August.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that in recent years the Government have not planned their programme of legislation wisely. There should be some effort by them to introduce legislative measures early in the year so that there will be no need to try to stampede the House into passing these measures in June, July and August.  We agree with these proposals but we trust that as far as a programme of legislation is concerned, the Government will give ample time for its discussion and see that time is not wasted as it is being wasted at the moment.  We sat here yesterday; we seem to be stringing out the business today; and we are not sitting tomorrow. Next week we have a Church holiday and it is not our practice to sit on Church holidays but if we have a lot of business to do, I could see no objection to sitting on Thursday and Friday of next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one criticism to make, that is, that the Minister seems to be unduly modest in this matter.  He states that he believes the Bill will not involve any lessening of Parliamentary control over Government <Col N="765" /> expenditure.  I feel with Deputy O'Higgins, particularly with the memory of the last Finance Bill in mind, that the Minister has met us fairly.  A number of us expressed ourselves in a particular way in regard to that Finance Bill and about the way it had to be dealt with by speaking against the clock.  I am absolutely convinced that the debate which will now be abolished gave a completely illusory feeling of Parliamentary control over financial expenditure.  In actual fact, it merely gave opportunities to backbenchers such as myself to air their own grievances, to ride their own hobby horses, and so on.  There really was no element of Parliamentary control on finance.</P>
      <P>I believe, therefore, that this new procedure will give us all a far better opportunity of examining Government financial policy.  Whether we avail of that or not is a matter which is our responsibility, but I think it would be wrong of me, having criticised the Minister in the past, not to acknowledge now that he has met us very fairly, and it is a good augury for the future.  If we use this new procedure properly and can debate the Finance Bill and all the Estimates quietly and with full deliberation, I think we can fulfil our Parliamentary responsibility far better.  I am absolutely convinced that not only will this not involve any lessening of Parliamentary control but it will increase it.  If that can be achieved, a very definite step forward will have been made, and I will be the first to welcome it.  I am very grateful to the Minister for meeting the criticisms that have been made and meeting them so quickly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth is simply rambling.  The history of this procedure is that the Taoiseach.  Deputy Lemass, Dr. Ryan, Deputy Brendan Corish. Deputy James Tully, Deputy Gerard Sweetman and myself met two years ago and said: &ldquo;Let us streamline our <Col N="766" /> procedure&rdquo;.  This Bill is the fruits of that discussion.  It gives us no more control over Government expenditure than we ever had.  All it does is streamline the procedure of the House.  If anything, it gives somewhat less control over Government expenditure than we have ever had but it leaves very adequate control.  If Deputy Booth does not understand that, he ought to take a little lesson with the Minister for Finance who will tell him what the Bill really means.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with very much more important problems.  This Bill deals with the Central Fund Act.  There is proceeding in this country at the present moment the most extraordinary conspiracy of silence to keep from our own people vital facts well known in every financial centre of the world but apparently utterly unrealised by the vast majority of Deputies here and by about 90 per cent of our people, that is, the magnitude and the gravity of the financial crisis in which this country is at present seized, with special reference to section 6 of this Bill which deals with the authority of the Minister for Finance to borrow.</P>

      <P>My observation relate strictly to the powers conferred upon the Minister under section 6 of this Bill, nothing else.  I do not propose to deal with any other aspect of the great financial crisis with which we are confronted, except in so far as it is related to the Minister for Finance's power to borrow.  I want to say in that <Col N="767" /> context that nobody seems to realise that all the storm signals on our economic frontiers are flying.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently, under the powers to borrow, issued a National Loan at the rate of 6¾ per cent, the highest rate of interest ever attached to an Irish National Loan. It was represented to our people that the loan was oversubscribed.  That loan has stood at a discount on the Irish Stock Exchange every day since it was quoted, although the Government stockbroker has authority to purchase £20,000 worth per diem in order to maintain its value.  That in itself would be a very grave situation but we are then blandly informed that the loan which the Minister for Finance, under the powers which we conferred upon him and which we confer upon him in this Bill, intends to raise abroad and which was to be issued in this month of December, has now been postponed.</P>

I now allege that the Government financial agents employed under the powers enjoyed by the Minister under section 6 of this Bill sent out their underwriting letters in respect of the Irish loan and that not one single one of them was returned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 has strict relevance to the powers to borrow and I have directed the attention of the House to certain grave facts arising therefrom.  Let no Deputy be under the illusion that we are maintaining the same control over public expenditure when we pass this Bill as we had before. There may be some silly billys in the House who do not understand that and I want them to realise that, with our eyes wide open, we did agree that there should be some streamlining of our financial procedure at the expense of a degree of control which this House hitherto enjoyed.  I think this relinquishing is wise for the sake of the greater expedition with which financial business can hereafter be effectively dealt with in this House. It is true, as Deputy Corish has said, that if the Government will regulate their business reasonably, the extra time made available by this procedure ought to enable legislation to be appropriately discussed and the financial business adequately examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also true, as Deputy Corish has <Col N="771" /> said, that if the Government will not produce the legislation which they want to have examined during the session between October and Christmas, we will run into precisely the same congestion at the end of the legislative year as we have always done before.  I do not want the Minister to feel that I have prevented him from replying at sufficient length.  I commend this measure not on the ground that it extends our control of finance but on the ground that while it knowingly reduces our direct control, it in fact leaves us adequate control and time whereby to expeditiously discharge the business of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to deal with his specific point and also with the other constructive observations made by other Members.  I wish to deny categorically that the fact that the National Loan recently floated may now be quoted at a discount is in any way unusual.  On the contrary, if the loan were being sold at a premium, we could be charged with having issued it at too high a price.  As far as the international loan is concerned&mdash;the borrowing of dollar bonds&mdash;the fact remains that there is extreme pressure on the dollar bond market at the present time.  A lot of international corporations put their eyes in that direction and many of the international corporations, because of the pressure on that dollar market, withdrew their applications or postponed them as we have done.  There is a clear feeling in the United States of America that the President and the Government are seeking to withdraw this dollar pool as a means of borrowing by people outside the United States and that was very much a contributory factor to this pressure on that market at the present time.  As I announced <Col N="772" /> last week, our application has been postponed on the advice of the American and British managers of the loan.</P>

      <P>I found that not only were we denying ourselves sufficient opportunity to debate Financial Resolutions and the provisions of the Finance Bill in full, but by reason of the pressure on our own time, we found ourselves adjourning after the Finance Bill and all the financial business had been completed in this House, but the Seanad in their discussion and examination of the Finance provisions had no opportunity to make recommendations. If they had an opportunity or could make recommendations, it would mean the Dáil would have had to be recalled, and that was impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was just one other point Deputy O'Higgins raised, that is, the possible denial to the Seanad of the opportunity of a debate on Government policy.  It is true they will be denied one opportunity by the withdrawal of the annual Central Fund Bill and its replacement by a permanent Central Fund Bill, but the Taoiseach, in outlining the terms of this Bill to the Leaders of the Opposition Parties, suggested that, in order to make this up, the scope of the debate on the Finance Bill in the Seanad might be widened to cover not only the tax policy and provisions of the Finance Bill but Government policy in general.  I think that may be acceptable to the Seanad, and <Col N="773" /> when I go to the Seanad, I shall suggest that, but I shall also listen to any observations the Seanad may have to make on this.</P>
    <P>Because of the general acceptance of the Bill, I do not think it necessary to say more, and whether the Bill is a creature of Deputy Dillon or of mine. I think it will make for better regulation of financial business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>In doing so, may I say that this is a simple, straightforward measure which, I hope, will be accepted by Deputies on all sides of the House. It sets out to make two important changes in the existing electoral law. The first change recommended is to ensure that where a mental patient is still resident in a mental hospital on the day of the election and where he or she is not considered by the resident medical superintendent to be safe to be discharged to go out and vote where he would normally vote if he were not a patient in such an institution, that person will not be allowed to vote.</P>
      <P>Prior to the enactment of the Electoral Act of 1963, this was the case.  It was the case for all long-stay patients in hospitals and homes and workhouses of all discriptions and the Joint Committee, when considering the electoral law and making recommendations, felt that was very harsh on people in county homes and workhouses and such institutions, and recommended that these people be deemed to be resident in the county homes and in these institutions because they felt that otherwise they were practically disfranchised and debarred from voting as in many cases they had no home and there was no question of discharging them home to what would have been regarded as their normal place of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though that recommendation is given in the explanatory memorandum, <Col N="774" /> I think, for the records of the House and for the purpose of further explanation, I should quote it.  It stated:</P>
    <P>A further amendment to section 1 of the Electoral Act, 1923, which the Joint Committee would like to see made is the deletion in subsection (9) of the words &ldquo;workhouse, poor house&rdquo;.  This should enable persons residents for long periods in county homes and similar institutions to be registered there.  The present wording of subsection (9) in effect disfranchises them and seems to be an anachronistic survival from old poor law attitudes.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Act, 1963, did not however restrict the residence provision to county homes but extended the recommendation to mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>This Bill accordingly in section 2 proposes to revert the law virtually to what it was prior to the Electoral Act, 1963, but modernised by the Joint Committee's recommendation.</P>
    <P>That is to include county homes and similar institutions but it deliberately left out patients in mental hospitals because obviously they saw the dangers and difficulties arising in these cases. They saw possible abuses which have since taken place.  We had the experience of a general election in 1963 and a considerable amount of experience was gained in that election which showed that the situation was taken advantage of, that undue influence was used on mental patients in certain cases. That situation was altogether unsatisfactory. We believe that if this Bill is accepted, the possibility of further such abuses arising will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>To indicate the type of thing that happened in the course of the election, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I should like to read a report or portion of the report of an election agent in a certain constituency to the returning officer.  It is not necessary either to name the institution or to identify the people concerned but I think it is useful because it illustrates the sort of malpractice that took place during that election and which, if we do <Col N="775" /> not change the law, is likely to occur again.  I am not making any attempt to pin this on any particular Party because I think all sides can be and are, perhaps, guilty.  It begins</P>
    <P>On the morning of the counting of the votes in the recent General Election I, as election agent for stated to you that I would confirm the formal complaint I then made regarding the manner in which the voting was conducted at hospital.  On the adjudication of doubtful ballots I pointed out to you two papers on which was written the word &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo; and on which were also two sets of initials.  These initials I identified as being those of personation agents whom I named.  I now accordingly write to state:</P>
    <P>(1)  There were two booths in what is, I understand, the Admission Wing of the hospital;</P>
    <P>(2)  I appointed one personation agent to act on my behalf for ...</P>
    <P>The names are given.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>(3)  When I called (as a result of information conveyed to me) to visit these booths, my Agent informed me that one booth was being conducted in a most irregular fashion;</P>
    <P>(4)  He stated that on entering the booth at one stage he found several patients voting openly.  He asked that the booths be cleared and that voters should mark their papers secretly;</P>
    <P>(5)  He further stated that the patients, without any regard for their wishes or mental condition, appeared to be herded in to vote. In many cases it appeared to him obvious that they were incapable of understanding what was going on.  He also stated that in his opinion many of the patients were voting in names, and presenting cards, other than their own.  This was obvious from the manner in which some nurses were canvassing the patients in the corridor, handing them cards and urging <Col N="776" /> them to vote for certain candidates;</P>
    <P>(6)  I remained in the vicinity of the booth for some time and found conditions to be exactly as described by my Agent;</P>
    <P>(7)  At one time I heard a nurse urging a patient (who to me appeared incapable of understanding what he was doing)&mdash;&ldquo;In you go, Daly, and vote.&rdquo;  This patient presented a card bearing a name other than Daly;</P>
    <P>(8) I concluded after about thirty minutes observation, that the patients were, in fact, being herded in to vote, in many cases unwillingly, and that the names of certain candidates were being drummed into their heads.</P>
    <P>From the foregoing you will see that there were grave abuses. Since the total vote in the hospital could have had no significant effect on the result of the then General Election I am now taking no further steps in this matter as Election Agent for the Election now past.  In view of the serious nature of the abuses, however, I must make the following objections now.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say he is objecting to any booth being located in such a hospital for future elections and to any member of the staff of the hospital being appointed as presiding officer or poll clerk in any booth where the patients will vote.  He says these objections apply to all other institutions in the county and will be renewed at the appropriate time and pursued as far as possible.  The report ends:</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to state that I feel sure neither you, Sir, nor your assistant were aware of these abuses.  As election agent on many occasions I have always received the utmost co-operation from your office and staff.  I look forward with confidence to that happy state of affairs continuing.</P>
    <P>I read that report to indicate that, arising out of the change in the laws <Col N="777" /> in 1963, certain abuses have occurred and have been facilitated by that change.  I believe it is altogether wrong that these unfortunate mental patients should be subject to such abuse.  It is quite easy to see how this can arise, more especially when a booth is set up in the institution and when people attached to the institution are employed in it, either as presiding officers or polling clerks, with the various members of the staff around to induce patients to vote one way or another. That pressure could be in favour of any Party; it need not necessarily be in favour of one Party or another.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that people in that mental state can be induced to vote in certain ways and that it is altogether wrong that the law should facilitate that type of abuse.  We are simply asking that in future, notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act, where on the qualifying date a person is a patient in any institution for persons suffering from mental disability, such person shall be deemed for the purposes of the Principal Act to be resident in the place where he would have been residing but for his having been such a patient.</P>
    <P>If we revert to that situation then, if a patient is considered by the doctor to be well enough to be discharged and to be safe enough to be allowed home to his known place of residence, a vote will be waiting for him.  But, if he is not well enough and if the doctor is not prepared to take the responsibility for that type of discharge, that patient will not be allowed to vote.  It will be agreed by everybody in the House that such a person should not be allowed to vote.  Such persons are not allowed to make their wills; or, if they do, the will does not stand in law.  If a person is not capable of making a will, surely we should not have the law in such a way that he can vote?</P>
    <P>We all know the seriousness of this and the narrow margins by which seats have been won in certain parts of the country.  Nobody wants this type of abuse to continue and I would very strongly recommend the acceptance of this recommendation to the <Col N="778" /> House.  I believe the Minister will see the good sense of it and have the position rectified.</P>
    <P>The other part of the Bill relates to commercial travellers.  It seeks to provide that the postal vote be extended to include commercial travellers.  In the course of a number of elections, I have come across many people who are commercial travellers who hold that they are virtually disfranchised because of the fact that elections normally take place in the middle of the week when commercial travellers are away from the place in which they are registered as voters so it is virtually impossible for them to vote.  In some cases they cannot vote and in other cases it would involve them in a lot of expense and an immense amount of inconvenience to come back from perhaps the furthest point in the country to vote.</P>
    <P>I understand at present there are in all about 4,000 commercial travellers. They are an intelligent body of people in touch with what is happening in the country.  They are all the time on the move around the country and they should know what the people's needs are.  Therefore, it is very desirable that they should vote.  No Party will have a monopoly of their votes.  We would all agree it is extremely desirable that they should be facilitated and should not be, as they are at present, practically disfranchised.</P>
    <P>I know there is again a danger of abuse and a certain difficulty about ensuring that this postal vote is properly used.  For this purpose we have tried to indicate that certain safeguards could be taken.  There is a registered body of commercial travellers and I think the danger could be overcome by that body vouching for these people in advance.  I think also pretty heavy penalties could be included in the legislation to ensure that, if commercial travellers get this vote, they would not in any way abuse the situation.  We all try very hard to get the maximum number of people out to vote.  It is very desirable that we should have the maximum number voting.  I have come across irate commercial travellers who say that no <Col N="779" /> effort has been made to facilitate them in the matter of voting.  The postal vote is available for the Defence Forces and the Garda.  The commercial travellers represent a significant number of intelligent persons.  I am sure many Deputies will agree with me that they also should be allowed to use the postal vote, if they are able to satisfy the registration authority that they are commercial travellers who by reason of the duties of their employment, would be unlikely to be able to vote in person at an election.</P>
    <P>It is possible to safeguard the situation due to the fact that commercial travellers are members of a registered body.  There are about 4,000 of them, which is a significant number.  I would recommend the Bill in its present form to the House and I hope that it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>All Deputies must have realised a long time ago that the recommendations made by the Commission were not intended to include patients of mental hospitals.  I do not know whether somebody decided to make a big change and to include everybody or whether it was decided that having regard to the persons elected, mental hospital patients were as sane as anybody else.  Whatever the idea was, the inclusion of mental hospital patients was a bad idea.  The inclusion of persons in county homes and permanently in hospital was a good idea.  A line must be drawn. Deputy Clinton's description of what happened in a constituency of which he had some experience would also be true of what occurred in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all heard the most horrifying tales of mental hospital patients being brought to booths and being forced to vote for certain people. There is a story that one bright person who was herding in these patients is supposed to have told them that they would be prosecuted if they voted for anybody except those persons indicated on a list which was handed to them. How true these stories are, I do not know.  I am quite sure that in regard to <Col N="780" /> most mental hospitals there was a certain degree of looseness where voting was concerned.  For that reason I believe that a mistake was made.  The method suggested may not be the way to remedy it but at least it attempts to high-light the fact that that mistake was made and that a change should now take place.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Clinton has said, that a person confined in a mental home would not be allowed to make a will.  Why such a person should be allowed to elect the rulers of the country is something that nobody can understand.</P>
    <P>With the local elections taking place next year, a very serious situation arises.  I am told that in one town in which there is a regional mental hospital with some 2,000 patients, there are nine urban councillors elected and that if those 2,000 patients are worked in a certain way and they vote in a certain way they can elect six of the nine representatives for the urban council.  That can happen in that town and I am sure in many other towns. For that reason there is a grave danger in this business being allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are debarred from doing that&mdash;that is one of the extraordinary things&mdash;but they can elect men twice as mad as they are from outside.  The only trouble about it is that if we decide to change the law there are certain people who will say that we are taking a mean advantage of these people, that they should be allowed to vote.  I am prepared to take a chance on that.  I am offering a personal opinion which is, that patients in a mental hospital should not be allowed to vote.</P>
      <P>As to the suggestion that Deputy Clinton has made, that they might be allowed to vote if they could come home, that is of no use because very few people will bother to bring these patients a long journey for the purpose of voting because they could not be relied on to vote in a certain way. I would suggest that such patients should be debarred from voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> In my view, the Bill does not go far enough.  An effort should be made to extend the franchise by postal vote to patients in ordinary hospitals.  I suppose that is the only way in which it could be done.  We have dealt already with patients who are permanently or semi-permanently in hospital but what about the thousands of persons who are in hospital on the occasion of every election?  They are in hospital only for a short period. There may be persons ill at home. Unless they live beside a polling booth and are convalescent, they are unable to vote.  If we were really serious about getting as many as possible of the persons entitled to vote to exercise the franchise, we would make every effort to facilitate them.  The postal vote seems to be the only practicable suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton has referred to commercial travellers.  Why stop at commercial travellers?  What about long-distance lorry drivers, men working away from home, bus drivers, bus conductors, who may be away all day and unable to vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not include emigrants.  They have a right to vote in the country in which they are resident.  If we are to tackle this problem, everybody should be considered. We should not stop at commercial travellers and say that they are a certain class, that they are intelligent and that they should vote. Ordinary working people are intelligent and should have the same facilities extended to them.  We should be able to devise a scheme which will facilitate persons who are not able to get home in order to vote at their normal polling stations.  Such persons would be far more entitled to vote than patients in a mental hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the matter was raised with the Minister on a previous occasion, he said that he did not deliberately include mental hospital patients, that, in fact, he was carrying out the wishes of the Commission.  I have been trying to check and, as far as I can find out, it was obvious, or fairly obvious, that <Col N="782" /> mental hospital patients were not supposed to be included.  The Minister or his advisers read into the report that they were.  It should have been pretty obvious to everybody from the complaints that we have heard that including them was a mistake.  There may be quite a number of patients in a mental hospital who are quite sane.  Most mental hospital patients claim that they are saner than those who go to visit them.  While it might be possible to differentiate between those who are only mildly mentally ill and sufficiently sound in mind to vote and those who are seriously ill and who should not be allowed to vote, I should prefer to err on the side of debarring all who are patients in mental hospitals, if the alternative is that all patients in such hospitals should be entitled to vote.  I would be prepared to support this Bill because, if it does nothing else, it highlights the problems and ensures some changes before the local elections take place next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

      <P>I have a particular interest in this Bill because I am on the executive committee of the Irish Commercial Travellers Federation and I am the honorary secretary of the Dublin Branch Committee of this trade union.  For a number of years, not only this trade union but other commercial traveller associations and organisations have been campaigning on behalf of their members who are disfranchised in many elections.  The problem could be solved in many ways.  Elections could be held at the weekend, on Fridays or Mondays.  The problem could also be solved by adopting the method suggested in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments against this section of the Bill will probably be those put forward by Deputy Tully in regard to lorry drivers and others who work out of town, musicians, embassy staffs, migratory workers and other large sections of our people who should equally be considered.  This Bill will not deal with the whole problem, should the Minister agree to accept it. I should like to point out here that the former Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Norton, campaigned on <Col N="783" /> behalf of commercial travellers.  He gave evidence at the commission which investigated the position.  It may be that the late Mr. Norton was influenced by the fact that commercial travellers have always been singled out as individuals of a higher social status than most other organised workers. For example, a commercial traveller is not entitled to a house under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, not because of his income or his need but because he is classified as a commercial traveller.  This rule was put into force by a committee presided over by the late Jim Larkin.</P>
    <P>While a case can be made for many other sections, the commercial traveller's case has been the most consistently in the news and the most consistently fought.  Because of that, whatever case may be made for other groups, there could be no harm in accepting this section of the Bill as a temporary expendient until such time as investigations into other groups are carried out.  If the section is adopted it is up to the individual traveller then to go to the returning officer and satisfy him that he is a <i>bona fide</i> commercial traveller, for whom, because of his business, or because of the time of the year at which the election is held, it is essential to be out of town at that time.  I would appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to this temporary measure.  It does not deal with all sections of the community but we have a definite proposal before us now.</P>
    <P>I know the feeling of many members of the various organisations representing commercial travellers; I belong to two or three of them myself.  They are very sore about this.  I know some of them who, in the last general election, travelled back to Dublin from as far away as Sligo, leaving at 6 o'clock in the evening, in the knowledge that the time had been extended to 10 o'clock and they would be able to exercise the franchise.  These were people working on a commission basis and any loss in their earnings was out of their own pockets but they were prepared to suffer that loss in order to <Col N="784" /> exercise the franchise.  These people are very interested in what goes on here in this House, particularly from the point of view of expanding the business and trade of the country.  I believe it is only right they should be given every facility to exercise the franchise.  A census was taken in Dublin North-East in the Commercial Travellers Federation and it was found that more than 40 commercial travellers were unable to exercise the franchise.  How serious that is will be appreciated when it is remembered that in the last general election the last seat was decided by four votes.</P>

      <P>While a good case can be made for commercial travellers, at the same time, if we analyse the figure of 4,000, we find that quite a number of these people live in Dublin and Cork and Galway.  One section of our citizens deprived altogether of voting is our sailors engaged in coastwise trade.  Surely we should extend the postal vote to these?  They have helped to build up our mercantile marine and we all know that there are greater numbers now engaged on Irish ships. These are deprived of the right to vote, unless their ship happens to be in port, and then it must be the port in which they are registered as voters.  Nothing can be done for deep-sea fishermen because they might be away before the election is called and may not return until long after it is over.  Even inshore fishermen could lose their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we deplore the fact that commercial travellers and others lose their votes, we must also admit that in <Col N="785" /> local elections the total poll may only be 25 per cent and surely there is something wrong in a system in which only one out of every four voters turns out to vote to return members to the local council.  In Dáil elections a 60 per cent poll is considered quite good.  In examining the problem in regard to commercial travellers, the Minister might also examine the whole question of our attitude to voting, to see if something can be done to encourage people to be as keen as commercial travellers and sailors to cast a vote.</P>

These are the members of the lighthouse service who keep watch along our coast in all kinds of weather.  They have told me that they have not had an opportunity over the last 20 years of casting their votes and the time has come when we must consider such people who, through no fault of their own, are not able to exercise their voting rights.  For a number of years they have been forgotten.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Clinton's approach has been more sympathetic than that of Deputy Tully, but I also think that if the Minister decides to make a change in the law he must exclude all mental patients.  I would like to disabuse both Deputies with regard to the legal position of a person who is in a mental hospital.  Such a person can make a valid will and can execute a valid legal document.  If the resident medical superintendent is satisfied that the person concerned understands the nature and contents of any document, he can so certify and the person can execute the document. In practice, these documents are rarely challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputies realise that quite a large number of patients in mental hospitals are there as voluntary patients, perhaps because conditions in their homes are not favourable.  The <Col N="786" /> reason I think the Minister must do one thing or the other is this that if he were to accept Deputy Clinton's suggestion, it would mean that some patients would be aware that certain other patients were allowed to vote while they themselves were not allowed to vote, and the feeling of such a patient would be: &ldquo;I am not as good as I thought I was.  He is better than I am.&rdquo;  For that reason I think the Minister, if he accepts the idea of the Bill in principle, should disallow all patients in institutions such as this.</P>
    <P>Where commercial travellers are concerned, if a suitable scheme can be worked out to enable them to vote, it would be desirable that it should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of mental hospital patients voting, I still say that as far as I am concerned the intention of the authors of the Electoral Practices Report was that they should have votes.  Without quoting from the document, I can say that the reason for that decision was that mental disability should not be treated in any different manner from physical disability. I have a great deal of regard for the ability of mental hospital patients to know what they are doing, far more than I have for the ability of a whole lot of people who are not mental hospital patients.</P>
      <P>The case made by Deputy Clinton is based on reports of one election occurrence.  There may be something in this, but, on the other hand, you get a number of electoral acts done by people who are no better than the people we are talking about.  We see a lot of things happening which we know are not provided for by the strict letter of the law, but, on the other hand, if you want to change these things, you could spend the whole of the time of this House between one election and another trying to iron out all the flaws.  No matter what the law is or how it is constituted, change and change it again, each time you remedy a flaw, the possibility is that someone will find another flaw which will then have to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> There is this talk about the abuses that are said to have arisen because of the mental hospital patients being brought out <i>en bloc</i> by nurses or attendants and told what to do in the polling booth.  Even if that did happen, I do not think it had any real significance. If it were only to deal with cases such as that, I would be inclined to leave the register as it is, because such things, even if they did happen, would be of little significance in a general election.  There is, however, a matter of importance, that is, with regard to the election of local authorities, particularly urban councils.  This has not been mentioned here but the extraordinary situation can arise in connection with the register for certain of our smaller urban councils, and some of them that are not so small, that the total number of mental patients and staffs, if they all voted, and voted <i>en bloc</i>, would be sufficient to gain complete control of a number of our urban councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite possible. This is a far more serious situation that could develop from the registration of mental patients.  Even if what has been said happened in the case of the last general election, it could not be of any real significance and would not be of any greater significance than other acts which have gone undetected. This question of the urban council elections is a different one. For this reason, I am inclined to the opinion that these people should not be registered as electors at the mental hospital.  If it is to be the case that we should disfranchise them altogether, I would not be in favour of that.  As far as the registration of our medical patients is concerned, I would be prepared to bring in a Bill to change the law so that they would not be registered in the mental hospital.  They would be registered at their home address, the last known address from which they came.  This is a right that these people should have.  If they are well enough on election day, even if they are still in a mental hospital, <Col N="788" /> if the RMS and his medical staff are satisfied that it is wise and in the best interests of the patients or is not against their best interests, they should be allowed out.  As for the others who are only in for a time, who may be voluntary or otherwise and are registered at home, they are in the same category as the rest of us and will be entitled to vote if they so wish.</P>
      <P>In regard to the extension of postal voting facilities to commercial travellers, while I am not against it, I cannot agree to it for the moment. If we are to extend the postal vote to commercial travellers, there are many other categories who would have to be taken into account, for instance, our migrants, the people who go from a county like my own for about half the year every year but who are on the register.  If the election comes about, although they are legally entitled to be on it&mdash;in case Deputy Tully is thinking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the way I might hope it would work but I am afraid it is not always so.  That is the situation at the moment.  These people are entitled to be considered very seriously, and many other categories that have not been mentioned.  Although some of these categories may be small in number, that does not take away their claim to get these voting rights.  However, the biggest single group would be migrants from the west but also from places like Ballyfermot, Cabra, Drimnagh and many other areas.  These are people who, although they may be on the register, may be away from home at the time of the election.  They will be back again after the election and then they will be gone again.  These people are entitled to be considered <Col N="789" /> and may feel in their exile that they have more right than anybody else to be considered as to who should be selected to represent the people, as to who should be elected to form a Government.</P>
      <P>For the reason that a quick decision cannot be made in this matter, I am not in favour of the terms of the motion to give postal voting facilities immediately to commercial travellers. At the same time, I undertake to give full consideration to the whole field of categories that might have to be brought in when consideration is being given to the granting of postal voting facilities such as are already enjoyed by the Garda and the Army.</P>

Then we could undertake to notify the registration officers so that they could get to work straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the postal voting aspect, I am neither for nor against it.  I am in sympathy with the principle but <Col N="790" /> there is so much more involved that I would be against it here and now so far as commercial travellers are concerned.  I know the interest they have in a very particular way as to the operations of this House and certainly in regard to business, industry, commerce, and so on.  There is probably no group that has a greater interest in these things.  As a result they have greater knowledge and, of course, their contact with the general public throughout the country in their daily business gives them an even greater insight into these things.  However, as I have said there are other groups that must be considered if any changes are to be made.  I am undertaking to the House that I shall consider the whole field of postal voting for other categories apart from the Garda and the Army. If we find we can do something and the Government decide it is desirable, I shall be coming to the House with such a proposal.  If we decide against it, some Deputy will ask a question and I shall tell him so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister has seen fit to accept section 2 of the Bill in regard to people in mental hospitals.  When the Electoral Bill was going through the House in 1963, it was one of the points made. I pointed out my recollection of the matter as a member of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law.  My experience there was that we were <Col N="791" /> concerned about taking away the stigma of the workhouse.  The Minister has told us it was our own fault that this provision went through.  I am glad the Minister has dealt with this matter now.  In regard to the registration of people in any electoral area, the returning officer has the obligation of keeping on the register people who would be regarded as being normally resident in a place and it was stated in the Joint Committee that a reasonable period during which to keep such people on the register would be 18 months.</P>
      <P>If it were a case of a person being temporarily a patient in a mental institution, in the circumstances his retention on the register was not denied him. He could be kept on the register for 18 months.  What we asked for in section 2 of this Bill, which the Minister is now accepting, is that people will not be denied the right to be retained on the register.  The section states that such persons shall be deemed for the purposes of the Principal Act to be resident in the place where they would have been residing, had they not been patients.  What we are concerned with is the long-term patient confined in a mental hospital.</P>
      <P>The other section proposes to confer a benefit on other people about whom we were concerned&mdash;a body of people easily identifiable.  I should like the Minister, between now and the time he introduces his short Bill, to consider this body of persons again.  Other bodies of people were mentioned, such as sailors who may be away for only a short time or lighthouse men marooned off the coast.  There is provision in existing legislation and in voting procedure at the present time whereby, if any difficulty is experienced, for instance, in islands off the coast, the returning officers have the option of taking a ballot in these areas prior to the election date.  The returning officers are not confined in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister and his advisers may be able to devise a system whereby the votes of an easily identifiable body of people might be recorded just before a general election, <Col N="792" /> if they are to be absent on election day and if they are a body clearly resident in a certain place and to which they return at weekends.  They are different from migrants, people who will be out of the State for periods, people who do not leave just for a day or two.  For instance, a commercial traveller may be away from home during the week and return each weekend.  He may find himself absent on a particular day. Could the Minister and his advisers devise a system whereby the votes of such people could be recorded?</P>
    <P>I should also direct the Minister's attention&mdash;I am sure he is already aware of it&mdash;to the fact that a returning officer is enabled under the Electoral Act to make provision for personnel they employ on the day of the poll who were absent from their ordinary polling districts.  A returning officer can ensure that such people will exercise the franchise in an area other than the place where they normally would poll.  If we can make arrangements like that, surely we should be able to make provision whereby returning officers will ensure that a body of people, whom the Minister says he has sympathy with, will not be permanently disfranchised.</P>
    <P>The step being taken now will be for the good of people in mental institutions and I trust the Minister will not delay his consideration of extending the franchise to these people in the shortest possible time.  This is the date on which the draft register became available and from now on the registering authorities will be preparing the register.  The 24th December is the last date on which claims may be made and 1st January is the date on which there can be objections. The work is generally completed by 14th January.  The Minister said he would bring in his short Bill on the next sitting day, which is the week after next.  Now that he has agreed in principle to accept the provision contained in section 2, I submit he should put the registering authorities under notice that the intention is that the new register being compiled will not include patients permanently domiciled in these institutions.</P>
    <P>We are grateful for the way the <Col N="793" /> Minister has met us in this matter and we hope that the consideration he may be able to give to it between now and the introduction of the short Bill will result in the devising of a system whereby recognition will be given to a clearly and easily identifiable body such as commercial travellers and the people Deputies Moore and Dowling mentioned.</P>

      <P>I fear I have taken the turn of a Fianna Fáil Deputy, but I shall be brief.  The Bill has been met in part by the Minister but it is a pity he did not go the whole way.  It is most important that we should realise that at election time the energies expended and the contrivances used to produce votes are many and quite extraordinary.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will be amazed to hear, for instance, that in a recent by-election in Galway, a Government supporter who was crippled arrived in a car and a good Fine Gael worker from Louth who was there insisted that the presiding officer should not give him his voting paper out through the window of the booth.  I think our man on this occasion was right but I want to show the lengths to which people will go. They need not necessarily be TD's, who probably are inclined to be more blasé and sophisticated about the matter but Party supporters are inclined to go to desperate lengths to catch a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree there is nothing like a few hatchetmen in the constituency.  It is doubtful whether, in the last election, which I think was the first one when unfortunate inmates of mental hospitals had votes, any person was unseated because of that.  It is true that persons of unsound mind and persons removed from the ordinary strenuous nature of life for a long period beforehand are easily impressed and more so by those who look after them, who minister to their daily needs and are good to them.  One may find that a Labour, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil supporter who is an attendant in a mental hospital or even a nurse or <Col N="794" /> doctor may exceed what is proper in trying to get votes for a Party.  This is the most natural thing in the world and therefore the Minister was right to make the provision in section 2.  That is a good step forward.</P>
      <P>He should now think about the point very properly raised by Deputy Jones in regard to the draft register which most of us have now lying on the back seats of our cars, as mine is: it was delivered to me this morning.  These people may be included on this register if we do not move in the matter.  I am sure the Minister will find a way out of that situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones and Deputy Clinton were quite right when they indicated that commercial travellers should have votes.  I am interested to know that Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore also spoke about this because, as well as having experience of a by-election in distant places like Galway, I also have experience of by-elections in Dublin.  I should not like to say that any Party is blameless in this regard but if personation goes on anywhere at present during an election, a city like Dublin or Cork is the place where it can be done.  The anonymity of neighbours makes it very difficult for a presiding officer, a personation agent, poll clerk or anybody to know everybody who comes to vote.  The size of the voting unit makes it impossible to find a personating agent who will know everybody coming to vote, whereas in a rural community the personating agent will know absolutely everybody who came to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 90 per cent of the cases, they would know how they will vote.  In places like Dublin, a commercial traveller's vote might be one that would be personated over a period of 20 or 30 years if certain people&mdash;the hatchetmen the Parliamentary Secretary refers to: and we confess to having our share of them&mdash; knew that the traveller was always away on a Wednesday, for instance, and elections are usually held on Wednesday.  It might be that this man had been personated for 20 or 30 years.  It is far better that the man <Col N="795" /> should vote himself by post.  The long period before the election gives an opportunity to decide who should be entitled to vote in this way and who should not.  It could be done during the claims period that we now have ahead as politicians in respect of the draft register which we have now got.</P>
      <P>I was talking over tea to Senator Rooney about the matter and we were discussing how this is done at race meetings.  He explained that when you went to the Curragh, if you had your badge, the number of the badge was ticked off.  That meant that you could not pass it out through the railing and get your pal in on the same badge.  I see no reason why the same principle could not be used in regard to postal votes of commercial travellers.  This vote could be put in at the end of the register just as Division 3 electors are put in and this vote could have numbers allotted and in this way the commercial traveller could vote at a general election and one could see to it that his vote was not personated.  He would have a right which at present he cannot have.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of whether or not it would change representation in this House by one seat, every citizen who pays rent, rates and taxes here, raises a family here and wants to exercise his suffrage should have an opportunity of doing so.  If his job precludes him from doing that, it is our duty to contrive a way out of the difficulty.  The suggestion that postal votes should be allowed to commercial travellers does not differ very much from the case of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda.  I shall now sit down as I note that Deputy Molloy has come in and I believe he has something to say on this matter.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief.  I congratulate the Minister on his attitude to this Bill.  On previous occasions I made representations here on behalf of commercial travellers and I am very pleased that the Minister is prepared to consider the question of extending the postal vote.  This is a proper step and I trust there will be no delay in forming the committee <Col N="796" /> referred to by the Minister.  I think all sides of the House will expect this committee to be set up fairly soon.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the draft register and I want to make one suggestion to the Minister.  It is that sufficient notice is not given to people of the opportunity they have to have a look at the draft register and have it changed, if they see fit.  Even though we do have franking on letters reminding people to see if they are on the register and notices in the post office, that is not sufficient.  An occasional mention is made of the matter on the radio.  The best medium for getting through to the public today is television. If there were a short, interesting reminder on television, it would be well worth while because it would get the message home to everybody.</P>

      <P>The public should be advised to look up the register and if a name should not appear, they should be informed exactly what the whole procedure is of checking and where they should go.  To be honest, I am not myself at the moment able to inform my constituents of the procedure to be followed in regard to the draft register, but I feel it my duty to acquaint myself with the facts.  I hope the Minister will accept the suggestion from me in good faith.  I feel television should be used to a great extent to inform the public how they can check if their name is on the register and, if it is not, exactly where they can go to have it on the register.</P>

      <P>The reason members of non-enclosed religious orders, particularly <Col N="797" /> nuns, do not vote is that they do not like to have to go to the polling station.  Provision might be made to give them the alternative of the postal vote.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I wish to express my pleasure at the reception the Minister has given to this Bill in respect of the mental hospital vote.  Nobody wishes to deprive anybody of a vote, but certainly there were unpleasant happenings as regards mental hospital voting in the last election. It must have appeared extraordinary to the ordinary layman outside. Here we have a group of people housed for their own protection and the protection of the public, people unable to look after their own affairs, who are given the right to exercise the franchise and vote people into local authorities and the national assembly sometimes without even knowing their own names.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is clearly impossible to expect the medical superintendent of a large institution to come out the morning before an election and certify that so-and-so is fit to vote and so-and-so is not.  He would probably tell you it was not in his terms of employment.</P>
      <P>A difficult question arises in regard to county homes.  I have witnessed activities during election times in county homes and it was not a pleasant experience.  A number of the people in county homes are really mental cases, senile dementeds.  A number of them are bed fast for a number of years.  You unleash a lot of electioneering enthusiasts into county homes and they simply over-run the place.  You have the three political Parties neck-and-neck trying to drag out of their beds people who have not been out of them for months.  You can almost hear their joints creak as they tear down the stairs to vote.  Too much enthusiasm is expended in getting people in county homes out to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> Even though bringing the facilities near to them may appear at first glance to be a good thing, on the other hand it begets a degree of enthusiasm which is sometimes a bit unwarranted.  If they had to go some little distance, the electioneering enthusiasts would be inclined to limit their activities to those who were ambulant or fairly rational, but when they have the polling booths at their elbows they tend to drag down anybody and everybody into them.  If they have to go only 100 yards, they can put some name into their heads and get them to vote. Many of them are senile dementeds quite unfit to exercise the franchise. How you can draw the line there I do not know, but I think a polling booth a reasonable distance from the county home might be a better idea than one placed at the bedside.  At least it would segregate the ambulant or near ambulant and reasonably rational.  That is the only suggestion I can make to the Minister as regards the county homes to produce some measure of restraint and control of the enthusiastic electioneering agents who go in there at election times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the Minister's acceptance of the portion of the Bill relating to patients resident in mental hospitals and such other institutions. I wonder if the position could be more readily met if, instead of the Minister having to bring in a short Bill, he could not accept an amendment to this Bill deleting all the words after section 2. He agrees that what he has accepted is exactly what is recommended in this Bill and represents no change.  That is down as far as the end of section 2.  In relation to section 3, he agrees it is desirable, and his only reason for not accepting at present that the postal vote be extended to commercial travellers is because he believes there is a much wider group of people he is convinced should be given similar facilities.  He has named a number of sections who, we all agree, are people who should be similarly facilitated. That occurred to me at the time we were drafting the Bill.  What prevented me from including any other group <Col N="799" /> was the difficulty of identifying them and of drafting a Bill that would prevent the kind of abuse that could occur if the group of people entitled to a postal vote was considerably widened, as, indeed, it could well be widened if the various categories we would all like to see having a vote were included.</P>
      <P>We all hope that, if the Minister is bringing in a Bill, he will consider bringing in commercial travellers because they are a clearly identifiable group and at a later date when the Minister or the officers of his Department or the Commission would have had time to consider at length other groups mentioned this evening, they could be added.  If the Minister insists on doing it by bringing in a short Bill, I would exhort him to consider including this group.  The situation could be dealt with more easily by deleting everything after section 2 of the Bill, by accepting an amendment along those lines.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question? The first thing is that I could meet the point of the urgency of this matter probably, since we are not meeting until 14th December, if the House agrees with the bones of what I have <Col N="800" /> said, by informing the registration officers, in anticipation of a Bill which we hope to bring in on December 14th. I have the Bill ready.  The deletion of the words as suggested by Deputy Clinton would not serve the purpose he would wish to serve.  According to my advice on the drafting of the Bill, it would in some queer way&mdash;I do not know how&mdash;have the effect of disfranchising this group, while remedying the situation about the register; in fact, they would not be there at all.  I have the Bill and, if the House will agree, I could inform the registration officers by circular of our intention to enact such a Bill and do that forthwith rather than wait until 14th December.</P>
