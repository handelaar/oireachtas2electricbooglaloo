      <P>I have dealt with the question of representation of agriculture on the National Industrial Economic Council on a number of previous occasions, the most recent of which was my speech on 10th November last in reply to the Dáil debate on the economic situation.  The Government recognise the arguments in favour of this development and the way has been left open for it from the beginning. Certain practical difficulties of arranging adequate farming representation within a reasonable number of members would, of course, arise but these are not insuperable.  If farming interests are prepared to accept membership, the Government will be prepared to arrange for appropriate changes in the constitution of the Council.</P>

      <P>The Constitution was drafted by civil servants (including legal officers) working under the instructions and the close direction of the then President of the Executive Council, who acted in consultation with his Ministerial colleagues.  In the preparation of the Irish text of <Col N="803" /> the Constitution&mdash;which is, of course, the fundamental text&mdash;the President had the benefit of the services and advice of a number of eminent scholars of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to the Civil Service tradition of anonymity to disclose the names of the civil servants who were engaged on the drafting work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the Taoiseach and Ministers have been going about the country making speeches while all that time the west is bleeding to death and whole families, as I have stated in the question, <Col N="805" /> are clearing out and going across to England, and nothing is being done about it.</P>

As I have said, it would take me a very long time to indicate to the Deputy all the measures that have been implemented by the present Government to help the west.  We are going on with those measures and more will be thought of in due time.  The Deputy can be assured that we are fully alive to the needs of the west.</P>

On the assumption that 1 cwt of eviscerated <Col N="808" /> turkey represents 11 birds it is estimated that exports of eviscerated turkeys, frozen or not, in the period January-November 1965 totalled approximately 847, all of which were consigned to Sweden.  Similar exports in the same period of 1964 are estimated at 7,095 birds.  The numbers of such turkeys exported this year constitute 0.17 per cent of the numbers of turkeys under six months of age returned at the June 1965 Agricultural Statistics Enumeration.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by CIE that the initial supply of 200 of these scrolls was printed in England for the reason that, hitherto, Irish manufacturers had not undertaken the manufacture of scrolls. As a result, however, of a recent approach by CIE to the Irish Printing Federation, a number of Irish concerns are now interesting themselves <Col N="813" /> in the work and CIE are in negotiation with them.</P>
    <P>The remaining questions asked by Deputy Lindsay are matters of day to day administration of CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of these questions and remembering the Minister's words in reply to Question No. 4 that Irish was the fundamental language of the Constitution, may I inquire did CIE ask for tenders for these scrolls or did they seek to place a contract in England immediately for the publication of scrolls in Irish for their company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always the custom of State companies to try to secure the manufacture of the material and equipment they use in this country. It is a fact that on occasions they received no tenders from Irish manufacturers. CIE, in accordance with Government policy, deliberately went out to try to interest manufacturers in the printing of these scrolls.  They approached the whole of the Printing Federation in order to find out whether any of their members were prepared to manufacture the scrolls.  Therefore, CIE have discharged their duty, in my opinion, so far as the Buy Irish campaign is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>So far as the State companies over which I have supervision are concerned, where there was a problem of whether or not the Irish manufacturer could take the order, the total value of the orders given to foreign manufacturers, as against Irish manufacturers, is extremely small.  For example, about 80 per cent of the material purchased by the ESB is of Irish manufacture and, from my knowledge, CIE have gone as far as they can to secure Irish-manufactured materials and equipment.  There are these borderline fringe cases where a non-Irish manufacturer is able to provide the material.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the clerical officer grade by means of open competition was suspended after the 1960 competition.  Since that time appointments to the grade have been made through competitions confined to clerk-typists and Post Office clerks as a result of an arrangement recommended by the General Council under the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  Almost four-fifths of clerical officers appointed in this way were women.  Between 1st January 1958 and 1st January 1965 the number of men clerical officers fell by 527 to 721.  To prevent the situation from getting unduly out of balance and to meet the Departments' representations, it was decided, also on the recommendation of the General Council, to hold a competition confined to male candidates.</P>
      <P>As already announced by the Civil Service Commissioners, it is proposed to hold a competition, open to school leavers of both sexes, for the clerical officer grade in 1966.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the failure by the Department to issue loans from the Local Loans Fund has created a very embarrassing situation for a number of people who are building their own houses? Would the Minister not try to expedite matters so as to prevent people being taken to court for payment of houses which have been built and which they cannot pay for, unless they get the money from the Local Loans Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the total issued from the Local Loans Fund from 1st April to 30th November, 1965 amounted to £12.56 million, as compared with £8.55 million, in the same period last year. I understand also that the issue of these loans which has not yet been approved by the Minister for Finance will be arranged in the not very distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that comparison with the money paid last year is very cold comfort for those who are looking for money this year? In my local authority, we have bespoken, or promised, £94,500 to housebuilders and people who are building their own houses and we applied for a £100,000 loan several months ago. Surely in ordinary common decency the Department should make money available to local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each usher in Leinster House is issued with an overcoat as part of his uniform. Apart from this, a supply of five loose-fitting waterproof coats is kept for use by ushers on outdoor duty in wet weather. The supply of <Col N="831" /> waterproof coats is arranged so that there is a satisfactorily fitting coat available for each usher on outdoor duty. It is standard practice that waterproof clothing is not issued on a personal basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if he considers that it is in keeping with the dignity of Parliament that ushers who have to go out in the rain have to collect someone else's overcoat which has already been worn on duty, and is probably wet on wet days, when they are sent out on duty? Would the Minister not consider, in view of the small cost involved, that each one of the ushers should be issued with a raincoat which would fit him properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This practice has been found satisfactory in the past. It amounts to a question of whether the pool of waterproof coats is sufficient in relation to the number of ushers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scandalous. There are five between the lot of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;making use of the waterproof coats. As the Deputy knows, each usher is issued with a heavy outdoor coat, not a waterproof coat, which is used by him personally. This is a question of what the total pool of waterproof coats is in relation to the number of ushers who have to go on outside duty. Recently there has been an increase in the number of ushers involved in this duty because of changes in the numbers required at the gates. If the total pool is not sufficient, that matter could be discussed. It is not proposed to award every single usher with a waterproof coat, and this has long been the tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the fact that the ushers are human beings and are entitled to have decent overcoats and decent waterproof coats should be taken into consideration? Does the Minister think it is in keeping with modern hygienic practice to have a waterproof coat worn by more than one usher? I am surprised that the trade unions are not doing something <Col N="832" /> about this. Surely in every job the wearing of a waterproof coat by two different people on the one day is considered unhygienic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 to 52 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>The National Institute for Physical Planning and Construction Research has just completed, with the assistance of the United Nations and advisory committees, one year of effective operation. In that year it has carried out a large volume of urgent research and informational work of the highest quality. The value of its achievements has been commended throughout the year by informed professional and lay opinion alike.</P>
      <P>The Institute has received very generous and able assistance from the United Nations. I, as the Minister responsible for establishing it, am entirely satisfied with the work it is accomplishing.</P>
      <P>There are no policy differences, incompatibilities or failure to fulfil contract terms in the relations between, on the one hand, the Irish Government and the Institute and, on the other, the United Nations.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied as to the competence and ability of the Board of Directors of the Institute, who represent the several Ministers concerned with the work of the Institute, to manage its affairs. The members of the Board are senior civil servants with wide experience in the fields of housing, building, planning, transport and economic development and have available to advise them fully qualified technical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government and local public bodies are entirely responsible for physical planning, roads construction and road <Col N="836" /> traffic and public funds are responsible for almost 60 per cent of total investment in building and construction. It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the research connected with these programmes be under the general management of civil servants representing the several Ministers concerned and responsible to me as the Minister with the main responsibilities in these fields. I keep myself fully informed about the Institute's activities and projects and I have no intention of holding a public inquiry into it.</P>

In addition, a loan application for £500,000 for house purchase loans was received on the same day. The normal period for processing a loan is from two to four months. In this case because of the size of the loan applied for the period could reasonably be expected to be longer.

      <P>Appointments to professional posts in the local authority service are made by local authorities on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and I have no function in these appointments. I am aware that the Commissioners recently recommended a permanent architect grade II employed by Dún Laoghaire Corporation for appointment to a permanent post of architect grade I under Dublin Corporation. The question of his taking up duty there is a matter between the candidate and Dublin <Col N="854" /> Corporation. The appointment of a person to fill the architect grade II vacancy is a matter entirely for the Dún Laoghaire Corporation, subject to the same statutory provisions which apply to the architect grade I appointment being made by Dublin Corporation. The retention by Dún Laoghaire Corporation of the architect grade II in question as an architect grade I could not be sanctioned. I understand that the Local Appointments Commissioners recently recommended a person for appointment to a vacant office of architect grade I under Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of social insurance established by the Social Welfare Acts, males employed as domestic servants, whether in hotels or elsewhere, are insured for all benefits including unemployment benefit. As regards female domestic servants, the position is that the scheme distinguishes between those who are engaged in private service and those who are employed otherwise, for example, in hotels and institutions. The latter, as in the case of males, are insured for all benefits including unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Women employed in private domestic service, however, are not insured for unemployment benefit and they pay a reduced rate of contribution. The question of extending insurance for unemployment benefit to these women is under examination in my Department at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it comes to that at all. The position was that as far as the Department of External Affairs were concerned, they were not satisfied that the title and the text of the resolution were appropriate to each other and in these circumstances they instructed the Irish delegation to abstain. The delegates from Britain, Australia, the United States voted against it. Canada, South American and other countries abstained for a similar reason. I do not accept the implication in the Deputy's supplementary. As far as I know, not all the workers' delegations at the conference were satisfied either.</P>

      <P>While there is no doubt that some shoppers would wish to have fuller information about the contents of packaged goods, I am not aware of any significant abuses in this connection. The general impression is that members of the public are, by and large, well able to look after themselves in matters relating to weights and measures.

In general, jurors in criminal cases are provided with a hot mid-day meal in a hotel or restaurant, provided that the judge approves of the jury leaving the courthouse.

      <P>While the rerouting of traffic in this area was made necessary by the fact that the Dublin Corporation was undertaking extensive road reconstruction work on the North Quays, the specific arrangements made were designed to tie-in with the existing one-way system in the central city area, including part of the North and South Quays, so that, if the new arrangements worked satisfactorily, they could be retained permanently.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the widespread dissatisfaction in North Mayo due to the centralisation of specialist hospital services in Castlebar; and that many medical and nursing people feel that there is an urgent need to provide similar specialist services at Ballina, with a view to facilitating patients in North Mayo and parts of Sligo within a reasonable distance of this centre; and what action he proposes to take to provide such specialist services at Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that representations have been made to duplicate the specialist hospital services in County Mayo by the provision of surgical and other specialist facilities at Ballina District Hospital. A modern specialist hospital is a complex and most expensive organisation and it would be uneconomic to attempt to provide two such organisations in the county.</P>
      <P>My Department is, however, at present in correspondence with Mayo County Council about appropriate improvements in the facilities at Ballina District Hospital. These involve the building of a new female medical ward which would enable the maternity accommodation at the hospital to be improved and extended. The possibility of providing extra beds for children is also being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the long run if the services I suggest were provided a saving would be effected in my opinion and in the opinion of many medical and surgical people for that matter? At the moment, patients have to be transported from such places as Ballycastle, Ballycroy <Col N="889" /> and other long distances to Castlebar, at great hardship and inconvenience to the people concerned. These people could be accommodated and minor operations, at least, could be carried out in Ballina with consequent saving on transport and other services as well.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, may I inquire whether the Minister is aware that quite a number of people in Sligo could avail of these services if they were reorganised? Would the Minister take the necessary steps to have the whole position examined in relation to Sligo and Mayo so as to, perhaps, embrace parts of the Sligo area as well and have these people treated in the Ballina District Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of Ballina District Hospital into a hospital providing these specialised services is, as I said in reply to the Deputy's question, a very costly undertaking. Further, it would be of doubtful value to patients. I should like to point out that the services would be split between two hospitals 24 miles apart and could not develop in a coordinated manner. The existence of two separate surgical units at Castlebar and Ballina would mean that each would be smaller than one centralised unit. Such small units are unattractive to both consultative and resident medical staff, and staffing difficulties could be expected.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the improvements we expect to make in Ballina but I would remind the Deputy that there is provision whereby a specialist employed at the county hospital in Ballina is available, if required, to help in the treatment of patients at Ballina as well as other district hospitals in the county. When a permanent physician and gynaecologist is appointed, it is proposed to take up with the Health Authority the feasibility of having clinics conducted at Ballina Hospital by the consultant from Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not today or yesterday I received this complaint about the dissatisfaction of the Ballina people, the suggestion that they were not getting a fair crack of the whip and that improvements in these services were <Col N="890" /> being concentrated in Castlebar.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable the bringing into operation of the Succession Act to be synchronised with the commencement of the Registration of Title Act, 1964. In view of the fact that the machinery of land registration is tied up with the administration of the Succession Act I think this is a more desirable proposal. For that reason we suggest the arrangement proposed in the amendment, which will enable both Acts to be brought into operation on the same day.</P>

It is an improvement but as I read section 51 as it stood it seemed to me to be quite clear that the protection was only in the case of property transferred to the beneficiaries. This amendment does make it quite clear that purchasers will be protected against claims by creditors and against claims by any person entitled to a share in the estate.

      <P>&ldquo;Subsection (3) of section 61&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 substitutes a new subsection for subsection (3) of section 61 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964. The purpose of the new subsection is to make it clear that a will is no longer a document of title to registered lands and that the Registrar of Titles has no responsibility for examining the will of a deceased owner in order to satisfy himself that its terms are being properly interpreted and implemented. This was the whole purpose of the relevant subsection of the Act of 1964, but it has been represented to me that the subsection as it stood could be interpreted as applying only where a person is to be registered as owner in succession to a deceased registered full owner and that it does not extend to the case where a remainderman applies to be registered on the determination of the <Col N="920" /> estate of a registered limited owner. It is really with a view to freeing the Registrar of Titles from the responsibility of looking into the will of a deceased person, by in effect declaring that a will is no longer a document of title.</P>

      <P>My views at the time were that the initial period should be six months and that there should be a provision for telescoping that in case of urgency where the personal representative gave notice and that there should likewise be discretion to the court to extend. I am glad that the Seanad have persuaded the Minister at least to accept in principle that notice should be given and that in the event of notice being given the time allowed will be reduced from the twelve months to six months. I do not think I can emphasise too strongly to the Minister the practical importance of this. I do not think it goes the whole way to meet the practical difficulties that will be involved in administration of estates when this Bill goes through but it certainly goes some way. The Minister will appreciate that the practical effect of this Bill on administration of estates may very well be that no estate can be distributed until the period of twelve months or in case notice is served six months, is up. The administration of the estate, willy nilly, must be hung up for that period because otherwise a claim from a dependant, one of the children or someone like that, may come along and the personal representative may find himself in a difficulty. It was to meet that situation in cases of urgency that I felt there should be machinery in the Bill in urgent cases to reduce the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in the course of the discussions here that these are not theoretical cases. They are cases of practical importance that any practising lawyer meets in the course of his business. I think it is a good thing that at least this advance has been <Col N="922" /> made but my own view is that it does not go far enough. However, for what it is worth, I am certainly glad it is there.</P>

In the course of the debate in the Seanad a very practical point of view was put as to the widow remaining on in the family home who might find herself in the position that the value of the house and domestic chattels might be in <Col N="923" /> excess of her legal right share. She could find herself being threatened with eviction by a beneficiary who was entitled to the balance of the estate. The effect of the two amendments here is that, where the share of the spouse would not be sufficient to enable appropriation of the house and chattels to be required in the ordinary way, an application could be made to the court, which would have discretion in chambers to look into the situation and provide that the widow would take the property either subject to the payment of a specified sum or without any payment whatever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Before section 65, in Part V, the following new section inserted:</P>
    <P>(1) Where administration of an estate is granted for the use or benefit of the State (whether to the Chief State Solicitor, the Solicitor for the Attorney General or any other person), any legal proceedings by or against the administrator for the recovery of the estate or any share thereof shall be of the same character and be instituted and carried on in the same manner, and be subject to the same rules of law and equity in all respects, as if the grant had been made to the administrator as a person beneficially entitled to a share of the estate.</P>
    <P>(2) Proceedings on behalf of or against the State in respect of the estate of a deceased person or any share thereof or any claim thereon shall not be instituted except subject to the same rules of law and equity in and subject to which proceedings for the like purposes might be instituted by or against a private individual.</P>
    <P>(3) Where the Chief State Solicitor for the time being is administrator of an estate for the use or benefit of the State, he shall cease to be administrator on ceasing to hold office and his successor in office shall become administrator in his place without further grant.</P>
    <P>The first two subsections of this amendment are largely a re-enactment of sections 2 and 3 of the Intestates Estates Act, 1884. The new provision will, however, be applicable to all property, whereas the existing sections of the 1884 Act apply only to personal property. The repeal of the Act of 1884 is provided for in amendment No. 40.</P>
    <P>The third subsection is designed to deal with the situation where a grant of representation is issued to the Chief State Solicitor on behalf of the State and subsequently the person holding that office ceases to do so, whether as a result of retirement, death or otherwise. This subsection provides that in such a case the person who succeeds to the office will become administrator <Col N="929" /> in his predecessor's place without having to obtain a fresh grant.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>The following subsections added to the section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() The Minister for Finance may, if he thinks proper to do so, waive, in whole or in part and in favour of such person and upon such terms (whether including or not including the payment of money) as he thinks proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the right of the State under this section.</P>
      <P>() Section 32 of the State Property Act, 1954, (which provides for the disclaimer of certain land devolving on the State by way of escheat or as <i>bona vacantia</i>) shall extend to the grantee's interest under a fee farm grant and the lessee's interest under a lease, where the State has a right to such interest as ultimate intestate successor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is two fold. The first of the two subsections will empower the Minister for Finance, if he thinks proper to do so, to waive in whole or in part, and upon such terms as he thinks proper, the right of the State to take property as ultimate intestate successor. Under section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954, the Minister for Finance already has this power of waiver in relation to property which devolves upon the State by way of escheat or as <i>bona vacantia.</i> The right or waiver would, for example, be exercised in cases where the intestate left persons who were dependent on him but, not being next-of-kin, were not entitled to succeed to this estate under the provisions of this Part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second of the two subsections provides that section 32 of the State <Col N="930" /> Property Act, 1954, shall apply in relation to property to which the State has a right as ultimate intestate successor. That section enables the Minister for Finance to disclaim the State's right to a fee farm interest or leasehold interest to which it has become entitled by way of escheat or as <i>bona vacantia</i>, respectively. We are extending it also to the State's new right as ultimate intestate successor which we have here in this section. There are many practical cases where the State would want to disclaim its right to property&mdash;to avoid liability for payment of rents and so on&mdash;and I think it is important that they should have this right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before section 113 the following new section inserted: &ldquo;(1) Where property is devised or bequeathed in a will to a spouse and the devise or bequest is expressed in the will to be in addition to the share as a legal right of the spouse, the testator shall be deemed to have made by the will a gift to the spouse consisting of&mdash;<Col N="931" /> (a) a sum equal to the value of the share as a legal right of the spouse, and</P>
    <P>(b) the property so devised or bequeathed.</P>
    <P>(2) In any other case, a devise or bequest in a will to a spouse shall be deemed to have been intended by the testator to be in satisfaction of the share as a legal right of the spouse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments provide for the redrafting of section 113 and subsection (5) of section 114 so as to clarify the meaning of the two sections. The House will remember that on Committee Stage there was some difficulty in deciding precisely what the two provisions meant. We have gone to some considerable trouble in redrafting these sections. There was some disagreement with the principle involved whereby the testator must spell out the legacy in addition to the legal right. The wording is better now and the intention is clearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I told the Minister on Committee Stage that I had never any real doubt as to what section 113 means. I agree the new wording proposed in the Seanad amendment is clearer but I still think it is a bad section. It is a bad section for several reasons, the principal one being that the practical fact of it is, that it will be a trap for the testator. It will be a trap to the testator who wants to leave a bequest to his wife over and above what she would be entitled to as her legal share. That intention will be defeated unless he expresses it positively in the will. The difficulty, as the Minister must be well aware, is that there are what you might regard as two types of wills: a will made by a solicitor and a will made without the assistance of a solicitor. Let us take the second class first. It is most unlikely that the person who makes a will without any legal advice &mdash;he is perfectly free to do so&mdash;will carry in his head the whole 130 sections of the Succession Bill and that he will be aware of the provisions of section 113 of it. He will not be aware <Col N="932" /> if he wants to give his widow something over and above her share, that if he does not put it in the will, he must express that intention.</P>
      <P>We have departed from the original position taken up by the Government under the original Succession Bill to a very great extent. One of the major changes under this legislation now is that it will be open to a testator to leave everything to his wife. Originally, that was not going to be allowed. It seems to me, having regard to that fact, if a testator now wants to give his widow something more than what she would be entitled to as a legal share, if he does not put that in his will, and is silent about it, simply does it without expressing that it is in addition to the legal share, my view is that it should be understood that it is his intention and it is one which should be operative, when we have gone to the length as we have to leave everything to the wife.</P>
      <P>We now come to the second class where wills are made by solicitors. I agree, by and large, that most solicitors will be familiar with this section and that they will advise their clients in drafting their wills that they must express themselves positively. You will have the occasional will which is made in a hurry, the deathbed will, where the solicitor has not the opportunity of consulting the provisions of this Bill and where a slip-up will be made. I still feel very strongly that it would have been far wiser for the Minister to swing this the other way, and to say that in the event of the testator making a bequest to his wife over and above what she would be entitled to as a legal share, unless a contrary intention is expressed, she should get both.</P>

      <P>I was convinced on the point of attempted murder because a person might wish to forgive another person who attempted to murder him, and as the section stood, he was debarred from giving that person a bequest. In the interests of encouraging forgiveness I am amending the subsection so as to validate a bequest made after the commission of the offence.</P>
      <P>The amendment to amendment No. 38 is consequential. The amendments deal with the question of the dangerous driving type of case. The case was mentioned of a husband and wife driving together and one is killed. As the section stood, in the event of an intestacy, the surviving spouse would be debarred from securing an intestate share. I considered that this was going a bit too far, so now in the event of such a thing happening, the share will pass on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if, on this Money Resoulution, I may inquire from the Minister the position in relation to the proposal to raise a dollar loan. It is understood that this loan has now been postponed. Will the Minister indicate on whose or on what advice it has been postponed and what, generally, the situation is? There appear to be considerable grounds for confusion. We are aware of the adverse interest rate in New York. I should like to know on whose advice the loan was proceeded with, up to the stage a postponement was decided upon, and, generally, perhaps the Minister would give us some indication as to what the plans now are in relation to that loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance did issue a statement in this regard in which he explained that the decision to postpone the loan was taken on the advice of the managing underwriters, owing to the extreme congestion in the market for dollar bonds. He was advised that this congestion <Col N="938" /> would make it undesirable to proceed with the loan at the present time. He pointed out that decisions to postpone loans had also been made by other prospective borrowers in view of the unexpected pressure of issues by large American and international concerns in the pre-Christmas period.</P>
      <P>I cannot say exactly when the loan will be proceeded with but I should imagine that it will be in the not too distant future&mdash;again, on the advice of the managing underwriters. There is no reason whatsoever to imagine that there is any reflection involved on the credit of this country. The money for these kinds of investments consists of American dollars available for investment outside the United States and, of course, they are subject to restrictions by the American Government, for their own reasons. The pressure on the number of dollars available is considerable and was unexpected in the pre-Christmas period. Therefore, the Minister, acting on the advice available to him, decided that it would be in the interest of this country and of the loan concerned to postpone going for the loan at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm, or otherwise, therefore, that the Government are £7 million short of money needed for very necessary expenditure, particularly in capital services? Does this mean that the issue of money from the Central Fund, from Government Departments, will further be curtailed? If so, is the Minister in a position to say what Departments will suffer in view of the fact that this £7 million is not available to the Government and probably will not be available during the present financial year? Further, will the Minister say&mdash; I appreciate the disadvantages of speaking for the Minister for Finance&mdash;if efforts will be made to raise the £7 million, that seems to be necessary, from some other source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension if he thinks, because we have not gone ahead and got this loan now, that the capital programme, on which the Government have agreed, will be reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we did, but we did not need it all at the one precise time. The capital programme covers a financial year and the arrangements are made to cover the whole year. I cannot give the Deputy any information as regards a reduction in particular Departments. There will not be any reduction in particular Departments as a result of our not going for this American loan at the time we were going to go for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister is in a difficult situation, standing in for somebody else. If the Minister and the Chair would wish it, I should be happy to leave my comments until Vote 6 is taken tomorrow. The fact is, as everybody in this House and in the country knows, that the Government are putting their heads in the sand and will not admit that you cannot get money at present for any capital purpose from any local authority. My own local authority in Kildare, for example, is not getting anything like the money it needs to service loans, agreed to months ago, under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, and it is the same with every local authority. All my colleagues tell me the same thing in respect of their local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every local authority in the country knows that the position is that they have been given orders to dry up on capital projects, to defer them, to delay them, and that moneys are not there to meet even existing commitments. In this situation, I must confess, like Deputy Corish, that I am at a loss to understand why, if the moneys were not there to meet existing commitments, the Minister for Finance did not go ahead with his proposals. Without question, it was universally known that the better thing to do was to go ahead and <Col N="940" /> to try to get through their financial arrangements quickly. It was because of that that certain other steps had to be taken in an affair in which I was concerned in order to get it through doubly quickly because that was the sound financial advice&mdash;to get it through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I know also that the loan to which we are now referring was offered outside of New York. People outside of New York were asked whether or not they would go in. I know the terms. I do not know whether or not the Minister for Finance has announced them and I do not want to disclose them until I am certain that they are public property. However, the fact is that, in some extraordinary way, there is no money here. The Minister for Finance did not do his job properly by getting the money early, when he could, in respect of this dollar loan. I appreciate that it would be unfair of me to expect the Minister for Education to know, to understand and to appreciate all the details but the Government&mdash;not the Opposition&mdash;ordered this Bill to be taken today, in the absence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There should be a great deal more frankness and more truth in relation to the financial position and neither the Government nor the people have anything to lose by having the truth, nothing to lose and everything to gain. Day after day we hear stories from Ministers that there is no difficulty here and no problem there; yet everybody knows they are not telling the truth. Go into the head of any financial institution in Dublin and you will be told the same thing: the burden of his complaint against the Government is not the state of the economy but the fact that the Government are not being frank with the people. It is time they were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from what the Minister has told us that there still exist areas of vagueness on the part of the Government with regard to this dollar loan. It is fair to say, I think, that initially when the size of what we were seeking in <Col N="941" /> New York became known, many people wondered why it was necessary to send the Minister for Finance voyaging across the Atlantic on the &ldquo;Queen Mary&rdquo; for a loan of such comparatively small proportions. However, so far as we are concerned certainly, no criticism was voiced; we were satisfied that, however it came about, the money being sought was necessary and would be used in relation to the Government's capital programme this year.</P>
      <P>I want to know now what the present position is. The Dáil and the country have had this year two capital programmes. We had the announcement of what the capital programme was to be and then, in a matter of weeks, we were told that the capital programme would not proceed along the lines of the figures indicated and a new White Paper would be issued. It now appears that this small dollar loan being sought in New York has been postponed. I want to suggest that this particular enterprise seems to have been embarked upon on insufficient advice and without proper planning. It is true to say in relation to this, as it is true to say in relation to many other actions of the Government, that the Minister has not made it clear to me or, I believe, to the House whether this postponement will mean that this money will not be available in relation to the capital programme this year. I understand that it is most improbable that this loan will now be proceeded with in this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few moments ago the Minister seemed to indicate why it was possible we might perhaps, take it up after Christmas. Will there be continued vagueness? There is at the moment in the country the situation both Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Corish have already described, a situation in which many urgent projects are being held up. Many people, small people, seeking assistance to build houses, local authorities seeking assistance to embark on projects upon which they have decided, are in a state of utter uncertainty. They are told by the banks that they cannot have any credit or any accommodation. When <Col N="942" /> that matter is raised here, Government Ministers blow hot and cold. At one moment, as the Minister for Agriculture said a fortnight ago, we are alleged to be dealing with just one of the problems of a boom period; this is a situation in which one just stops to draw one's breath before going ahead again. Is that the situation? Or is it a fact that there has been a failure on the part of the Government to take the public into their confidence? If the latter is the case, then I say deliberately to the Minister that we on these benches will hold the Government to account if the full story is not being told. I would recommend the Minister for Education to see the Minister for Finance when he returns tonight and advise him that, in relation to matters of this kind, there should be a greater degree of honesty and frankness on the part of the Government; we should know exactly what is planned in relation to this kind of borrowing or, indeed, any other kind of borrowing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputies think that the degree of frankness about which they talk should come from both sides of the House or from the Government side only. There never has been a Government so frank with the public from the point of view of publishing all the economic statistics possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred, though not specifically, to the White Paper on the revised capital programme. On the one hand, Deputy Sweetman says Ministers are indicating to the people that there is no problem at all and, on the other hand, Deputy O'Higgins says the Government issued this White Paper which set out exactly what the difficulties were into which our economy had run and what steps the Government proposed to take to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that we are providing more capital than ever before. It may be that in some cases in which there are difficulties for local authorities and others, what has happened is that plans were going ahead for the expenditure of money without sanction; in other <Col N="943" /> words, what is happening is they have not got the sanction they automatically expected to get. In a number of cases the reason for this is&mdash;this has already been announced in the White Paper&mdash; that we must curtail our rate of expansion, not the provision of capital but the rate of expansion of credit. This is what has been done and we have made no secret about it.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about the American loan. The loan was due to be issued on 1st December and was postponed, as I said, on advice received from the managing underwriters, who were Messrs. Harmon, Ripley &amp; Co., of New York and Hill Samuel of London. Their advice was that the extreme congestion in the dollar market for dollar bonds would make it undesirable to have a dollar issue at the present time. Owing to the effect of the United States income equalisation tax for loans issued to nonresidents, the proposed issue due to be made in New York catered for the non-United States market for dollar bonds. It has been reported in various financial columns and newspapers that the rush to float dollar loans made by the non-United States market at this time is due to the fear that the American authorities are about to take steps either to prevent or curtail the raising of such loans in Europe by American companies.</P>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Corish, which I have already tried to answer, I want to say once more that, if this dollar loan is made before the end of the financial year, the postponement of the loan from now until then will not involve any change in the financing of the capital programme. If, however, it should be delayed beyond 31st March, the gap in the necessary financial resources for the capital programme will be made good from other sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay on this, but the Minister said that the Government had provided more capital than any other Government. That is true, but there is one fact about which people are rather concerned. It was mentioned by <Col N="944" /> Deputy Sweetman. A great many projects, local and individual, have been turned down. We get phoney reasons from the Government Front Bench, particularly from people like the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Office of Public Works, when they are questioned about the sanctioning of schemes and the advancing of money. It would be fair for the Government to say in respect of this, that, and the other that they cannot do them now because they have no money. I do not think the revised capital programme was ever intended to prevent people building houses but, whatever has gone wrong in recent months, people are not being allowed to build houses.</P>
      <P>Let me give the Minister one example. It happens to be from County Limerick. It is the case of a person who applied in July last for a loan. Up to date the local authority has not told him whether or not he can have a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. His house is being built. Because he cannot pay an instalment, the building contractor is charging him six to eight per cent on moneys due over and beyond the period on which they fell due. That is just one example. People cannot afford to wait for money. They must look for it from other sources and, if they do, they have to pay much more for it, and I think that is what concerns Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the reply the Minister gave me in respect of the £7 million but can he give an assurance on behalf of the Government that this is £7 million that will not be deducted from the amount allocated even in the revised figure for the capital programme? It was very important about three months ago that we get £7 million by way of borrowing in the United States. Now they do not seem to be very much concerned about it. Was this the only source from which we could get £7 million for what was regarded as necessary work? We have raised £25 million in the National Loan but this £7 million was necessary as well. The Government have not as yet indicated whether or not they are prepared to look for it elsewhere, and <Col N="945" /> the Minister could not tell us here today whether or not that loan will be floated and subscribed by the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself&mdash;and being in charge of Education, he has not a lot to do with this whole business&mdash; must recognise that every single day there are questions here on which there is a reluctance on the part of Ministers to give information. They turn down projects, not, as they say, for the want of money but because there has to be some alteration of the plan. It goes down to the local authority and comes back again. This can be carried on for months so that necessary works will not be done in this financial year. Again, let me emphasise in regard to housing that it would be a dastardly thing, in view of the fact that very many houses are needed, if anything this Government did prevented a local authority or any individual from building a house. Those who have applied for loans from the local authorities are suffering very grave hardships indeed and will discover ultimately that the house which was to have cost £x last July or September will now cost considerably more, due to the fact that the Government have not provided local authorities with sufficient funds for building houses themselves or given loans to those people who applied for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister for Education was speaking from a brief when he said the difficulty arose because people did not apply for sanction. He must know from his own Department that that is not true. If the Minister made an effort to acquaint himself with what is happening in his Department, he would know it is not true. Let me give him one specific case in his own Department. One night last week I met a parish priest from a substantial town in Kildare and he told me that in respect of the addition to the school that he was building on the instructions and at the request of the Minister for Education, he had sent up the certificates of the architect for instalments due to the builder, that he had not been paid and <Col N="946" /> that he could not get it. What is the use of saying that is a case where sanction was not given? The Minister for Education knows perfectly well that no addition to a school like that is started without sanction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He also knows that one thing that is essential in any building contract or building arrangement is that payment is given when certificates issue. If he had not sufficient knowledge of building procedure in that respect, he will get it by turning around to the Minister for Health immediately behind him. One thing that is absolutely essential in a building contract is to issue payment immediately the certificate goes up, and it has always been done. I was told it was not done in this case and one cannot go through the country at present, unless one's ears are sealed, without hearing everywhere of people who cannot find out whether or not they will get the capital from their local authority. If the local authority were told: &ldquo;You will get that in this financial year and that is all you will get&rdquo;, then somebody would know there was some chance of planning and some chance of explaining the situation to people.</P>
      <P>There is a situation arising in another part of Kildare where the Kildare County Council cannot give purchasers of houses under the Small Dwellings Acts the positive assurance that the loans will be available and, on the other hand, the National Building Agency, a Government agency, is shrieking for the money from these purchasers, two different sections taking an entirely different line that cannot be resolved. There must be some frankness in this regard. As Deputy Corish said, we were told some months ago this £7 million was needed for the purpose of carrying out the terms of the Government White Paper. We are told today it is not necessary.</P>

      <P>What I said was that some couple of months ago the Minister for Finance said this particular dollar borrowing was necessary to complete our capital programme as revised in the White Paper for this year. Now I understand the Minister for Education to say that this is not so. What I want to know is why there has been a change in regard to what the Minister for Finance said a few months ago as against what the Minister for Education is now saying. Either the Minister for Finance was talking nonsense two months ago, or the information that the Minister for Education has been given is nonsense. Either it was necessary or it was not. I believe the fact of the matter is the Government and the Minister for Finance made a &ldquo;hames&rdquo; of the American borrowing and that they must now turn to other, perhaps, less desirable methods of making up for their blunders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, it would be better to know and it would be better for the local authorities to be told what they will get this year and what they will get next year. They cannot make any plans. Instead of those wishy-washy implications and half-truths being thrown out by the Government that more money is available this year than last year, there should be a clear statement of the position. Each local authority <Col N="948" /> have numerous projects for which sanction has been given but in respect of which they cannot get any assurance as to when, or if at all, they will get money to meet their commitments. That is not being frank with the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education must have misunderstood the position and possibly he is in an awkward position carrying a brief for the Minister for Finance, who is unable to be here. From what he said this evening, I got the impression, first of all, that the £7 million was necessary earlier in the year but that it is not necessary at the end of the year. If that is correct, the £7 million is needed but we have not got it. Local authorities are gravely concerned.</P>
      <P>I tabled a number of questions today and I pointed out during the discussion on these questions that my local authority asked the Local Loans Fund for £94,500 which they have already promised and sanctioned to borrowers. They have asked for £100,000 but the amount already spent or promised amounts to £94,500. Many people have their houses almost completed on the strength of these promises and now one of two things must happen: either the contractors will sell out on the people, bring them to court, or the contractors will go broke. The Minister said the money would be paid out next year. That is not the answer.</P>
      <P>I do not think the money is there. I am afraid that is pretty obvious. It is only one aspect of the present situation. We have supplementary grant schemes for house building, for water and sewerage. The needs of any local authority in this respect cannot be got from the Local Loans Fund or from the Department of Local Government. Local authorities are not being told whether the money is there. The question Deputy Corish asked is a fair one. Is the money there? If it is, it should be given to the people immediately; if it is not there, the people should be told. If there is only a certain amount available, the people should be told so and advised to make other arrangements which might mean going into court or selling some property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> Bord na Móna employ a large number of men during the summer and lay them off at the end of the season. For a long number of years, many regulars have been employed year after year. Last year was a bad year and the previous year was not so good. Normally in such circumstances what would happen is that Bord na Móna would borrow until such time as the situation eased. This year, regular employees with up to 25 years service are being laid off and the first excuse given by Bord na Móna was redundancy. When the unions pointed out that it could not be redundancy, that the work is there for men with 25 years service, Bord na Móna eventually admitted they were short of money.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say then that it is not urgent to find this £7 million or is he saying that we asked for this money in the first instance to oblige the American lenders to whom we were prepared to pay such a high rate of interest? Is that not all cod? Is it not so that in order to finance our capital projects we need this money and is it not so that we have not got it because we could not get it? We could not get the money and therefore we must do without it. Should the Minister for Finance not come to this House or go to one of the dinners at which he is so fond of speaking and state the position and let us have a bit of honesty for a change? He should let us know where we stand and he would be thanked a lot more in the long run.</P>
    <P>The people are not prepared to stand by, to accept this attitude that the shortage either is not there or is the fault of the local authorities and not of the Government. The Government know darn well that if there is a fault, it cannot be placed anywhere except on the Government. I say to the Minister that it is his responsibility to see to it that tomorrow, before the House adjourns, there should be an honest statement of the financial position. We should be told whether there is to be money for the people who have been promised it and have not got it. We should be told whether this American loan is being proceeded with and if not, what alternative arrangements are <Col N="950" /> being made to get the money that is so necessary.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to understand the statement of the Minister for Education this evening. Either the £7 million is needed or it is not. If not, why did we make a show of ourselves before the world by applying to the Americans for the money? If it is not forthcoming and if it is needed, surely it is the duty of the Minister to tell us that there is to be a cut-down in the Government's capital expenditure. Deputies Tully and Sweetman have put the case fairly. Everybody in the country knows there is a serious financial crisis. We know it affects Bord na Móna in Westmeath where men are being laid off week after week. The same applies to the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>Any of us who are members of local authorities know quite well that in the matter of housing, the Minister for Local Government will not face up to his responsibilities. He is not telling the people the truth. He sends us back our plans, asking us to dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo;. The Minister has told us there has been no cut down in money except where sanction has not been given. Surely he knows the workings of his own Department and can stand over his signature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Westmeath Vocational Education Committee have, irrespective of politics, a go-ahead policy. They are anxious to provide good schools in which boys and girls can get a first-class education. On 26th July last, we asked the Minister for Education for permission to advertise for tenders for a school at Tyrellspass. Sanction was given by the Minister, the advertisement appeared, we accepted a tender and at our October meeting decided to send the tender to the Minister for his permission to go ahead with the work. The Minister turned that down, referring us to a speech he made in this House on 16th July last. We have looked it up but nowhere in that statement did the Minister say he intended to stop the building of those schools. The point I wish to get back to is that ten days afterwards, he gave his permission to go ahead with the work. Perhaps at that time the Minister did <Col N="951" /> not realise that there would be this shortage of money. It is wrong for the Minister to say that there has only been a cut-back because sanction had not been given. We know that sanction has been given and that the cut-back took place afterwards. We know that the blowlamp is there as far as housing is concerned and also schools and health and even the Garda Band.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about a degree of frankness. I can bring my mind back to 1956 when there was a crisis in this country and I can remember the political capital made from it on the far side. Let it be said for Deputy Sweetman and those who were in the position in which the Minister is today that they were frank with the people and at the time they told the people the truth. It is up to the Minister to be frank. The Government have not been frank and they only admitted that this crisis existed when it was wrung from them. Even the Taoiseach had not got the courage to come into the House and tell the truth to the elected representatives. He went to meetings of chambers of commerce and other places and spoke about the financial crisis and about how we should tighten our belts. It was not until the two Parties here asked for a discussion on the position that he gave information to the members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be much better if he took this House and the country into his confidence. There is little use in Ministers saying one thing and the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party going around the country telling the people that there is no financial crisis and that it is only Fine Gael talk. Deputy Flor Crowley was at a Fianna Fáil function in Clare last week and he talked about &ldquo;this so-called financial crisis&rdquo;. He quoted what Deputy Sweetman and Deputy T. F. O'Higgins had stated in this House. We have always put country before Party. A national loan was being floated when the discussion was taking place and they said that the economy was basically sound. He took those words out of their context and made a laugh of the whole thing. He said <Col N="952" /> there was no financial crisis and that it was only Fine Gael whining throughout the country and trying to do harm.</P>
    <P>Every businessman knows that there is a financial crisis today. We all know that the Government perpetrated a fraud on the electorate last April when they told them that there was money for everything. They do not want to admit the mistakes they made that time. It would be much better for the Government to take the people into their confidence, to tell them the truth and not try to fool them any longer. It is time they were honest and frank with the people who have gone through many crises in the past. They would like to know where exactly they stand.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Minister to be creating another mystery. I would have assumed that if the Government sent the Minister for Finance sailing on the &ldquo;Queen Mary&rdquo; to New York to raise £7 million that it was not merely a journey of love but that the money was needed for capital purposes here. Therefore, it would appear that we must assume that if that money is not going to be raised, and it has not been raised, that that £7 million which was required to feed our capital programme this year is just not there. The Minister said that of course it was necessary but it was not necessary from that source. I should like the Minister to indicate what other sources the Government have in mind from which to raise this money. It appears to me to be quite wrong to leave it in the air and say: &ldquo;Oh well, it is not necessary for us to get this money in New York&rdquo;. Does the Minister contemplate shopping around seeking this loan elsewhere? If so, it is well that the country should be told so that the implications of that procedure can be fully understood. Certainly I would not think that it was a very pleasing spectacle to see the Minister for Finance at sea, in more ways than one, in relation to raising money which is necessary for the country's expansion. The Minister in the interests of the country should clarify what he meant by saying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the position in my county as it was explained by our county manager yesterday morning. Our position is that because of the extraordinarily high borrowing by the Government from the commercial banks our treasurers have had to refuse extra overdrafts. Whereas we sought an overdraft in the first instance for the same amount as the highest figure we reached last year, which was £208,000, we were told that up to the 1st January we could enjoy an overdraft of £200,000 but that after that, for the coming quarter, we would have a total overdraft accommodation of £170,000. Our county manager informed us that in order to keep employment running in the county council, to keep existing schemes going, and in order to finance our whole operations, his estimate was that during the first quarter, from January to March, he would need overdraft accommodation of £240,000. We authorised him by simple resolution to seek that overdraft accommodation. The position now is that in order to run the county council, to proceed with work on the roads and to keep our permanent staff paid, we are sending our county manager back to our treasurers for £70,000 more than they gave him a few months ago, and in fact £70,000 more than they regard as the absolute maximum overdraft limit they can give us. We are facing this crisis in the middle of February with horror in anticipation of what can happen to this organisation which might break down and which might take years to recover its previous efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have only to look around the county to see the complete cessation of private house building and to see half-built houses standing as monuments to this Government's bad planning. Formerly we were enabled, when the roof went on a house, to pay a man half of the loan and make further payments as the work proceeded. Now the separate overdraft accommodation which we used while waiting for the money to come from the Local Loans Fund has been refused and payments from the Local Loans Fund have been <Col N="954" /> slowing up to such an extent that it seems impossible for any young man who wants to build a house and who has not got the Bank of England behind him to proceed on the basis that while the building is continuing, and while certificates are issued from the architect, the money will be forthcoming. These young people cannot face the prospect of building their houses. I have known instances where commercial banks helped one or two of them when relatives who had very big credit accounts went in and signed their names to say that during the progress of the building there would be a float there. The persons building the houses immediately had to sign an authority that all grants and loans from the county council or the Department would be paid into their account in that bank. That happened in one case out of 25.</P>
    <P>The position in Louth is that housing, which was proceeding&mdash;certainly not as fast as we would like or fast as during the term of office of the last inter-Party Government &mdash; with some success has now stopped. I can bring anybody who wishes around my constituency and show them houses half built which cannot be proceeded with. How many builders are there at present who cannot pay the next Friday's wages to their men because they do not even know when there is going to be a further local issue from the Local Loans Fund? I can instance the case of a builder building a group of houses under the SDA Acts in Drogheda who, because of the slowing down of payments, was left in the position that he could not pay his men and had to remove them from that site to some other building where the proprietors were in a position to pay. I can tell of public-spirited men who have put up £1,000, £2,000 or £2,500 a piece to keep the pot boiling for the Government in the building of private houses. All this seems extraordinary when one considers that, at the same time, the Exchequer are still spending far more than was spent this day last year. I cannot see why this should be so except that the Government are guilty of bad planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> May I now condemn absolutely the subterfuge being used by the Minister for Local Government to try to cover up the position I have outlined? He will issue sanction at present for certain building schemes but at the end of his letter there is a codicil in which he indicates that, while sanction is granted, permission to sign tender documents is withheld. In other words, you try to hold these unfortunate people and the unfortunate builders on a string by not giving them permission to sign the tender documents so that the delay is just the same.</P>
    <P>The Government are not facing up to their responsibilities in this matter and, as Deputy Sweetman said, they are not telling the people. I can see the political advantage in what they are doing, in trying to drag this thing out and give the feeling there are better times around the corner. But this is not any good to the unfortunate builder and the unfortunate people caught up in this maelstrom. It is unfair. In other times, if you take 1953 as the base year, when the terms of trade were completely against us, when everything we sold was cheaper and everything we bought dearer, Deputy Sweetman had the courage to say: &ldquo;There is what I have got and this is how I am going to share it out. Do your best to employ your people in whatever branch you operate.&rdquo; This was something courageous but unpolitic. It did not help the Party image and left the Opposition if they were unscrupulous enough, as they were, to pull down the building of solidity and belief in the economy which we sought to construct. This is the unfortunate comparison with today&mdash;the comparison of a group of thimble-riggers who are prepared to move the pea from one thimble to another and try to convince the people if they lift the thimble they will find the pea. That is the way the Government are dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>It is quite extraordinary that they get away with it so far as some people are concerned. I can show how Government supporters are facing up to this question of no money for housing. <Col N="956" /> The vice-chairman of Ardee Town Commissioners made several speeches in which he said there would be no delay in building houses in Ardee. We got the housing report yesterday morning and found that 16 houses in Ardee had been awaiting sanction from the Minister since last June. Of course, there were those who remarked on the statement made by the vice-chairman of the Town Commissioners, but he said there had been a panic rumour that the 16 houses had been abandoned. The word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; was never used.</P>
    <P>We have this pitiful situation whereby we have not got a Minister who will say &ldquo;Look, there is what we are going to give you.&rdquo; To give the Taoiseach his due, he said in a general way that we were going to spend as much as last year and no more, but, when it came to saying how or where, his Ministers, his Deputies and his political hacks down the country sought to confuse the public mind and to give as little information as humanly possible. It is clear that, once you give somebody less than he hoped for, he will be dissatisfied and that it is better to string them along and not to tell them. But what about the people who may lose their jobs? I have outlined the situation in Louth whereby we do not know how we will be fixed next February or March. We know we have hard times ahead of us but we do not know exactly how bad or good our position will be. Is this not wrong? Can the revenue returns not be estimated for the months ahead? The Government should assess the situation and tell each local authority how they stand. They might lose a few votes, but votes are not everything. They may mean power. Men who seek power and nothing else rely on votes to get it. I sincerely believe the Government would be doing a better job for the country and proving themselves better statesmen than politicians if they would tell the people they have no money or are short of money and tell them exactly how they will apportion it during the rest of this financial year.</P>

      <P>I do not propose, nor <Col N="957" /> do I think Deputies who made some contributions seriously expected I would, to deal in detail with all the points raised but there are some matters I want to mention. First, the picture has been painted of the Minister for Finance going to the United States to negotiate a loan. This is a very dramatic picture but, unfortunately, it is not true. The Minister went to the United States to attend in the normal way the meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and took the opportunity while there to go ahead with arrangements for this loan, which would have been done anyway but without the attendance of the Minister in the United States.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to make it quite clear that the capital programme for this year, as set out in the White Paper issued by the Government, will be met in full.</P>

      <P>The one to which I referred earlier in which the Government set out exactly what the situation was and what it is proposed to do about it. Then we have to listen to people like Deputy Donegan telling us we are concealing everything from the people. I do not know whether he pays much attention to these things or not but, if he does, he knows what I am referring to. I am telling him the capital programme for this year set out in the White Paper will be met in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States dollar loan has not been abandoned but postponed. I did mention earlier that if we did not proceed with it before the 31st March, we would have to raise the money from other sources. I have been asked to say what those other sources are but I am not prepared to say what they are. I think it should be obvious to the House that I should not say <Col N="958" /> what they are and that it would not be in the best interests of the country for me to refer to it at this stage. I want to assure the House there is and will be absolutely no question of the Minister for Finance hawking the credit of this country around the world. There is no question of that at all.</P>

      <P>I should like to take up with the Minister the suggestion that I am incorrect in saying that the Government are withholding information from the people and that the Minister is not giving them the wealth of information they should have. I want to emphasise that I did say the Taoiseach did indicate that he would spend as much this year on capital expenditure as the previous year and would complete his capital programme. That is not a remedy. I agree with the Minister that this is indicated in the White Paper to which he referred, but it has to do with a reduction in the capital programme. When the Minister says the Government will complete that capital programme indicated in the White Paper, it means, in effect, the completion of a reduced programme. It is quite clear they will spend as much this year as last year because this is an expanding situation.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to get away from what I was saying. If one takes the total Exchequer expenditure and revenue, one finds that both are running well above what they were last year. The important point is that the rate of progress in the country, which had been accelerating, is now being slowed down. Those houses to which I referred, in my constituency, are standing as monuments to the fact that there is not a red shilling available to pay the builders who are doing the work. The fact that the Government will spend more than last year on capital projects does not mean that it is adequate because this is an expanding situation. It really indicates a slowing down in acceleration.</P>

    <P>This amendment is required to cover the transition from the existing financial procedure to the new system proposed in the Bill which will come into effect on 1st April, 1966. It is necessary to provide for the issue of moneys from the Central Fund in respect of (a) Estimates for the current financial year passed since the Appropriation Act, 1965 became law and before 31st March, 1966 and (b) Estimates for the year 1966-67 which may be approved by the Dáil before 31st March, 1966. Neither of these categories was covered in the Bill, as introduced. Therefore, the amendment I move is a purely transitional provision. From 1st April, 1966 the issue of moneys in respect of all Estimates passed after that date, including Supplementary Estimates, will be covered by sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 12, to insert &ldquo;(other than a dog or a cat affected or suspected of being affected with rabies)&rdquo; after &ldquo;poultry&rdquo;, and, in line 14, to insert after &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;(other than eggs of pigeons, doves, peafowl, swans or birds of the species psittaciformes)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Rabies is unknown in this country. It can arise only from illegal importation or escape from a quarantine station. It seems unreasonable that compensation, therefore, should be compulsorily payable for a cat or dog which is smuggled and subsequently ordered to be slaughtered because of rabies. Likewise, it is unreasonable that compensation should be paid, in similar circumstances, in respect of animals found to be affected in a quarantine station or for such animals as might escape therefrom. Admittedly, there is a danger that a dog or cat might be bitten by a smuggled or escaped rabies animal but it is not unreasonable to expect that valuable dogs should be kept under proper control. The Protection of Animals Act, 1965, does, in fact, lay down specific provisions for the control of greyhounds in public. Part II of the First Schedule contains a list of domestic poultry, game and other birds to which the provisions of the Bill may be applied. While it may be reasonable that compensation should be compulsorily payable in respect of all live birds ordered to be slaughtered under the Act, there seems to be no compelling reason why compensation should be compulsorily payable for eggs of birds of no commercial significance.</P>

On the Second Reading, Deputy Sweetman made the point that whereas a member of the police force could always be easily identified by his uniform, there was no means whereby the public could identify an inspector.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Bill which is now about to pass merely proposes to enlarge the definition of what is commonly known as the middle income group. Heretofore a person whose income exceeded £800 ceased to be in the middle income group. That ceiling will now be increased to £1,200. A farmer whose poor law valuation exceeded £50 heretofore ceased to be entitled to the benefits, such as they were, which were enjoyed by the middle income group. That poor law valuation is now being increased to £60. So far as the Bill enlarges the definition of the middle income group, we approve of it. As I said on Second Stage, however, the Minister freely admits that the Bill does nothing to relieve the great injustices and great hardship imposed on sick people, those who need medical attention, hospitalisation and surgical attention. The Minister, I understand, freely admits that illness imposes great hardship in this country and that the State so far has done nothing to relieve that hardship. This Bill certainly does nothing and is a grave disappointment in that respect.</P>
      <P>For several years past, there has been a cry in the country for a proper health service. The Government have been called on to provide such a service. On the assembly of the 17th Dáil, the Government were confronted with a demand for the replacement of the Health Act of 1953. They did not really seek to defend the Health Act of 1953 but, instead of replacing that Health Act, they set up a committee to advise the Minister. That was at the end of 1961. Through the period from the end of 1961 to 1964 this country experienced the farce of that committee being obstructed by the then Minister for Health. He used it as an implement of obstruction, as a method of shirking his responsibilities, as a method of saving the face of the Government which had fallen down on the health services.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I intend to conclude very shortly but I am making the case that what is in the Bill is not very much and that a great deal more is required. That was the position during the term of the Seventeenth Dáil. In this Eighteenth Dáil we have a new Minister for Health. He admits very frankly, as I understand it, that there is a great deal to be desired in the health services but what does he promise us? &mdash;not a Bill to improve matters but a White Paper.</P>
      <P>I conclude by asking the Minister when does he intend to tackle the problem? When does he intend to do something concrete? When does he intend to give the people the health service which they so badly need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to discuss a matter that is in the Bill and to record the fact that the Fine Gael Party found itself in a very difficult situation in that, for once, the excellent Rules of the House seemed to militate against our putting forward amendments seeking to include in the middle income group persons of a higher poor law valuation than £60. These amendments were ruled out of order because they would have imposed a charge on the Exchequer. That places us in the position that all we can do is talk about that situation and make it clear that we do not agree with the limits imposed by the Minister and the Government in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poor law valuation is used under this Bill as a measuring rod to decide who shall get the benefits applicable to the middle income group as operated under the 1953 Health Act. We regard the use of the poor law valuation as unsatisfactory because the poor law valuation varies widely <Col N="966" /> throughout the country and many factors affect it, such as whether or not a person owns a lot of buildings, which could be old and decrepit; whether the premises were rented from a very unjust landlord in days gone by or whether they were rented from a very fair landlord. All these factors tend to change the circumstances in individual cases.</P>
    <P>We want to register the fact that we believe that a valuation of £60 has no direct relationship to an income of £1,200 a year. Even though the poor law valuation is a bad guide to adopt in this matter because of the variation throughout the country, in no case would one find a farmer with a valuation of £60 who had an income of £1,200 a year. In most cases one would find that such a farmer had a much lower income.</P>
    <P>It is very hurtful to us to be placed in the position that we can do nothing about this matter except talk about it. We do want to make it clear that what we desire is a proper health scheme financed by insurance contribution or voluntary contribution and which would give the beneficiary a far better service and make him the customer. According to the old saying, the customer is always right. We want a scheme which would make the beneficiary the person who was on top in this matter. In the meantime, while the Minister wants to improve slightly the existing system, we go along with him, but we do want to say that his method is not our method of doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want on behalf of the Labour Party to say that we are in agreement with this limited amendment of the Health Act because we are in agreement with anything that will tend to bring health legislation to the stage that we desire, where it will provide a free for all health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party did not table any amendments to this Bill for the simple reason that they realised that such amendments as they would have proposed would have suffered the same fate as the Fine Gael amendments because they would impose a charge on the Exchequer. It is practically impossible <Col N="967" /> for an Opposition to introduce an amendment that would be accepted because of the Rules of the House. We felt it was pointless to agitate and to indicate all the changes that we desire in the Health Act in the debates on this Bill. We have stated during the course of the Bill that the aim of the Labour Party is to have a free for all health service on a contributory basis.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Fine Gael Party now agree with that represents a conversion, not of Fianna Fáil to a Fine Gael policy, but of Fine Gael to a Labour Party policy. Please God, I shall live to see such a scheme introduced in this House with the help of a Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>
    <P>Whatever support the Government may need for the introduction of such a scheme, be it in connection with the financing of the scheme or any other aspect, providing we are satisfied that the necessary funds will be collected in proper proportion to the ability of the people to pay, we will certainly give that support, as we support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an undertaking on the last occasion when this matter was before the House that I would deal with the eligibility for general medical services of persons in receipt of non-contributory old age and widows' pensions. I have today sent out the following circular to every health authority in the country and every member of a health authority will get a copy. It reads:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Health to refer to previous communications from this Department directing attention to the fact that non-contributory old age and widows' pensions are granted on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that the pensioners are regarded as necessitous on the basis of standards laid down, as a matter of public policy, by the Oireachtas, and suggesting that recipients of non-contributory old age pensions and their spouses and recipients of widows' non-contributory pensions should automatically, on application, be regarded as entitled to services under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> These recommendations were endorsed during the debate in Dáil Éireann early this month, on the Committee Stage of the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1965.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to deal fully with the matter in the proposed White Paper on the Health Services which, it is expected, will be published shortly. In the meantime, he notes that Managers of Health Authorities, at a meeting with officials of the Department held on the 20th October, 1965, agreed that applications for medical cards from recipients of non-contributory old age or widows' pensions would receive special and sympathetic consideration and if, in a period commencing on that date, in the case of any such application it was felt that the circumstances did not warrant the issue of a card, particulars of it (without specifying names) would be reported to the Department. No such particulars have since been notified to the Department and I am to request you to confirm that, in the interim, all such applications have been granted, and further, to indicate the numbers of such applications refused in the period commencing the beginning of the present financial year and ending on the 19th October last.</P>
    <P>Additional copies of this circular are enclosed and the Minister requests that a copy be furnished to each member of the health authority.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no point going over all the ground again but there are one or two things I feel I should cover. As far as I could gather Deputy Donegan seemed to think a valuation of £60 bears no relation to an income of £1,200. He did not specify what the valuation should be raised to, whether it was to £75 or some such higher figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <P>Finally, this measure is a further advance on the many improvements in health legislation enacted by this Government down the years. Every great measure in improving the health services of the country was introduced by Fianna Fáil Governments. The Health Act of 1947, the Health Act of 1953 and the various other minor, amending or improving Acts down the years, have, in the main, emanated from this Party. While, in this instance, we have not put in other measures which might have been desirable, I have pointed out that the White Paper will follow. It was thought more appropriate that they would be published in the White Paper. This Bill and the White Paper will represent a tremendous <Col N="972" /> leap forward. In the ordinary course of events, where account would be taken of a drop in the value of money, the increase would have been from £800 to £1,000. Instead we have gone as far as £1,200 so we have gone beyond the usual category. I hope there will be no undue delay in publication of the White Paper and the House will have an opportunity of a further comprehensive discussion on the health services.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate W&mdash;Castlecomer Collieries Ltd., is necessary to provide financial assistance to Castlecomer Collieries Ltd. to enable them to continue operations during the period of certain explorations for extractable coal; and also to meet certain obligations to the National Bank Ltd. incurred earlier by the Minister on behalf of this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I informed the House on 15th July, 1965, the Castlecomer Collieries were being closed down in 1963 because of total uneconomic working. The Government were very concerned with the grave social problem which would follow this concentrated unemployment, and arrangements were <Col N="973" /> made to assist the company in securing further accommodation from their bankers. It was thought at the time that the difficulties were only temporary and the aim of this assistance was to facilitate continuing operations while fresh workings were being investigated for increased output. The investigations were not successful and losses continued. The losses were met by loans to the company by the National Bank Ltd., amounting to £60,000 under a guarantee from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. These advances with accrued interest have now to be repaid and an estimated sum of £65,000 is sought for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In spite of the continuing losses the Government decided that the abandonment of the industry without an exhaustive survey would not be justified, and the company engaged the services of a firm of international experts to make the examination. Their report, in brief, was that there was no prospect of the mine being worked on an economic or commercial basis. It did not rule out the possibility of finding coal in one particular area which could be economically extracted but considered the cost of the exploratory work would not be justified as a commercial risk.</P>
    <P>In the light of this report there could be no question of the management or the State accepting responsibility for continuing heavy losses. The mine was, therefore, closed at the end of July, 1965 and all but a skeleton maintenance staff were notified that their employment had been terminated. At the time of this closure the company had urgent liabilities for wages, electricity etc. amounting to £16,500 and these were met by direct loans to the company from the contingency fund. It is now necessary to repay the advance from the contingency fund which was used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Government were gravely perturbed about the social problem created by the closure and after consultation with the interests involved it was agreed to consider any proposal that had even the possibility of future viable working. The Irish Transport <Col N="974" /> and General Workers Union, acting on behalf of the miners then had a survey carried out by a second firm of technical experts. This report recommended the reopening of the collieries while the area referred to in the earlier report was explored in order to determine if there were, in fact, any coal reserves which were economically extractable. The recommendation provided for the re-employment of about 190 men for at least six months.</P>
    <P>Despite the considerable sums of public money already committed on social grounds, to maintain this enterprise in operation, the Government decided that the social considerations involved justified the acceptance of the recommendations in the further report, and in fact the mine was re-opened early in November. To provide for losses which may arise during these operations an estimated sum of £50,000 is sought, plus a contingency provision of £8,500. These sums together with the amounts already made available in the forms of loans and advances from the contingency fund give a total of £140,000.</P>
    <P>It has been arranged that the various moneys involved will be made available to the colliery company as an unsecured loan, to be repaid if profits become available.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the uncertainties involved in mining operations and it must be accepted that there is no certainty that the scheme now on trial will result in a situation where the continued working of the mine can be justified. I sincerely hope that the results will be favourable.</P>
    <P>With regard to Supplementary Estimate R&mdash;St. Patrick's Copper Mines, Ltd.&mdash;offers were sought in 1954 for the State's interest in St. Patrick's Copper Mines, Ltd., from private mining concerns willing to undertake a satisfactory scheme of exploration and development of the mines, which are being maintained on a care and maintenance basis at a cost of about £50,000 per annum. The sum provided for care and maintenance in the 1965/66 Vote was limited to £12,500 as it was hoped that a decision as to the disposal of the mines would be <Col N="975" /> made by 30th June, 1965. Various offers for the mines have been received and considered but no satisfactory arrangement for the disposal of the property has yet been concluded. I ask the approval of the House for a Supplementary Estimate of £37,000 to meet the cost of care and maintenance of the mines up to 31st March, 1966. I am hopeful that a satisfactory arrangement regarding the disposal of the mine may be finalised before that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House approve the decisions made by the Government and the path being followed in relation to these two enterprises. It is extremely sad that the position is that we are at risk in Castlecomer. I suppose in this particular instance this is something that cannot be laid at the door of the Government or anyone else. We must take action and try to defend the employment of the people there. There is nothing more that can be done. The second report that was produced as a result of the intervention of the men's unions must be regarded as very praiseworthy. This investigation, and the cost of so doing, is something to which the people of the district, and the people who have given their lives towards the furtherance of this enterprise, are fully entitled in any normal democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We approve of and support the attitude taken in relation to Castlecomer but there immediately appears to arise a necessity for an assessment of our natural fuel resources and that includes not only coal but anthracite. From my own experience, I know that Irish anthracite produced, not in Castlecomer but not far away, in Ballingarry, is of the highest quality and produces heat in boilers at a far lesser cost than imported oil. The Government, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should assess the fuel resources of the country so that if in the future there is any failure, which we all hope there will not be, there will be an opportunity to rehabilitate the workers elsewhere, and not too far away from their homes. <Col N="976" /> Whatever the result of this exploration, these workers' jobs should be defended, and so far as we can help, the Parliamentary Secretary can be assured that this help will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Again, it is rather a pity that the opportunity to dispose of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines did not materialise. Naturally we must try to preserve the very large Government investment there. A disused mine depreciates day by day because of non-usage and ordinary deterioration. We approve of the decision that since the mine was not disposed of, extra money should be provided to keep it going until the end of the year so far as care and maintenance are concerned. It does appear as if, because of the increase in the price of copper, the Parliamentary Secretary is right when he says there is a better opportunity now to dispose of it and it may well be that success will attend his efforts. I wish him well in this regard. We want to see these men working again and re-employment created there. Therefore, in this instance, it is a case of the ball being at the feet of the Government and of every support being given to them from this side of the House to defend the employment that is in danger in one instance and that is not there in another, though an opportunity for re-creating it seems to be introducing itself because of the increase in the price of copper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We, of course, support the suggestion that money should be found to keep the Castlecomer mine going until the result of the survey is available. Like Deputy Donegan, I should like to pay tribute to the Irish Transport and General Workers Union for their action in carrying out a survey which resulted in the men being restored to their jobs. It is rather a pity that the Government did not take the necessary steps to have the survey carried out themselves. This is an example of something that could have happened, if the union had not taken the step they did. The mine was closed, the men were out of a job, and that was that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the figure required seems substantial, <Col N="977" /> it should be considered, I think, in relation to the amount of money which those men would get if, in fact, they were on the labour exchange rather than in employment. I think the net cost to the Government will not be anything like the figure of £58,000 which is mentioned here. The decision to try to keep it going is a good one. If the necessary surveys throughout the country were carried out, it might be possible to switch the men to other mines where they could usefully be employed. I think it is a very good suggestion and should be acted upon.</P>
    <P>It is rather extraordinary, in this context, that, while this action has been taken, we find, at the same time, that another firm producing fuel is letting men with long service go because, they say, they cannot get the necessary money to keep them going. I refer to Bord na Móna. I do not want to broaden the debate. However, Bord na Móna are at present letting go men with up to 25 years service on the grounds that they have no money and that the Government will not make the necessary funds available&mdash;for no reason other than the fact that the Government are short, and so on. That is something the Parliamentary Secretary might look into. It is a serious situation. While it is not as serious now as the Castlecomer situation, it could develop so that, where fewer than 1,000 men are now involved, the figure could be several thousand men within the next few months, if things do not improve. The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>With reference to St. Patrick's Copper Mines, again, we must approve of the decision to maintain the mines in good shape. While it is true, as Deputy Donegan says, that, at the present time, the world price of copper is going up and, for that reason, there is a better chance of disposing of the mine on favourable terms, it must nevertheless be remembered that this is mainly because of the situation in Rhodesia and anybody who thinks that that situation will continue indefinitely is making a big mistake. Therefore, an effort should be made to conclude an <Col N="978" /> agreement with somebody because the continued expenditure of £50,000 this year&mdash;I understand it can be an even greater figure&mdash;may not carry the mine next year. If that situation continues over a number of years, the Government will naturally attempt to recoup their losses and will have a far greater sum to try to recoup. Therefore, a quick arrangement should be reached. It would be more satisfactory to settle for a sum now because, after the lapse of a further 12 months, a very much greater amount will be required to compensate the Government for what they expended. In both cases, we believe the Government are doing what any sensible Government should do. I suggest that, for the time being, they are being sensible. They should spend this money because, apart from preserving the St. Patrick's Copper Mines, it is vital that the employment should be kept going. For these reasons, we approve of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I misunderstood Deputy Tully's opening remarks when he paid tribute to the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. However, he seemed to me to imply that there is some sort of basic reluctance on the part of the Government to come to the rescue of the Castlecomer mines which, as Deputy Tully probably knows, got into difficulties not only last summer but in the summer of 1963 as well. This trouble they got into was the result of a build-up of a great many adverse factors into which it is hardly necessary to go now. However, it is only fair to recall that, on each of these two occasions, when evidence was produced to the Government that the situation required their help, help was forthcoming. During the summer, when the Powell Duffryn Commission reported on Castlecomer, no contradictory evidence was then available. It is quite true to say that the local secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, Mr. Boran, took it upon himself to collect such evidence as was available to show that workable coal could economically be produced <Col N="979" /> and he did so. I am sure Deputy Tully well appreciates that grounds upon which the Government could reopen the mines in Castlecomer were very avidly sought and that, when they were forthcoming, they were grasped, in spite of the fact that it involved fairly heavy financial commitments for them.</P>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Seán Flanagan, for his part in the Castlecomer operation. I am sure I am expressing the opinion of my constituents, especially the coalminers in Castlecomer, when I say his visit to Castlecomer and his conversations with everybody concerned&mdash;management, union and men&mdash;were very much appreciated. I think, on this last point, that the establishment of close personal relations with the coalminers themselves is a very welcome departure indeed. I think one of the reasons Castlecomer found itself in the difficulties that arose was that&mdash;or so it seemed to me, at any rate&mdash;communications between the men, the union and the management left a great deal to be desired. I hope this situation will be remedied in the future: I am confident it will be. It would be a very serious matter if some divorce occurred again between the interests of management and the interests of the men.</P>
      <P>While it is fairly widely recognised now that everybody in Castlecomer is involved, it would be most regrettable if the newly reopened mine ran into any difficulties because of problems about wages, or anything else, requiring full and thorough investigation being left without that investigation. It would be regrettable if a situation should arise in which grievances on the part of the men were not given proper ventilation. It is of the utmost importance now that there should be a close communication between management and men and that that close communication, having been established, should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This present operation has been described as exploratory. It is important we should aim at success now in this venture. It is not sufficient <Col N="980" /> to accept this project as a temporary rescue measure. We must get it into our heads, into the heads of management and into the heads of the men, that the future of Castlecomer depends on the success of this operation and any action by anybody prejudicial to this general objective of overall success could very well result in failure. I trust this general target will be borne in mind by everybody. It is not a temporary success or a partial relief we are aiming at; we are aiming at continued, successful coalmining in the area. On behalf of the people of Castlecomer, I want to repeat once more that we are very grateful to the Government for coming to the rescue for the second time in two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Supplementary Estimate. A deputation waited on the Minister for Industry and Commerce not so long ago and one of the points he made then was that he would have to face this House with a Supplementary Estimate and he would be put through the mill for providing so much money without having got the permission of the House. I assured the Minister then that, if he reopened the mines, the House would welcome any Estimate he cared to introduce and, judging by the reception this Supplementary Estimate has got, my words have been fully borne out.</P>
      <P>The financial crisis arose in the summer of 1963 when the company found themselves unable to pay the men their wages plus holiday money, which was at the time a very considerable amount. I am pleased that the Government at that time guaranteed the company the money to meet their immediate requirements and to maintain the industry in production. The local people offered to contribute towards the immediate cost but it would have been very hard for them to provide, not alone the immediate cost, but money for continued operation. I was very glad the Government took over and guaranteed the bank over the next year or so.</P>
      <P>During that two years' period, there was no reorganisation carried out. There was no capital development. There is no great hope, therefore, that the mine will become viable or self-supporting, although the company did manage to pay its way during the particular period. The company provides work for 300 to 350 men and their families. The mines mean a great deal to the district, which is one of the most populous in the country. The local authorities have provided serviced houses and so on. There are ideal educational facilities, both primary and secondary. Castlecomer town is absolutely dependent on these mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the development of our national resources. I am very happy to see the provision of £50,000 for exploratory work. I hope the work will prove successful and that the industry will be put on an economic basis. The <Col N="982" /> decision to close these mines was announced the day before the Dáil went into recess. That was a regrettable action on the part of the Minister. I wonder was it true that arrangements were being made to have the men transferred to employment in other areas and did the Minister hope that by the time the Dáil reassembled the Castlecomer mines would be forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently that was not without foundation because it was only due to the efforts of the trade unions, the development association and the local representatives that pressure was brought to bear. We are very pleased the mines have been reopened. We hope the reorganisation will be satisfactory. The Minister has a nominee on the new board and it is generally believed that these mines should prove an asset. The quality of the coal is the best in the country. With the balance of payments as it is, it is essential we should produce our own raw materials as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Minister if he had any proposals for an alternative industry in Castlecomer from the IDA and An Foras Tionscal and the Minister said that he had not received any so far. The people in Castlecomer were assured that the area would be scheduled as undeveloped if the mines closed down. So far the area has not been so scheduled. I saw a communication from the Minister to the local development association in which it was stated that, if an industry came along which would provide work in Castlecomer, An Foras Tionscal would treat with the proposed industrialists as if they were establishing the industry in an undeveloped area; they would get the same facilities. I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One further point I should like to raise is that this month the principal users of anthracite duff in this country have written to all the suppliers of anthracite duff that as a result of the continuing downward trend in the main fuel costs, as and from 1st January 1966, the basic price for duff would be reduced by 14/- per ton to 45/- per ton. This would be a most <Col N="983" /> uneconomic price. The firm is supplied with 14,000 or 15,000 a year and it would be a great loss to both the suppliers and the mines if this anthracite duff is not wanted in future. Not alone is there a reduction in the price but it looks as if they do not intend to use any further Irish anthracite duff.</P>
    <P>This question was raised here in 1962 when the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lynch, was asked whether firms were going to use Russian oil. In reply the Minister stated that one firm was considering the use of Russian oil but this would not result in any reduction in the quantity of Irish anthracite duff being used by that firm. That was three years ago. Apparently there is an oil war going on in the world and oil is being dumped at very low prices. I believe this firm is getting oil from both Russia and Germany and one of the big oil combines has now cut out both of these countries dumping oil in this country. Will the anthracite industry here suffer as a result of this oil war in the world? The letter to which I referred means that these people will not be in a position to supply at that price, which is most uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I would have put down a question in this regard but I only heard of it on Saturday. However, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to give an assurance to the House, that, whatever about the use of oil, this firm will continue to use Irish anthracite duff as it has been doing over the past 20 years. This is a national firm working under licence from the Government, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give me that assurance. There are two ways of telling a person that supplies are not needed. You can tell him you do not want any more or, as was done in this case, state an uneconomic price. This fuel is most suitable for the requirements of the kilns used by this firm and I would ask the Minister to give the same guarantee that his predecessor gave in 1962, that this importation of oil will not result in any reduction in the quantities of anthracite used by that firm in the future. If these mines have not an outlet <Col N="984" /> for the duff as they have had for the past 20 years it can make the mines uneconomic straight away and involve closing not alone Castlecomer but the other anthracite mines in the country.</P>

      <P>I was in the Avoca mines during the earlier period and I am aware of its history. When one takes on mining one takes on big business. It is very easy to be critical of it and of those who came before us, to point out the mistakes they made, but there were very few people then who were prepared to take the risk involved in such big undertakings in an economy like ours. There is no tradition for mining in Ireland. The sums that are mentioned in this Estimate&mdash; and it is only an estimate&mdash;are small sums when one considers mining ventures <Col N="985" /> but now that we have established a reputation for mining and when we have geared our Geological Survey Office to the demands of the situation, it would be too bad if we started to put back the clock and if we were not prepared to gamble&mdash;if I should use the word &ldquo;gamble&rdquo; here at all&mdash;some of what we hope to make in the future of these things.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of risk in any undertaking. It is a good sign that foreigners coming into this country in such large numbers have taken an interest in such undertakings and are helping us in many ways. It would be regrettable if we were not prepared to shoulder our part of the responsibility. I know the terms of this debate are narrow, but I am proud to see that items such as these can be so well received on both sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to say a few words in regard to the Supplementary Estimate dealing with the St. Patrick's Copper Mines in Avoca.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that offers were sought in 1964 for the State's interest in these mines and he made it clear that the door is still open and that negotiations are at present going ahead so that anybody else interested can still be considered. My purpose is simply to urge both the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to keep alive their interest either in retaining the State's interest in the mines or disposing of it.</P>
      <P>In any event, I wish to express the hope that the people who have still some hope in the Avoca area that the mines may ultimately reopen will not be left in the position where they just do not know what is happening. I know it is not a matter we can reasonably expect the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with in any detail at a time when the question of negotiations is still there. It would not be fair to expect him to tell the House what type of commitments those who show an interest are being asked to undertake. It would not be reasonable even to ask him to discuss the precise details of the disposition of the State's interest in the mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> My principal reason for speaking is to urge that the active interest of the Minister should be maintained in this matter. I know it is the popular thing to say that money has simply been poured down the drain in Avoca by successive Governments. It is probably natural that I, a Deputy in the constituency, should feel that is presenting a very one-sided picture of the operation and I do not propose to discuss it at any great length other than to say that if successive Governments who showed an interest in Avoca had done nothing more than give employment in the area it was a great asset to the people there.</P>
    <P>Of course, they did more than that when the mines were in operation. The work carried out in the mines, even in the years immediately before they closed, played some part in our balance of payments. With the present fluctuations in the price of copper, it may well be that in the present period there could be considerable interest in mines such as St. Patrick's. The Minister and his advisers no doubt have considerable knowledge of that. I hope that whatever negotiations are under way at the moment will result in these mines being reopened. There is still room for considerable employment there. We all know that many of the workers engaged in the mines have naturally, in their own interests, sought employment elsewhere but I feel there is still scope for development and employment in Avoca.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House. I am only too pleased to support this Supplementary Estimate. The Castlecomer Collieries, as we all know, were closed down just before the Summer Recess and it is in no small measure due to the pressure brought by the local committee and local representatives that the Supplementary Estimate comes before us this evening. I fully realise, being in business myself, that people are in business to make it pay. The coalmining industry in Castlecomer was subsidised by the Government during the past two years. Losses were something in the region of £60,000, speaking from memory. When representations were made to the Minister some months <Col N="987" /> ago to have the mines reopened, we pointed out that though the losses had been met to that extent, at the same time the losses were not as large as they looked because, if you take the collieries from that town, Castlecomer becomes a ghost town. This Government, or any Government, must realise that revenue is collected in the town from taxes on tobacco, drink, the turnover tax on general food-stuffs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>From Pay as You Earn. In other words, the losses were not as great as they looked. However, that is by the way. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance earlier complimented the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the work he has done and for his visit to Castlecomer when he met the employees of the collieries and the people of the area generally. I do not wish to take away from that because I think it was a very good move on his part and I have the highest regard for him. However, I feel this Supplementary Estimate would not be before us now were it not for the pressure put on the Government by the local committee and by all the public representatives in the area.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned that the mines were uneconomical. If this Supplementary Estimate can succeed in giving constant employment to people in the Castlecomer area and if, as a result, the town is kept alive, I think the £140,000 provided for in this Vote will be money very well spent. I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that he need have no doubt that as far as the workers in the mines in Castlecomer are concerned they will play their part to ensure that the mining industry in Castlecomer will become a profitable business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little else that I can say except to welcome this Supplementary Estimate not alone for Castlecomer but also for St. Patrick's Copper Mines, because while I approve of grants being given to people coming into the <Col N="988" /> country who will give employment, one of our first duties is to keep our people at home and our industrialists in a strong position to weather the present day storms. For that reason and also because it will keep our people from the emigrant ship I welcome this Supplementary Estimate and I hope it will not be the only Supplementary Estimate which will in the years that lie ahead ensure that Castlecomer Collieries become a profitable business and that the people in that area will have full and constant employment.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate and sympathise with the views expressed by Deputies Crotty and Governey and also Deputy Michael O'Higgins in relation to what is contained in this Supplementary Estimate and what it proposes to do, but I want to protest if I may as a Deputy representing the constituency of Laois-Offaly about what is not contained in this Estimate. There is no proposal here to deal with the identical problem which exists in relation to another portion of the Leinster coalfields and which concerns the constituency that I represent and in particular the county of Laois. A short time before Castlecomer was closed down the coalfields in the county of Laois, in the parish of Mayo-Doonane, were closed and all the Deputies representing the two constitutencies, with the regrettable absence of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, met in Mayo to consider the problem.</P>

      <P>Is the position then that I must deal with the fact that the Government now are merely concerned with Castlecomer and are not the slightest bit concerned about the unemployment that is taking place within one and a half miles of Castlecomer, with the unemployment that is taking place in Arless, Mayo and Doonane? Is it the situation that portion of the coalfield is now to be given a shot in the arm and that as far as the rest of that area is concerned no hope is going to be held out for it? It is wrong that a limited solution should be provided for this problem. I think I am in order in applying that criticism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this Supplementary Estimate, as I do, I can express regret that it is a faltering step in the right direction but it is not the kind of solution that I would have liked to have seen applied. This problem of developing our national resources which are contained in the Leinster coalfields is something that should have received proper planning. It is perfectly clear that planning has not been applied to this problem and that a limited solution is now being put forward. The money which the Minister asks for must be voted to him but it is a matter of regret that he has <Col N="990" /> not asked for more and that he has not dealt in a better way with this particular problem. It is true to say that in Castlecomer, and in the areas in the immediate vicinity, there are many families who depend entirely on the mining of coal for their existence. They have no other means of livelihood and for those who cannot earn their living from mining coal the only alternative is emigration.</P>
      <P>I am sure I am not enlightening the House when I say that not far from Castlecomer many hundreds of people in the last six months have been forced to emigrate because they have not been able to make their living in the way in which they were accustomed to make it. I would like to have seen a courageous Minister tackling this problem of developing our coal resources on a planned basis instead of deferring, as is obviously intended by this Estimate, a solution to the problem until a later stage.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to recall that in both Carlow-Kilkenny and Laois-Offaly when the last general election was being fought Fianna Fáil candidates said, or caused to be said, that if there were a change of Government the coalmines would close down. It is interesting to recall that, that having been said and the election having been fought and won by Fianna Fáil, the closing of the coalmines took place after that in the month of June in part of the coalfield and in July in Castlecomer. It is also notable that when other elections faced the Government, and in particular when local elections have to be fought all along the Leinster coalfield, this particular Supplementary Estimate is introduced. I do not know what effect it will have in the immediate vicinity of Castlecomer but I do know what effect it will have in Laois, because, whatever benefit is being given in or around Castlecomer, it will not extend into Laois and will not affect other parts of the coalfield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, for the half-loaf that is in it I and my Party are grateful. We feel it is due to the fact that there was when this closure took place a vigilant Opposition that this Estimate was decided upon by the Government It is <Col N="991" /> a consoling fact to every miner thrown out of work, to every workman unable to earn a paypacket in Castlecomer and in that part of the constituency of Kilkenny that they had Deputies like Deputy Crotty, Deputy Governey and Deputy Pattison who spoke out when it was necessary to speak out. I only wish that those who came to the parish of Mayo included all Deputies. If everybody had come along at the invitation of the parish priest, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, I am certain the Estimate which is moved today would have included an Estimate providing for the reopening of the Laois mines. However, I support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very pleasant when the House manages to achieve unanimity and I am thankful to the various Deputies who have contributed to this debate. It is absolutely necessary that the House and country should know the basis on which this money is now being asked of the Dáil, particularly in view of some of the speeches that have been made. In this connection I must say I always admire the facility of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins when he is in mischievous mood, but I think it would be undesirable that the impression he has given to the House should not be contradicted. The fact is that there is not, never has been and will not be a political or social justification for any Government to use the taxpayers' money in a hopeless cause. I do not have to repeat here the history of coalmining in the United States, in Britain and in this country because the House is aware of it. Indeed, only a couple of weeks ago it was announced in Britain that a further 150 mines are to close in the next couple of years. A complete reorganisation of coalmining had to be undertaken in the United States at a time when the industry was in grave jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Castlecomer is concerned, the Powell Duffryn Report was brutally frank and said there was not the slightest hope that coal could continue to be extracted economically. <Col N="992" /> Obviously, this was creating a very grave situation in the entire Castlecomer area. I resent very much the statement made by Deputy Crotty, who himself was associated with the Department of Industry and Commerce in a responsible capacity a few years ago, that we in this Government were cynical enough to arrange the close-down at Castlecomer in the hope that the fate of the workers and of their wives and families would have been forgotten by the time the House resumed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It looked like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was cynical, unworthy and totally unfair. The truth is we did not own, never did own and do not now own Castlecomer Collieries Limited or any other mine, but when in 1963 the financial condition of the company became desperate the Government were hopeful that reorganisation of mining methods, of management and of manpower generally in the area would make the colliery viable again. When the Powell Duffryn Report appeared to put an end to any such hope, the Government were faced with a situation that there seemed to be no future whatever for the mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thankful indeed for the efforts made by the unions in connection with this and indeed the efforts by all Deputies of all Parties in connection with this reopening. I want to disabuse some Members of the House of certain misconceptions they appear to have. In this connection I am not trying to make political capital at all but merely to put the record straight. It appeared to me and the Minister, even though the Powell Duffryn Report was, as I say, so brutally frank, that inasmuch as this was a report commissioned by the Management of Castlecomer Collieries Limited and, therefore, not available directly to the unions and their members, the unions should be given an opportunity on behalf of their members of obtaining, if it was possible to obtain, expert opinion which would support the contention of individual miners with long experience in the area that there was, in <Col N="993" /> fact, at least one seam from which coal could be extracted on an economic basis. In other words, that justice would have to be seen to be done. The initiative in that matter came from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and from me.</P>
    <P>It transpired when the Bathurst Report came to hand that there was a hope that this particular seam would prove economic. But I must issue a warning that this hope can be sustained, and I now quote from part of the summary of the Report:</P>
    <P>...only if a total new start is made by all concerned and management and labour co-operate fully in raising efficiency and lowering costs.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute here to Mr. Conroy for the way in which he, on behalf of his union, publicly accepted this. He recommended to all concerned that every possible effort at increasing efficiency and removing workers who were in any way malingering or otherwise causing difficulty be made. All these steps, as well as streamlining management, had to be undertaken with a good heart, if there was to be a realisation of the hope expressed in the Bathurst Report.</P>
    <P>The justification for this Supplementary Estimate, therefore, is the belief that when you ask people who are fighting for their lives if they are prepared to lay down their lives, if necessary, they will do so rather than let their employment and future prospects in their native locality go to nought. In that connection, it was somewhat disappointing that only a couple of weeks ago a claim was received from the local branch of the union for additional payments for hard cleaning and night shift workers, etc. It appeared to the board generally that these claims could have been brought forward at the time the wage structure in the reopened mines was being considered. It is rather a blow that fresh claims should be brought forward after such an insignificant period of time.</P>
    <P>I said, in introducing the Estimate, that we hoped that this would be a success. We most sincerely do but the justification for it is not, as Deputy T. F. O'Higgins said, that the Government <Col N="994" /> are offering a piecemeal solution to a wider problem. This is an argument based on an entirely false ground. I want to deny to the House that this is the approach of the Government now or at any time previously. The approach is that in certain circumstances, we are led to believe&mdash;and we like to hold on to that belief&mdash;this can be made an economic proposition and we are voting some of the people's money in the pursuance of that prospect. Incidentally, with regard to alternative employment in mining, the House will recall that there was an offer for the immediate employment of approximately 120 men in Ballingarry coalmines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, in fact, an offer for the immediate employment of 120 people in the occupation these people had been accustomed to all their lives. That is the basis on which Deputy T. F. O'Higgins argued the case only a few minutes ago. That alternative employment was taken up by, I think, eight or ten men to date. True, there is plenty of alternative employment in England, but, there again may I remind the Deputy of what British experience has been in regard to coal mining? It is becoming an increasingly unfashionable occupation. Many of the expert miners in the Castlecomer area, when given the choice of immediate employment here, chose to go over to England. When I discussed the matter with them, they admitted they would go there not to work in their own field but rather in alternative employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I asked them and, of course, I am perfectly <Col N="995" /> well aware of the situation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance mentioned the necessity for continued good communication between men and unions and between unions and management. In that connection, the House may know that one of the local union leaders has been appointed to the board in an effort to achieve this very necessary level of communication between all the people involved.</P>
      <P>Mention was made earlier by Deputy Donegan of assessment of the fuel resources of our country. The position here is that this is really a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>I now come to the matter of the Avoca Mines and, as Deputy M. J. O'Higgins so rightly and fairly said, the details of the negotiations going on at the present time must be regarded as confidential. Obviously, the fact that the world price of copper has improved makes the prospect of a reasonable deal being made considerably brighter than it was, say, 18 months ago. All we can say to the people living in that locality is that we have real hope that within the fairly near future, a suitable arrangement will be made either on the basis of the offers which are already on hand with the Receiver or other offers which Deputy Sweetman seems to suggest may yet be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing further I wish to say except on a personal note. On the occasion of my visit to the Castlecomer area, I was very struck by the obvious pride the people had in their houses and their locality. Indeed, I was most impressed by the way in which some very large families of children were looked after and dressed. It is my sincere hope that the next time I go to Castlecomer, it will be to a continuing thriving community. The answer to that, possibly, now lies partly <Col N="996" /> under the ground but partly with the activities of those who will be working there, and I wish them every success.</P>
