      <P>I assume that the site to which the Deputy refers is that cleared for a new building to be erected for the Electricity Supply Board in accordance with plans accepted following an architectural competition.  I am informed by the Board that the plans are under detailed examination at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite wrong in his assumptions.  There is no intention of leaving the building uncompleted and the present position is due simply to the fact that the detailed plans for the building are under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the estimated <Col N="804" /> decline in small savings and prize bonds as set out in the White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure, he will in order to encourage greater savings increase the rate of interest in respect of sums in post office savings banks and other similar accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, having regard to the substantial drop in small savings, he proposes to increase interest rates on accounts in the post office and Savings Certificates; and what measures he proposes to take to stimulate savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Finance) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the increase in savings which might be expected to follow an increase in the interest rates of the savings banks would be commensurate with the heavy cost involved which would be approximately £1¼ million for each 1 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful, however, that the increase from £25 to £50 of the tax free allowance on the interest paid by savings banks and commercial banks which was effected in this year's Finance Act, will prove a useful stimulus to savings.</P>
      <P>The return on the National Loan which I shall be announcing tomorrow should also be a stimulus to saving in this form.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, I have set up a working party to review existing arrangements for encouraging savings and to examine the possibility of improving them.  The working party consists of representatives of the Central Bank, the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the Trustee Savings Banks, the Savings Committee and the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Posts and Telegraphs and Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say is the change from £25 to £50 the only new incentive proposed to encourage saving?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee are seeking new incentives and will report to the Minister what they consider to be useful incentives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the delay which is likely to occur in getting a report from a committee of this sort, does the Minister think this is a quick enough method to encourage saving?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were any obvious incentives, they would be used right away, but there does not seem to be any obvious useful incentive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether import levies are contemplated as a measure to correct the unfavourable balance of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to today's announcement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I am in order in thanking the Minister for his courtesy in answering my question a day in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider in a matter of such <Col N="806" /> importance to the economy as this, where additional heavy taxation is involved, that the appropriate place in which to make such an announcement is the Dáil rather than to make an announcement in advance, in this case, of a Parliamentary Question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  Once the Government decide on such a course, it should, I feel, be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that in matters in which taxation is involved, the normal procedure is to make the announcement first to the Dáil.  The Minister will appreciate that in a matter of this sort a number of questions arise and I do not know whether at this stage it would be possible for him to answer them.  Could he indicate the estimated additional revenue it is expected to secure from the levies between now and 31st March?  Could he say, further, whether traders and others affected by the levies will be entitled to pass on to customers the additional increase due to the levies or will it be necessary to secure the Minister's permission in this case and, if so, what procedure will be adopted to secure such permission?  Further, can the Minister say whether in view of the fact that on this occasion a preferential rate of levy applies to British goods or commodities, any specific representations were made to the British Government concerning the surcharge imposed last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an imposition of taxation, as I think the Deputy appreciates.  The action is to curb imports, the Government having first tried to do it in other ways.  As it is not a taxation measure, it does not require to be brought to the House.  If there are any other details the Deputy would like, he should address questions to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether or not these levies need the force of legislation and, if so would the Taoiseach not avail of an early opportunity, if legislation is to be promoted to give force to these <Col N="807" /> levies, for a general economic debate? It is obvious from the questions Deputy Cosgrave has asked and the questions that people are asking, that we need a clear statement from the Government as to our present economic situation and the measures which the Government have proposed outside the Dáil.  I do not accept the excuse of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he says it was decided it should be done.  That was only yesterday, and the Dáil meets today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Taoiseach's suggestion, can the Taoiseach say at this stage what steps traders are entitled to take who are affected by the levy, if they are entitled to make representations to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and what procedure will be adopted in the case of goods where the prices are affected?  Secondly, can the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce say if any specific representations have been made to the British Government in view of the preferential rate of levy applicable on this side to British imported goods, in respect <Col N="808" /> of the British surcharge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as traders are concerned, what we want them to do is to stop buying these goods, which are not essential, for the duration of the period of the levy.  In regard to representations to the British Government, we have made frequent representations in regard to their surcharge but their obligations under the trade agreements are different from ours. Our obligation was to give a preferential rate.</P>

As regards the second part of the question, local authority pensions are adjusted in line with periodic increases in other public service pensions under regulations made by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has found by experience that the following words, which appear in section 5 (3) of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, namely, &ldquo;the passing of a resolution under this section shall be a reserved function for the purposes of the County Management Acts&rdquo;, have served any useful purpose; and, if not, if he will introduce appropriate amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>General provisions for the granting of pensions and other superannuation benefits to servants of local authorities were enacted for the first time in Part III of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948.  Because of the importance, and the financial implications for local authorities, of the new provisions, the decision by each local authority to implement Part III of the Act was made a reserved function for the purposes of the County Management Acts. Corresponding provision was made in section 5 of the Act of 1956 because a number of local authorities had not by that time adopted Part III of the 1948 Act.  The provision in question has served the purpose of ensuring that the decision as to the adoption of Part III of the Act will be the function of the elected council.  Amending legislation to alter the provision is not contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said the other day, he is not with us. The question was to ask the Minister whether the following words in section 5 (3) of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, namely, &ldquo;the passing of a resolution under the section shall be a reserved function for the purposes of the County Management Acts&rdquo; have served any useful purpose.  Surely the Minister agrees, in regard to the reference to a county manager, a county manager cannot pass a resolution?  Why were the words put in that way and what function have they?</P>

      <P>The official form of application for sanction to borrowing has always contained an instruction that no expenditure should be incurred in respect of the works until the local authority have been notified of sanction to the loan.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that if local authorities have tended to ignore the regulations, it is because it was the practice of the Minister's Department to allow them to do it over the past 15 years?  Why is there a change now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not agree all the way with the Deputy but I will agree, in regard to this ignoring of the regulations, that this was done when my Department were trying to get local authorities to do more than they were prepared to do in those years past. Now that we have got to the point where they are doing more we are merely reverting to the practice as outlined in the regulations which were in existence for many years before I became Minister.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="812" /> state clearly to us all that the reason is that there is no money available to carry out the works proposed by the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make any such statement but I will state that we have not got as much money as we could possibly spend this year.  It is the first year since I became Minister that that is so.  It is not true to say we have no money to do any more work. We have more money than we had last year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that on the County Dublin section of the dual carriageway from Dublin to Naas no crossing of the island is permitted for residents living along the road, while in County Kildare each householder is permitted such a crossing; and if he will indicate his willingness to have similar crossings on the County Dublin section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The approved design for the improvement of this road to dual carriageway standard included provision, in accordance with the appropriate engineering standards for such roads, for openings in the median at existing road junctions, incorporating special lanes to cater for crossing and turning traffic.  The route in question is one of the most important arterial roads in the country, and carries very heavy traffic.  To permit unrestricted crossing of the median would completely nullify the advantages conferred by a road of this standard, and also create very serious accident hazards.  I am not aware that the position in relation to the County Kildare section is as represented by the Deputy, and I am having the matter taken up with the Kildare County Council.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a number of cases farmers with slow-moving tractors or trailers have to pass their own houses and travel at least a mile to get back to their own farmyards, or perhaps from one farm to another, and that this is causing serious trouble on that stretch of road, especially in view of the fact that just across the Kildare border, they <Col N="818" /> recently put a tarmacadam passway across the island opposite every household from the Kildare border down?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that because of the raising of the income limit for social insurance purposes in the case of non-manual workers from £800 to £1,200 a year, many voluntary contributors have again become compulsorily insurable.  I am not, however, aware that such persons are being deprived of any of the benefits for which they would have been covered had they continued without interruption in compulsory insurance.  Those of them who had been insured for all benefits prior to exit from compulsory insurance because of the operation of the £800 limit, continued, as voluntary contributors, to be covered for widows' and orphans' and old age contributory pensions.  By virtue of regulations already made they have been credited with employment contributions for a period sufficient to render them immediately eligible for those other benefits to which title could not have been preserved on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>However, a person who ceased to be insured for the full range of benefits because of entry into employment in respect of which, but for operation of the £800 limit, he would have been required to pay contributions at the special rate giving cover only for widows' and orphans' pensions, can be insured only for these benefits on again becoming compulsorily insurable in that employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10th May, 1965 it was decided by a deciding officer that the person to whom the Deputy's question refers was not incapable of work and not entitled to disability benefit.  The claimant discontinued submitting <Col N="822" /> medical evidence of incapacity and took no futher action until 16th July, 1965 when he gave notice of appeal against the decision of 10th May.</P>
      <P>A week later a fresh claim for disability benefit was received from him in which he contended that his illness was continuous with that in respect of which he had been in receipt of benefit prior to 10th May.  Despite a request by the Department, he failed to submit medical evidence supporting this claim until 23rd August.  He was examined by a medical referee on 27th August and again found capable of work.  Since that date no further medical evidence of incapacity has been received in my Department from him.</P>
      <P>The claimant was informed at once of the medical referee's findings and invited, as is the normal procedure, to state the facts and contentions on which he relied in support of his appeal.  This he did on 14th September, 1965 and his appeal was then referred to an appeals officer.  Arrangements have been made for an oral hearing which will take place on 9th of this month.</P>
      <P>I may mention with regard to the last part of the Deputy's question that an increase of disability benefit was claimed in respect of the claimant's wife but no increase has been claimed in respect of qualified children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that through the whole period this man has been attending a hospital in Navan, and that medical evidence proving he is unable to work can be obtained or could be obtained by the Minister's officials from the hospital if desired?  Does he think it fair that someone who was refused a disability benefit in May on the ground that he was not capable of work should still have his claim under consideration in November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular person was found to be not incapable of work by two different medical referees within that period.  It is the normal practice for people claiming disability benefit to submit medical <Col N="823" /> certificates themselves.  It is not normal for the Department&mdash;and not reasonable to expect the Department&mdash;to go looking for the medical certificate.  It is an obligation on the person claiming the benefit to submit the certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not this a continuation of the Minister's attitude that if a person has been declared fit for work, there is no rush to have his case further examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Despite a request from the Department, the medical evidence was not received until 23rd August.  He was examined by a different medical referee on 27th August and again found capable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if this is the only case in which a person was found capable of working on two occasions and was subsequently found to be incapable of working and had to be paid the benefit?  In view of the fact that this happens, would the Minister make every effort to have this matter fully examined?  I believe a great injustice is being done to a very decent man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the latest published returns, insurance companies <Col N="824" /> paid £1,384,000 on claims under employer's liability policies in 1962, and on the basis of conclusions reached by the Commission on Workmen's Compensation, this would include £927,000 in respect of workmen's compensation. There would be a further sum of about £273,000 paid by employers who had not taken out insurance, so that the estimated total paid by way of workmen's compensation would be £1,200,000.</P>
      <P>The annual expenditure on benefits, including pensions, to injured workmen and their dependants under the provisions of the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Bill, 1965, will increase over a period of years before stability is reached.  The estimated expenditure on benefits will, in the long term, amount to about £2,300,000 a year.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain how it is that although the contributions which many employers are being asked to make under the new Act are five times greater than what they are now required to pay, the benefits which will be payable will, apparently, according to the Minister's figures, be less than twice what is now paid?  How come the discrepancy?</P>

Paragraph 7 of the White Paper on manpower policy states that the Government accept that the placement and guidance facilities of this service must be expanded if the service is to play its full part in the development of a manpower policy.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular referred to does not operate as suggested by the Deputy.  It dealt with the printing and publication of statutory instruments and the desirability, in relation to the requirements of the Statutory Instruments Acts, of giving reasonable prior notice of the date of coming into operation of an order of the kind in question to persons likely to be affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This circular was <Col N="836" /> sent out to persons likely to be involved in this operation.  The Agricultural Wages Board was included in the normal routine way and the circular was addressed to it the same as any other Departmental agency concerned. The circular simply drew attention to the desirability of publishing in the widest possible manner all orders and instruments likely to affect people.  It went on to indicate that, where possible, two weeks should be allowed so that the instrument could be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and everybody made aware of what was in the order or instrument concerned, the idea being that if people are to be made liable to penalties, they should at least know what is in the Statutory Instrument before they are made liable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister does not understand.  The draft order referred to is one which would not normally come into operation for two months.  The suggestion was that when the draft order was submitted, the date should then be inserted, giving ample notice.  But the former chairman of the board, who was a member of the Minister's staff, Chief Secretary, did, in fact, say there was no authority for doing that.  Does the Minister now say there is authority for doing it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened was that the circular was received.  At a meeting of the Wages Board on 16th April, 1964, in connection with the making of an amending wages order, the Secretary of the Agricultural Wages Board drew attention to the following extract, Paragraph 21, of the circular, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government regard it as being of the utmost importance that every instrument affecting the public in any way (and in particular every instrument in connection with which penalties may be imposed) should be available to the public not later than the date on which it comes into operation.  Departments should bear in mind the very grave consequences which may follow from failure on their part to ensure that no member of the public may in any <Col N="837" /> circumstances, render himself liable to penalties for an infringement of an instrument without having first had an opportunity of becoming aware of its terms...</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>The chairman indicated that, allowing for adequate publicity, the earliest date on which the order could come into operation would be Monday, 4th May, 1964.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

The chairman drew attention to this Finance circular saying that, in all fairness, everybody likely to be affected by an order should be aware of its contents.  The chairman said that a fortnight, roughly, would be the time involved in giving an opportunity to bring it to the notice of everybody concerned and said that 4th May would be the earliest date that this would be applied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy was fully considered by the council before employing its advertising agents and is kept constantly in mind.  I should explain that the council employs an Irish advertising agency which operates for the council in conjunction with a non-Irish agency with considerable experience in the particular field of dairy products promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the serious disappointment amongst the advertising world in general here that the services of Irish advertisers were not solely relied upon to advertise the sale of Irish milk and creamery products?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The compromise adopted here seems to me to be a reasonable one.  As the Deputy probably knows, when a body of this sort decides to employ an agency it usually invites presentation from a number of agencies.  This council did that and it seemed to them that the presentation put forward by the non-Irish agency was the best.  However, they decided to employ the non-Irish agency and the next best Irish agency jointly.  This arrangement was adopted and seems to have worked satisfactorily.

In addition, casual meal reliefs of up to half an hour per night are allowed and a time allowance of one seventh is made for all attendances between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.  In effect, therefore, the net working week is about 34 hours.</P>
      <P>Male night telephonists attend on five nights weekly, which may include Saturday and/or Sunday as part of the normal working week.

      <P>The scales of pay of full-time male night telephonists, which are weekly scales, and part-time male night telephonists are in the form of a tabular statement which with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  All the rates shown were fixed following acceptance of agreed recommendations in 1964 of the Post Office Departmental Council under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed, by the Cork Health Authority, that there has been no delay in dealing with patients needing urgent chest surgery in St. Stephen's Hospital, Sarsfields-court. Because of shortage of surgical staff, there have been delays of a week or two in cases requiring less urgent surgical treatment.</P>
      <P>There are 50 cardiac cases awaiting investigation, but I am informed that none of these is regarded as urgent from the medical point of view, and that the delay, in this instance, is due in part to the limitation imposed by radiation hazards on the number of cases which can be investigated each week, and in part to pressure on available beds in the thoracic surgical unit.</P>
      <P>Despite persistent efforts by the health authority, there has been great difficulty in recent years in securing sufficient junior surgical staff and nurses for St. Stephen's Hospital.  This is one of the reasons which has now led to a decision to transfer the thoracic surgical unit to St. Finbarr's Hospital, where it will be associated with the general surgical service there. This transfer will take place as soon as some necessary structural alterations, to which I have given my approval, have been made in St. Finbarr's.  The health authority considers that this arrangement should overcome many of the present difficulties, and make it possible to provide a more satisfactory service than at present.</P>

      <P>If an urban housing authority houses an applicant from a county council area on compassionate <Col N="854" /> grounds, can the two-thirds subsidy be withheld on the ground that he could, in fact, have been housed by the county council?  I draw the Minister's attention to sub-clause (a) (v) :&mdash;</P>
      <P>for the accommodation of persons who are in need of housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds if the circumstances of the persons would not permit them to be otherwise housed.</P>
      <P>If an urban authority housed them and they were from a county council area would that debar the urban authority of the two-thirds subsidy because it could be said that they could have been housed by the county council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When we finished the other evening we had been dealing with the question of caravans and the Minister was to have a look at the situation because I felt that in the case of people who were put into caravans, the caravans being temporary dwellings, even if owned by the local authority, they should qualify for a <Col N="855" /> two-thirds subsidy if they were being rehoused because these caravans could be used by the local authority again for housing and no one could claim that the persons were properly housed. I should like the Minister to reply to that point.  There is another angle to this question of subsidy to which I should like the Minister to advert.  Is the subsidy on loan charges as laid down in the Act or is it as it is being administered by the Department? Loan charges at present administered by the Department represent two-thirds of the loss on the housing scheme.  That is not what the Act says but that is exactly what is being done.  When the highest rent which can be charged to a tenant is, in fact, fixed, then the Department pay two-thirds of the difference.  I suggest that the Department should pay two-thirds of the loan charges and that the question of rent should not be fixed until the loan charges are made known.</P>
      <P>I also want the Minister to make clear whether or not the system which is adopted by some local authorities of applying the money they get for loan charges for one scheme of houses to another scheme of houses or to the general rate is legal or should be allowed to continue.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that matter before we go further with the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the caravan question is concerned, where caravans are provided and they have received or are receiving or are about to receive two-thirds subsidy in the provision of those caravans then a person who lived in such a caravan for some time and moved from there to a house would move in the normal way within the council's estate by way of transfer. If, on the other hand, a person was removed from a caravan through an operation of the local authority, this would create a different situation.  But, taking it in the normal way, where they have been housed in a caravan, the caravan has been subsidised, and ultimately they come to get a house, as distinct from a caravan, in part of <Col N="856" /> the local authority's housing estate, their movement from the caravan to the house would be on the basis of transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the caravans provided by some local authorities have, in fact, been subsidised to the extent of two-thirds or is he referring to the development of the caravan sites?  As far as I am aware, no subsidy whatever has been paid by the Minister's Department for caravans provided.  The Minister's officials, I understand, have said that they could be provided only if the council provided them out of the rates.  Deputy Clinton may know something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised the question of caravans initially I had in mind a number of types of caravans. The Minister said he had some difficulty in relation to caravans because of the various types.  We had a number of families well able to pay for a local authority house but we had no local authority house to give them and it would be a considerable time before we would be in a position to put these people into houses.  We have rented caravans for them but they pay the full rent at the present time.  That will be the position of the subsidy when we are moving them out of rented caravans into houses.</P>
      <P>There are several other types of caravan which people have provided for themselves, through their own thrift and endeavour or through the help of friends, while they are awaiting houses.  The people in respect of whom I am seeking this two-thirds subsidy are people who are in caravans because we cannot give them houses and who would not be in caravans if we could.  Surely it is right and proper that the full subsidy should be paid in such cases.  I have not got a clear answer from the Minister on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might clarify it a bit more.  No subsidy has been paid in respect of any caravan up to this moment but a decision has been taken in principle to pay subsidy in respect of caravans that meet certain <Col N="857" /> requirements as to standard.  This would not be known, naturally, to Deputies and possibly this may clarify my statement in regard to my mind in this matter.  There is a decision to pay subsidy in respect of caravans subject to requirements as to standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say he is prepared to pay two-thirds subsidy where people are in caravans because there are no houses available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That surely would be wider than even Deputy Clinton would wish.  Somebody who was moved out of a house because of some operation of a local authority&mdash;condemned, dangerous and so forth&mdash;and who was later provided with a house out of a caravan is subject to a subsidy.  If a two-thirds subsidy were payable at the time of that person's removal from the old house, the fact that in the interim the person may have gone into a caravan will not alter the qualification for a two-thirds subsidy in respect of the new house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come up against this difficulty.  Two or three families have been living in a local authority house.  They built a wooden hut at the back and the subsidy was refused.  Surely a good case cannot be made for refusing the subsidy in such a case.  Because of it the people were charged the full economic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considering and shall be giving further consideration to this subletting problem in all its aspects, including huts in gardens.  I should also mention that in the future the emphasis will be on the need for rehousing, which takes us away from past and present operations in regard to categories.  This, plus the new emphasis on need, should together be <Col N="858" /> capable of meeting possible objections at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give me an assurance on the query I put to him earlier&mdash;I do not think he heard it&mdash;on the situation where a local authority build a housing scheme. The position now is that a two-thirds subsidy or a one-third subsidy, as the case may be, is paid on the deficit rather than the cost.  I suggest that as the Act reads the situation should be that the subsidy is paid and then the rent is fixed on the basis of the deficit. The present system is a reversal of that.  What happens is that the rent is fixed and then the deficit is ascertained and the subsidy paid on that.  That is only one aspect.  The second is the question of switching of subsidies from one scheme to another.  Should the local authority be allowed to switch subsidies from one housing scheme, after they have fixed rent, to another housing scheme?  Could the Minister clarify that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the House that on both of the matters the Deputy has now raised a circular will be issued to the local authorities in the very near future which will clarify the situation and the changes we intend making in regard to both of these matters.  In so far as the deficit mentioned by Deputy Tully is concerned, we have made certain headway in our consideration of it and our decision will be incorporated in the circular. It will be of an advantageous type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>We are now passing a new Housing Bill.  It is practically on the same lines as the last Housing Act which stated almost the same thing as this Bill does but it was not interpreted in that way by the local authorities or the Minister.  Can the Minister not now tell the House the manner in which this is expected to be operated rather than let us be told it at local authority level later? Should not the Minister tell the House during consideration of the Bill if the present system is to be continued or whether the subsidy should be paid on the loss rather than after the rent has been fixed?</P>

      <P>It is a fair enough request but I should like to say that this is not laid down in any Housing Act.  It is not a statutory obligation and has not been so at any time.  The changes I am talking about in regard to the deficit are that this matter of paying the subsidy on a deficit principle will be abandoned or ignored&mdash;will cease to operate&mdash;in so far as rural housing schemes sanctioned before 1960 are concerned and urban schemes sanctioned before 1953.  That is generally what local authorities will be informed in the circular to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is not laid down in any Act, but in subsection (2), in the case of qualified dwellings, the subsection says that the contribution shall not exceed 66? per cent of such annual loan charges.  Will the Minister say how that is related to the system whereby the subsidy is 66? per cent of the deficit?  Why does it not state it, if that is what is meant? Why should we have this in while we are told by both the Department and the local authorities that there is a two-thirds subsidy for those living in condemned houses and a one-third <Col N="860" /> subsidy for others.  The Minister says it is not in the Act.  Here it is, clear enough, in the subsection I have just referred to.  Yet, we have continued this system whereby the Minister does not, in fact, give two-thirds subsidy or one-third subsidy.  He waits until the local authority fix the rent and then he fixes the subsidy on the loss of the houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of what happens after that.  In many cases, the subsidy may not be paid for 12 months and it will be paid only at the rate of £300 a year.  It is related to some other works on the housing scheme.  The result is that some fantastic things have happened at local level.  Either two-thirds is a fact or it is not a fact. If it is a fact, OK, and if it is not a fact, the Minister should say it straight out so that we will know what we are facing.  The Minister should say that it does not mean a thing at all if that is so and that there is a different system under which this takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Not exceeding two-thirds&rdquo; is the expression used.  The Minister is aware&mdash;if he does not believe it I will turn up speeches made by him in which the two-thirds subsidy is referred to&mdash;that if the Department does not mean that, then the ability to pay is what affects the subsidy and that, of course, alters the whole thing. If that is so, then the question of one-third and two-third subsidy should be carefully considered.  There is no point in saying two-thirds in certain circumstances and then coming along afterwards and saying it is a maximum of two-thirds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

Is it two-thirds of the money required to build a house or two-thirds of the deficit that operates?  If the Minister does not know, he can get all the evidence that is required very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to two-thirds <Col N="861" /> of the prescribed figure, which means quite a different thing from two-thirds of the actual cost of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, why should two-thirds be laid down for certain types and one-third for others?  You say &ldquo;up to two-thirds&rdquo;, and you could cover that by the one phrase.  Let me be very honest about this.  There is a bit of hooking going on between the Department of Local Government and the various local authorities on the administration of this subsidy for a number of years and this is an opportunity to try to get it straightened out.  I would like to know also is it right that the subsidy should not be applied to a housing scheme for which it was intended because that is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It baffles me why we are using a system here which is just as complicated at that in relation to rent control and rent restriction in relation to private houses.  It is fair to say&mdash;perhaps it is an underestimation to say it&mdash;that the average cost of a unit of housing accommodation in Dublin at the moment, taking small flats with large flats and small houses with large houses, will run to a minimum of £2,600.  I am simply taking that figure as being an easy one for mathematical purposes.  As I understand this section and subsection (8) to which Deputy Clinton has drawn attention, the effect is somewhat like this: at the moment there is a ceiling of £1,650 on which the Department of Local Government will pay a subsidy, which means that the State will pay a subsidy of two-thirds of the loan charges on £1,650 and will pay nothing towards the loan charges on the additional £1,000 required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of that is this.  The State will pay&mdash;again I am using a rate of interest for convenient mathematics&mdash; 6 per cent, which we know is less than that being charged.  The interest which the State will pay will be £66 per annum.  I think I am right in that.  The local authorities and the Dublin Corporation will be required to pay one-third of the local charges, or £1,650, which will be £33 and 100 per cent of <Col N="862" /> the local charges on the remaining £1,000, producing £66 a year.  Therefore, in the end, the effect of this is that the State is paying 50 per cent for the local charges and the local authorities are paying 50 per cent also.</P>
    <P>As the cost of building has increased, the effect has been to reduce the proportion of the local charges being borne by the State.  As costs are likely to increase rather than decrease in the future, the proportion the local authorities will have to bear&mdash;the tenants, under the new edict will be obliged to bear this&mdash;will increase continuously. We have no reason, from experience of past performances, to believe that the Department will raise their ceiling at the same pace as building costs may increase.  Instead of having all this confusing and complicated mathematics to arrive at a fair distribution of the burden of interest rates, I wonder why we do not take our courage in our hands and say we will have a 50 per cent contribution in respect of the total cost and be done with it once and for all?  I would like to know why this will not be done? It will work out, ultimately, at the same real cost to each of the contributing parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be easier to work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this during the Second Reading debate.  It is completely ridiculous to say we are giving two-thirds of the loan charges. We are not giving anything like that. At the moment, in Dublin County, we are giving 50 per cent and I would not be prepared, like Deputy Ryan, to settle for 50 per cent.  Nevertheless, I consider we should have one figure, if at all possible, and none of this argument at all times about what sort of caravan, what sort of house or what sort of applicant wherever local authority housing is provided.  It will be a question of need in the future; need will be the yardstick.  If we agree on the need for housing, it would be much better to eliminate all arguments and have a flat percentage of the actual cost of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got tenders in Dublin <Col N="863" /> County for housing at £2,300.  That does not include the cost of the site or its development.  The ceiling here is £1,650.  It is quite obvious we will pay 100 per cent on anything up to £1,000.  The thing is unrealistic and it is unrealistic to talk about two-thirds subsidy.  When people make inquiries, they are told the State is giving two-thirds. Of course they are not.  They are not giving 50 per cent and it is time the Minister, for his own satisfaction, did something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So many questions have been asked that it is rather difficult to answer without leaving some out.  Deputy James Tully spoke about deficits and the principle of deficit.  As far as I understand the principle&mdash;it is quite involved&mdash;it was designed to ensure that local authorities did not make a profit out of this operation.  In addition to this, it has also had the effect that there has been little encouragement to them in the past to get more money into the housing account.  Theoretically, where the balance was favourable, the State should have gained; but, in fact, in most cases the balance is unfavourable. The change, about which we will be notifying local authorities in a circular, is that in future if there is a surplus on the housing account, the benefit will go to the local authority for the relief of rates and will not as at present be credited to the central authority.  We are losing nothing here because we never got anything.  I do not mind if Deputy Tully shakes his head because I think there is something here for the local authorities. This change will be in respect of urban houses, approval for which issued before a certain date in 1953, and in respect of rural houses, approval for which issued before some date in 1960. This is not as empty as Deputy Tully appears to think it is.</P>

      <P>You asked for this.  I did not volunteer it.  Deputy Tully also raised the question of the switching of subsidies.  The subsidy is allowed in <Col N="864" /> respect of the provision of a particular house.  The first tenant, who would be the qualifying tenant, may disappear out of the house and it may be occupied by God knows who.  However, the actual subsidy in respect of the house does not alter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often a bulking of the subsidy takes place in a scheme. Subsidies of 33? and higher are bulked together and a graded rent scheme or something on that line is devised on that basis.  Having taken credit as a whole for the subsidy due to them, the local authority does not pass on the benefit to the individual who qualifies for the higher or the lower subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is the actual cost or not, if we were to give a flat figure, obviously it would have to be lower.  It is true in respect of Dublin <Col N="865" /> city and county and some other areas the application of the figure of 66? under the general regulations and the prescribed figure for subsidisable costs means that, in effect, they are getting only 50 per cent.  But it is also true that other local authorities have been able to build at lower costs and benefit by the 66? per cent.  If we were to fix a flat figure, we would be penalising those people while not improving the position in Dublin and the other highcost centres.  It is for this reason we retain the description not exceeding the higher figure rather than fixing a lower percentage.  That is why I think we should not pursue the other course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the danger the Minister speaks of.  In parts of the country, because labour costs are lower, it has been possible to derive greater advantage by accepting the 66? because the ceiling was much nearer the actual cost than in Dublin. But I am not asking for a figure that would represent the same thing.  I would like to see a flat figure&mdash;one subsidy&mdash;rather than having all this argument about what qualifies and what does not qualify.  Anybody in need of a house, anybody for whom a house is built, should qualify for a fixed subsidy.  If that subsidy were fixed at a level that would not injure the districts the Minister has in mind, it would give us as much, if not more, than we have at present.  The two-thirds and the £1,650 were fixed some time ago.  Since then prices have been increasing and there is now justification for some advance on the 66?.  If we decide to have one figure&mdash;not one-third or two-thirds but in between &mdash;it should represent an improvement, eliminate administrative difficulties and provide a more satisfactory arrangement for local authorities as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he intends to alter the system of subsidy in a certain way for the purpose of allowing a housing authority, to put it plainly, to make some money on the deal.  The Minister must be aware that this is not possible.  At the moment the system is operated exactly as he states.  The <Col N="866" /> Minister waits until the rent is fixed and then pays two-thirds of the loan charges.  I should like him to explain how he proposes to deal with the situation in order to allow the local authority to make money on the deal because, unless he does what is set down here and pays a stipulated sum, either one-third or two-thirds, there is no hope of anybody making any money on the deal.</P>
      <P>The Minister is far too honest to deny that the Department have, by switching things round to suit themselves, got their housing carried on with the least possible expense to the Department.  They, first of all, make a regulation stating that the amount can be two-thirds for certain people and one-third for certain others.  Then there is a limit put.  We are now reaching the stage very fast, as Deputy Clinton has pointed out, at which it will not be possible to get a subsidy on local authority houses because, if the information I have got about rural cottages recently advertised is correct, it means the limit for urban houses is now being reached by contractors contracting for single-roomed rural cottages costing £1,650.  A few years ago the same cottage was quoted at £800, £900, £1,000, £1,100, £1,200.</P>

      <P>The one-third subsidy and the two-thirds subsidy can all be lumped together and a common rent fixed.  The Minister went further and said that it will be quite in order when a scheme is completed and the rents fixed, according as the people come from overcrowded or condemned houses, for the local authority to switch the subsidy they get on the scheme of houses to another scheme catering for a different type of person altogether.  So long as their housing property is OK, the Minister does not mind what way they switch the subsidies around.  That defeats the idea of the subsidy altogether.  The idea was the Department would pay a certain subsidy so that people living in condemned or overcrowded houses could be properly housed.  The Minister now says that that subsidy need not be applied to that particular type of house; it can be applied to a different scheme altogether.  Not intentionally, perhaps, the Minister is, I think, trying to get away from the question we first asked: is it intended to do away with the present system altogether of one-third for those in normal houses and two-thirds for those in condemned or overcrowded houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made the point about the new system which will enable local authorities to make money on the deal.  I do not believe local authorities will be able to make money out of this.  Secondly, I do not think the Department should do this sort of thing.  The Department should state the amount of money they are <Col N="868" /> prepared to pay and the rent should be fixed after the money is paid.  The opposite is the case.  The rent is fixed first and then the Department put in their subsidy and, instead of paying pounds, they are actually paying shillings and pence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Tully, though both of us are probably moving in the same direction. Surely it is the ability of the tenant to pay the rent that is the important factor?  If there is an obligation to pay a supplement, either State or local authority, surely it is not unreasonable that the tenant should pay according to his ability?  What is wrong then in fixing the rent in advance of the payment?  I believe rents should be fixed on the basis of the ability of the tenants to pay.  The big question is: are they fixed in that way?  They should be.  If they are, then the amount coming is not really an issue.  Once a decision has been taken on the amount of rent based on the ability of the tenant, then the State and the local authority make up the difference.  That is the only fair basis.  What Deputy Tully has said is indicative of a certain mentality all too often encountered; we will see what we get from the Government; we will see what we can provide from the rates and then we will see what we will charge the tenant.  The first question should be what can the tenant pay and, after that, the difference can be found between the State and the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that the subsidy is taken from one house and put on to another house, but, in regard to certain priorities and certain operations on the part of local authorities, we are prepared to provide certain subsidies not exceeding 66? per cent on a figure up to £1,650, or whatever it may be. Thereafter, we are not primarily concerned, and should not, I think, concern ourselves in central Government with the actual use of the subsidy provided.  We give it to the local authority and they then, in their wisdom, can apply it as they think fit. It is advisable they should look on housing <i>in toto</i> rather than as separate, <Col N="869" /> unrelated schemes.  The total subsidy should be regarded as revenue coming in and what we pay by way of subsidy should be regarded as total revenue from State sources and the total rents should be regarded as the other contributory factor and they themselves are contributing a third part from the rates.</P>
    <P>I can see nothing wrong with this; in fact, I can see many things that would be helpful to the local authorities in this approach.  They are to be encouraged in this direction rather than discouraged provided they have due regard at all times to their primary and greatest responsibility which is to provide houses for the least well off living in the worst housing conditions.  The important thing is how the local authority house their people, how they charge their people for the housing they give them, always bearing in mind the burden on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The ability of the tenant to pay is a matter of paramount importance.  It is not unreasonable that the tenant of the house should be expected to pay but those who are not able to pay what their graded rents may now be should have those rents reduced so that they can afford to pay them.  This is where I and many of our local authority people differ at the moment but I do not think we shall always differ.  We shall be of one mind on this question in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some enlightenment from the Minister on the question of the 66? per cent of the loan charges.  While this has been there for quite a long time from the point of view of subsidising local authorities and is supposed to be paid in cases where the tenants of the house come under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, there is also in being an administrative practice which reduces the 66? per cent very considerably. I should like some enlightenment from the Minister as to how he proposes to depart from what has been the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the city of Dublin as an example, it is a good many years since <Col N="870" /> anyone was housed who was not really entitled to be housed on the 66? per cent basis.  Because of certain physical development and a failure which to a great extent may be attributed to lack of control in the national body, for quite a number of years the only people housed in the city of Dublin were people who were living in overcrowded conditions, who were living in houses unfit for habitation, who were living in dwellings which became dangerous and had to be removed, or were living in circumstances where members of the family were suffering from tuberculosis and were certified as having to be housed.</P>
    <P>In recent years while the cost of housing has been going up fairly steadily and while the 66? per cent might be considered a reasonable rate of assistance in relation to a house costing £1,650, when the house costs £2,200 or £2,300, the 66? per cent depreciates very rapidly, so that we have reached a situation that in no case practically has the percentage of the actual cost of a modern house been paid.  There is also the question as to whether the 66? per cent relates merely to loan charges on dwellings or whether it should also include the cost or acquisition and development.  Take the situation where dwellings such as flats are provided.  We are aware of the fact that the maximum on which the 66? per cent was paid for flats went up to £2,200.  At the same time, the cost of constructing the flat went away up over £4,000.  Therefore, a subsidy of 66? per cent on a maximum of £2,200 when applied to a flat which has cost £4,400 really amounts to 50 per cent.  Therefore, if people are to be provided with dwellings which they can reasonably afford to rent, the difference has to be found by the local authority, and this sliding scale has been continuing to the disadvantage of the tenant and prospective tenants and to the disadvantage of the people who contribute to the local rates.  It is not a fair picture to talk in terms of a subsidy from national funds of 66? per cent unless in the normal housing case that subsidy amounts to that percentage of the cost.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is reasonable at <Col N="871" /> this stage, as far as my own local authority is concerned anyway, to talk in terms, under the section, of 33? per cent in other cases than those set down in subsections (3), (4) and (5). All those being housed in local authority dwellings by Dublin Corporation and, I suppose, by every other local authority, are people who are being housed only because they are not able to provide suitable dwellings from their own resources.  For the past three years, the bulk of them have come from dangerous buildings.  If and when that situation improves, we can go on to housing people from unfit dwellings, people certified by the medical officer to be in need of houses and also families living in overcrowded conditions. Personally, I do not see any argument in favour of continuing this one-third for other cases, but I should like at this stage to interrupt my remarks in order to give the Minister an opportunity of indicating whether he proposes to lift that ceiling and place it at £1,650 and £2,200 but on the actual cost and whether the 66? per cent is to apply to the actual cost of providing the dwelling and all that that entails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To give a flat answer to a direct question, I may say that I have no intention of relating the 66? per cent to the actual cost, for the reason that the costs are much too high, higher than they should be, and Deputy Larkin is quite well aware of this, particularly in the operations of his local authority.  It applies with like emphasis to other local authorities but not with equal emphasis to the operations of all local authorities.  There is no doubt that there are variations in costs that cannot be accounted for, either as to labour or material or anything else.  I certainly would not follow the spiral of costs right up to the £4,000, or £5,000, or £6,000 brackets for providing a flat in Dublin or anywhere else, no matter what amount of money I had at my disposal, because I do not think that adding fuel to the fire is going to damp it down.  That is the only reason we have the 66? per cent tagged down and I have no intention of going after prices.</P>

      <P>We have already appealed to the Minister to do what Deputy Larkin is looking for and I wonder if he could not meet us in some way.  He accepted the fact that this ceiling of £1,650 has operated to the disadvantage of the Dublin region and other similar regions to a much greater extent than it has operated to the disadvantage of the remainder of the country.  He accepted this in a practical way in the private sector, realising that houses are costing a good deal more in Dublin and certain other regions than in the country as a whole, by allowing an extra £200 loan in these regions.  Whatever the Minister thinks about costs being too high, and perhaps we could agree with him, they are secured as a result of competitive tender and those are open to the whole country.  The local authorities can do no more than that. Often we advertise twice for tenders. Perhaps the Minister may be dissatisfied with the first tenders.  This has often gone on for a long period and the last stage is much worse than the first because all the time costs are increasing.  If they are not competitive tenders, they are the keenest prices we can get.  In those circumstances, would the Minister not consider, in regard to the regions where he knows that this is a fact, that houses are costing too much, increasing that ceiling by at least a couple of hundred pounds?  That would be meeting the situation half-way?</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton <Col N="873" /> is correct in saying that it is necessary to increase the ceiling above the £1,600.  If the two-thirds subsidy is not to be paid, it does not matter a lot because it is on the deficit that the subsidy is being paid, if any is being paid at all, and having the Department write to a manager telling him what he can do, instead of writing it into this section, will not improve the matter. All relevant matters should be discussed in this Bill and the Minister should supply Members of the House with copies of that circular before it goes to the managers because many of us here are members of local authorities and when we go down to these local authorities, we are told this is what the Department of Local Government say and it does not matter what the Minister says across the floor of this House.  That does not count because it is what the manager has that we will have to go by.  I would ask the Minister to do something about the payment of the subsidy on the actual cost of the house.</P>

In regard to this question of the deficit, no matter what Deputy Tully may say, the fact is that the subsidy is not paid on the deficit. Let me put it this way: of all the subsidies paid, taking the country as a whole, over 90 per cent in fact is the high subsidy and less than ten per cent is the low subsidy.  Out of a total subsidy payment of £2,700,000, only £40,000 arises or has any bearing in regard to the deficit.  That is the figure and if this is not so, then we are missing £660,000 somewhere.</P>

I cannot see how the Minister can say that the deficit does not come into this.  He said earlier that the local authorities cannot make any money on it.  If in fact the rent is fixed before the subsidy is declared, if the houses are built and the rent is fixed and what is left over is considered for subsidy purposes, how can the Minister say that the deficit does not come into it?

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information and it is not my experience. The Minister referred earlier to the question of the one-third subsidy and the two-thirds subsidy. If I understood him rightly, he asked how would the local authority be expected to relate the subsidy to a particular house, and said that it was to the income that the rent should be related.  He also said there was not much inducement, without the operation of this section, to take people out of condemned houses.  What is the whole idea of having a one-third subsidy or a two-thirds subsidy, if, in fact, the only factor to be taken into consideration when the rent is being fixed is the income of the person concerned?  I do not know what advice the Minister has got, or what particulars he has with him.  I am sure he has fairly good information, but I am quite satisfied that the two sets of facts do not run together. There must be a mistake either in <Col N="875" /> one or the other.  Luckily, this Bill will not be finished with too soon and we will have an opportunity of having another look at the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow the line taken by Deputy Tully.  I am satisfied that in my local authority the approach followed is the approach outlined by Deputy Tully.  As I understand the position&mdash;and I would be very pleased to know that I am wrong &mdash;if in respect of houses built last year in Coolock the manager fixed rents which were full economic rents, there would not be one single red cent of subsidy in respect of those houses.  There would be no subsidy on those dwellings.  As I understand the position also in each scheme, in the operation of finding out what subsidy will be got from the State, some of the people on both sides of the fence are developing into experts, because each scheme has to be examined, and the financial effects following from the rents to be paid by the tenants have to be measured.</P>
      <P>The representatives of the local authority have to trot down to the Department with each and every scheme to discuss them in detail, and a decision as to what subsidy will be granted to the local authority concerned is made only when all the income and expenditure are shown.  This means that in relation to a local authority such as Dublin Corporation dozens and dozens of schemes have to be examined and re-examined practically every year.  In respect of a scheme of houses built last year or the year before, no one in the local authority can know what the actual subsidy to be paid from Central Government funds will be.  The theory is that it will be 66? per cent up to a maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully, other Deputies and I have been raising two different aspects of this matter.  One is the question of the justification for relating the subsidy in a more realistic manner to the cost of producing houses.  The Minister has been frank with us this afternoon.  He told us that the prices of dwellings have gone up, and have gone up unjustifiably <Col N="876" /> to a great extent.  I should like to know what the Minister has been doing in this regard.  What protection has he been trying to provide for people who are affected by this unjustified increase in prices.  I have not seen very much evidence of any great activity on his part, or on the part of the Department in this regard.  Every proposal by a local authority to build any kind of dwelling requires and gets the sanction of the Minister before the contract is given out.  There is again the general question of the failure to do anything about the price of houses for another section of the people who are faced with this problem.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter of the subsidies.  In regard to subsidies to local authorities for the provision of housing, why is it necessary to continue the present elaborate and most confusing method?  If the Minister is going to give a subsidy of 66? or 50 per cent to the local authority, why can it not be done by way of deduction?  It might well ease the administration problem fairly considerably if a different method were used.  At present if a local authority decide they want to build 300 dwellings, they get sanction to build in due course, and they get sanction to raise a mortgage from the Local Loans Fund.  If those 300 dwellings qualify for the 66? per cent subsidy, surely it would be more sensible to think in terms of trying to introduce a short cut and not have the process of the local authority being lent the money required and having to pay it back into the Local Loans Fund in a most elaborate and unnecessary procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister answered my question quite frankly in regard to the section. Even if this 66? per cent subsidy were paid in full&mdash;which is subject to very serious doubt&mdash;he does not intend that that figure shall be the maximum.  He made it clear that he has no intention of increasing the maximum.  It is quite clear to me, and it must be clear to everyone inside and outside this House, that the Minister is endeavouring to use pressure to compel local authorities to increase the level of their rents; in <Col N="877" /> other words, to compel the city manager or the county manager to impose higher rents.  The initiative towards this end is coming directly from the Minister and from no one else.</P>
    <P>In this matter, might I remind the Minister of the problem facing the local authority in Dublin at this present time in housing ordinary families who come under the old term, which is now going out, the Housing of the Working Classes Act?  In many cases, they are compelled to provide dwellings for them some miles away from the place of employment.  In such circumstances, the additional cost falling on the members of the family, where the father has to go to work five or six miles away, or the cost falling on the other members, the children attending school, and so on, is no little financial burden on the average family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of loan charges is very important in this regard.  In order to provide some easement for the families affected by these circumstances, the Minister should, in looking at the loan charges, do as has been suggested by Deputy Tully.  He should make sure that the full percentage of subsidy set out in the Bill is actually given to local authorities and, because of the necessity to provide assistance to all the thousands of families affected by this, he should consider increasing the maximum and not leave the present maxima of 66? per cent, £1,650 and £2,200 in the Bill. Unless that 66? per cent is related to the actual cost, then a subsidy of that amount in respect of a flat in an area where it may cost £30,000 or £40,000 to acquire the site alone and where the development costs may be very heavy indeed means that either the local ratepayers have to bear an added burden or the tenants will be required to pay rents which they can by no stretch of imagination meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise a further point, particularly in regard to the question of <Col N="878" /> flats.  In the city of Dublin, there are many buildings that require replacement. Many of them are privately-owned. Many of them are publicly-owned. Some of them were re-built in 1940, reconditioned dwellings which, now again, unfortunately, have become tenements.  These need to be replaced. If they are to be replaced by flats, is it suggested that the people living in those dwellings could meet the types of rent which would arise from the Minister's directive and from the contents of this Housing Bill?  The result of failure to deal with this matter in a realistic way and in a way that takes into regard living conditions and the need to improve these living conditions means inevitably that all the millions of money spent in trying to provide accommodation will, to some extent, be wasted because we should be creating conditions which would encourage overcrowding in corporation dwellings.  I want, again, in regard to this matter, to ask the Minister to re-examine this particular situation in the light of the need to increase the maximum and to re-examine it particularly in the light of the problems of providing dwellings in the central city areas where people need to live in order to be near their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Larkin is less than fair to the Minister's statement that he would not increase the subsidy maximum.  Practically everybody who spoke here this evening said that building costs are too high and one hears the same argument outside. The builders complain that the costs are too high because of labour costs.  The workers say that excessive profits are being made or perhaps there is profiteering in land.  Somewhere among all the accusations lies the truth.  The Minister should try to stop the spiral in house prices and give increased grants.  The present Minister helped out my local authority, Dublin Corporation, by including the sub-tenants in the full subsidy.  For many years, we got no subsidy in respect of them and if you housed a sub-tenants, you did it at a cost to the rates and not a Government subsidy. Deputy Larkin mentions rents <Col N="879" /> generally, but the corporation have introduced no new scheme of rents since 1950.  Certain charges have been added for rates, and so on, but the new scheme has not been adopted yet.</P>
      <P>Consider the frightful rents being charged by private landlords.  I merely mention that point to stress the very urgent need to press forward with the building programme so that each family entitled to a house or flat may get it, irrespective of how it is financed. Years ago, the corporation may have seemed very generous in housing people but we are coming to realise now that in fact we have been penalising a very needy section of our people. Take a man in this city with two children.  We cannot house them.  Even though he may be a semi-skilled labourer, drawing £11 a week, we have not a house for him.  Yet, somebody with more children, but who is much more affluent, will be given a house without question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just referring to the matter of subsidy.  While the Minister's blank refusal to increase the subsidy may, to some, seem harsh, at the same time there is a lot of sense in his attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Clinton's request that the Minister meet the difficulty in Dublin and areas of greater pressure by giving a greater subsidy in respect of those areas.  Subsection (8) permits the Minister to do so because he may, in the preparation of these regulations, consider different provisions for different areas.  That would appear to justify a higher ceiling in areas of greater demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think, in one way, that the interest subsidy paid by the State was a significant factor in the cost of house building.  If that had any effect, good, bad or indifferent, I would be amazed.  I do not think it in any way creates any pressure on the cost of house building whether the State gives a complete subsidy or no subsidy at all.  The pressures which determine <Col N="880" /> building costs are entirely different.  Therefore, I can see no benefit at all in the Minister's attempted justification of the preservation of the present levels when he says that he will not increase the cost of building by making a greater contribution towards the loan subsidies.  I can find other reasons, such as that the Minister might not wish at a time when there is a credit squeeze to increase the burden the State has to meet.  Rather than that, however, he advances as a reason something which cannot remotely be said to have any bearing on building costs, that is to say, upon the tenders and prices which we receive from people who are invited to build.  These have something to do with other factors but certainly not to the contribution which the State may make.  We might, perhaps, relieve the position in Dublin and areas of greater pressure if the Minister were to provide additional assistance in those areas.</P>

      <P>I believe that the interpretation of this section stands or falls on subsection (4) (b)&mdash;&ldquo;conditions as to building standards.&rdquo;  I was wondering what progress the Minister's Department has made in having the national code of building regulations under the Planning and Development Act of 1963 framed.  I believe it would be of great importance in the interpretation of this section.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position for me.</P>

      <P>In answering Deputies Larkin and Andrews, and particularly Deputy Larkin, on this question of house prices being too high, I shall not enter into any argument as to whether or not prices are too high but I think everybody is fully agreed that there is more being paid or asked for than in fact the product is worth today.  The question is: what am I doing about it. I hope I have been doing some little about it, which is more than can be said for most of those who ask me the question.  A review of standards and designs is currently going on in my Department and An Foras Forbartha are endeavouring to reduce the loan costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are a lot of blackbirds, Deputy Tully will always see a white one somewhere.  In addition, I have initiated proposals from system builders and have rationalised building systems.  A number of these proposals have been examined and I think the majority of new houses have benefited from them.  I might say that up to 100 such proposals were submitted from one source or another indicating various forms of construction.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Andrews, another matter to which we are currently attending, is this question of national building standards.  That has for some considerable number of months past been pursued with the utmost vigour to try to produce this new building code for the good of all concerned, not the least of which will be the bringing about of uniformity of approach throughout the country as well as a beneficial effect in regard to prices in certain respects.  Further, modular coordination&mdash;which is another matter which shows itself to be of great value in other countries&mdash;is being pursued by a working party for some considerable time.  I expect to have a report from them in the not too distant future.  I should add that consideration, and indeed sympathetic consideration, of any further proposition to reduce costs while maintaining standards will be welcomed.  This is something enunciated by me quite a number of years ago.  Indeed it is just four years ago that I first went out on this limb, seeking new methods and ways of doing this rather than adopting the traditional method maintained for hundreds of years.</P>
      <P>I have also introduced during these past few years, grants for prototype builders which I thought would have the merit of speeding erection and reducing costs while maintaining reasonable standards of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also, in my Department, engaged ourselves on the question of site costs as they relate particularly to the built-up and urban areas, and are providing, in this measure before the <Col N="882" /> House, site subsidy for the first time. Refusal to sanction exorbitant tenders after all sorts of pressure over a number of years has not been the least of the charges and, in some cases, I have been charged that it cost more because prices had gone up in the meantime.  It is rather too easy a conclusion to draw that just because this happens in one or two cases, the general overall effect has been wasted.  If I and my colleagues were to accept all tenders, no matter how exorbitant, it would be ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I have also been trying to encourage builders of private houses to build houses of moderate standards as distinct from the dressed-up versions which were produced in greater number because there were sufficient people around with more than sufficient to pay and indeed more than many of them could really afford.  This effort is, I think, even at this moment paying off, in that a number of our builders have in fact moved over to the production of less pretentious houses and are bringing prices down to the level of the people who require them rather than up to the level of those who can afford to pay exorbitant prices, as has been the practice in the market for the past four or five years. That is an answer, in some degree, to Deputy Larkin's charges as to what I am doing about these things.</P>
    <P>Getting back to this really important matter which is related to the section, the question of subsidy and its relationship to rents, rates and taxes, I wonder has Deputy Larkin stopped to consider that the rates of Dublin this year are probably paying about £1 million towards the builders of the housing estates of Dublin Corporation. The Dublin local authority's house rents scheme is, I know, in the melting pot at the moment awaiting some changes because of the very poor comparison with other parts of the country.  Further under the differential rents scheme the maximum rent in Dublin is 25/-.  Deputy Tully shakes his head and I do not blame him.  If he fell down, I should not be surprised but this is, in fact, generally the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way. If I give you Cork, Limerick and Waterford in the same context, perhaps it may highlight the situation whether you agree the figure covers this, that or the other.  The Cork maximum would be 65/-; Limerick, 62/8; Waterford, 53/- and Dublin on that table, would read 25/-.  I do not want you to believe me, I am simply stating the figures which you can believe if you wish.  It makes no difference to me.  The difference is to the Dublin housing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a rate element in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all plus rates. That is why I say comparatively the figures are, Cork, 65/-; Limerick, 62/-; Waterford, 53/- and Dublin 25/- and that has to be taken against the background of £1 million on the rates and £800,000 from the taxpayer and a huge backlog of housing yet to be provided.  How and by whom can the houses be paid for?  Is there some source yet not fully tapped to enable the Dublin housing authority, the Corporation, to go on with an expanding programme of housing?  The charge that I am directing the managers to increase rents is terribly far from the truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  If any corporation or county council believe their rates can bear more than they are at present bearing&mdash;and I have not heard of them saying they can, for any purpose&mdash;they can put on another 2/6 or 3/- for housing and keep their rents realistic.  I am not going to say: &ldquo;You must put up the rents and take down the rates&rdquo;.  This is a matter for the ratepayers' representatives which all Deputies are, who are members of local authorities.  It must be their decision and I cannot make it for them. Am I to accept it if Deputy Larkin passes the bill across to me that I am the person responsible for having rents increased?  I am simply outlining the figures for the Deputy's housing authority and saying why I believe it is inevitable, in all justice and equity, that rents in the differential rents schemes in Dublin must be brought up to realistic figures so that the housing authority will be enabled financially by greater contributions from those who are able to pay, to provide houses for the great number yet unprovided for and who are not able to pay even the minimum rent.</P>
      <P>If we do not do this, the whole system of providing houses will collapse. For that reason, I say the taxpayer is paying his share and the ratepayer, according to everybody, is paying more than his share, and until the housing authorities have demonstrated by a realistic re-appraisal of rents that their tenants cannot pay any more, that those who are better off are paying what they can afford, I do not see how we can make a case to either taxpayers or ratepayers that they should contribute more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three parties involved, the tenants, the ratepayers and the taxpayers, and if two are carrying a great burden or as much as they can be expected to carry, one is entitled to examine realistically the position of the third party and see how much they can carry.  If it can be demonstrated that they cannot carry any more, then we can look around for some other solution, but until that is done there <Col N="885" /> is very little case for coming here and blaming the Minister for Local Government for putting up rents.  Do not put them up and do not raise the rates and you stop building.  That is the answer, not to say that the Minister for Local Government is making you put up rents.  What I am doing is pointing out some of the ways you must travel if you are to succeed in providing the housing that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he stated in this House that if local authorities did not increase their rents, he would have to reconsider the question of further subsidy of new housing in the area?  Was that not, in fact, said, that if the local authorities did not increase the rents, he would prevent them from building more houses?  Was that not, in effect, telling the local authorities that they must make the tenants pay more?

      <P>Let the public judge it.  There is another issue.  Many people apparently think in the same way as the Minister.  They talk about the ratepayers and about the tenants as if they were two different types of people.  The Minister seems to forget that the biggest ratepayers in most of the local authority areas are, in fact, tenants of local authority houses and they are paying without any remission of any kind more rates for the accommodation they have than anybody else. The person who builds his own house gets his grant and partial rates remission for ten years but the local authority tenant who is put into a house pays what is now recognised as hefty rent and rates from the first day he goes in.  The Minister should look at the facts and not give the impression that these tenants are parasites living on the backs of certain other people who are carrying them.</P>
      <P>We who are members of local authorities have been looking at this situation for a long time and we know the situation.  The Minister says the maximum differential rent in Dublin is 25/- a week.  The Minister says that.  I am sure he will be able to prove it; he did not prove it.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that qualified secondary and vocational teachers who are nationals of Ireland and who have had suitable teaching experience in Northern Ireland or Britain should on returning to teach here, be given credit on a basis commensurate with their services in these areas for the purpose of computing salary payable by the Department of Education, and that similar credit should be given to those who have already returned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since last week, I have had a communication from a teacher in Meath which highlights the need for the reform suggested in the motion.  It deals with the case of a qualified teacher who claims, and appears to me to substantiate his claim, that the experience required under the regulations of the Department for the newly-recognised posts in physical education can be obtained only outside this country. I should like, if I may, to quote from his letter which I shall gladly pass <Col N="888" /> over to the Minister and I will be grateful if he would look into this gentleman's case.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>The qualifications which the Department of Education will accept for appointment as a secondary teacher of physical education cannot be gained in this country.  Secondly, the experience necessary after becoming qualified can only be realised fully in England or Northern Ireland, where the newly-qualified specialist can work with experienced physical education specialists, have the benefit of advice and direction from county organisers of physical education and inspectors from the Ministry of Education and consolidate his ideas and philosophy by being in constant touch with his colleagues in the area in which he teaches.  Thirdly, the specialist needs to be kept in contact with the latest developments in the teaching of his subject by attending conferences, short courses and reading all the relevant periodicals published by physical education associations in England and America.</P>
      <P>Hence, the specialist in physical education must go abroad for his training and experience and to keep abreast of the latest trends.</P>
      <P>The Department recognised my qualifications for purposes of registration as a secondary teacher but refused to recognise my teaching experience in England.  This meant that when I accepted an appointment as director of physical education in a secondary school here, I had to start as a probationer.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say that his salary was reduced from the £1,090 he was earning in England to £500 when he came back here.  This man is one of the few full-time teachers of physical education recognised as such by the Minister's Department and his case has been very fully considered by the Minister's Department.  I shall pass his letter to the Minister and hope he will look into the case sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House can be justified on educational grounds, but I want to emphasise at this stage an aspect which I did not advert to at any <Col N="889" /> great length last week, that is, the humanitarian aspect of the proposal. It behoves us here to have great sympathy with and concern for the position of the Irish national who is compelled by economic necessity to seek employment in England and who after six, eight or ten years working in England, is anxious to return to this country in order to bring up his children in a decent environment.  We must have the greatest compassionate consideration for such a person.  To expect a man of 35 or 40 years of age with a family of young children whom he wants to be reared in Ireland in Christian conditions to return here and to work for £500 a year is absolutely miserable.</P>
    <P>Despite all the difficulties and disadvantages which confront them, some hardy spirits have returned and have started working at the bottom of the scale.  To quite an extent we are indebted to qualified lay teachers who have returned from England, bought old houses in small country towns and established secondary schools in areas that were not otherwise catered for as far as secondary education is concerned because of their smallness and the fact that it is not feasible for religious communities to cater for very small numbers.  We are indebted to people who have established schools in remote places.  They are making great progress and most of them are thriving.  But taking the generality of our graduates in England, if they wish to return to this country, they start on a salary of £500 a year.  For married men with children, that is an impossible position.</P>
    <P>There is a great scarcity of well-qualified teachers in the technological fields and in the applied subjects of science and mathematics.  I learned from information given by the Minister's predecessor in reply to a Parliamentary Question some time ago that of 700 full-time teachers of mathematics only 30 are honours graduates. Honours graduates leaving the universities well qualified in mathematics and science are going into all sorts of boring jobs.  One of the most boring jobs available at present is in the <Col N="890" /> meteorological service and there are a number of splendidly qualified persons bored stiff in that service when the field in which they would wish to operate is the teaching profession where there is such great need for them.  In the principal Dublin technological school at present, there are 16 vacancies on the teaching staff which have been advertised more than once. There is an acute scarcity of teachers while men in England are only too anxious to come home to take up the vacant jobs.  I think it is true that in the technical schools very limited recognition of English service may be granted by the Department.  However, it is very limited indeed and obviously does not meet the needs of the situation. Otherwise the 16 vacancies I have referred to would not exist.</P>
    <P>I spoke last week of a motion passed at a meeting of Education Ministers of Europe, a body which is an offshoot of the Council of Europe.  The motion was passed in the presence of Dr. Hillery.  It called for free interchangeability of teachers throughout Europe. I had hoped to obtain a copy of that motion but have been unable to do so. I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten us on its terms.  I do not wish to repeat what I said last week about it.  It is stupid of us to endorse such pious aspirations at international conferences unless we make it possible to implement the proposals. I hope the present Minister will do what his predecessor failed to do in this respect.</P>
    <P>At present, certain limited recognition of foreign service is available for lay people who have taught in Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania.  Strangely enough, it is not extended to religious. It is an attempt to make it easy for our graduates to go to these under-developed countries for a short period. However, that scheme again is hedged with restrictions and I shall bring before the Minister later a most unfortunate case of an individual, a former constituent of mine, who went to Tanzania, believing his service there would be recognised.  He taught in a first-class Catholic diocesan school but because it is a school not under Government control, the Minister's <Col N="891" /> officials refused to grant recognition. They must have known that Catholic schools in Tanzania are deliberately kept free from Government control for very sound reasons.  Tanzania has a radical Government, very near to being a Communist one and the less Catholic schools have to do with the Government, the happier position they are in.  That is a typical example of bureaucratic bungling.  I have a considerable file on that case.</P>
    <P>With the Minister's predecessor, I was only beating my head against a stone wall.  I shall bring this case to the attention of the present Minister. Of course the question of Tanzania or Nigeria is beside the point at the moment.  There is also limited recognition for service of one year as a teacher of a foreign language&mdash;Irish nationals who go to France or Germany, the country of their specialty. Therefore, there is not a new principle involved in acceptance of this motion.</P>
    <P>Since the motion was first put on the Order Paper three years ago, the Minister's predecessor saw the light of reason and granted limited recognition for service in Northern Ireland under which seven teachers now working in the Republic have derived benefit. Here again, the scheme of recognition is hedged with restrictions of all kinds. It is not retrospective.  Recognition is only in respect of service gained after 31st July, 1962.  I cannot see the rationality of that.  If there are people in the North anxious to come back, why should not they be given credit for five years service, even though it was prior to the introduction of the scheme in 1962?</P>
    <P>I know the Christian Brothers' school in Harding Street, Belfast. They have on the staff many honours graduates from University College, Cork.  I suppose the average Cork graduate, when he became qualified and went to England, had little or no intention of ever taking up service in Belfast but years of service in Britain convinced them that even Belfast is preferable to returning home.  There are, in any event, by some quirk or other, a large number of Cork graduates working with the Christian <Col N="892" /> Brothers in Belfast.  They would be anxious to come back without doubt.</P>
    <P>The religious orders, particularly the Christian Brothers, are among those who would gain substantially from acceptance of this motion.  It is true to say that in the present under-financed state of education in this country, the salaries paid to religious teachers constitute one of the main sources of finance for educational development. We have these dedicated teachers whose principals receive the salary cheques from the Department. Most of the teachers have taken vows of poverty and under the new banking regulations, they no longer have to endorse the cheques.  In fact, they never see them.  The cheques go into the orders' house bank accounts and are devoted towards educational expansion and improvement.  The system constitutes a most important source of finance.</P>
    <P>Who can blame the religious orders if, in these circumstances, they are a little slow to put themselves at a financial disadvantage by bringing into Dublin, or Cork, or Galway, teachers serving in their Anglo-Irish province, under the same control and in the same organisation, in schools in Liverpool, Manchester or Glasgow? They have people trained, ready to come back but unfortunately the Department of Education make it difficult for them to do what they would wish to do.  It is very difficult for the average emigrant working in Great Britain to get home here.  Contacts in our conditions are all important. Some of these people who would be anxious to get back have not got the contacts which would put them in the way of a job here.  In these circumstances it is particularly important not to add to their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the case for this motion is based on commonsense. It is also based on educational grounds but primarily it is based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds and, that being so, I am very hopeful that the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is one which has often been raised here by way of Parliamentary <Col N="893" /> Question or in the course of the annual debate on the Estimate for the Department of Education over the past number of years.  My interest in the subject of the motion started away back when I first became a member of this House because it was one of the first Parliamentary Questions I tabled on 7th December, 1961.  The reply which the Minister for Education, at that time, gave me was that the matter was being considered.  It is strange that we are now in November, 1965, and the matter has not, as yet, been completely dealt with.  I agree that some steps have been taken to improve the position but, by and large, it is still the same.  Graduates and secondary teachers who, for reasons probably outside their control, have to go to Great Britain and Northern Ireland to teach have not that service fully recognised when they come back.</P>
      <P>I shall be very much surprised if the Minister for Education does not accept the motion.  I think he was one of the Deputies who, for a large number of years, were very interested in this matter and he was also one who advocated the action which this motion seeks.  I should like to refresh the Minister's memory on what he asked by way of a Parliamentary Question on 22nd March, 1962, vol. 194, col. 446.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley asked the Minister for Education whether a scheme is at present in operation under which teachers of modern European languages in secondary schools may teach for a period in Continental countries without loss of salary increments; and, if so, the names of the countries to which this scheme applies.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Education, Dr. Hillery, in his reply, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme introduced in June, 1961, provides that, subject to certain conditions, credit on the incremental salary scales for secondary school teachers of French, German, Italian and Spanish may be allowed in respect of teaching service in certain schools on the Continent of Europe. The scheme is applicable to any school district on the Continent of Europe where the language in respect <Col N="894" /> of which the credit is claimed is used as a vernacular language.</P>
    <P>That question by Deputy Colley, as he then was, demonstrates that he was in favour of the terms of the motion now before the House.  I, for one, will be very surprised if he does not accept the motion.  It is an extraordinary situation, when we have the Taoiseach going to Belfast to establish greater co-operation and communication between both Governments.  The Minister for Education in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands went to Belfast to establish greater communication in the sphere of fisheries.  Last week the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands went there for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>In the sphere where this co-operation is most needed the Department of Education insists on this barrier between North and South.  If a secondary teacher goes to Northern Ireland his service there is not fully recognised for incremental purposes on this side of the Border.  If there is to be another trip to Belfast by a member of the Government it should be to try to settle difficulties.  I do not believe it needs a trip to Belfast to do that.  The Minister can solve this problem here and now.  It is difficult enough nowadays to get secondary teachers in modern languages, mathematics and science without placing a further handicap on them, without making it less attractive for them to come back to this country.  The salary scale and the conditions of employment here for secondary teachers are not that attractive that we can make these regulations and keep them, and deny teachers their rights in the incremental salary scales.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a vocational education committee and we have found it extremely difficult to get qualified teachers to staff the various vocational schools throughout Kilkenny. I am sure other vocational education committees are finding it extremely difficult to staff their schools.  The reasons which were previously advanced by Dr. Hillery, when he was Minister for Education, <Col N="895" /> for keeping these regulations do not now hold any water.  At that time the usual reason was that we had no scarcity of teachers here and that we wanted to keep out as many as we could.  We wanted to get them out and keep them out because we had enough secondary teachers and graduates here. That reason cannot now be advanced and we should do everything possible to attract the best brains back to this country.  We need them very badly now and we will need them more in the future.  We should sweep away any barriers or regulations which make their coming back to this country less attractive.</P>
    <P>We should also encourage our graduates and secondary teachers to go to Great Britain and Northern Ireland to get experience.  There is a practice in the Department of Education of sending officials to some countries in order to get teaching experience.  The people who should be sent over, and who should be encouraged to go there, are the graduates. These are the people who had to come back and put into practice here what they learned in those countries. The Department, in sending their officials to foreign countries, recognise that it is important to have a knowledge of educational systems and teaching methods in these countries.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister persists in keeping these regulations when obviously it would be for the betterment, not only of the teachers themselves but of our whole educational system, to get rid of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> This is a matter on which several Deputies have spoken time and again. There has been a general consensus of opinion in favour of a more liberal approach.  The Minister has relaxed to a certain degree in so far as he has allowed service in some African states to be considered for incremental purposes and certain concessions have been given in respect of teaching abroad in modern languages.  As I mentioned to Deputy Dr. Hillery when he was Minister for Education, it is strange that you can qualify here in <Col N="896" /> the medical profession and go abroad and the experience you get abroad is considered as a great advantage to you when you apply for a professional appointment here.  It seems strange that the experience a secondary teacher may acquire abroad is considered of no use whatsoever and cannot be reckoned for incremental purposes afterwards.  In fact, many of us, including Deputy Dr. Hillery and myself, might not be here at all if we were accorded the same treatment as secondary teachers are accorded. Therefore, I would appeal on the ground of social justice that graduates in science and arts who afterwards go to teach in England and elsewhere should be given an opportunity of returning to their own country.  It may be argued that we have not great employment possibilities here.  It may be thought it would increase the amount of emigration of younger graduates.  Even if it did increase the immediate emigration of young graduates, many of them would be repatriated after seven or eight years and the position would balance out.</P>
      <P>My second ground of appeal is that of efficiency.  I believe it would be of considerable benefit in our educational approach here if we had a number of our teachers coming back with a new orientation gained from experience abroad.  This is a very small country and we cannot always live with a wall around it.  It would be of tremendous help to us if we had a number of teachers coming back after nine or ten years experience in England, Scotland or elsewhere.  In particular in respect of Northern Ireland&mdash;and I speak now from a purely nationalistic point of view&mdash;surely we should have a better approach to the only country in the world with which we have a favourable balance of trade?  It would be a measure of our goodwill if we had a more generous approach to the repatriation of our teachers up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, going a little further afield, if we are approaching the question of free trade in a free trade world, where the concept of the free movement of men, money and material will obtain, surely it is clear that the time has arrived when we cannot live as an <Col N="897" /> isolated community with a wall around us?  We must be prepared to take our place and accept the notion that under a more liberal trading approach, there will be freer movement of professional people as well as those employed in other occupations.  On those grounds, social justice, efficiency and the outlook for the future, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his stand on this matter and request him to adopt a more liberal approach, to give our graduates abroad the opportunity of returning home.  It might be good for many of our graduates, even those lucky enough to get a job here immediately after qualifying, if they had to emigrate for a few years.  It would have a broadening effect on their outlook and would redound to the benefit of education generally in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a consensus of agreement on the terms of this motion and Deputies on this side have listed exhaustively the reasons why they think it should be passed.  It meets with commonsense demands from several points of view.  I find it remarkable that any graduate teaching abroad should want to return to take up a position here.  It must be the tug of local loyalty or some other reason. Certainly, it could not be for the kind of professional life that awaits him here in Ireland.  I can think of few professions that offer a slower slavery, and greater death of intellect, lack of promotion and treadmill existence than that of being a teacher in Ireland. However, talking of their frustrations and problems is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison mentioned one area in which one would think no element of discrimination would be introduced, that is, that these regulations apply even to those teaching in the part of our country we lay claim <Col N="898" /> to under our Constitution.  It is only massive bureaucracy to think there should be any division or any bar to prevent people teaching in Northern Ireland from returning home at any time.  This is something which could be done without any delay.  I can accept we have our commitments to the undeveloped countries and that the people who teach in Tanzania and such countries should be given credit for this work.  But I think also we should not penalise the people who teach in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The only reason people go abroad in the first instance must be the low incomes here.  Those who wish to get married find it impossible to do so on their wages here.  If that is the reason, I do not see why we should hold it against them and prevent them from remaining on in their teaching career if for any reason they wish to return home.  The people about whom I am mainly concerned are the lay teachers in England and elsewhere.  I am not primarily concerned with people in religious orders.  The man in the religious order is dedicated to an ideal and takes on that particular job of teaching abroad when he joins the order.  I am concerned with lay people who wish, for one reason or another, to return here.  Deputies have listed the reasons.  Fresh thinking, and, God knows, fresh thinking is needed in education generally, would be brought into the profession, if these people could return home.  It is doubtful if all the jaded theorising we have on the subject of education will improve the situation.  We should, I think, look for some new thinking, some fresh thinking from those who have been abroad, working under more enlightened systems.</P>
    <P>Shortages in different teaching disciplines have been mentioned. Surely what is advocated here would be a way of filling the gap?  These people would have had valuable experience.  They would be an advantage to the profession at home.  This suggestion would go a long way towards waking up the profession here to the fact that they could fill a better role than they are doing at the moment, in most cases through no <Col N="899" /> fault of their own.  Theirs is a <i>cul-de-sac</i> employment with no prospect of promotion and no prospect of profit after a certain incremental point has been reached.  I hope that Deputies in Fianna Fáil who show so much confidence in their Minister by absenting themselves from this debate will have the experience of the Minister repaying their confidence and ours by accepting this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>All the arguments in favour of this motion have been put forward, but I should like to add my voice in support of the motion.  I appeal to the Minister to accept it.  One of the things that appeals to me in this motion is the possibility of interchange.  This is an age of liberalisation in trade, etc., and, at a meeting of European Ministers, a meeting to which Deputy Byrne referred and at which our own Minister for Education was present, agreement was reached on this question of interchangeability of teachers as between one country and another. There is, too, the argument that experience abroad can be very valuable and vitally important.  In most of the faculties in our universities, graduates are encouraged to go abroad and gain experience.  This experience is of great benefit to them when they return home. The same argument holds good for the teaching profession.  These teachers have been forced to emigrate and we should do everything we can to make it possible for them to return here.  It is difficult to justify the continuation of the present regulations which operate to the disadvantage of those who go abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there is a serious shortage of qualified teachers and specialist teachers in vocational schools. Deputy Pattison referred to that.  Vocational committees are finding it difficult to get specialist teachers.  A point which has not been mentioned, but which is very relevant, is the fact that the British Ministry of Education recognises Irish teaching service for the purpose of incremental salary.  We should have a similar arrangement. Such an arrangement is overdue.  I <Col N="900" /> appeal to the Minister to accept the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the arguments put forward by the other speakers.  It would be a great pity if politics were introduced into anything as important as this and I urge the Minister not to look on this motion as a Party motion. I am a member of a vocational committee. I know there is a shortage of teachers in metalwork, woodwork and other crafts.  If we are to have new technological colleges, we will have to get people from outside of a standard not attained at home to fill these posts. We cannot expect these people to come here and take jobs in our schools and colleges if they are denied the increments and salaries which normally accrue to teachers here.  The arguments put forward by Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> and others are strong enough, I think, to convince the Minister once and for all.  Acceptance of this motion would do no disservice to our people here.  Those teachers who have gone abroad have done so because there were no opportunities here.  The least we could do is to recognise their work abroad when they come back.  If this motion is accepted, it will benefit education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I sincerely hope the Minister will accept it.  I appreciate that in a Department such as Education, he is, to a certain extent, restricted by a good deal of bureaucratic thinking.  Nevertheless this motion should commend itself to him.  If we want to secure the best in any profession, then the young people in that profession should have every possible opportunity made available to them. In most of the professions, opportunities are afforded to graduates to go abroad and enlarge their experience and their thinking generally.  In this particular profession, however, graduates are restricted.  They are expected to settle down in some remote country town and spend the rest of their days there, inadequately remunerated.  There is no denying the fact that secondary teachers cannot advance very high on the salary scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Another angle I should like the Minister to consider is the fact that most secondary education here is carried on by religious orders.  The Minister knows as well as I do that entrants to these religious orders are not as numerous now as they were heretofore and the orders are, therefore, dependent to an ever-increasing extent on lay teachers.  That is true of both male and female religious foundations. Therefore, it is essential that there should be a ready supply of secondary teachers well qualified coming into the teaching pool to carry on the work that is most necessary.  That is one angle of it.  Another angle&mdash;I think it was mentioned by Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> just now&mdash;is that we are now moving into a free trade era and that by moving into a free trade era we shall have the free passage of men and money and the general opening up of opportunities in one country as against another.  It is essential, therefore, that we should be able to take our place in that situation and surely education is one of the absolute fundamentals of that.</P>
    <P>I would be very disappointed if the Minister for Education did not accept this motion.  I believe he is a broad thinker or he should be.  He spent quite a few years in Europe and he had plenty of opportunities of studying things at first hand and of realising that there are other opportunities and openings beyond our own shores. There is a further angle to this.  There are tremendous opportunities in the developing nations for young people in the teaching profession.  The developing nations may have made many mistakes in numerous things they have done in the setting up of their governments, but they have all, as far as I can read the situation, become cognisant of the fact that education is fundamental to their improvement and of their being able to manage their own affairs.  For that purpose they are offering to young teachers opportunities to go out there and to help them in their schools and to set up the educational system.  That in itself gives teachers a sense of authority and purpose which is very necessary in that distinguished profession.  I believe that <Col N="902" /> certain facilities are available to these people.  I do not think they get all the benefits they should get or would get if they stayed at home in the village and were prepared to settle down for the rest of their lives doing the one thing.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the reasons why the Minister should give earnest consideration to this motion.  As I have said, the Minister is in a Department that is, perhaps, subject to more bureaucratic control, or, shall we put it in a more kindly way, less forward thinking than other Departments.  He will probably be told by his officials that if he does this there are all sorts of pitfalls and troubles in the way.  I do not think there are any.  The Minister would be doing the big thing by accepting the motion and by doing so, not only would he be doing a big thing but doing something which is really necessary for Irish education and for secondary education because if any section of education wants assistance and wants to get the best that we in Ireland can offer it, it is secondary education. For that reason I ask the Minister to give the matter his most earnest consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the impression from some of the contributions of Deputies that there is a certain misapprehension about what the present position is.  Therefore, the first thing I should do is to state briefly and, I hope, factually what the present position is.  There are three schemes under which we give credit to teachers for service abroad: first, a scheme for service in the developing countries; secondly, the scheme which was referred to by some Deputies for our teachers to improve their knowledge of continental languages by service on the Continent of Europe; and, thirdly, there is credit given in respect of service in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we may take the last one first, the main features of the scheme in Northern Ireland are that the teaching service must be given in grammar schools in the case of secondary teachers, in grammar schools, intermediate schools or institutes of further education in the case of vocational <Col N="903" /> teachers, and in primary grammar, intermediate schools or institutes of further education in the case of primary teachers.  The teaching service must be given subsequent to the date on which the teacher obtained the necessary academic qualifications for recognition as a teacher.  In the case of Northern Ireland the credit is related to a maximum of five years and incremental credit may be allowed only for teaching service given after 31st July, 1962.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of this debate I do not think I need give the details of the service in developing countries but it might be no harm to mention what the countries are.  Again, I think from some contributions there may be a misapprehension in this regard.  These countries are: in Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Ghana, Nigeria, Rhodesia and Uganda; and in America, Jamaica, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Chile. The House will notice something about the structure, if we can call it such.  In the case of the scheme for recognition of service in the developing countries, it is quite clear that what we are trying to do there is to help the developing countries.  In the case of the scheme dealing with our teachers serving on the Continent of Europe to improve their knowledge of continental languages we are clearly trying to help ourselves.  In regard to the scheme dealing with service in Northern Ireland, it is obviously a special case based on the fact that it is Northern Ireland, a part of Ireland as far as we are concerned. Incidentally some of the Deputies who spoke seemed to have the mistaken idea that we had no scheme in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>You had not the scheme when the motion was put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy mentioned that the motion was put down quite a long time ago and that scheme was not in operation then.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the considerations which apply in putting such a scheme into <Col N="904" /> operation in relation to Great Britain are very different from those which relate to the scheme for Northern Ireland.  The strongest argument which could be advanced in favour of this motion is on the educational ground that service abroad would tend to improve the quality of our teachers.  I do think that to have a number of teachers who have had service in another educational system, in another discipline, would be of advantage to our educational system but I would not contemplate with equanimity the situation in which all or virtually all of our teachers had to serve abroad before they served here.</P>
      <P>I mention this because some Deputies, two of whom are doctors, referred to their profession and to engineering where,&mdash;particularly in the case of doctors,&mdash;service abroad is almost a <i>sine qua non.</i> I would point out that there is a considerable difference between the teaching profession and the medical profession or even the engineering profession.  Firstly, when the teacher is working here he is working within a system which is peculiar to Ireland.  Secondly, he is dealing with people and with traditions and he is dealing with an approach to life which is different from that which he will see abroad.</P>
      <P>Now, it is true, as I said, that it is an advantage to us to have a core of teachers who have had service abroad and have benefited from it, but it would be untrue to say that you can go the whole way with this and say that this is similar to the medical profession. The argument has been advanced that this motion should be accepted on compassionate grounds&mdash; I think those were the words Deputy Byrne used&mdash;and Deputy Byrne instanced the case of graduates who had served for a number of years in England and wanted to come home and bring up their families here.  There is no doubt that if one could facilitate such people to come home, obviously this is something we should do, but equally obviously, if the matter were as simple as all that it would have been done long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> The real problem is that we have to be satisfied that if we were to implement this motion, we would not in fact be encouraging far more of our graduates to emigrate than emigrate at present because, if you remember what I said in regard to our scheme relating to the developing countries, clearly it is designed to assist them.  It is designed to induce our teachers to go abroad.  Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that if we apply such a scheme to Great Britain, we would be inducing our teachers, particularly younger teachers, to go to Britain. Deputies may say: &ldquo;yes, but the experience is gained and they will come back.&rdquo;  But will they all come back?  Is it not more than likely that many of them will settle down, have their families growing up over there and that the upset involved for their families in moving back here would be such that many of them would decide not to come?  Indeed, the better the teacher, the better the position he will have and the less inducement there will be to come back.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which I, as Minister for Education, must very seriously consider, whether the effect of such a scheme would not be, while allowing and inducing some teachers to come back, overall to cause many more of our teachers to go abroad and not come back, remembering all the time that the scheme is designed not to bring people back but to encourage them to go abroad and this is evidenced in that it is in operation in regard to the developing countries where we want to help them and want our teachers to go there.  We must also remember that a scheme such as this, since it is designed to help in the case of developing countries, would be, in the case advocated in the motion, designed to help Britain.  I do not want to be misunderstood here. I do not mean that the Deputies proposing the motion desired to help Britain, but if one wanted to help Britain, this is the way one would go about it.  I do not object to that, if the ultimate result is a gain to our educational system.  However, as things stand it seems to me that what we would be doing is assisting the British <Col N="906" /> educational system without getting anything like comparable benefits to ourselves.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy T. O'Donnell who mentioned that the British give recognition to our teachers, but, of course, the reason they do this is that they want our teachers.  I, as Minister for Education, must consider whether the implementation of such a scheme would have the effect, overall, of redounding to the benefit of our educational system.  I have agreed that there are certain factors in which it would certainly assist and improve our educational system but I am not satisfied that overall it would assist us.  It may be that it will be possible to demonstrate this at a later stage; I will deal with that before I finish.  At present, however, I do not think it has been demonstrated.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that Deputy Pattison, who quoted a question I put to the Minister for Education in 1962, argued that it was evidence of the fact that I had shown myself to be in favour of this motion when on the back benches.  It was an ingenious argument but I cannot allow it to go unanswered.  In fact, the question, as Deputy Pattison showed, was in relation to the scheme for allowing teachers to obtain service in continental countries for the improvement of their knowledge of French, German, and so on, and had nothing to do with this motion.  I cannot allow Deputy Pattison to argue that because I put down such a question, I went on record as being in favour of this motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the case of a secondary teacher of physical education and I should be glad to look into that matter if he will let me have the details.  I did gather from what he quoted from the letter that one of the problems was that this teacher wanted to have his probationary year spent outside the State recognised here. This is not part of the existing scheme and I would be slow to change that because it seems to me that when it is a probationary period, it should be spent here where we can see what is <Col N="907" /> happening to the teacher.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by a number of Deputies that we are short of teachers of certain specialised grades.  Science in particular was mentioned and mathematics, and there are certain other specialist teachers in the vocational schools, or the colleges of technology, of whom undoubtedly we are short.  Indeed, if one could improve that situation by giving the kind of recognition that is called for in this motion, I would be very tempted to do it but this is not the end of the matter.  To give recognition on a differentiated basis as between certain types of teachers might create even greater problems than exist at present and this is not, I am afraid, a complete answer.  Therefore it seems to me that the decision will have to be either to give such recognition to all secondary teachers or to none, and if we have to give it to all, then we get back to what I was talking about before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned that my predecessor, when attending a meeting of European Ministers of Education, had supported a resolution advocating free interchangeability of teachers.  I would, however, point out to Deputy Byrne that this concept of free interchangeability involves very considerably more than is involved in his motion.  There are quite a number of other factors involved and it seems to me that while it is laudible, it is something that is going to happen slowly and not something on which we are going to take an initiative, on which we will be giving away considerably more than we are getting, and that the case made here for recognition of service by Irish teachers in Britain is fairly far removed from the concept of the resolution passed by the European Ministers of Education.  It does seem, therefore, as though we are back to the question of to what extent would acceptance of this motion be of advantage to our educational system. Previous Ministers for Education of different administrations have considered this question.  There are some attractive arguments in favour of it, <Col N="908" /> but they all ultimately came to the conclusion that the balance of advantage lies with not granting such recognition.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the kernel of the problem is that we may, in fact, if we accept the motion, encourage very many of our young graduates to go abroad of whom we can be certain some will stay abroad.  Whether this would balance out with the number of teachers who would come back is extremely doubtful.  It seems to me that the operation of the scheme in relation to Northern Ireland may give us an indication, limited though it may be, of how this would work out in relation to our overall system.  While I have been impressed with the number of arguments put forward&mdash; and, indeed, I am very conscious of them and was conscious of them before this debate&mdash;I think the wisest course for us would be to wait some time longer and see what experience we gain from the operation of the scheme in relation to Northern Ireland, and see can it give us a line on what would be likely to happen if we applied it to Britain.</P>
    <P>I would certainly not wish the House to think that my mind was closed on this, because it is not.  I want to have further convincing evidence as to what is likely to happen, and that it will work out not to our disadvantage if we accept it.  I, therefore, suggest that the best course would be to wait some time to see what our experience is of the scheme in Northern Ireland.  If as a result of that it would appear that we would not lose out substantially by applying it to Britain I should like to have another look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad, indeed, that the Minister has accepted the debate on this motion in the manner in which he has.  I want to assure him that there was no playing of politics in putting down the motion. Most of us who signed our names to the motion are aware of particular cases of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's hypothetical argument is completely illogical.  He is inclined to think that graduates leave this country of their own volition. <Col N="909" /> that is not so.  Some certainly do leave the country for the purpose of gaining post-graduate experience, or postgraduate degrees, but the majority of graduates would never leave this country if they could get permanent employment here.  It is force of circumstances which compel them to go, the same force of circumstances as compelled our forefathers to leave the country through lack of employment. It is only right that, having gained some experience abroad, and having been able to procure employment here, when they come back they should not suffer through the circumstances which forced them to leave the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us the system of education here is different from the system of education elsewhere.  I am very sorry to hear that.  I am very sorry to hear the Minister say there is such a difference between my county, Donegal, and a county across the Border in the Six Counties, Tyrone. I find the people the same.  The pupils have the same aptitudes and the teachers are of equal standard.  It would be a tragedy if anyone were to say that the standard of education here is different from the standard in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say his mind is not completely closed on this matter.  That he has an open mind is shown by the fact that since this motion was put down, he has agreed to it in part, in that certain qualified secondary teachers are now eligible for employment here under the terms set down in the motion.  I want to appeal to the Minister now on behalf of vocational teachers.  After all, there is very little difference between vocational education here and in Britain and the Six Counties&mdash; particularly between here and the Six Counties.  I appeal to the Minister to give the same status to our vocational teachers as he has given to our secondary teachers who have previous employment in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I did not think vocational teachers were covered, but if that is so, we have gone a long way to meet some of the cases in which I am interested.  There are still one or two which are not covered.  I notice that the employment must be subsequent to 31st July, 1962.</P>
      <P>The systems in Britain and the Six Counties are very similar.  So far as I know the difference is very slight.  The greater number of our graduates who are compelled to become emigrants or migrants seek Great Britain as their temporary home.  They are nearer to their relatives; they are able to pay periodic visits home; possibly they do not want to go to warmer climates and would prefer employment in Britain. They would like to come back as soon as the opportunity arises.  For instance, I know the headmaster of a school who took out his degree in this country.  He then went to London for some years and he did his M.A. in London University.  He is now the headmaster of a school in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht which teaches all subjects through the medium of Irish, and he is making a success of that school in my home town, Dungloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> These people do not lose touch, as the Minister might like to describe it, by going abroad.  Deputy Byrne also referred to compassionate grounds. These people do not want to become Wild Geese.  They do not want to give up their association with this country completely.  They would like to come back.  If they are successful in procuring employment here, surely the Minister should facilitate them by recognising their service abroad.  That would enable them to come back and live here, possibly not at as high a rate of salary as they would obtain elsewhere, but at least at a rate of income which would encourage them to remain in their own country.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the various arguments used by other speakers about the advantage of procuring teaching experience abroad through post-graduate courses and other such experience.  I understand that Deputy P. Hogan <i>(South Tipperary)</i> and one or two other speakers mentioned this. We know it is appreciable.  We all know the desirability of procuring higher education from sources other than our own country.  We encourage student scholarships abroad.  It may well be that, having done post graduate courses abroad, they are not able to procure employment at home immediately.  They may have to take up temporary employment abroad.  It would be a pity to penalise those people, as is being done, when they come back.  What is the difference between teaching in South America or South Africa and teaching in Britain? The standard of education in the British secondary and vocational schools is equally high with the standard in the various countries that have recently emerged in Africa and possibly South America.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister has an open mind on this matter, but I think he might go a little further. Why pick 31st July, 1962, as a particular date and say that teaching experience in the Six Counties subsequent to that date is essential?  There are many people who were fortunate enough to come back prior to that, or possibly who through force of circumstances <Col N="912" /> were driven back from the Six Counties prior to that, and their teaching experience has not been recognised.  As I said, we appreciate the Minister's point of view on this matter and we hope he will keep an open mind.  We may possibly raise this matter again on his Estimate later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I am glad the Minister has said he has not a closed mind on this matter.  It is very essential that he should approach this matter from the point of view of the arguments that can be adduced to support the motion. We have heard some of them.  The Minister seems to feel he cannot fully accept this motion.  If I follow him aright, he feels that the emergent countries in Africa or South America may lose the services of some graduates who might be prepared to go there, knowing that the service they give there will be recognised when they come back.  Furthermore, he seems to fear that perhaps our graduates, in going to Britain, might stay there.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that the graduates going to Britain do so in the main because they are compelled to do so. In view of the numbers of graduates leaving our universities every year and the amount of employment opportunity available to them here, it becomes an absolute necessity for many of them to emigrate for some time at least.  One of the strongest points that must be borne in mind is the fact that these people have to emigrate through no fault of their own but because the opportunity of suitable employment is not available to them in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking subject to correction, I think, that, in this year alone, there are up to 300 graduates in University College, Dublin, seeking to obtain the Higher Diploma in Education.  Consider the employment opportunities available to these graduates, say, in the field of secondary education in this country.  Add to that the numbers in the constituent colleges of the National University and the numbers in Trinity College, Dublin.  I think the Minister's argument is a bit fallacious in the sense that he would fear <Col N="913" /> that if these graduates went, we would find ourselves in the position that we might not get them back, whereas, in fact, by inducing them to go to other countries, there is the possibility that they will come back.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not have an opportunity of quoting some figures in regard to this matter.  This scheme is fitted in three ways.  It is designed to help the developing countries; it is designed to help ourselves by way of a golden opportunity to our graduates to go to the Continent to gain experience in the teaching of languages and then there is the question of service in Northern Ireland.  The answer the Minister gave to Deputy Byrne's question is enlightening.  I think he said that the number who avail of the opportunity at the moment is seven. That is a small number, I am sure the Minister will agree, and would not upset the balance one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Equally so, the number of graduates involved in relation to the emergent countries is small because I think the scheme is being confined to lay teachers and the religious are not involved in this one way or the other. The numbers would be small and consequently should not have any great effect one way or the other on the matter.</P>
    <P>Therefore, taking the third portion of it, those who go to Britain generally go there because the employment opportunity is greater for young graduates.  As the Minister says, quite a number of these will not come back and I think we may accept that.  It is something that has always had to be accepted by Irish graduates, that there is not a wide employment opportunity for them in this country and that many of them will have to make a living abroad and will have to make a home abroad.</P>
    <P>For the smaller number&mdash;and I think it would be much smaller than the Minister might fear&mdash;of those who would be induced by family considerations, either through their attachment to home circumstances here or by reason of the fact that they would prefer to come back and bring up their family in this country, I think the amount would not be very much and <Col N="914" /> should not present any serious problem to the Minister.  I do not think that the fact that you would decide to give the same status of recognition to these people coming back would take in any way from the number of graduates who would either stay here or who would return.  It would scarcely affect the argument one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions that this free interchangeability is something which will happen slowly.  The advantage that will be gained by our encouraging people to come back after having had experience abroad in specialising in any particular branch, whether in regard to languages or to the type of education which would be given at vocational school level at the present time, is bound to be substantial.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to fear that by doing this, he may encourage people to go away and stay away. Many of our graduates will go, anyhow, for the simple reason that they have to earn a living after they graduate.  What will bring most of them back, the type of people we are thinking of, is the fact that they think it would be more advantageous to them to rear their family in this country with the system of education we have and which some people might think has disadvantages.  The disadvantage I suppose some people might assess against it at the present time is one in spite of which these graduates, having had experience of the more materialistic type of education available in other places, still consider it in the interests of their family to return here.  If they can confer an advantage on our educational system by their return here, then, equally, we ought not to penalise them by leaving them in a worse-off position than would have been theirs had they remained.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that it is an advantage for us to send staff from the Department of Education abroad and that they should attend study courses outside this country to familiarise themselves with not alone the systems of education existing abroad but also with the advantages available in outside <Col N="915" /> systems.  The Department of Education has been, very commendably, encouraging teachers in our primary schools to go abroad each year to the United States and to spend some time there assimilating what advantages and experience they can find in a short time so that they may be brought home to the people here.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the contribution made by the Minister in response to a request from Deputy Andrews.  One aspect, on which, perhaps, the Minister might give us a little more information, is the question of the regulations in relation to standards.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied that sufficient attention has been given to standards in the past. There is no doubt that there has been too much slackness regarding the standards of the dwellings on which State and local authority supplementary grants were paid.  When the Minister tells us of the action he has been <Col N="917" /> taking regarding the prices of houses, has he in mind any form of administrative action which will ensure that standards laid down will be adhered to and that there will not be a continuation of what might well be termed exploitation of people purchasing their houses because of failure to ensure that the standards which at the particular time were supposed to apply were not in fact applied.  In that regard, might I ask the Minister if he contemplates making his Department the Department which will ensure that standards are maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how the question of standards can be pursued in this way.  The Minister mentioned it in passing on a question put to him by a Deputy but it does not open up a general debate on housing.  We are restricted to the section before the House, which relates to loans by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the loans by the Minister are made to local authorities to build houses.  Surely the Minister wants to be satisfied that the quality of the houses built are up to standard; otherwise, why should he subsidise?  Taking it from that particular point, he should ensure, in any case where State money is being used to subsidise housing, that proper attention is given to the standards of construction. I am sure the Minister will appreciate the point I make.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (4) (a), I think the Minister has in fact dealt in some detail with what might well be the effect of the application of Ministerial or departmental decisions in subsection (4) (e).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully has, of course, reminded me that subsection (4) (b) would permit me to speak on standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 4 (a) deals with &ldquo;conditions as to the rents of dwellings.&rdquo; It appears, having listened to the Minister before tea, that if I were not speaking as a Deputy, if I were just reporting this, I should be inclined to say: &ldquo;Minister Calls For Increase <Col N="918" /> In Rents&rdquo;, because the Minister has indicated quite clearly&mdash;there are many ways of skinning a cat&mdash;that his approach to the question of subsidy to local authorities will depend on their approach to the fixing of rents of local authority tenants.  If that is not cracking the whip over managers, whether county or city&mdash;and it is the managers who up to this fixed rents &mdash;I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, in effect: &ldquo;Unless you fix rents that I am satisfied with, I shall use the powers of this Act to ensure that the level of subsidy is a minimum not a maximum.&rdquo; Not too long ago, the Minister approved tenders for single-roomed dwellings in Dublin designed for old people and the tendered price was around £2,300.  Under the present subsidies, the local authority could not even get 66? per cent of the loan charges on dwellings constructed for old people, the bulk of whom would be on social welfare or small pensions and of whom some few might be working as cleaners and so on.  That was the cost of a single-roomed modern flat.  If one goes on to the two-room or three-room flat provided for families where the father may be, as many are, in a low income or casually employed, the State subsidy, assuming the maximum would apply, would be 66? per cent or £2,200 in respect of flats costing £3,000 to £4,000. The Minister has said almost as a sort of warning to local authorities that unless they loaded on to the backs of the ratepayers an increasing burden from the housing account or unless the managers increased the rents substantially, the Minister and the Government would reduce the amount of subsidy.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct that during the financial year ended 31st March, 1965, when the estimates for the current year in the local authority in which I am reasonably familiar were examined, there was a peculiar situation.  The loan charge on capital account had increased more on the ratepayers than on the State at a time when the State, through the Minister, was calling for greater activity, and instead of giving greater encouragement we get, in fact, <Col N="919" /> less and less subsidy by way of assistance.  I want to pinpoint these two things because the Minister has been at some pains to give the impression that he would have no hand, act or part in or responsibility for increasing rents on local authority tenants.  As I have said, the Minister does not have to send out a circular to managers saying: &ldquo;Increase the rents or else ...&rdquo;  If the Minister tells managers that if they do not increase the rents of local authority houses substantially, it will affect the subsidy from central funds, that puts any manager under a very severe penalty and very severe pressure.  It is for this reason that I am dealing with this section at such length.</P>
    <P>This must also be said.  I speak mainly in relation to the affairs of a city where so many people are in need of adequate housing.  Because of the size of the city and its population which is being swollen by people coming from the country, the problem of housing is different from that of other parts of the country.  There is no other centre where it is common for the bulk of the building to be in an area five, six or seven miles from the centre.  Consequently the people are not faced with quite the same type of problems.  There is not the great necessity to afford people an opportunity of transferring if their employment changes or if they have been compelled because of circumstances to accept accommodation from four to six miles away from where they wanted accommodation.  No other city in the country has the same problem of trying to get rid finally of the hovels that still exist.  I am relating this to the fact that to do this job properly requires adequate financial assistance from the State through the Minister.  This section does not provide adequate assistance.</P>
    <P>One must compare that with what happens in other parts of the community. As Deputy Tully has said, the corporation or local authority tenant is faced with having immediately placed on his dwelling the moment it is occupied, full rates.  The fact that there is no State subsidy as <Col N="920" /> such at that particular point in time means that the 66? per cent does not become 66? per cent in far too many cases.  I ask the Minister to look at that again, and I conclude by pointing out that the whole intent and purpose of the section is to make clear that from the point of view of the national housing authority, the way to approach the situation is to impose heavier burdens on those who are unable to meet the burdens of tax and high living costs they already have to face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The portion of the section on which the Deputy relies in trying to reiterate what others have already said&mdash;that the Minister for Local Government is advocating for its own sake an increase in rents on local authority tenants&mdash;is only one of six conditions, any or all of which may be insisted on for the purpose of subsidy to the housing authority.  That is (a) conditions as to the rents of dwellings. I want to make clear that I envisage rents being brought down as a result of this in cases where this is necessitated by the circumstances of the tenants, as well as being put up in the cases of those who can afford it.  I want to make it clear that if you want to hang me for one, you must hang me for both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have a realistic approach to the matter, we cannot go on adding to the burdens of the ratepayers and taxpayers which will of themselves continue to increase year by year and the total of which is now approaching £6 million annually.  This is the burden the community is carrying by way of assistance to the housing of those who cannot house themselves, under normal operations as of this day.  Next year the figure will increase and the year following, it will increase again.  Undoubtedly there are sums that can be subtracted from it at times in respect of loan charges that have expired but their impact is very insignificant because of the difference in the cost of building those houses and the cost of building now. Therefore, it may be taken that the £6 million is a figure that will continue to rise fairly substantially, divided <Col N="921" /> between the ratepayer and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>All I am saying is that, despite the fact that it was easier to build when costs were very much lower, when a very small fraction of what it costs to build today could have built a house, despite all the apparent advantages of those days, although we have this emphasis on priority classes, quite a substantial number of persons throughout the country and in the cities and towns are living in bad conditions today because of the fact that they could not afford to pay the rents asked in respect of houses that were offered to them in their due turn.  What are we to do about it?  One thing that we can do is to look at those in our houses whose circumstances may have improved radically since they became tenants, who are now in a position to pay well for the houses in which they live, who have enjoyed the benefits provided for them by the community for years past when they were very much less well off, and to ask them, now that they have turned the corner and are better off and can still enjoy the facilities &mdash; nobody is advocating putting them out of the houses they have been reared in&mdash;to make a fair contribution so that others less well off may in turn be rehoused and this new class of persons who have not yet been housed can be housed at even lower rents than is being asked of them at the moment.  Surely that is not an unfair suggestion to make to this House or to the community as a whole?  If looked at in a fair light, it will be seen not to be an admonition that you must increase rents, just baldly and blandly and without qualification. There will be those who may continue to perpetuate the myth that that is what is inherent in the section. Let us look at the other five conditions, any or all of which may be insisted upon.  Subclause (b) refers to conditions as to building standards, which Deputy Larkin has been talking about. Sub-clause (c) refers to conditions for acquiring contributions from the municipal or county rate (as may be appropriate) towards the costs incurred by a housing authority in respect of their housing services.  This <Col N="922" /> can be very useful and beneficial at times.  Sub-clause (d) refers to conditions as to the maintenance of dwellings. Surely nobody will object to the Minister for Local Government insisting that proper provision be made for the maintenance of dwellings that have been erected or that are being erected or that will be erected, at great cost to the community, so that they will not fall down for lack of maintenance and have to be rebuilt at further cost? Sub-clause (e) refers to conditions as to the sale or lease under this Bill of dwellings or other land.  Sub-clause (f) refers to condition as to the development of sites for building houses.</P>
    <P>The section says that regard may be had to any or all of these conditions, notwithstanding anything that may have been said in any of the foregoing sections about other regulations. If you pick out one and say that this means that the Minister says you must increase the rents on local authority tenants, if that is the way Deputies want it and the way they want to interpret it, they can have it. I leave it to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton raised another matter, but before going on to discuss it, I should mention to Deputy Larkin and others who think like him that this idea of holding the Department responsible for building standards in respect of every house in respect of which public money is contributed whether by way of grant or loan can clearly be seen to be an impossible suggestion.  It would require hordes of inspectors who would act as clerks of works.  In respect of each house or group of houses being erected in any part of the country an inspector would have to be standing by.  The suggestion is ludicrous.  It has been suggested that the inspections at present carried out are merely a couple of inspections. These inspections cannot be regarded, and certainly should not be regarded, as involving any warranty on our part that the house conforms in every respect to the minimum standards laid down in our specifications.  We cannot be there.  We cannot give the service being talked about.  Therefore, it should be clearly understood that the <Col N="923" /> inspections carried out cannot carry a warranty in respect of everything contained in the walls, the mixture, whether they are cavity walls or a sham, whether the foundations put in when our inspector was not there are of the right dimensions.  All of these things cannot be guaranteed other than on the basis of having clerks of works present, which we could not provide and even if we attempted to do so the administrative costs would be far greater than the grants.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Clinton does not agree with the inference to be drawn from what Deputy Larkin has said, that in the case of loans and subsidies the Department should take it on themselves to ensure that everything is carried out in accordance with the letter of the law when, at the same time, he and his colleagues and most members of the House are pleading for more autonomy for local authorities. Now Deputy Larkin says that the Department should see to it that local authority houses should conform to all the standards laid down if the Department provide money by way of loan and subsidy.  He cannot have it both ways.  There cannot be more autonomy and at the same time more departmental control.  The argument which has been made, possibly well meant, does not convince me that I should carry out the intention behind it.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I do not feel that the question being raised here about making a special case for Dublin can be seriously considered, even though Dublin Deputies may feel that we should make a special case for Dublin. Dublin city and county have their problems.  Deputy Larkin has outlined them.  People are coming in looking for houses.  There are problems here not met in other built-up areas throughout the country.  On the other hand, Dublin has a lot of privileges.  It is a very favoured part of the country and we should not decry it because it has its difficulties.  It also has its advantages and I do not think any special case can be made for giving Dublin additional help when we remember <Col N="924" /> that of this £1,650 limit which is operating at the moment a two-thirds subsidy means in effect almost 30/- a week contribution by the ratepayer.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy mentioned that.  In the country as a whole we have approximately 110,000 local authority houses let, of which approximately 40,000 are in Dublin, the other 70,000 being here and there throughout the country.  By and large, we have about 700,000 dwellings in the country.  If Deputies work back and put the 110,000 let houses against the 700,000 other dwellings, they will realise the rates impact of 110,000 houses as against that of 590,000 dwellings the owners of which are contributing towards public housing. Let us not confuse the issue by asserting that the amount of rates being paid by tenants in local authority houses is of such magnitude that it would wipe out all the benefits such tenants otherwise get through taxpayers' and ratepayers' contributions.</P>

I shall hold back on that but I <Col N="925" /> direct Deputies' attention to the contribution made by the ratepayers of this city and they will readily see the total amount paid in rates by those housed in local authority dwellings in the city.  It is not all that big a proportion of the total amount of rates contributed towards the housing account of Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>That is a herring that will not queer the trail at the moment. Even if I have not got the figures&mdash;I feel sure I will be able to get them before we get through&mdash;I know what the position is.  It has been pointed out that the person who builds his own house and gets a grant gets rate remission. Surely Deputies will agree that the person who builds his own house does so at the cost of a great deal of personal sacrifice and that the additional facility of some rate remission is not out of order, that it is not something he is not entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am taking a cue from the manner in which things I have said are being misused and returned to me.  Let us say the suggestion has been made that if people building their own houses get this remission why should not the new tenant of a new council house get some like advantage.  The two people are to a degree different because one of them has had to make provision to get his house built&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ownership brings obligations.  Having made that effort, the person who has built his house has the benefit of a scaled imposition of rates and this gives him some breathing space to help him out of <Col N="926" /> part of the debt he has incurred.  A new tenant coming in has not got the same case to make, though I feel sure specific cases could be quoted in favour of it.  The new tenant has to furnish his house but so has the new owner who, because the house he built may have cost more than he thought it would, may have a bigger debt to pay, a bigger loan to repay than he anticipated when he began building.  In his case rate remission for a few years can be of some assistance.  I do not think a parallel case can be made for the new tenant.</P>
      <P>I am not saying we should not do anything about the new tenant.  All I am saying is that the two cases are not equal from the point of view of the amount they should or could get.  The fact that the person who built his house now owns it does not necessarily mean he is any the better off as a result.  He may be carrying a loan on which he must make repayments.  He has to finance maintenance which he dare not neglect as may be the case of a local authority house.  All these mount up to a tidy obligation for the privilege of owning his own house.  We should not forget these things when we are comparing the two categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to compare the outgoings of a Corporation tenant who goes into a house on what the Minister says is the maximum rent of 25/- per week plus rates of 25/- or 30/- a week&mdash;into a house which is only rented, which he will never be able to own&mdash;with the outgoings of a person who gets the maximum grant and loan for building his house and who must finance repayments of approximately the same amount?  If the Minister goes deeply enough he will agree there is an injustice on the tenant, particularly in view of the fact that the tenant in many cases is in a far worse financial position than the person who builds his own house.  I have great respect for the person who attempts to build his own house, particularly for those who did so a few months ago.  Despite all that I feel the tenant should get more consideration where rates are concerned. With reference to subsection (4) (a), I <Col N="927" /> am rather amused by the Minister's attempt to turn himself into a ministerial Mary Poppins and sing: &ldquo;A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that under this subsection certain conditions must be taken into consideration but he tells us not to mind that at all.  Even though it does not mean an increase in rent for many people, there are also people who would be able to get new houses at much reduced rents.  The spoonful of sugar is there in the imagination of Mary Poppins and it is in the Minister's imagination, too.  If he imagines for one minute that one tenant in this country will, as a result of what he is trying to do here, go into a house at a lower rent than he is getting it for now, he has got to think again. I am quite satisfied there is not a snowball's chance of that happening and the Minister must know it.  The Minister has made a fairly strong point regarding this and he must know that the right thing for a county manager is to bulldoze, if he can, an increase in rents over the local authorities and then be the whiteheaded boy with the Minister.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that as far as we are concerned on the Labour benches, we will fight this tooth and nail.  The Minister is trying to squeeze the last drop out but he is not going to get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was making a case with regard to the higher ceiling of subsidy, I did not make a case for Dublin city and county.  I made a case for those areas where the Minister felt it was necessary to increase the limit of loans.  The decisions and the conditions were the same in that case as they are in this case.  All the favourable conditions he referred to exist.  I submit the Minister is being inconsistent.  He has acknowledged it in the private sector but he will not acknowledge it here.  We are bringing in a new piece of legislation that is deteriorating every year that passes. <Col N="928" /> That cannot be denied.  Every year that passes costs are increasing.  We have subsidies and associated with them, we have certain conditions and regulations that are so far-reaching that the Minister can nearly do anything he likes under the section.</P>
      <P>The conditions as to rent have been discussed at some length.  I want to say a word with regard to building standards.  The Minister went outside the scope of the section when discussing building standards and went into private sectors.  I am glad he did because there has been a misconception widely held that because there was a State subsidy, the State should then be responsible for standards and should, in fact, act as a clerk of works.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made a public statement that this is not so and that everybody is responsible for his own house and the standard of quality of his own house.  If he wants to have it 100 per cent, he must have a clerk of works.  There may be a case for having an inspector to check up on standards generally, and if that is so he will see that they are maintained according to the degree of inspection carried out.  That is outside the scope of this section.</P>
      <P>The section refers to standards of local authority houses.  I want to say it is my belief that we are building lower standard houses than ten years ago. We are doing so because the Minister insisted they must be of a lower standard. He insisted on that because the tenders we were getting were too high. I remember quite clearly plans and specifications being sent back to us and our being told to reduce standards in order to get prices down.  We have built houses in the very recent past with nothing in the kitchen except a plug&mdash;no fire, no cooking apparatus, no range of any sort.  At that time the upper rents were 42/-; now they are 73/-.  These houses have a very small kitchen with no cooking facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, standards have lowered and if the Minister uses his powers under this section to lower standards any further, there will not be a house at all.  That is one of the great objections that people paying the higher <Col N="929" /> rents have to such houses.  They are unsatisfactory accommodation.  Many of these people realise that if and when they get an opportunity to purchase these houses, they will have to build a suitable kitchen.  There is not very much more to be said with regard to it.  As I said, this is a standstill section and the benefits to be derived under it are deteriorating every year that passes.  The Minister refuses to acknowledge that by making any little improvement.  We are legislating here for the future and we are worsening the position every year that passes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to building standards, I might again make this point.  The purchaser of a dwelling might not be aware that an inspector would come from the local authority and the Department of Local Government, and yet, as Deputy Clinton says, it is up to the purchaser to look after his own interests and in fact satisfy himself as regards standards.  In other words, he has almost to employ an architect.  Many people are under the impression that if there is a local authority inspection followed by a Local Government inspection, there is some sort of implied guarantee that the house is up to the standard.  This is a matter that should receive more publicity.  In fact, neither the Minister nor the local authority protects the purchaser.  He is on his own if the house should fall down.</P>
      <P>Although there has been a tendency of late to increase the number of rooms in local authority houses, has the Minister any idea of insisting that the rooms in these houses be larger? For a number of years these rooms have remained minimal size, taking into account the requirements of families with growing boys and girls. I think there is a song called &ldquo;Little Boxes&rdquo; and this could well be applied to our local authority houses and even some private houses.  I would be glad if the Minister would say whether or not he has examined this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another subject on which he might give us some information is the maintenance <Col N="931" /> of local authority dwellings. Anyone connected with local authorities knows that the standard here is dropping year after year.  Possibly, that is due to the actual cost of repairs. Minor repairs, which 20 years ago were considered part of ordinary maintenance, no longer come under that heading.  Is the Minister considering laying down it is essential that these so-called minor repairs be done in order to maintain the property up to a proper standard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of building standards, which would include room size under the regulations, is something that would come within the ambit of this.  In fact, this matter of standards is covered at the moment on an administrative basis.  My answer to the Deputy is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when he asks whether routine repairs hitherto carried out should be done in order to keep houses in a proper state of repair, in other words, to maintain their value.  Anything required to keep a house in a proper state of repair would come under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in the past few years the Department have instructed local authorities to reduce standards, particularly in regard to rural cottages?  In fact, in order to keep costs down, they were instructed not to include fireplaces in bedrooms which used to be standard.  Is it not true that the Department also instructed local authorities to lower ceiling heights, giving as their reason that this would reduce building costs? I agree that the last scheme in my area was a very big improvement on previous schemes, but the two before it, in respect of which the Department instructed the local authority to reduce standards, were not so good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to repairs and maintenance, I do not know what the usual practice is but very little maintenance is carried out by the local authorities.  The result is that when rural cottages are being vested a major repair job has to be done. This is entirely due to the local authority's failure to carry out the ordinary maintenance work.  It may be <Col N="932" /> said the tenants could help considerably by carrying out some of the maintenance.  In fact, a number of tenants do so.  But where the tenants are unable to do it the onus is very definitely on the local authority to see to it that the houses are kept in good repair.  In case the Minister thinks we consider the section is all bad, I want to say there are a number of good ideas in it, particularly the subsidisation of sites for building purposes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 34&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to delete all words from &ldquo;to&rdquo; in line 35 to &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; in line 38 and insert &ldquo;under this section and, as a condition of making the payment, has been given an undertaking which,&rdquo; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  to insert &ldquo;or body&rdquo; after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; in line 40 and in line 43.</P>
      <P>Section 47 provides that the Minister may, instead of making periodic contributions by way of subsidy to housing authorities or approved bodies, pay the authority or body a lump sum. If he does this he may require an undertaking from the authority or body or the compliance with such conditions as he thinks fit.  Subsection (3) provides that where a payment has been made to a housing authority and the condition or undertaking subject to which the payment was made has not been complied with, the Minister may recover the payment.  The subsection does not make any similar provision where a payment is made to an approved body.  This is, however, necessary and the amendment rectifies the omission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think this is the ideal way of dealing with such things?  After all, it almost looks like a family row. Something happens.  Under the guidance or with the assistance of the Department, a local authority does something and, for one reason or another, the Department insist that the conditions have not been carried out and the money must be refunded. I do not think this is a good principle. There should be some other way of dealing with this situation, some way of insisting on the regulations being carried out.  Refunding the money is not the ideal way.  Suppose the money is refunded, what happens to the work originally subsidised?  Does this mean the Department will have no further interest or can the local authority do nothing with it?  Can they sell it?  What is the situation? Would the Minister have another look at this?  The principle enshrined here is not a good one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>From a bookkeeping point of view, an annual subsidy might be more of a nuisance than a lump sum.  Assuming a local authority undertook to do certain things with this lump sum, but failed to carry out that undertaking, I do not think it would be unfair to ask them to refund the money, since they did not, for one reason or another, live up to their promise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agrees it is a new principle.  This is the first time there has been a suggestion that money can be recovered by the Department from a local authority.  Surely there should be some other way of dealing with a local authority who fail to carry out the undertaking for which the lump sum was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of dealing with this matter is new.  What brings about the necessity for the new method is the fact that the lump sum payment is also new.  This is a compounded annual subsidy in relation <Col N="934" /> to something done or about to be done.  It is a new provision.  In the case of a continuing annual subsidy, the Department have some say and control, but, once the annual subsidy is compounded into a lump sum, then the Department no longer have the same sort of control.  Having lost that control, it is only fair that, where local authorities fail to adhere to the conditions governing the giving of the lump sum, they should be required to refund the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the necessity of having some way in which to deal with a local authority who fail to carry out an agreement. Where the Minister gives a lump sum to a local authority for administrative purposes and the local authority, having failed to carry out some undertaking, are then required to refund the lump sum, surely it is from the local authority the lump sum would be demanded back through the county manager?  Supposing the county manager decides to spend the money in a certain way and the local authority do not enter into the picture at all, does it not seem a little peculiar that the local authority should be required to find the money out of their rates or through borrowing to repay money which, in fact, the local authority never handled?  The principle is not a good one and I should be glad if, between now and Report Stage, the Minister would have another look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference here to subsidising the rate of interest. Is this an indication that the Minister is contemplating bringing in a scheme for subsidising interest rates other than by payment of grants?  Does this indicate an intention to contribute towards interest charges?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  This section is designed to deal with the situation which developed as a result of stabilising the interest rate between 1948 and 1953.  Interest rates then which increased from 2½ per cent to 3¼ per cent were paid back at 2½ per cent and all we are doing is continuing the law.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 35, line 37, to add &ldquo;and in paying for other premises any excess in rent over the rent paid for the premises from which he was displaced&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to provide a safeguard for certain people who have not been covered by legislation so far and who have not been included in this Bill.  I have in mind people who are forced out from an area in which rents are controlled, people who may be paying, perhaps, 5/- or 6/- a week and who may be forced out to an area in which they will have to pay £2 per week.  There is no provision to compensate these people.  They are compensated for disturbance, but compensation for disturbance is only sufficient to pay for the furniture van.  It does not meet the situation in which they find themselves having to pay an increased rent or in which a local authority puts them into a local authority house at a greatly increased rent.  There seems to be no safeguard in legislation to meet these people and give them what they should be entitled to get.  I hope the Minister <Col N="936" /> will see the good sense in this amendment and agree that it should be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There appears to be one thing missing from the section. Would the Minister say if it is simply proposed to operate this from the passing of the Act?  To be any use at all, this section would have to be operated from a date back quite some time in order to compensate people who have suffered very severely because of houses being condemned as a result of the purge here in Dublin, following the falling down of some of the houses.  Is it the intention of the Minister to cover this by back-dating this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation, section 37 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, has been strained in its interpretation to enable certain things to be done, which will continue to be done until the enactment of this measure here. I would say that this section as it stands without any amendment is wider than the strained interpretation that has been put on section 37 of the 1931 Act.  It is better than the best we could make out of that legislation. In the interim section 37 of the 1931 Act is being operated.</P>

      <P>The Minister sat down without answering the question I put to him.  There is no provision in this section for the type of person I have in mind, the person who has to pay a high rent on moving from a controlledrent house to an uncontrolled-rent house or a local authority house where the rent is estimated in excess of what he was paying prior to being moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes a sweeping obligation, whether implied or actual, on the housing authority.  The amendment as sponsored here by Deputy Clinton, which proposes that the rents the persons he has mentioned are paying should be related to the rents they were paying prior to their being moved, may be a very laudable one but I wonder is it a wise provision to make.  It could impose a rather heavy burden on the local authority.  In the section as it stands provision is made which is better than anything we have had up to now despite the fact that in addition to the 1931 Act there also was a 1962 Act in respect of dangerous buildings.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I am inclined to despair of Deputy Tully, in his present mood, accepting anything as being of any use, short of what Deputy Larkin asked for which is more than anyone could possibly concede.  I do not think even that would satisfy Deputy Tully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment could be rather sweeping. However, if the House agrees, I shall take another look at the implications of the suggestion and see whether or not we might, on the one hand, satisfy ourselves that it is not so sweeping or, on the other hand, find some compromise that would go most of the way Deputy Clinton suggests and, at <Col N="938" /> the same time, remove the danger, as I see it, of imposing too much of a burden on the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept a modification of this in order to safeguard the reasonable interests of the local authorities in so far as a person could not leave a house at a rent of 5/- and expect to be provided with alternative accommodation or that he could provide himself with alternative accommodation costing £3 and that the difference would be made up.  I can see that would be unreasonable but surely there is a way around this.  There is a way to safeguard, at least to some extent, the people who have suffered considerable hardship and will continue to suffer considerable hardship, people who were in accommodation which they considered good enough for themselves at a very low rent and who are not able to get that type of accommodation further out and who, on top of that, have the added expense of bus fares into town where they are moved out from town to this new accommodation. They have two losses, the loss incurred in paying transport costs and the loss due to increased rent.  If the Minister is prepared to come back with something that will provide these people with reasonable accommodation while safeguarding the local authority, limiting the responsibility of the local authority in this regard, I am satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which would require very careful examination. We all have every sympathy for the cases of families who are dispossessed but there may be many families who were housed out of accommodation that was considered suitable and who succeeded in getting the best accommodation that was available well in advance of their turn. They may be paying the maximum rent for the type of accommodation they have got or may not even be paying that but this is a matter that requires to be carefully considered, having regard to the fact that there are thousands of other families who are in much more unsuitable accommodation and who are still waiting to be housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> This problem arose in respect of people who are displaced because they were living in dangerous buildings or because of compulsory purchase orders.  There may be many cases where they were living in accommodation that suited them and I suppose there would be thousands of cases where the rent paid was very low, a long-standing rent.  In some cases they may have succeeded in getting accommodation which was not much better than what they had, but which was the best accommodation available.  If, as well as getting the best possible accommodation, they also had their rent subsidised as against other people living in the same type of accommodation, it would be a problem that would require examination.  Many of the people who were hardest hit were people who had small businesses and who in many cases had to provide accommodation for themselves at fairly exorbitant prices.  As well as that, they lost the advantage they had of paying a reasonably small rent for the business in which they were engaged and in order to continue on with the business, they were compelled to pay fairly high rents possibly for premises which were not convenient and not very suitable for their type of undertaking.  Both cases are affected and certainly should receive consideration. I support Deputy Tully's suggestion that whatever is decided, the Minister might consider adequate retrospective operation and I would suggest that the middle of June, 1963, should be the latest date for the local authority to exercise this authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of person I have in mind is not necessarily a person who is displaced because of dangerous buildings; it could be because of road widening, or because a whole area is being blocked out for redevelopment.  A person might then be in a perfectly safe house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has opened up the whole question of how wide the section is, with the present proposal to rebuild certain portions of Dublin city, and you cannot <Col N="940" /> rebuild until you pull down.  If we are to be told afterwards that this section covers that sort of thing, then the Minister and the House would want to be very careful about this legislation and about the wording of the section and of the Bill.  Deputy Larkin made the case for the small businessman who had to move because of a dangerous building or because somebody decided that the building might be dangerous.  We are aware of a number of landlords who got rid of tenants in that way, although eventually they themselves were forced to leave the dwellings.  Even if such people were lucky enough to get somewhere else in the neighbourhood, it was not always suitable in which to carry on business.</P>
      <P>I know of some businessmen who had to move again and again because the dangerous buildings inspector seemed to be following them.  This of course was coincidence, but that is what happened.  There was a loss to these people who suddenly found that even the most unsuitable accommodation would cost them £10 or £12, or even £20 a week.  I do not know how that can be covered, or how there can be compensation for them, but the Minister should have a look at it. Quite a number of people in this city have been left almost penniless and some people who never before had to do so are now signing on at the labour exchange, people who formerly had small businesses, and particular attention should be given to them.  The only way in which they can be included is by retrospective action and I would appeal to the Minister if he is having another look at this, as he has promised Deputy Clinton, to have a look at this matter of the date.</P>

      <P>Because I say that I feel this idea in the amendment is entitled to further consideration, I should not like people to be disappointed afterwards because they thought I was inclined to go all the way.  I do not think I could but I do not want to be too dogmatic about that until I have time to have a further look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting now to some of the points <Col N="941" /> that were raised, in regard to the question of somebody with a small business, if he has a compensatory right in the property, then obviously he is paid compensation with regard to that right, or relating to his interest in the value of that business.  This is where his property is being acquired.  Over and above that, it may well be that hardship may be caused in moving.  If that could be shown to be the case, I do not think anybody could raise an objection to further consideration being given to such a person.  If a person owns his house and, through the operations of the local authority, has to move out, then he will be compensated in regard to his ownership or for his interest in the ownership&mdash;it might not be full ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of these days I will fall out of my standing if Deputy Tully agrees with me.  If a person owns a house, or has an interest in a house, a compensatory interest either as to full ownership or leaseholder's rights&mdash; whatever it may be&mdash;then to that degree he would be compensated, whatever the operation would be.  To say that he should get further benefit because he moves from the house he was occupying for a rent of a few shillings and gets a house costing £2, and that the local authority should be obliged to make up the difference in rent, would not always be a good <Col N="942" /> thing, for the reason that although the person might be quite satisfied to stay in the premises, that is not to say the local authority would be satisfied that he or anybody else should be allowed to stay in them.  This may be for various reasons&mdash;insanitary, overcrowded, unfit, creating a public health hazard, he and his pals like him, if they were allowed to stay in bad housing conditions, and satisfied to stay in bad conditions at low rents.  He will now be taken out and given better housing at a higher rent.  It does not follow that in such cases these people may not be able to pay for the better accommodation. I do not think it is wise to say that in all cases&mdash;as this amendment is inclined to say&mdash;the entire difference should be made up.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to accept a modification that would safeguard the interests of the local authorities, while, at the same time, being fair to the person on whom new conditions are being imposed, because I think it should be evident to everyone that if he saw an advantage in moving out, he would not have to be compelled to move out.  He would go. He may see no advantage but a big disadvantage, and in those cases where people are perfectly happy with the conditions in which they are living, this charge and this extra expense are being imposed upon them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): I should like to raise a matter with regard to subsection (2).  It seems to me, if I am interpreting the section correctly, that where a man's business premises are displaced, he will be allowed such reasonable allowance as the local authority may think fit, and in the explanatory memorandum, it is stated that &ldquo;compensation for disturbance of trade or business will be payable to a person if the authority consider that he has suffered or will suffer hardship.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It would seem that if the authority consider that he has not suffered hardship, they need not pay him anything. What I miss here is any question of appeal or arbitration for persons who are displaced.  It is not mentioned in the section.  We should have some provision for arbitration or appeal on the question of loss of trade where a person is displaced.  Perhaps this is covered elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50b:</P>
      <P>In page 36, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;a letting made by virtue of section 58 of this Act&rdquo; and to substitute the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  a letting made by virtue of section 58 of this Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  the first purchase of a house in respect of which a grant is paid under sections 15, 16, 17 or 20 of this Act,</P>
      <P>(c)  the first letting of a flat or maisonette in respect of which a grant is paid under section 18 of this Act, or</P>
      <P>(d)  the first letting of a house in respect of which a grant is paid under section 17 or 19 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister would agree that every encouragement should be given, and every obstacle removed, in cases where people of moderate means are endeavouring to provide themselves with their own homes at no expense to the State, the corporations or the county councils.  That applies to everyone who qualifies for State grants and <Col N="945" /> loan facilities.  Why should those people be discouraged by the imposition of stamp duty on top of their difficulties in getting the necessary money together?  In many cases, it is a great struggle, I suggest, for these people to get the £500 to £700 that is needed at present to meet the difference between the amount of the loan and grant and the amount required to purchase the house.</P>
    <P>I know the stamp duty in this case is one per cent, but even one per cent reduces the State grant of £275 in respect of a £3,500 house by £30 to £40. Why should people who are endeavouring to relieve the State and the local authorities of the responsibility of providing houses for them, be penalised in this way, so unnecessarily, and for no service, because no service is involved in the stamp duty?  It sounds very ridiculous to me in this case that this imposition should be put on top of their other obligations.  The stamp duty in other cases is simply enormous. Legal expenses and stamp duty on the purchase of a house costing £3,500&mdash; and that is the normal price for a house in the Dublin region&mdash;are about £450. Auctioneers' fees on top of that are about £175.  That is all for the privilege of buying your own house.  Something should be done to relieve that hardship, and every effort should be made to lessen the burden on people who are trying to provide their own homes for themselves, at no-expense to the State, the corporations or the county councils.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (a) of the amendment, as I read it, proposes to re-enact the exemption from stamp duty on lettings and dwellings in section 58 (3).  In other words, it would do what is already proposed to be done in that section, so that is not at issue.  When we come to costs of £450 in respect of a £3,500 house, all I can say is that we are talking here about a stamp duty of one per cent or, as proposed in the amendment, of nil per cent.  How this can have any effect on what seems to be an exorbitant bill of charges, I cannot understand As soon as a person has £3,500, the stamp duty at the moment <Col N="946" /> is £35.  Where, then, do these hundreds of pounds come in?</P>

      <P>The trouble is that they were mentioned in passing.  It indicates that if there is any fat to be taken off somewhere, it is certainly not necessarily on the one per cent preferential rate of duty charged on these particular transactions but on the £300 or £400 added on by other operators between the getting of the house and the actual getting of the title.  I can only say that this is purely a tax revenue: there is no point in saying it is anything else.  On this particular type of transaction, one per cent is the preferential.  Whatever feelings I had about the matter before I heard the costs mentioned by Deputy Clinton, I think now that in the circumstances we are foolish not to be getting three per cent tax revenue and that those other boys might get less than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know I would be going outside it to introduce people who would be providing for themselves by purchasing <Col N="947" /> secondhand houses, so as to speak, even though loans are allowed on secondhand houses nowadays&mdash;£3,500 houses.  Stamp duty, £105; purchaser's solicitor's fees, £105; solicitor's fees dealing with mortgage, £45; solicitor's fee on loan of £3,000, £45: total £300. Then there is vendor's solicitor's fees, £105 and, if you put auctioneer's fees to that, it is another £175.  So, that is what a man has to pay for the privilege of buying his own house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to sustain anything at all.  Out of all that bill, even the £95 for a secondhand house transaction, out of £300 odd or with auctioneer's fees added, it would be nearer to £500, a sum of £95 coming back to the State that is providing the facilities of grants, loans, and so on, to the community is more than justified.  In fact, it is the best argument I have ever heard for it.</P>
      <P>I do not have any apology to make that this is a tax revenue.  It is not a question of penalising people because they want to do these things for themselves. The money for taxation has to come from somewhere and three per cent is normal for ordinary transactions. What is the case here?  A new house has a preferential rate of one per cent.  In many cases where a new house is built, a person purchases the site, in which event the ground rent is probably £25 and, in that event, the actual tax to be paid under this heading would be about £2 8s.  Od. Taking a look at the swings and roundabouts and realising that we are in the wrong side of the business in getting only £95 while £300 or £400 is going elsewhere, I do not think there is anything really wrong.  There are a lot of other places we might start looking at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that Deputy Clinton inadvertently made a very strong argument in favour of the tax but I think the Minister is arguing on the basis that two wrongs make a right.  The fact that other people are getting more than <Col N="948" /> their fair share out of the costs of the house, because the law cannot apparently control them, is no reason why the Government, the law of the land, should take extra money when in fact the Minister has it in his power here tonight to delete that particular fine. I think that argument is the one which should tell very heavily with the Minister. He is a sensible man.  I am quite sure he appreciates the fact that because other people are taking far more than their share out of whatever money the person has available who is either building a house or buying a house, it is no reason why others&mdash; by &ldquo;others&rdquo;, I mean the State&mdash;should also attempt to take a slice.  It is entirely unjustified and it is no argument in favour of it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think that the evidence produced has been very tempting for the Minister to make the reply he did, but, very definitely, two wrongs do not make a right.  Even though what the Minister now describes as a very little wrong is hardly justified because other people have been committing big wrongs against the people attempting to supply themselves with houses.  The Minister should consider this whole question again.  I am sure the amount involved, as far as the State is concerned, is not so terribly great that, even at the present time of financial stringency, the Government should take it out of the pockets of those who have very little.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a comment which I think slipped him, rather.  He said that this money was necessary for the purpose of providing people with grants.  In fact, it does reduce the Government grant by £35.  I do not know whether that aspect of it has gone home to him or not, but if he looks at it again, he will appreciate that that is true.  If he had done away with it altogether and reduced the Government grant by that £35, it would have the same effect.  The Minister might possibly reconsider it, in spite of what he has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully put his finger on the matter when he said that two wrongs do not make a right and it cannot be argued that it is right for the <Col N="949" /> State to be wrong.  If example should come from anywhere, it should come from the State.  Surely the last person we should set out to penalise is the person who is trying to relieve the responsibility of the local authorities and the State?  I hold that many of the people who provide themselves with their own homes would be a housing liability on the local authority if they did not do it.  There is no stamp duty in Northern Ireland on a house costing up to £4,500 and just for the privilege of living on this side of the Border, we have this tax thrown in.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not tried to make a case for this tax.  He just admits bluntly that it is a tax on people where the State grant has remained static for 17 years, in spite of soaring prices and in spite of soaring costs of building.  I am amazed that the Minister will not accept this suggestion and try to encourage more people to provide homes for themselves, even by that amount, because of the struggle so many people have to make to have the necessary deposit to become the owners of their own houses.  Every little extra counts and £35 is not an insignificant sum when it comes to making up the £500 that is necessary, and in some cases, it is £600 and £700.</P>

I am sorry that people have to pay that sort of money but I am not apologising for the State's £95 or the £500 or £105 either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  It is happening in many cases where if they do not go out to an auction and buy a site they do, in fact, transact a deal to acquire the site on which their house will be built.  It works out in respect of many of our new houses that the tax payable is probably around £2 or £2.10.0.  It is a concession surely in that sense.  In this Bill we reduce it to a margin which is so small that it is insignificant.  If we talk about the other charges being made for services rendered, or allegedly rendered, it is not an undue tax at all on the concessional rate of one per cent.  All I can say is that the State which does not get its 20 per cent on a £3,500 house would be very foolish.  This sort of money being paid is not obviously justified.  Unfortunately, we do not deal with it here.  We are not competent to deal with it on a Housing Bill nor have we authority to deal with it on any Bill so far as my Department is concerned.  I am not at all impressed by the allegation &mdash;particularly viewing this against the background of the other charges and costs which are regarded as normal in this day and age&mdash;that the application of a one per cent tax going back to the State which provides much more assistance in other ways is an imposition against the other general background of the hundreds of pounds mentioned here.</P>

He quoted figures which showed that we had considerably improved our position in that regard.  Here is an opportunity for him, if he is so keen on accelerating private provision of houses, and he has not been too active in regard to the public provision of houses, to help people to provide themselves with their own houses.  He states in his explanatory memorandum that he will extend stamp duty and make it payable by all housing authorities in the same way as land acquired by hospitals or other institutions. Housing authorities will have to pay stamp duty for housing.  Surely he could help the acquisition of houses by private individuals, if he is sincere in what he says about that, by having a chat with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and see if he could wipe out this stamp duty which has obtained in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We had considerable discussion on this particular question on the Finance Bill and we found that the Minister for Finance was adamant on the question. Now it is very disappointing to find the Minister for Local Government equally adamant.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Clinton has something there.  Some years ago the Department of Local Government asked for something similar to be done.  I am sure the Minister recollects what actually happened. Some local authorities completed their survey inside a few weeks, some within six months, some within a year and some have not yet completed it, the reason being that there was no time limit specified.  The result is that there cannot be a fair comparison between the figures given by local authorities a few years ago and the figures given by other local authorities now.  I think Deputy Clinton is quite right when he says a specific period should be laid down.  I know also that if it is arranged that this be done once the tendency is to say: &ldquo;We had a report last year or the year <Col N="955" /> before.&rdquo;  The important thing is that there should be an accepted period laid down and it should be the normal thing to carry out this survey every four years or in whatever period is specified but it should be a specific period.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will admit that the survey which he was responsible for having carried out in the first instance revealed a situation that it was very important to reveal.  It showed the deficiencies all over the country.  This should not be left wide open.  Local authorities should now know what is expected from them in this respect. First, they should be capable of doing this inspection in a year and if that is carried out every four years it should be adequate&mdash;make it five years if you wish: I am saying four years because of the expense of making this survey and because in a shorter period there would not be enormous changes.  If it is made every four years the organisation is there and the local authorities know their responsibility and we shall not lapse into the chaotic position in which we find ourselves at present with an enormous backlog of housing and building to make up.  That should not have occurred.  We should be able to estimate housing needs and budget in advance for them over a period.  It is time the Minister specified what he has in mind and he should not leave this wide open because if he does, it will not be accepted as a responsibility by the local authorities.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister mentioned his difficulties on several occasions in getting social surveys carried out by local bodies.  He mentioned on other occasions figures in respect of what he considers a reasonable period to carry out inspections of towns of a certain size.  I think what Deputy Clinton has suggested is reasonable and if incorporated in the Bill rather than made as a regulation it might give added force to the Minister in insisting on these surveys being carried out at regular, say four-year intervals, and it <Col N="956" /> might avoid getting into the chaotic position into which we have come in the last five or six years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very little reason to believe there is any difference in our minds on this matter or on the method of doing it.  As I see it, what I do not like about the amendment&mdash;let me put it that way&mdash; is that the period of one year could be too short in some cases, too long in others and the interval of four years may or may not be a desirable period.  The insertion of these as fixed periods would give this measure an inflexibility that I do not think is good in the circumstances.  Let us take Dublin with 130,000 dwellings approximately. The job of surveying that, assuming you had adequate and competent staff, could not be in any way compared with the job of doing a basically rural local authority, Meath or Mayo or Donegal.  There is no comparison between the two operations.  It is possible that we may be able to fix different periods for different local authorities depending not only on their need for the survey but also on the staff available to do it, in relation to the other things they also have to do. It is for that reason, to ensure a degree of flexibility, that I have left the section as it is.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the same time to Deputy Clinton that it is quite possible that what might be prescribed in the regulations under the section could very well be the one year and the four years he mentions in the amendment.  I am not saying that it will not be.  If it transpired that these were the proper periods they would be prescribed.  I do not think it is right to tie ourselves to the prescription in law because there might be reasons that would render the carrying out of inflexible schedules of surveys impossible.  We should avoid that.  It is for that reason only that I am inclined to oppose the amendments.  I am not against the intention behind them except in so far as they would destroy the flexibility that at present exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is ignoring two points.  First, while he personally has a reasonable approach to this matter, there is no guarantee that Ministers who will succeed him &mdash;and somebody will eventually succeed him&mdash;will be as reasonable about this matter as he is, and it is quite possible that a Minister will say that this provision was put in by a nuisance of a Minister and that it can be shelved.  The onus should be put on the local authorities to have this survey carried out and the way to do it is by inserting a specific period.</P>
      <P>The second point which the Minister barely touched on is the question of staffing.  The last survey was not carried out by all local authorities for the reason that they claimed they had not adequate staff available.  If there is a simple inspection carried out, the existing staff are directed to have the work done and the work will be done in a certain way and then the staff will resume their normal duties and nothing more will be done about it. Whereas, if there is a specific period laid down and a regular staff put on the job, the job will be far better done and the excuse of insufficient staff cannot be put forward.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal in what Deputy Clinton has said.  If we do not include a specific period in the section, then we might as well delete the section because it is mere whitewashing.</P>

      <P>There is one way that we could meet this idea of the whimsical Minister who would have no regard to those who went before him, which is always a distinct possibility. We may be able to meet that aspect of the matter by inserting somewhere, in lieu of the proposed amendments, a provision to the effect that the survey must be done not less than once every five years, but subject to regulations which may specify more frequent surveys; in other words, oblige the local authorities to carry out the survey not less often than once in five years and have a regulation which enables the Minister, if he thinks fit and is so advised, to have it carried out more often and to have it carried out earlier, and so on.  That would meet the main objection.</P>

      <P>I do not know how far we could go and yet retain flexibility. If you get a Minister who does not want to do this, it will not be done. There was a law passed and it was ignored, not because any Minister disliked it specifically but because nobody had time to get around to it; there was so much else to be done, it was never insisted on.  The result was that the situation got to the point where there was not any clear picture as to the overall position in regard to unfit dwellings in the country as a whole.  Certain headway has been made over recent years under the old law and with a bit of prodding here and there to get things moving.  A certain basic pattern has emerged.  Certain information has come to light.  The <Col N="959" /> picture could be clearer than it is.</P>
      <P>While I am not against the idea that as far as possible it should be inserted in the Bill as an obligation on the local authority.  I am not quite sure that it can be so provided in the Bill as not to make the provision so inflexible as to be unworkable in some cases, which would be the beginning of the end of the section.  If what we stipulated in law became clearly unworkable that would be the first step to making the section worthless.  I want to avoid that by going as far as possible to meet the wish expressed that we should provide that the minimum should be done regardless of who is Minister and regardless of his outlook.  I cannot see how far we can retain the necessary flexibility and at the same time give the positive indication to the local authority as to the carrying out of the surveys but I think we can go a good bit of the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister indicates that he is prepared to consider having written into the Bill a period of not less than five years, I think the House would support him completely, on the basis that the Minister would also have power to direct that surveys be carried out at much shorter intervals. It is quite clear that the position will vary in different areas.  The possibility of carrying out surveys may vary from one area to another.  In an area where the housing authority may be town commissioners, even though there may be staff difficulties, the nature and the size of the area and the type of dwellings and buildings might make it possible to have a survey carried out speedily whereas a number of problems might exist in other areas.  In the case of Dublin when, in 1963, it was decided that it was essential to have a survey of dangerous buildings carried out, it was estimated that it would take up to two years to have the survey carried out fairly completely with the staff then available or that could reasonably be recruited.  That is the type of problem the Minister would have to take into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, it is quite clear that at least once in the life of every <Col N="960" /> local authority there should be a complete survey and the five year period would guarantee that.  The surveys should be carried out simultaneously so that the national picture could be presented.  It would be of no great benefit to have local surveys carried out at various times.  It is important that the housing needs of the nation as a whole be presented to the House.  The Minister has indicated that he will see what can be done on the question of carrying out a survey once every five years I suggest he should also indicate that, where possible, specific aspects of problems will be surveyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 53 says:</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be the duty of a housing authority, within such period after the commencement of this section as may be specified by the Minister and thereafter at such intervals as the Minister may direct from time to time, to inspect the houses in their functional area and to ascertain&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> (a)  to what extent there exist in the area houses which are in any respect unfit or unsuitable for human habitation,</P>
    <P>(b)  any overcrowding existing in the area, and</P>
    <P>(c)  such other matters as the Minister may specify from time to time,</P>
    <P>We suggest that the other categories set out in the amendment be added, providing additional paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g).</P>
    <P>The reason why we have asked that all these be included is that, as the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, we are here legislating for the future.  We know that even at the present time&mdash;and the position must change during the years&mdash;our amendment must affect the position more or less as the years go by.  There are quite a number of areas, centres of employment with factories and so on, where employees find it impossible to get housing accommodation.  We believe that, where possible, surveys should be carried out to ensure that houses are made available for employees within a reasonable distance of their employment.  To that end, we submit there should be surveys to find out what the demand is, what the need is for private building, especially in urban and non-municipal areas. It is not necessary to go into detail about those things because we all know that quite a number of people would be prepared to build houses but the local authorities will not make provision for sites on the ground that there is no demand.</P>
    <P>In my constituency on a number of occasions I have carried out surveys on a small scale and have found a big number of people who would be prepared to build their own houses, if sites were available.  When I approached the local authority, they said they had no evidence to that effect.  I produced the evidence and the local authority proceeded to acquire sites in some cases&mdash;in others, it was not easy to procure sites.  If we lay it down in the Bill that this should be done at regular intervals, the local authority will have on record the number of people looking for sites and then make <Col N="962" /> the necessary provision to acquire land when it becomes available in the areas under their control.</P>
    <P>We believe that the demand or need for the provision of sites for houses for newly-weds should be investigated. This may be the cause of some amusement to people who believe that the provision of houses for newly-weds is not of importance and that such people should make their own arrangements to provide houses.  Though we call ourselves a Christian country, we seem to have the idea that there is no responsibility on local authorities to provide houses for people about to get married, that they can live with their in-laws in all sorts of unsuitable accommodation in what has been called their purgatory where they must suffer for a time before they qualify for houses.</P>
    <P>The way to avoid this is by planning such as we are doing now in a Bill supposed to set up an ideal for future housing needs.  We should now, therefore, make provision to ascertain what the demand will be and to do so at reasonable intervals.  Then there would not be many obstacles in the way of making the necessary arrangements for housing such people.  We also seek in the amendment to ascertain the demand or need for the provision of hostels or temporary or emergency accommodation for homeless persons who cannot be accommodated because of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to enter the very dangerous atmosphere which the mention of Griffith Barracks conjures up in this city.  All over the country we have similar situations on a smaller scale arising day after day.  It is not unusual to find people being evicted from houses because their tenancy lettings do not give them the necessary protection.  They are put out on the side of the road and the local authorities have then got to attempt to find some accommodation for them.  It may be said local authorities have no such responsibility but I had an experience recently of a family of seven or eight small children and the man and wife being put out of a private house they had been renting for a number of <Col N="963" /> years.  They found themselves in a very bad tent in very bad weather.  The local authority found everybody, including certain newspapers from outside this part of the country&mdash; it was during the newspaper strike&mdash;condemning them for their unchristian act in not providing accommodation for that family in such inclement weather.</P>
    <P>The local authority had to do something about it and rather than bring those people to the county home, which looked to be the only alternative, they eventually found some accommodation at very high rents in the area. They had to subsidise this out of the home assistance; otherwise, a number of delicate children might have died. I understand this situation occurs again and again and it can pretty easily be overcome by the provision by the local authorities of houses which will be kept for such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I know quite well also that there is a saying that when there is full employment, it is always easy to find a job for somebody and if everybody is housed properly, it is always easy to find alternative accommodation for somebody who requires housing for one reason or another.  I still believe, even in the circumstances we have at the present time, it should be possible for local authorities to have available a spare house, suitable caravans or hostels with family accommodation in which people who need emergency housing for a short period can get accommodation.  If this were done, it would get rid of the argument that people put themselves in bad housing conditions for the simple purpose of jumping the housing queue.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider and, as far as possible, try to meet the amendments, either by accepting them now or by agreeing to have them or some similar amendments prepared before the Bill comes before the House again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the inspection at certain intervals by housing authorities to assess adequately the supply and condition of houses in the local authority area. Certain matters are set out in the Bill that should be observed.  Attention should be drawn to the making of this type of survey.  The Labour amendment, and indeed our amendment, indicate all the other matters both relevant and desirable if this survey is really to mean anything.  I believe that, unless these matters are written into the legislation, they will not necessarily form part of the survey work that will later be carried out by the local authority.</P>
      <P>I do not know how good the reports which the first and only inspection that has been done are or whether they are completed.  It certainly has taken long enough to provide them and one of the reasons why it has taken so long is that medical people were involved and you had not that sort of co-ordination and co-operation with the engineering personnel, which is necessary.  I consider the engineering personnel of the council should be quite equal to deciding whether housing is satisfactory or not.</P>
      <P>We set out in amendment 57 matters which we consider important in making any sort of assessment.  We ask that between lines 10 and 11 certain new paragraphs be included, the first of which is:</P>
      <P>(c)  to what extent persons are paying for housing accommodation rents which impose undue hardship on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across many cases where people are paying rents they cannot afford, simply because there is no local authority housing available for them.  The doctor goes out to make his inspection and finds that these people are in quite suitable and spacious accommodation and he has no <Col N="965" /> regard at all to the ability of the people in question to pay the rents involved.  Therefore, I consider that is a very desirable thing to have included in this list of matters which should be investigated when making a survey.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph is:</P>
    <P>(d)  the number of old persons living in accommodation or in circumstances unsuitable for elderly persons.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with that.  There is fairly adequate attention being drawn to this.  It is no harm, nevertheless, to have it listed and to ensure that it will be included in the investigation.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we have:</P>
    <P>(e)  the suitability of premises for conversion into multiple dwellings.</P>
    <P>That could be a matter which could provide a quick and perhaps fairly cheap method of providing accommodation quickly.  It would perhaps be utilising space that is badly utilised at the moment.  It would be one way of solving in a short time the housing problems of a particular area if this particular type of accommodation could be converted, and converted quickly, to accommodate a number of families.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph is:</P>
    <P>(f)  the degree of future obsolescence.</P>
    <P>It is well to include this but it is certainly something which in the cities is being fairly well assessed at the present time.  It should be written into the Bill and the local authorities should have a clear indication of the matters to which they should pay attention and what should form part of this survey.</P>
    <P>Then there is:</P>
    <P>(g)  the proximity of adequate housing to centres of employment.</P>
    <P>That is also covered in the Labour amendment.  It is not easy in advance to decide what will be the demand in that particular sector.  All one knows at any time is that an area is set aside for industry.  There may <Col N="966" /> perhaps be a number of people coming along and proposing to set up an industry and there may be some estimate of the employment content of those industries.  It is sometimes possible to forecast for a period ahead the extra housing required for a particular area in which industry is sited or in fact the position may exist where people are at the present time coming very long distances to work in industry.  In fact they may be living in very unsuitable accommodation at some distance from the industry in order to have the advantage of employment there.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>(h)  the number of persons residing in housing accommodation provided by their employers which they will be required to vacate on termination of their employment.</P>
    <P>Here again is a class of persons or families that is excluded in the normal way.  Their employment may be in danger and they may say there is a limited period during which they will be in that employment.  In fact they may have left the employment.  There may be some sort of loose renting agreement that does not leave them anything.  The doctor goes out to the area for priorities and he sees those people in perfectly normal and suitable accommodation.  He cannot recommend them until they are on the side of the road, until they are evicted.  The threat of eviction can be arranged.  These are all the matters which should be taken into account in reckoning housing needs in a particular area.</P>
    <P>The amendment further down dealing with repairs goes further into this and suggests matters that should be taken into consideration in making this survey, one of which is redevelopment causing displacement of persons.  That is something that should be known fairly well in advance in any built-up area&mdash;the intentions in relation to redevelopment. There should be a fairly accurate calculation of the amount of disturbance this is likely to cause and of the increased number of dwellings that will have to be provided over a period.  It should not just happen that <Col N="967" /> these people, because of the decision to redevelop an area, are left in all sorts of emergency and unsuitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>The matter of the housing need arising from industrialisation is more or less covered in amendment No. 37. The legislation would be much improved if the matters referred to in these amendments were written into it. Otherwise, this inspection will be too loosely carried out and in many cases will not indicate the real needs of an area at all, especially, as the Minister has said, if there is a shortage of staff in a particular area and the local authority avoid making a number of important investigations which should influence their decision in relation to future housing needs.  For that reason, I think these amendments should be accepted <i>en bloc.</i> They may require slight rearrangement because there is a certain amount of repetition occurring in the amendments being taken together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed the Minister did not outline in a more detailed way the matters he felt a housing authority should deal with in making a survey.  He possibly intended covering these points when drafting regulations.  Nevertheless, it would be of assistance in discussing this matter if the Minister set down in greater detail what he had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the paragraph concerning to what extent there exists in any area a shortage of houses at centres of employment, in general this would refer to provincial areas.  It seeks to have written into the Bill a specific provision that the housing authorities in those areas take into account the present and future establishment of employment and whether in fact employment opportunities may be prejudiced by the lack of housing. This also has some relation to the larger cities.  Employment is attracted by the fact that suitable housing accommodation is available near an industrial unit.  There is a tendency in planning housing to deal with it on the basis that a site is available and subsequently try to attract industry, without taking into account the <Col N="968" /> fact that an industry may be sited some distance from the housing scheme.  That is an aspect of the survey to which consideration should be given.</P>
    <P>Included in the survey also should be the demand or need for the provision of sites for private building, especially in urban and non-municipal areas.  While we stress urban and non-municipal areas in the amendment, it is not suggested consideration should not be given to possible sites for municipal development and for private dwellings.  A survey along those lines would make it possible for local authorities to think more in terms of a community.  It has happened in our cities over the past 20 or 30 years that there has been a segregation of municipal dwellings from private dwellings.  That may have been necessary in order to meet the urgent demand for houses, but I do not think it has proved to be the best type of development.  It has had the effect of separating the community to too great an extent.</P>
    <P>In carrying out the survey, the housing authority should be required to examine not only the demand for sites for private dwellings in the urban and non-municipal areas but also the need for sites for private dwellings in conjunction with municipal dwellings.  In the past in certain areas, in large municipal schemes, sites were reserved for people desirous of providing their own dwellings.  Unfortunately, there was no plan for the provision at the same time of churches, schools, shops and industries.  Consequently, in every city this imbalance has developed to some extent.  Opportunity should be taken in the future to try to remedy that.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested that the survey should include the demand or need for the provision of houses for newly-weds. In years past certain local authorities took advantage of this power in order to provide houses for newly-weds. Under the regulations, these houses had to be reserved for certain categories. The subsidy paid was less than that normally paid.  But these houses were valuable where young couples who could not provide their own housing <Col N="969" /> were concerned.  Young couples, even if credit were easier and sites and houses more readily available, could not find deposits of £300, £400 or £500, to say nothing of undertaking the financial responsibility of repayments of £3 10/-, £4 or £4 10/- per week. Yet, they are reluctant, and understandably so, to start married life in a couple of rooms, even if the rooms are available at less than £3 10/- or £3 per week.</P>
    <P>A smaller house than that normally provided by municipal housing authorities would meet the needs of these young people, houses at a reasonable rent; in time, they could transfer to a larger local authority dwelling or they might even be in a position to transfer to private enterprise housing.  A survey of the needs of such people should be carried out.  Up to two years ago, there was a draw for houses for newly-weds. That scheme commenced in 1950.  An undertaking had been given some years earlier that these houses would be provided and the local authority felt committed to include all those who got married after the date on which the scheme was mooted.  The result was that at the first draw there were some hundreds of married couples with one, two, or three children participating in the scheme.  I believe the type of survey I have mentioned in this regard is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to subsection (d):</P>
    <P>the demand or need for the provision of hostels, or temporary or emergency accommodation for homeless persons who cannot be accommodated at an early date because of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to dilate on a matter which has been the subject of so much comment here and elsewhere. The system of providing hostels for families who cannot provide accommodation for themselves has been successfully operated elsewhere. In Britain, emergency accommodation is provided.  No one can condone a situation in which a family, put out of housing accommodation by order of the court, perhaps because a building is dangerous and scheduled for demolition, <Col N="970" /> perhaps because certain people are anxious to dispose of property for purely commercial purposes, is left without some kind of accommodation. While local authorities could not house these families in advance of those much higher on the priority list, the possibility of providing some type of hostel accommodation is worthy of examination and worthy of a provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of a survey to establish the needs of the aged.  In this regard it would be desirable for the housing authority and the health authority to combine on such a survey.  Housing may not be the answer in the case of every aged person.  The provision of a room or two might be no solution.  The old people might well be incapable of looking after themselves: they might need fairly constant attention.  That is why the Minister should examine into the desirability of carrying out such a survey.  It is possible that in some cases the addition of a room to an existing dwelling might provide suitable accommodation for the aged.  This could be done by way of subsidy.</P>
    <P>With regard to obsolescence, at the rate we are going it is doubtful if obsolescence will present any major problem in the future; but in Dublin, and throughout the country, there are one-storey and two-storey houses which will require examination.  A survey of these should be undertaken to discover what the possible need in regard to accommodation may be.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Donegal River Drainage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday, 20th October last, I addressed to the Minister for Finance Question No. 55 on the Order Paper as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if in view of the extensive flooding in the Finn and Lennon valleys, County Donegal, he will state what steps he proposes to take by way of proper drainage to prevent a recurrence and to provide better farming <Col N="971" /> conditions for the farmers who work these farms.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary concluded his reply, I brought it to the notice of the Chair that I did not hear him, and I refer to Volume 218, No. 1, Question No. 55 of that date.  Any person who wishes to read the Dáil Debates will quite easily see that more than Deputy Harte did not hear the Parliamentary Secretary.  While I strenuously object to a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary trying to evade the issue by not speaking up, I am satisfied that the present Parliamentary Secretary has given me this opportunity, which is the first opportunity available to him, of ventilating the happenings in the Finn Valley on the night of October 7th.</P>
    <P>The Finn is a river which runs from the high reaches of Glenfin into Donegal right through the Finn Valley until it meets the Mourne, and both the Finn and the Mourne create the river Foyle.  This is very high, fertile land and in view of the disaster which occurred in the town of Ballybofey, and indeed all along the river banks, on the night of October 6th or early October 7th, the Parliamentary Secretary should re-examine the draining of the River Finn.</P>
    <P>In a financial crisis such as this country is experiencing at the moment, this may be a tall order, but I feel it my duty to suggest it here.  If one examines the facts and uses a certain amount of imagination and foresight, one is left with one conclusion in respect of the night the Ballybofey area was flooded and 900 teenagers marooned in a dance hall: if that flood had not hit the dance hall until one hour later and caught those young couples going home or talking on the street, many lives could have been lost. Who will be responsible if this happens a second time?  I am not an alarmist but that has happened once and could happen again.  If, for example, instead of having a dance in the hall that night, as is the practice, bingo had been in operation and the people attending there were of an older age group than the people who attended <Col N="972" /> the dance, what kind of pandemonium would have been in the hall with flood waters coming through the doors?</P>
    <P>Immediately after the catastrophe in Ballybofey, every public representative, local or Dáil, made it his business to go there and see what happened and to pull his weight by contacting the Office of Public Works and, indeed, the Taoiseach.  Deputy O'Donnell and I sent telegrams to the Taoiseach asking him to declare the Finn Valley and the Lennon Valley disaster areas. Senator McGowan, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, stated likewise. That weekend we had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Senator McGowan examining the matter in one direction and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Fianna Fáil county councillors examining it in another.  They all discovered the same facts and were all of the same opinion, that the disaster was due entirely to bad drainage of the River Finn.  Senator McGowan disclosed&mdash;I cannot find the reference at the moment&mdash;that the amount of damage would be £300,000.  It transpired at a special meeting of the Donegal County Council that the damage would be approximately £150,000. I will accept the figure of £150,000 as being the correct one.</P>
    <P>Surely it would be good economics on the part of the Government to spend £150,000 on the drainage of these two rivers?  Not alone would it prevent a recurrence of the disaster but it would provide farmers with a decent standard of living so that they would know that when they put in crops, they would be able to harvest them when the time came.  At the moment any farmer who crops his land along either of these valleys does so possibly in the full knowledge that if there is a week's rain, he will lose his entire crop.  This is the dilemma in which the Donegal farmers in the Finn and Lennon Valleys find themselves.</P>
    <P>The situation has been aptly described in local newspapers.  I do not wish to delay the House by quoting the local newspapers but I should like to quote the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> of Friday, 15th October, where it says in relation to the Lennon Valley:</P>
    <P>From Churchhill to Ramelton, <Col N="973" /> particularly, and the Kilmacrennan area hundreds of acres of oats and potatoes have been written off as a complete loss.</P>
    <P>This is not peculiar to 1965 and the storms which caused this situation in 1965.  This is a hardy annual.  I have not been so long in public life to forget that certain members of the present Government Party in very senior positions made election promises that the Finn and the Lennon would be drained as soon as their Party got into power.  I am also satisfied that since I came into public life, every political manoeuvre has been employed by the same public representatives to gull and persuade people, particularly at election times, that these promises would be fulfilled when they were returned to office.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make a political issue out of this but the Parliamentary Secretary is a man who recognises the serious situation that could have arisen in Ballybofey on the night in question. I am sure he would not wish to have it on his conscience that if that happened next month, or in a year's, or two years' time, the people attending the dance or other function in the hall might not be so lucky, because the House should realise that but for the grace of God, lives could have been lost on that night and the life of any man, woman or child cannot be assessed in terms of finance.  Apart from anything else, this is one consideration which the Parliamentary Secretary cannot easily disregard.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the machinery used on the Swilly embankment was not transferred to the Lennon or Finn Valley.  That may be answered officially by the Office of Public Works as happens when pressure is brought to bear on them for the drainage of a particular river, but it appears to be elementary economics that if machines are available adjacent to the Finn or the Lennon, they should be put to work immediately instead of being transported at great cost to other parts of the country.  If it is not possible to drain these rivers, then serious consideration should be given to the partial de-rating of the agricultural <Col N="974" /> land.  It can easily be recognised that if a farmer cannot harvest his crops, he cannot earn a living and being unable to earn a living from the land which he toils, it is ludicrous in the extreme that he should have to pay his rates.</P>
    <P>I have promised Deputy O'Donnell a few minutes of the allotted time and I make this final appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.  In my opinion, the amount of money necessary to drain the River Finn and the River Lennon would be very well spent even if it meant that the job would be merely started and the embankments built at a later stage.  Any attempt on the part of the Office of Public Works and the new Parliamentary Secretary to alleviate the problems which confront the farmers in these valleys would be very much appreciated by them.  I hope that this discussion will in some small way enlighten the Parliamentary Secretary, and if he wishes to tour the valleys, I invite him to do so.  If he gives me ample notice, I will be glad to tour them with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which I wish to make is much more urgent than that raised by Deputy Harte. Deputy Harte talked about the long-term policy for the drainage of these rivers but what is more urgently necessary is assistance for these people in the glens.  The <i>Derry Journal</i> for 8th October carried this banner headline &ldquo;Night of Terror in Donegal&rdquo;. A day of terror is bad enough but a night of terror is worse.  I have had an opportunity of inspecting these valleys and I have seen houses flooded to a depth of five or six feet.  I have also seen houses which were flooded and had it not been for the fact that they were two-storey houses the families could have been drowned in their sleep.  Last night in Pettigo I saw a house which was flooded as a result of the neglect in cleaning the Lennon River.  We have heard a lot about cleaning the River Shannon and there has been a lot of blowing about that, but here we have a small catchment area which could be tackled by means of an interim drainage scheme.  Even at this stage, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act something could be <Col N="975" /> done.  I was in a field quite near the town of Castlefin where a man had four acres of barley on conacre land which he had paid for and had tilled. Not one solitary stook of barley was left in that field.</P>
      <P>Members of the Donegal County Council are reasonable men and they are agreed that something must be done to compensate these unfortunate people who suffered on that night of terror.  We have a precedent for this, as I have pointed out on a few previous occasions.  The precedent is the North Strand in Dublin when all red tape was cut to ensure that the people would be reasonably compensated, as they were compensated by the then Government.  There should be no difficulty in setting up an independent tribunal to inquire into what damage was done on that night and on a few nights since.  If these people can satisfy an independent tribunal that they suffered damage, they should be compensated by the Government. There is no use in appealing for more tillage unless the farmers are satisfied that their tillage will be protected.  The only way that that can be done is by draining these rivers but pending that, I appeal to the Government to give compensation.</P>
      <P>It makes very bad reading for people in Donegal to read that the Taoiseach said, when this matter was being discussed, and I quote from Volume 218, column 64: &ldquo;It rained in other parts of the country too.&rdquo; Deputy Costello, when Taoiseach, did not say that to the people of the North Strand nor were the people of the Shannon catchment area told that.  It is poor consolation to the people of Donegal and it is something we would not expect from the Government and something we are not going to accept from the Government.  Unless some relief is given this year, these people will be financially unable to till their land next spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope my appeal will not fall on deaf ears.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is sympathetic and will do anything he can.  What we are asking him to do is to use his influence <Col N="976" /> with the Government.  We are asking his colleagues, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Cunningham, to use their influence with the Government to ensure&mdash;we do not want any political capital out of this&mdash;that something is done for these people.  I know that Deputy Breslin and Deputy Cunningham are anxious that these people should be compensated.  They have more influence with the Government than we have and I appeal to them to use that influence to see that what Deputy Costello did on one occasion, cut red tape, is done again and that these unfortunate farmers are compensated for the loss they sustained.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to apologise to <Col N="977" /> Deputy Harte because when he began speaking he said he could not hear my reply to his question on 20th October. If you recall, Sir, it was very difficult for you or for anyone else to hear my reply, even if my delivery was a little faulty, because, so far as I can recall, pretty well every member of the Fine Gael Party on that occasion was giving tongue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Harte's plea and Deputy O'Donnell's plea can be taken to be an official Fine Gael departure from the procedure that has always been accepted since 1945 of sticking to the priority list set at the time the Arterial Drainage Act was passed through the House.  If this is the official Fine Gael view, it is peculiar that it has not emerged until now, because they themselves had two periods of office in which they could have, if they wished, reviewed the priority list as it stands at present.  No one has done that.  I think it is wise that no one has attempted to do it, because there are good economic and engineering reasons why the Office of Public Works have abided at all times by the priority list established at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was bad drainage through the negligence of the Office of Public Works.  I should like to say in that connection that the rainfall in the Ballybofey area on that night was phenomenal.  There were three inches of rainfall within five hours.  It is worth while reading an extract from the engineering report on that particular incident.  It says:</P>
      <P>No drainage scheme could reasonably be designed for such phenomenal rainfall which only rarely occurs, and then only in small areas, in this case just upstream of Ballybofey.</P>
      <P>As a rough guide, the largest overall catchment rainfall intensity that could be catered for in the general run of economic schemes would be less than two inches in 24 hours.</P>
      <P>In this case we had three inches in a concentrated area within five hours. Most rational people will agree that rainfall of those proportions would be bound to cause flooding conditions.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is understandable, but Deputy Harte completely ignored the fact that there are vast areas in the country besides Donegal which are in just as great need of drainage, and which suffered just as much as Donegal from time to time from flooding.  In recent times we have seen very severe flooding in different parts of the country. I myself in the town of Kilkenny saw the water lapping about the pews of the Black Abbey Church&mdash;which was built in the 12th century.  Thousands of acres of hay and corn were flooded by the Nore and the people near the Suir had the same experience time and time again.  This is by no means peculiar to Donegal at all.  I, as a farmer, can appreciate the losses incurred by farmers in conditions such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made a very good point before he finished when he said he was concerned that drainage machinery now in Donegal should be utilised to <Col N="979" /> the best advantage and that the money expended should be spent to the best advantage.  It is for that reason, and not for any other reason, that the priority list as it stands at present was drawn up.  Our engineering advice both in the case of the Finn and the Lennon puts them pretty well down the scale in each case, which does not mean that Donegal has been neglected, by any means, in the matter of drainage.  In fact, it was a little more fortunate than most counties.  The Swilly embankment, the Cloon Burn, the Abbey and the Blanket Nook, were all taken in hands in recent times.  I do not think there is any Deputy from Donegal or anywhere else who would not admit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want in any way to belittle or minimise the sufferings of the people in the Ballybofey areas or valleys who were affected by this phenomenal rainfall, but I refuse to accept&mdash;personally or on behalf of the Office of Public Works&mdash;that it was through any negligence on their part that this phenomenon occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether I should mention at all the very florid contribution <Col N="980" /> made by Deputy O'Donnell except to say I do not think it comes within my terms of reference to establish an independent tribunal to inquire into incidents of this kind.  For my own part, the people who suffered in this flooding have my sympathy and my understanding as a person who has suffered losses of that kind himself and who probably, for that reason, would appreciate the difficulty and the seriousness of the problem at least as well as either Deputy Harte or Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
