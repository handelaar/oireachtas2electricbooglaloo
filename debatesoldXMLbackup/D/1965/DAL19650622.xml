    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have given further consideration to any steps which might serve to terminate the present dispute between certain employees and CIE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have learned from the Press that on Thursday last, the 17th instant, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions sent a letter to the Labour Court asking the Court to investigate, at once, all outstanding claims and grievances of Unions having members employed by Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>In response to that request the Labour Court had discussions, on Friday last, with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of Córas Iompair Éireann and, on Saturday last, with representatives of the CIE group of Unions and of the National Busmen's Union.  Later, on Saturday, the Labour Court announced that it was considering the position further in the light of those discussions but that up to the moment it had little hope of being able to find a basis for an early resumption of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no change in the situation since that announcement by the Labour Court, nor any indication that its further consideration of the <Col N="1092" /> position has disclosed the possibility of a useful initiative on its part at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered whether either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Transport and Power might investigate the circumstances which have arisen, whereby a particular union, the NBU is recognised for certain purposes by CIE but has not access to the same staff negotiating machinery as the other unions and has he considered that that particular circumstance has operated in any way to prevent a general discussion of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything to be investigated there. The position is that the union to which the Deputy referred, the National Busmen's Union, is licensed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and is recognised by CIE. It is not a party to this negotiating machinery which was set up by agreement between CIE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and which is confined in its scope to unions which are affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is possible that some easement of the situation could be achieved in an adjustment of that position, but it is not a matter in which investigation by the Minister would be of any use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider taking some steps to see that the Labour Court will meet the parties in the dispute again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know the Labour Court has not indicated that it has brought to an end its interest in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will admit, I think, that the Labour Court in its statement appeared to be very pessimistic, more pessimistic than the situation really warrants, and it is my firm belief that there might be progress if the Labour Court called the interested parties together again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that, if <Col N="1093" /> the Labour Court has any reason to think that, it will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also ask the Taoiseach if his attention has been brought&mdash;I do not want now to make mischief here; I want to say that at the outset&mdash;to a statement appearing in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> to the effect that CIE are seeking an injunction against the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union to prevent that body pursuing a claim for a shorter working week on the basis of the claim being in contravention of the National Agreement?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that such a move in present circumstances is calculated only to damage further industrial relations between CIE and other unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen that statement and I do not know if there is any foundation for it.  In any event, I would not be prepared to comment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say it is scandalous behaviour on the part of CIE if, in these circumstances of a transport dispute, they seek to get an injunction against a reputable union which is not contravening, and does not want to contravene, the National Wage Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that the Government are gravely concerned by all the implications in this situation, both in regard to management-worker relations generally and in regard, of course, to the future of transport policy?  It has been the experience in the past that, when CIE freight services were interrupted, either road or rail, there was a serious and permanent loss of business to CIE subsequently because firms that used these services decided to make their own transport arrangements.  The implications of this situation in relation to transport policy generally will, of course, have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not emphasise the point I made earlier that no technicality in regard to negotiating machinery should be allowed to stand in the way of any possibility of fruitful <Col N="1094" /> discussions or, at any rate, some discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter in regard to which I have any official knowledge, but inquiries I have made with regard to the point he has raised indicate that the National Busmen's Union has not applied for affiliation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I assume it would be difficult for the Congress to regularise the position of the Union in regard to the negotiating machinery without such an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach must be forced to admit&mdash;if not in public, then to himself&mdash;that CIE have not behaved very tactfully in the past ten days, what with this lockout, now this injunction and the abuse in advertisements at the taxpayers' expense of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. These things are not calculated to improve industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share with the Deputy the hope that there will be in the next few days an outburst of tact and commonsense and logic in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the part of CIE. They opted out of their responsibility to provide public transport.  They multiplied the strike.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food at mid-May, 1964 and mid-May, 1965 and the actual change in each case and (b) the percentage change over the period in the prices of all the items entering into the Consumer Price Index numbers. In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful. The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries. Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each enquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices, computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentage calculated from the actual changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1106" /> for Transport and Power if his attention has been directed to a report concerning the level of hotel prices in this country and the effect of these on the tourist trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy and I have also seen a subsequent article by the same author commenting favourably on the premises and food in certain named hotels and also on the prices which are described as &ldquo;good value&rdquo;, &ldquo;very fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;excellent value&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Hotel tariffs are fixed by the individual hotel managements and these tariffs are quoted in the Official Guide to Hotels which is published annually by Bord Fáilte.  The Board's powers under the Tourist Traffic Acts are limited to ensuring that the prices quoted in the Official Guide are not exceeded.</P>
      <P>I am very greatly concerned at price increases in any sector of the tourist industry which could tend to offset the present intensive campaign to increase tourist traffic.  I am aware, however, that hoteliers, in common with other sections of the community, have had to face increased costs in the past year.  Some hoteliers have absorbed these increases and they deserve to be commended.  Some other hotelier would, however, seem to have increased their prices more than can reasonably be justified and I am examining the position to see whether any action can be taken towards halting this trend, though I do not consider that price control as such would be practicable.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the hotel industry generally realise that excessive charges would result in eventual loss to themselves and to the tourist industry generally through the diversion of tourist traffic to other markets offering better value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International tourism is highly competitive and many countries are in a position to offer better holiday weather and a greater range of organised entertainments than we can.  It is essential, therefore, if we are to maintain <Col N="1107" /> our foothold in the international market, that our charges for services be held at a level that will represent good value for money and be sufficiently attractive to encourage tourists to visit us and to make return visits.</P>
    <P>Hoteliers faced with the difficult problem of rising costs would do well to explore&mdash;possibly on a joint basis &mdash;the means of extending the season and of achieving higher annual occupancy rates.  They could also consider whether their premises would lend themselves to more efficient and economic operation through the adoption of modern methods and equipment. I can assure them of the full support and co-operation of Bord Fáilte in any measures they may adopt for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what steps he has taken to implement the proposal that passenger service charges be included in the price of air tickets to obviate the cost, inconvenience, and irritation caused to passengers by separately collecting the charges immediately prior to the point of embarkation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A large proportion of air tickets for departures from Ireland are sold abroad and a ticket <Col N="1108" /> may cover departures from many airports with different levels of passenger service charge, not all of which can be foreseen when a ticket is purchased. The difficulties in including the passenger service charge in the price of the ticket are, therefore, a matter for settlement by international aviation bodies.</P>
      <P>I have suggested to the International Civil Aviation Organisation that a study group be set up for the purpose of reaching an acceptable solution to the problem.  I have agreed to be represented at any discussions in the matter and now await further developments at international level.</P>
      <P>As stated in reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 12th May, 1964, I have taken steps to ensure that, where possible, the passenger service charge will be collected with the price of the air ticket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an indication of the system he has in mind when he says that, where possible, he is asking that the service charge be collected at the time of sale of ticket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The air companies, for example, are willing to collect the passenger service charge in advance and put a coupon on the ticket saying that it has been paid.  Certain travel agents do it.  It requires the agreement of the travel agents and, above all, of all the air lines that they accept as final and conclusive the imposition of these special passenger service charges.  It requires collaboration to operate a system in which by common consent travel agents will tend more and more to provide coupons for the payment of these passenger service charges.  It is a matter of international organisation.  The whole thing arose from the fact that countries, one by one, adopted these service charges, and we now have to face up to the fact that they are in operation over almost the whole of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus are recouped the actual costs of acting as my agents in the collection of the airport passenger service charge.  The costs of collection allowed to them in 1964-65 amounted to £16,800.  The net amount accuring to the Exchequer for that year in respect of each airport was:&mdash;Dublin, £186,483; Shannon, £22,514; Cork, £18,622, a total of £227,619.</P>

      <P>I cannot usefully add anything at this stage to the statements on the credit situation which I made in reply to questions last week.</P>

    <P>Responsibility for the treatment of individual cases must rest with the banks and I have no reason to doubt that the consultation procedures to <Col N="1111" /> which I referred last week will ensure, as far as possible, that such cases are dealt with in conformity with the general principles of the advice given by the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>No such general direction was given by the Central Bank to the Associated Banks nor, indeed, was any such direction approved of or sought by me.  As I stated very explicitly last week, the position was that the banks were advised not to increase their lending as fast as they increased last year and that they should give priority to purposes of a productive nature and, in that category, purposes connected with the export of industrial and other goods.  I am not aware that any other direction was given to the banks.  I know it was not.</P>

    <P>The salaries were revised in the light of the finding of the Civil Service Arbitration Board (Report No. 120) on a claim on behalf of higher executive officers.  As regards secretaries and assistant secretaries, it was found necessary to make a special adjustment in their remuneration by reference to that of their equivalents in outside employment and, in particular, in State-sponsored bodies.  The circumstance that in these bodies the levels of remuneration were substantially higher than those paid to top-ranking civil servants, despite the heavy responsibilities of these officers, had resulted in a marked and undesirable deterioration in their relative positions.  The adjustment approved was intended to go some distance to correct this distortion.</P>
    <P>The revision of allowances had regard to the finding of the Civil Service Arbitration Board (Report No. 96) on a claim for an increase in certain allowances in the nature of pay on behalf of officers comprehended by the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>

At the first inspection a certificate of approval and estimate of the necessary works were prepared. The three subsequent inspections followed receipt of notifications from the applicant who reported on each occasion that all works had been completed.  On each inspection, however, it was found that individual items which were included in the original estimate of necessary works had not been done.  No minor faults were found at any time, and the grant will be paid when all the approved works are completed by the applicant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The emission of noxious fumes and gases from certain specialised industries, mainly chemical works, are controlled under the Alkali, et cetera, Works Regulation Act, 1906, which is administered by my Department. The works are required to be registered annually and are subject to inspection by the chief Alkali Inspector, who must be satisfied as to the precautions taken to prevent the emission of noxious gases.  The report of the chief Alkali Inspector is furnished annually to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> With regard to smoke emission, certain controls are contained in the nuisance provisions of section 107 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, which are operated by the local sanitary authorities, but these do not apply to factory premises within the meaning of the Factories Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, gives wide powers to carry out investigations in regard to atmospheric pollution and to make regulations designed to prevent such pollution.  A programme of measurements of air pollution has been organised by my Department, in co-operation with some industrial and other bodies.  This programme is being systematically extended and, in the meantime, draft interim regulations are being prepared which will place restrictions on emission of dark smoke from all premises other than private dwelling houses.</P>
    <P>No prosecutions have been instituted on behalf of the Department under the Alkali, et cetera, Works Regulation Act, 1906, during the past two years, and I am not aware of the institution by local authorities of prosecutions in regard to smoke emissions.  In cases of complaint in regard to smoke issuing from factory premises, improvements have been effected in many cases by voluntary co-operation by the proprietors with inspectors from the local authority or from my Department who visit the premises in an advisory capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are occasions where people over 21 are not on the register.  If there are people over 16 on the register, I am not aware of it.  In these cases, in all the thousands of names that are compiled annually and that must be reviewed, certain mistakes may take place.  We cannot get away from that.

      <P>I am fully cognisant of the urgent need for improvement of the arterial routes leading out of Dublin, including those mentioned by the Deputy, and I have assured the road authorities concerned that the necessary financial support will be forthcoming for the works involved.  These road authorities are engaged on a comprehensive programme for the development of the routes to modern standards, including planning and design, land acquisition, and execution of works.  Thus, work on the improvement to dual carriageway standard of a number of sections of the Dublin-Naas road has already been completed and work is in progress on a further section; work has also been completed on a section of the Bray road, namely, the section at Loughlinstown.</P>
      <P>As to the question of a general policy statement on this matter, I would draw attention to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in which it is stated that it is clear from the traffic data available that roads of at least dual carriageway standards are already required on certain of the arterial routes radiating out of Dublin, and that priority will be given to the improvement of these routes during the course of the Programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why the 30 mph zone on that part of the Dublin-Sligo road passing north-east of Boyle was replaced by a 40 mph zone considering that this part of the road carries the traffic to and from the Catholic Church, the new infant school, the convent schools, the golf links and the sports field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the setting out of the built-up area speed limits in 1963, a considerable volume of complaint was expressed to the effect that there was a lack of uniformity and in particular that 30 mile an hour zones extended too far outside built-up areas.  These factors militated against respect for the speed limits and made enforcement difficult.  Accordingly, I decided to have the application of the limits reviewed by a central team.  As <Col N="1133" /> a first result, the limits on the arterial routes have been amended in various respects, and I am satisfied that the new zones secure uniformity and take account of traffic conditions as far as it is possible to do so.  The change in Boyle formed part of the changes generally made and fits in with the general pattern.</P>
      <P>The road in question is a wide road with good visibility and little development adjacent to it.  For that reason it was felt that the imposition of a speed limit of 30 miles per hour was unrealistic.  Because of the schools adjacent to the road it was felt, however, that some restriction was necessary, and a 40 mph speed limit was imposed.</P>

I would remind the Deputy that the allocations to Counties Sligo and Leitrim under the County Road Improvement Grant in the current financial year show an increase of 10 per cent over the allocations received by them in 1964-65.  I would point out also that, in recognition of the extent of the county road problem in both counties, the County Road Improvement Grant allocations to them in recent years have been maintained at a high level, in contrast to other counties who have suffered reductions in the amounts of their County Road Improvement Grant allocations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will make a statement regarding the grazing rights on the Curragh, County Kildare, including especially information as to when these rights first arose; how they arose; and what persons are entitled to graze animals there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The grazing rights on the Curragh, County Kildare derive from grants of certain lands surrounding the Curragh, which were made after the dissolution of the monastic institutions in Ireland and which included a right of commonage over the Curragh.</P>
      <P>Under the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1868, three Commissioners were constituted to ascertain, among other things, what (if any) rights of common of pasture existed on the Curragh.  The Commissioners made their award in 1869 and it is embodied in and confirmed by the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1870.  The award set forth that the Curragh should not be grazed by any animals except sheep; it listed the persons whose claims to rights of common of pasture were allowed; and it set out the number of sheep which each such person was entitled to graze.  The total number of sheep for which grazing rights were allowed was 7,957.</P>
      <P>Since the passing of the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1961, grazing rights in respect of 1,432 sheep have been voluntarily surrendered in connection with the inclosure of portion of the Curragh for horse racing and training purposes. It was also agreed in the same connection that a further 307 rights, vested in the Minister for Agriculture, would not be exercised again.  Two further rights have been surrendered in connection with the provision of a site for a school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is, therefore, that grazing rights for 6,216 sheep <Col N="1141" /> may be exercised on the Curragh.  The persons holding those rights are successors in title to persons who had claims allowed by the 1869 award.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only explaining that the Resolution becomes necessary because of the effects of certain provisions in the Succession Bill&mdash;section 9 (2), section 108 (2) and section 118.  The combined effect of the proviso to section 9 (2) and of Part VI of the Bill is to provide that succession duty on pure realty shall be payable by the new statutory next-of-kin designated in Part VI instead of, as at present, by the heir-at-law. In referring to statutory next-of-kin, I, of course, include a spouse and children.</P>
      <P>The effect of section 108 (2) and section 118 (2) is twofold.  Firstly, the legal right share of a spouse and any provision for a child under section 117 will be payable out of the estate remaining after the payment of expenses, debts and liabilities other than estate duty.  Secondly, the legal right share of a spouse and any property given to a child under section 117 will each bear its own due proportion of the estate duty payable on the full estate of the deceased, that is to say, the estate remaining after payment of all expenses, debts and liabilities other than estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 118 (1), legacy and succession duty will be payable on the legal right share of a spouse as well as on property given to a child under section 117.  A legal right share and the share of a child under section 117 represent new succession rights which will be treated as if they arose under and by virtue of the will of the deceased.  For clarity, I might perhaps explain that in general succession duty is payable on immovable property, <Col N="1147" /> whereas legacy duty is payable on movables.</P>
    <P>The reason that section 118 (2) provides that the legal right share of a spouse and the property given to a child under section 117 shall each bear its own due proportion of estate duty is that otherwise complications would arise where a bequest of property was made for public purposes.  Such property is exempt from estate duty to the extent that it becomes available for public purposes.  However, one cannot calculate the amount so becoming available until the amount of the legal right share and the value of the property (if any) awarded by the court under section 117 have been determined. In fixing the size of the estate out of which the legal right share or the property under section 117 is to be paid, estate duty is not deducted.  This is, as I have indicated, because of the provision in subsection (2) of section 108.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 14 of the 1914 Finance Act, if a testator settles his property on trust for his wife for life and, after her death, on his children, there is no estate duty payable on her, the second, death. Under this Bill, that is not a discharge of the obligation in respect of legal right.  In consequence, when the wife dies, there must be estate duty payable in respect of the second death under this Resolution.  Neither the Minister in the Bill nor the Minister for Finance in the Finance Bill has protected that exemption and it is because that exemption is not protected and is done away with, amongst other reasons the Minister for Justice has given, that the Financial Resolution is necessary.  It has the effect of creating additional estate duty payable in respect of the death of the second spouse and the effect of this Resolution is that such duty must be payable.</P>

      <P>No, what the Deputy has referred to is referable to a Finance Bill or an amendment to a Finance Bill, but it has no reference whatever to any of the sections referred to in this particular measure. Indeed, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1148" /> advise me that there is no additional taxation in relation to estate duty, legacy duty or succession duty, involved in this measure.  The basis of assessing these duties is changed by virtue of the spouse's legal right share and of the children's right to appeal to the courts, but there is no further amendment or change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a trick answer.  The fact is that this Bill means that there is not a discharge of the legal obligation created here to provide that a wife, for example, would have the life interest.  If the wife has the life interest alone, then on her death there is no duty payable in respect of property that has already borne duty and it is because of that that this Bill does create additional duty.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is under a misapprehension. There is nothing in this measure to prevent a testator from doing what Deputy Sweetman has stated, if he wishes to adopt that method of avoiding a certain proportion of duty, and the spouse may take the life interest, with further provision after the death of the spouse.  There is nothing to prohibit a testator from doing that.</P>

      <P>I am not at all clear what the purpose of this Resolution is, if it is not for the purpose of having estate duty paid that is not payable under the law as it stands at the moment.  Surely that is putting it in very simple terms.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me whether or not I am correct.  If this Resolution is not passed by the House, what is the effect?  Is it not the purpose of moving the Resolution to ensure that succession duty, or estate duty, or whatever you like to call it, is going to be payable on the passing of this and presumably on the passing of the Bill, which would not be pavable if the Resolution were not passed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We need this particular Resolution because the basis of descent is being changed by incorporating a legal right for the spouse and the right of children to apply to the courts.  By reason of that change, <Col N="1149" /> it is necessary also that we have a Financial Resolution to provide that succession duty, legacy duty and estate duty can be paid.  The Deputy's presumption is correct.  No additional taxation under these duty headings is involved in the measure.  It is merely to provide for the continuance of these particular duties under the new scheme of descent which will obtain under this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Is it not the effect of section 110 that the spouse must take, if there are no children, one-half of the estate absolutely and if there are children, one-third absolutely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that &ldquo;she must take&rdquo;.  This is a misapprehension I have sought to remove in the course of the discussions we have had on the Bill at all stages.  There is no compulsion in regard to legal rights, either under the Bill as it was originally framed or as it is now amended.  A widow, for example, if she wishes, may take her legal right share of one-third where there are children or one-half where there are no children, but there is no compulsion so to take and, in the event of her not taking within 12 months, then the right is forfeited. That is why she may take a life estate if she thinks that is more suitable.  If she does not want to take anything out of the estate, she need not.  The only right she will have is a legal right which she may elect to take within 12 months&mdash;not a mandatory share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's explanation the option she must take is an option as to whether she is going to take the one-half or the one-third as the case may be and put the estate her deceased husband has left to a second lot of duty after her death.  That is what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the law is perfectly clear that if one spouse leaves property to another spouse for life, then estate duty is payable on the death of the first spouse and not on the death of the second, but if a spouse <Col N="1150" /> leaves property to the other spouse absolutely and the other spouse succeeds to it absolutely by intestacy or by taking it under this Bill, then on the death of the second spouse, estate duty will be paid for a second time. Therefore this scheme of the Minister's does mean that in relation to what I may call the family fortunes if the spouse exercises her legal right under section 110, the State gets a double crack of duty.  I admit that she is not bound so to exercise, but if she does, the State gets a double crack of duty and therefore the position is that this legal right, in so far as the legal right is concerned, does away with the spouse's exemption, and it should not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because in section 110 there is no compulsion on the surviving spouse to accept a particular share and insist on it.  If the spouse acts as the Deputy suggests, the estate duty which exists at present, whatever that may be, will come into operation, but there is nothing in this measure to change that level of estate duty.  If the spouse chooses to act in so far as his or her legal right is concerned, then the existing provisions of whatever Finance Act is law will come into effect.  This, however, is not as a result of this measure; it is as a result of whatever Finance Acts have been enacted.  There is no compulsion under this measure to make a surviving spouse proceed in that manner if it is to her advantage to take a life estate.  In many cases a procedure which a widow might adopt would be to accept an annuity from a life estate.  Estate duty can be avoided in that way, as is the position at the moment.  The widow can enjoy the fruits of the life estate, and the remainder of the estate after her death will go as the testator wishes.  That can be done under the will, as at the <Col N="1151" /> present time, and it may be of advantage to the widow to adopt that procedure.</P>

      <P>I think I see more than Deputies on the other side of the House.  As I see it, the Resolution we are discussing at the moment is simply to enable the Revenue Commissioners to assess duty on property which is passing by way of legal right.  The situation at the moment, as I believe it to be, is that succession duty is payable on property passing under a will or passing on intestacy but if passed under a legal right it is not subject to tax at all.</P>

Whether the surviving spouse <Col N="1152" /> absolutely gets the property by way of legal right or absolutely by specific reference under the will, there is no difference.

      <P>If she has a legal right, without this Resolution, no estate duty will be payable on her death.  It just simply means that we are putting property passing under a legal right into exactly the same position as property passing specifically under a will.  That is not additional taxation but it is something I had not seriously considered. I do not see why a person should expect to avoid estate duty on his own estate simply by reason of the fact that he had succeeded to the property by way of legal right rather than by way of benefit under a will or intestacy.</P>

      <P>I should like to put one specific question to the Minister and I hope that I shall not add to the confusion by so doing.  I should like to preface my remarks by saying that nobody knows less about succession and estate duty than I but I have been informed by the people who know about succession duty and who are experts on it and I have been asked to raise this point.  It is for that reason I am raising it.  It appeared to them that where the legal right is granted to a person, the widow in this case, under the will, and the husband dies, property will pass on death&mdash;that is where Deputy Booth is wrong; he spoke about property on intestacy and under a will but what refers to succession duty is what passes on death&mdash;and what I want to ask the Minister is this: is it clear that succession duty may be exacted by the Revenue Commissioners on this?  Is it clear that when a legal right is granted in estates coming under this will and the husband or the wife, as the case may be, dies, there is a passing of that legal <Col N="1153" /> right under the statute on the death and on that itself succession duty may be charged?  On top of that, what she gets under the will or eventually whatever she accepts will be charged succession duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely confirming what Deputy Costello said. We can see the position in relation to estate duty.  Estate duty is chargeable on the property passing on death but so far as the recipient is concerned, succession duty attaches to any property real or personal which passes gratuitously as a result of death or on death.</P>
      <P>Here is a situation where a new estate or enforceable right, a legal right, a statutory right, comes into operation on death and on death it seems clear, under the provisions of the Succession Act, that now succession duty attaches to the surviving spouse who gets the legal right as a succession which becomes liable for duty.  That is our concern.  It is perfectly clear now: this motion here is a tax proposal.  That is why it is on the Order Paper.  It is a proposal which provides that estate duty and succession duty become payable having regard to the provisions in the Act relating this succession duty to the property of deceased persons.  As Deputy Sweetman said, it would have been far better if the Minister had disclosed this fact to the House at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as one can see at this stage, here is a new provision which is attaching or attracting new succession duty.  I do not know if it has happened before but it certainly appears strange to me that a motion of this kind should be in the name of the Minister for Justice.  I should have thought it would have been tabled by the Minister for Finance: I do not know why it was <Col N="1154" /> not tabled by him.  It certainly cannot be considered as anything but a taxation resolution.  It is intended to tax every widow who under the Succession Bill gets a legal right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  It is intended to tax her as the recipient, as the person entitled to succession. Under the Succession Duty Act, she is now going to be taxed.  Apart altogether from other death duties, estate duty will attach in any case following death.  That is Deputy Booth's point and I can understand that but the problem I see is that by reason of the creation of a legal right, there is going to be new attraction of succession duty.  Because of death the legal statutory right comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There seem to be two entirely different points here.  One deals with estate duty in respect of death and it arises only on death.  To that extent I agree with Deputy Booth. The other is succession duty.  They are two entirely separate matters.  I disagree with Deputy Booth in relation to that.  What was intended and what the Minister was claiming for the Bill was that it gave the surviving spouse in addition a legal right and he did not say, and it was never said, that he gave the widow a legal right but in so doing he was providing that when she took that legal right, the family fortunes would pay more to the Revenue Commissioners.  If we were going to give a legal right, the family fortunes should have been protected to the same degree as far as succession duty is concerned.  That is an entirely different point.</P>

I venture to say that at that stage of the proceedings no Deputy &mdash; and I include the Minister for Justice&mdash;had the faintest notion of what this Resolution meant.  The Minister for Justice then moved over beside the seat which he now occupies and borrowed a brief <Col N="1155" /> which he then read to the House.

      <P>At this stage of the proceedings, his interpretation of his own brief is called in question in the House and I very much doubt now if many members of the House fully understand the significance of this Resolution.  But, if the purpose of this Resolution is to make certain persons who take an estate under section 110 of the Succession Bill liable to duty who but for this Resolution would not be liable to duty, I want to know why was that provision not incorporated in the Finance Bill where we could discuss it in its appropriate context.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of trotting in here with a Resolution which I am now going to read for the House as an object lesson in obscurity?  Remember, the purpose of our deliberations here is to understand what the Government are doing.  Here is the Resolution we are asked to pass:</P>
      <P>That estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty shall be payable having regard to the provisions in relation to the distribution of properties contained in any Act of the present session to reform the law relating to succession to the property of deceased persons and, in particular, the devolution, administration, testamentary disposition and distribution on intestacy of such property, and to provide for related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has read to us the departmental brief and I must say, having listened to it, I am not very much wiser than I was before he read it.  We have Deputy Sweetman's opinion as to the effects of the Resolution; we have the point raised by Deputy John A. Costello, which I do not think the Minister has so far attempted to reply to; and we have the matters raised by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  Having listened closely to all these proceedings, I do not know and I do not believe there is a single Deputy in the Fianna Fáil benches who knows what is the ultimate significance of this Resolution.</P>
      <P>But there is one thing that is perfectly clear to me and I derive this information, not from anything the Minister has said, but from my knowledge of procedure in this House: this Resolution would not be necessary unless it proposed to legalise a tax that otherwise would not be legal.  There is the nub of this matter.  This Resolution would never have appeared on the Order Paper unless it was designed to serve some purpose.  One thing is certain, this Resolution does not exempt from tax anything that would otherwise be taxable.  If it does not exempt something from tax, if it would not be necessary if it left the <i>status quo</i> as it was, surely it is a legitimate assumption to say that it is taxing something that would not be taxed if that Resolution were not passed?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us what is going to be taxed as a result of that Resolution if passed by Dáil Éireann because the Dáil ought not to pass a Resolution designed to tax something which is not at present liable to tax unless we know precisely the nature of the burden which we are asked to impose, whether it be upon widows or the remainder men under will or under statute as provided in any particular settlement that may be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that at this moment the Minister himself knows what is <Col N="1157" /> liable to be taxed by this and I think the Minister is in this dilemma, that he is sustained by the officers of the Department of Justice and that he has not at his disposal at this moment the advice and counsel of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Let me isolate this one point: this Resolution does not exempt anything from taxation.  Avowedly, it does not leave things as they were.  Therefore, it is a legitimate presumption that it imposes tax on something that would not be taxed unless this Resolution were passed.  Will the Minister tell us now what it is that he proposes to tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now we have had no legal rights system here.  We have had no provision for application to the court in the case of children. Therefore, up to now the question of the incidence of estate duty and succession duty on (a) a legal right share or (b) property which a child might secure out of an estate by reason of a court application could not have arisen.  Consequently, we have, in this Bill, to make the legal right in the case of the surviving spouse and whatever a child gets by way of court application subject to the ordinary finance law in regard to estate duty, succession duty and legacy duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to estate duty, all we are providing for is that the legal right <Col N="1158" /> share of a spouse and the amount allocated by the court to a child shall bear their due proportion of estate duty.  That is clear enough.</P>
    <P>In regard to succession duty, what we are in effect providing is that any legal right share in excess of £15,000 will bear succession duty in the same way as if it were a bequest of the same size.  Likewise, if the amount awarded by the court to a child were in excess of £15,000, it would be treated in the same way as a bequest to the child under a will.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are merely transposing the existing duty provisions in regard to estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty to the legal right share of the spouse and to the amount that the child may secure by way of court application.</P>
    <P>This is precisely the situation that has always existed, for instance, in regard to the nearest equivalent that we have at the moment to the legal right share, namely the share on intestacy which the widow is entitled to.  At the present time, under the law as it stands, the widow is entitled to a one-third share on intestacy.  That one-third, on intestacy, at the moment, has to bear its proportion of estate duty, and it is subject to succession duty where it exceeds £15,000.  In the present instance, we are merely making the legal right share which will arise in the case of a will bear the same rate of duty as the legal right share on intestacy now bears and has always borne.  We are making the exact same scale of duties apply to the new statutory legal right share being created under the Bill that has applied to the legal right share on intestacy over a number of years.</P>
    <P>If that is not clear enough, I cannot make it any clearer.  There is no new financial exaction in this particular measure; we are merely applying the existing scheme of duties to the legal right share and to whatever property may be secured by the child on a court application.</P>

      <P>Because it is property which the spouse derived gratuitously as a result of the death. Here is a Bill which gives a statutory legal right operative on death relating to the property of the deceased and which confers a property right on the surviving spouse.  That is, in effect, succession in relation to the law as it stands now.  Is it not clear that if the law continues as it is that there is a succession created and that it attracts succession duty, apart altogether from what Deputy Sweetman has been saying about estate duty?  Is that not the position?</P>

      <P>Yes.  I would ask the House to consider the alternative. If there is succession duty in the case of an intestate share and in the case of a bequest, we surely could not have the situation where there would not be succession duty in the case of a statutory legal right share or where a court decides that a child shall receive a share.  What we are seeking to do is to have existing succession duty and estate duty applied &ldquo;across the board&rdquo;, so that the person who gets a share by way of legal right or from the courts will not be exempt while the person who gets it by way of bequest is caught.</P>

      <P>The legacy and succession duty payable at the rate of one per cent and the additional succession duty at the rate of ten shillings per cent shall not be chargeable on a legacy derived from a testator or intestate dying after the passing of this Act or on a succession conferred after such passing.</P>
      <P>That would mean that if we were to pass the Succession Bill before the passage of the Finance Bill, this becomes a succession before the passing of the Finance Bill, and if we pass this Resolution, the succession duty shall apply.

      <P>No.  I have tried to state this clearly.  All this Bill will do will be to put into effect in relation to legal right shares and amounts allocated by the courts the current finance provisions, whether they be provided under the Finance Bill of 1965, 1966 or 1967.  The current provisions at the time will be the relevant provisions.  I do not propose, therefore, to go into details of the Finance Bill, 1965.

Whatever provisions represent the current law in regard to the three forms of duty I mention&mdash;estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty&mdash;are applied by the section, at whatever the current rate may be, to (a) all legal right shares and (b) amounts allocated to children by the courts.  There it is.  A complete mountain is being made out of a molehill. There is nothing very subtle, nothing devious, nothing involved, in all this.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that it might be worthwhile at some stage to ask the Minister to endeavour to explain the motion.  The Minister endeavoured to have the motion accepted by the House simply by bobbing his head at the Chair and saying &ldquo;I move&rdquo;.  Were it not for the fact that we dragged some information out of him the motion would have been accepted.  I cannot see now that it is worthwhile trying to drag anything out of the Minister because he has not made anyone any wiser.  He says there is no relevancy in considering this in the context of the Finance Bill circulated by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, but, if he reads that Bill, he will see that the passing of these two measures may have vital repercussions on the question of whether succession duty is or is not payable on a legal right share, assuming the Succession Bill goes through. As things stand, I think the House is being put in a very dicey position in being asked to accept the Financial Resolution at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow this argument in the very slightest degree. It seems to me the position is that, if we do not pass this Resolution, we would, by passing the Succession Bill, be creating a class of persons who might avoid what would normally be their liability to succession and legacy duty.  To that extent the Succession Bill is interfering in strictly financial matters and the passing of the Bill, without this Resolution, would open a very wide loophole.  All the Minister is doing here is putting the matter right so that whatever the Minister for <Col N="1164" /> Finance may do in his Finance Bill will affect all transfers of property whether under legal rights, bequests or intestacy.  If we do not do this we will be creating a special privileged class of persons who will succeed to property without paying succession duty.  That is not what we intend to do.</P>
      <P>I see no difficulty in understanding why the Minister for Justice has to do this.  If he did not do it he would be infringing on the territory of the Minister for Finance.  In order to keep himself right, if you like, with the Minister for Finance he has got to make it perfectly clear that legal rights will be subject to exactly the same liability to succession duty and legacy duty.  I feel the Opposition may have been taken slightly unawares because of their not having gone into the matter in detail in advance, but no useful purpose is being served by trying to stir up a scandal about it.  There is no scandal to be stirred up.  It is just a question that, if the Resolution were not passed, we would be giving the recipients of legal rights a quite unwarranted preference over those succeeding in the normal way.  I am absolutely satisfied, I must say, about this.  Normally, I am prejudiced against the Revenue Commissioners and against all taxation provisions, but I cannot see any objection to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say one final word?  Deputy Booth says in a very plausible way that all that is supposed to be done is to provide a bridge into the ordinary law in relation to succession and other death duties.  That is very plausible and it would be quite relevant if one were considering this by itself.  The fact is that we have had circulated&mdash;Deputy Booth has also received a copy&mdash;the Finance Bill and section 27 of that Bill provides as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legacy and succession duty payable at the rate of one per cent and the additional succession duty at the rate of ten shillings per cent shall not be chargeable on a legacy derived from a testator or intestate dying after the passing of this Act <Col N="1165" /> or on a succession conferred after such passing.</P>
    <P>The right referred to there is the right attributable to a surviving spouse and that is a provision which says, in effect, that in respect of a legacy derived from a testator dying after the passing of the Act, or in relation to a succession conferred after the passing of this Act, where the recipient is a surviving spouse, legacy and succession duty shall not be chargeable. That is what the proposal is.</P>
    <P>Under the Succession Bill the only need for the Finance Resolution the Minister has moved is to deal with such new duties as may become payable under existing law, relating to the succession conferred as a result of a legal right.  In those circumstances it would appear to me to be the prudent thing for this House not to pass this Resolution.  If this Resolution is not passed this matter falls to be dealt with, as it should be dealt with, under the Finance Bill and to be considered under section 27.  If the Dáil passes section 27 there will be no problem at all because then the legal provisions that would attract the duty go.  If the Dáil does not pass section 27, then the matter may have to be dealt with separately.  Surely we ought not to be asked here on a Tuesday to pass a Resolution which, in effect, applies a tax to widows or surviving spouses who get this legal right when, tomorrow or next week, we may be asked to abolish this duty completely in that relationship.  That appears to me to be quite absurd.</P>

      <P>At present there is a simple clause which can be put into any will to avoid the imposition of death duties twice on the one family estate, succession duties and legacy duties. The effect of this amendment is to allow the Revenue Commissioners to charge the same estate twice.  It is no answer for the Minister to say that this legal right is simply a permissive right, that one need not exercise it.  At present a prudent <i>pater familiae</i> can protect his family against the hunger of the Revenue Commissioners by a simple clause providing for a life estate.  Now the prudent head of a family who seeks to use the family fortunes to the best advantage and to save them from the avaricious grasp of the State is having that weapon taken out of his hands so that the Revenue Commissioners can come in twice and do what they are now able to do only once.  We shall have the Minister for Finance next week proposing not to allow them to do it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a crazy and unfair Resolution. <Col N="1167" /> It may operate for only a short while if this Bill happens to reach the Statute Book before the Finance Bill, which I doubt.  It is a classic example of the kind of thing that happens in this House, where the administration and the Executive on the one hand either understand something and try to mislead people, or else do not understand it and create an appalling social injustice.  I would plead with the Minister not to press this Resolution. There is no need to do so at this stage.  We can proceed with the discussion on the remainder of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every intention of pressing it.  Up to now we have had a reasonably sensible discussion on this Bill.  I have been seeking to explain this in very simple terms. Irrespective of what the Finance Bill of 1965 contains or what the Finance Bill of 1966 will contain, they will not be affected by the provisions here, which merely apply the existing scales of succession duty, legacy duty and estate duty to legal right shares and amounts allocated by the courts.  If there is no succession duty, legacy duty or estate duty, that is the end of the matter.  These provisions are merely designed to ensure that whatever legacy duty, succession duty or estate duty is subsisting at that time shall apply to a legal right share or an amount allocated by the court.  As Deputy Booth stated, there would obviously be a complete gap in the revenue situation if I, as Minister for Justice, could come in here with a measure which introduced a new category of succession rights exempt from the current rate of duty&mdash;if I could come in here and exempt from the operation of the current Finance Act legal right shares or amounts allocated by the courts.  That would be an outrageous situation which I could not stand over.  I am simply making provision that whatever duties are current, whether under this year's financial measures or next year's, will apply to the legal right share and the amount allocated by the court.  The situation is quite clear.  I fail to understand why the essence of it has not percolated to some of the legal minds opposite.</P>

      <P>That estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty shall be payable having regard to the provisions in relation to the distribution of property contained in any Act of the present session to reform the law relating to succession to the property of deceased persons and, in particular, the devolution, administration, testamentary disposition and distribution on intestacy of such property, and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>This is a taxing Resolution the Minister is moving.  I direct the attention of the House to the fact that it is duty arising from the provisions contained in the bill relating to the distribution of property as they relate to succession to property.  That is succession duty.  It is the duty which attaches to property passing on death.  Legacy duty we know.  Succession duty is where succession is claimed.</P>

      <P>I just want to put a point to the Minister.  It arises on a later section also.  It is the position of the testator who has already made his will according to the law as it stands at the moment and who, by reason, say, of mental incapacity or physical incapacity is precluded from making a further will or adding a codicil to the will to bring it into line with the proposals contained in this Bill.  Has the Minister given any consideration to that type of position?  If the Bill comes into operation in 12 months from July next, there may be a number of people at the moment who are unable to alter their wills and who will continue to be in that position up to the time of the coming into operation of the Bill as an Act. However, I think that possibly this is more relevant on section 9.</P>

      <P>I must accept the ruling of the Chair.  However, the very fact that there could be a separate decision rather underlines my objection. The one thing I wanted to avoid on my amendments was a decision.  I wanted it to be something that would arise after a full discussion had taken place on the Minister's proposal and Deputy O'Higgins's amendments.  After a clear-cut decision, I hoped my amendment would come in as an effort to create some sort of agreed proposal between all the parties.  I could not possibly discuss that in the context of the controversy between the Minister's proposal and Deputy O'Higgins's amendment.  Accordingly, I propose not to move those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 1 and 2. As the Chair has mentioned, with amendment No. 1 are being taken several other amendments which have been tabled by me on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  These amendments, taken together, set up in my view a comprehensive and detailed alternative to the Government's proposals.  In the spirit which Deputy J.A. Costello has very rightly been recommending to the House in relation to this Bill and which I certainly welcome and should like to co-operate with, I think it might be as well to see how large is the area of agreement between the Minister's proposals and the outlook of people on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is agreed by Deputies on all sides of the House and by those who show themselves interested in this matter outside the House that a testator should make fair and adequate provision for his dependants.  There is no disagreement about that.  It is agreed also, I take it, on all sides of the House&mdash;otherwise, neither this measure nor the motion which was proposed by me in the House earlier would be necessary&mdash;that there are some testators who fail in their duty in that respect.  I think it is agreed also &mdash;or, if it is not agreed, I suggest it should be agreed and it would be quite reasonable to agree to it&mdash;that there is no need, and indeed that there is no justification, for interfering with the will or with the right of free disposition of a testator who in fact does make fair and adequate provision for his dependants.  If the Minister is prepared <Col N="1174" /> to agree with these three propositions, I think we have gone some way towards at least approaching agreement in relation to this measure.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to agree that there is no justification for interfering with the will of a testator who in fact does make fair and proper provision for his dependants&mdash;whether the dependants be a spouse or children&mdash;I suggest it follows logically that the class of will and the only class of will which requires to be dealt with is limited to the will of the testator who fails in his duty.  If there is agreement on that, I think there should also be agreement that our search for the remedy should be limited to that particular field, limited to seeing what requires to be done in relation to the will of the testator who fails in his duty.  I think it would be reasonable enough, and the discussions that have taken place in this House already justify my view in this, in any event that there should be discussion, and even disagreement, with regard to the particular remedy that might be applied.  But, logically, there ought not to be any disagreement about the area for which the remedy is necessary and that is the area for which the testator who fails in his duty, the testator who produces what has become knows as an undutiful or inofficious will.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the fundamental difference between our approach to this and the approach of the Government is that we in our approach to this matter are trying to remedy the particular problem that exists by applying the remedy directly to that problem, whereas the Government's proposal is that in order to remedy the particular problem that exists, it is necessary to interfere in some way with everybody's will and with the free right of disposition of property by will which exists at the moment.  That attitude can be justified only by the belief that the majority of testators in this country fail in their duty when making their wills.  If the Government believe that, if they honestly have come to the conclusion that the majority of will-makers fail in their duty and make wills which are not fair, or wills which do not make <Col N="1175" /> fair or adequate provision for their dependants, then I think the remedy they are suggesting is probably the right one.</P>
    <P>Certainly the Government have every justification for introducing a remedy which will interfere with the generality of wills if they honestly hold the belief that the majority of will-makers fail in their duty when making their will.  But if the Government do not hold that belief, then the proposition I am putting to the Minister is that they should seek some remedy other than the remedy they are proposing, other than the idea of interfering with all wills in order to stamp out the problem of a number, whether large or small, of inofficious wills.</P>
    <P>As I say, in the series of amendments which we are proposing, we are putting before the House for discussion, consideration and, I hope, acceptance a comprehensive alternative proposal which has been the subject of very great thought, examination and scrutiny by members of this Party and those whose advice we sought in the matter and which is designed to try to preserve for the ordinary Irish will-maker the freedom of disposition which he now enjoys and, at the same time, ensure that, in particular, widows are protected.  In this I agree very much with the views expressed by Deputy J.A. Costello that whatever the phraseology of the Bill or of the amendments, it is, in fact, widows and dependent children Deputies are most concerned with. Our scheme, as I say, is to try to preserve the rights of will-making that people have at the moment and, at the same time, give adequate protection to widows and other dependants.</P>
    <P>The scheme put forward by the Minister in the Bill is one of fixed legal right shares.  That has been described by a very authoritative body who are concerned in this problem as an attempt to do justice blindfolded.  That is the description that has been applied to it by the Incorporated Law Society. The proposals we are making are first of all that this question of fixed legal <Col N="1176" /> rights should be deleted from the Bill. I do not intend to read out this amendment in detail at the moment, but, in general, our idea is that we should insert in this Bill, in the Irish law dealing with distribution of property and succession, a declaration of what the Legislature regards as a testator's duties, and that we should make it clear in the Bill that it is the duty of any testator to make such equitable provision for his dependants as is reasonable, having regard to his means. I think that is the farthest anyone can go.</P>
    <P>That declaration of duty is one to which Deputies on all sides of the House could, not only with easy minds but with some enthusiasm, subscribe. That particular proposal is in our amendment No. 24.  We propose that that general declaration should be inserted into the Bill and that it should then be made clear that there are some cases of exceptions which would relieve a testator from the full implementation of what we would declare to be his duty in ordinary circumstances.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we set out in detail those four exceptions.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of a testator by his will to make such equitable provision for his dependants as is reasonable having regard to his means unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at the date of his death such person is otherwise adequately provided for in life;</P>
    <P>(b)  such person had been before the date of the death of the testator adequately provided for in life by the testator;</P>
    <P>(c)  such person is by reason of continuing dissolute, dishonourable, cruel or unfaithful behaviour undeserving of such provision;</P>
    <P>(d)  special personal or family circumstances exist which make it undesirable or impractical to make provision for all dependants.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>I am submitting this to the House as a perfectly reasonable and logical proposal.  Taken in conjunction with <Col N="1177" /> the other measures which we propose in the amendments, it would have the effect of ensuring that a person's dependants will be properly treated by the testator in making his will.  It might be perfectly reasonable to ask: why not insert a general declaration and leave it at that?  Why is it necessary to modify it, or to trim it down in any way by the exceptions mentioned in amendment No. 24?  If Deputies examine the exceptions, they will see that they are all reasonable.</P>
    <P>The first exception is the case where at the time of the testator's death the particular dependant in question is otherwise adequately provided for.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that there should not be any obligation on the testator further to provide for a person already adequately provided for.  It would be a matter for proof, if it were thought desirable to contest it, whether or not adequate provision was already made.</P>
    <P>The second exception is the case where the testator has already during his life made adequate provision for the particular dependant, whether it be a spouse or one of the children.  I think this should be acceptable to the Minister because it falls in with his own scheme of things in the modified Bill. Once that has been done, the testator has carried out his obligations and fulfilled his duty.</P>
    <P>The third exception is one about which I concede there might be controversy. It was only after very careful thought and consideration that it was decided that this exception should be included as a ground which would entitle the testator to disregard the claim of a particular dependant.  The third ground is that the person is by reason of continuing dissolute, dishonourable, cruel or unfaithful behaviour undeserving of such provision.  I want to make it clear at this stage that that exception is not intended to cater for the type of testator who was described by Deputy J.A. Costello on Second Reading as the testator who endeavours to control his family from the grave.  That is not what is in mind at all.</P>
    <P>What is in mind here is the case <Col N="1178" /> which must have been in mind of the Minister's predecessor when he introduced the previous Succession Bill.  In that Bill he made an exception very much in the same terms as the exception proposed here.  The Minister shakes his head but I do not think I am mistaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was nodding, and not shaking his head.  I see.  That is the explanation for that exception, and I think it is a reasonable one and one that should recommend itself to the House.</P>
      <P>The fourth exception we propose deals with one of the matters which, to my mind, is of fundamental importance. It goes to the roots of the proposals we make, and it is also one of the basic objections to the scheme proposed by the Minister.  The fourth exception is the case where special personal or family circumstances exist which make it undesirable or impractical to make provision for all dependants.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has anything to do with the making of wills, whether in his professional capacity as a lawyer, or as a friend and adviser from time to time&mdash;and I think one Deputy who is not a lawyer mentioned in the earlier discussions that he frequently had to give advice in regard to wills&mdash;will know that no two cases are the same. In every single case there will be special family circumstances and special considerations which might be personal to one or more of the dependants, or the people who have a claim on the bounty, if you like, of the testator. There will be special circumstances which it is proper for the testator to take into consideration, and special circumstances which in most cases it is recognised by the family that the testator should take into consideration when making his will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, anyone who has any experience of will-making will know that frequently when the testator is making his will, he will have discussions with his solicitor, or with friends in whom <Col N="1179" /> he has particular confidence, even though they may not be members of the legal profession, that he will discuss the matter with his accountants, and very much more often than not, I suggest, he will also discuss the matter with his wife and family.  When he has got the consensus of opinion of his family and the advice of lawyers and other professional people he may go to, he will decide in the light of the circumstances that exist, and in the light of the advice he has taken, what are the proper and just provisions to make in his will.</P>
    <P>I think it is right that we should encourage people to act in that manner, to give proper consideration to all the circumstances that exist at any time. If we insist on importing into our legislation provision for fixed legal right share, without any discretion to the court to review the case of a will where a man has failed in his duty, we are immediately cutting out those special family considerations which any lawyer will be able to tell the Minister exist in virtually every case, and which every individual who has made a will or contemplates making a will will be able to tell the Minister exist in his own case.  I think the Minister will find that there are very few people who go about making a will who do not feel there is some particular aspect that should receive special consideration and be treated with special concern.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that that position should be preserved and that in so far as the Legislature can ensure that all relevant family and personal circumstances are taken into consideration, the Legislature should so ensure. That can be ensured by the scheme we are proposing to the Minister.  They are the four exceptions, and there are only four, that we in these benches are prepared to recognise as justifying a testator departing from the general duty set out in the declaration at the beginning of amendment No.24.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to go in detail into the definitions set out in amendment No. 23.  The Minister will <Col N="1180" /> find they are comprehensive: they are intended to deal with the question of dependants.  As far as I am concerned &mdash;other Deputies may have other views &mdash;what we require to deal with in a measure of this kind is the position of the different types of dependant. Very briefly, we propose to define dependants as, firstly, a spouse of the testator; secondly, a child of the testator who is under 21; thirdly, an adult mental or physical disability incapacitating  child of the testator suffering from him from adequately supporting and maintaining himself; fourthly, in the case of a female testator who has legitimate offspring, such offspring who is under 21 and who has no adequate means of support independent of the testator; and lastly, a person who is under the age of 21 and to whom the testator was <i>in loco parentis</i> and who has no adequate means of support independent of the testator.  The Minister will agree that that is not only reasonable but is adequate to cover the type of cases that require to be covered.  We go on to make it clear that &ldquo;child&rdquo; will include a stepshild, a posthumous child or an adopted child.</P>
    <P>The next matter of importance in the proposal we are putting before the House is this: the whole system we are proposing is, as I have already said, that there should be a declaration of the testator's duty to make provision for dependants, except in the limited number of exceptional cases I have referred to; and then we go on to provide for what will happen if a testator fails in that&mdash;what remedies will be open to the dependants to ensure that they get fair treatment.</P>
    <P>We suggest there are four categories of wills which should not be capable of being challenged by dependants or anybody else.  By and large, there will be general agreement on this question among Deputies, particularly Deputies who remember the controversy that was aroused by the original provisions contained in the first Bill introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  They will remember that the controversy aroused succeeded also in arousing very far-flung interest in this whole question of the distribution of property on death, and succession to property, <Col N="1181" /> and by reason of that interest and controversy, Deputies in the House, or most of them, considering this Bill now will, like myself, have had the advantage of hearing the views of many of their constituents.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who has had that advantage will agree with the proposition we make that there are some wills which are now regarded throughout this country as being fair and proper wills which should not be capable of being upset or challenged.  The wills to which we say this applies fall into four categories.  The first is the will of a testator who leaves everything to his spouse.  Speaking with 25 years experience in the legal profession in the city of Dublin, I say&mdash;I hope some of my colleagues opposite will agree &mdash;that by far the greatest proportion of wills made in the city are wills whereby the testator or testatrix, as the case may be, leaves everything to the other spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I am dealing with my amendments. Consequently, I think everyone will agree it is perfectly right to say a will which does that should not be capable of being challenged.  As the Minister has indicated by his intervention, that position is recognised now by the Government in this Bill, though it was not so recognised in the first Bill introduced.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we are proposing that in the case where you have a married couple with no children, where the testator or testatrix leaves everything to the other spouse for life and then leaves it back, as is quite customary, to his or her own side of the family, that will is now regarded as being perfectly fair and proper and should not be capable of being challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third category of will which we say should not be capable of being challenged is where the testator leaves the spouse and other members of his family and by the testator's will the entire estate is given to such spouse for an estate for life with the remainder to such one or more of the <Col N="1182" /> other members of his family as the testator by his will may decide or as the surviving spouse shall appoint. That is a common form of will in this country.  It is very often a valuable type of will to make.  Take the case of a man making his will at a time when his family are comparatively young, still under age.  If he is a man of reasonable or moderate means, probably his desire would be to make such provision in his will as would enable each of his children to enjoy a particular share of his estate when he dies but he does not know&mdash;none of us does&mdash;when he will die.  He is married to a person in whom he has the utmost confidence.</P>
    <P>Very frequently what he will do is leave everything to his wife for life and say in his will that the further disposition of his property will be as his spouse, by deed or by will, shall appoint.  He does that in the belief and hope that whenever the other spouse dies or the children attain the age of 21 years, the surviving spouse will make fair and just provision for the children.  That is a common form of will.  It is one frequently used and is very often of inestimable value in its practical application.</P>
    <P>Now, the fourth category of will which we suggest should not be capable of being challenged is one that is of particular importance in the rural parts of this country.  We are suggesting that where a man dies leaving a widow and property consisting of a farm, a business or other source of livelihood, which by his will he gives to a member of his family, subject to and charged with rights of residence, support, clothing and maintenance in favour of the widow, that shall not be capable of being challenged in so far as the farm, business or other source of livelihood is concerned.  The last few words in that subsection suggested by us are of vital importance. We are not suggesting that merely because a person who owns a farm or a business leaves it to a member of his family and charges it with these rights in favour of his widow, that should preclude the widow from seeking more advantageous treatment if the man has <Col N="1183" /> other property.  All that we are suggesting is that so far as the farm, the business or the other source of livelihood, whatever it might be, is concerned, the will shall not be capable of being challenged.</P>
    <P>We are proposing this as a matter which is of very great importance and very great concern to the people.  We are proposing it with the object of being able to preserve the unit in question, whether it is the farm or the business, to enable the testator himself to select, knowing all the family and personal circumstances to which I referred earlier, the member of the family who is most suited by training and inclination to carry on the business of the farm and to enable him to preserve it and hand it over to that member of the family, whether it is a son or a daughter, as a unit.  If there are other assets which could be capable of having a claim made against them, well and good; let the claim be made against those other assets.</P>
    <P>One of the main objections which was made and is still being made to the Minister's proposals in the Bill is in regard to the possibility of fragmentation of farms and businesses if the fixed legal right share of one-third is operated.  I recognise, and I hope the Minister also recognises, that those arguments are sound and convincing and arguments which should be listened to.  The Incorporated Law Society commented on this and their comment was published in the newspapers. I have not got the newspaper clipping with me but what they said is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The first, and to a lesser extent the second, Bill approaches the question of testamentary disposition from the point of view of individuals rather than of the family as a unit. This fragmentation of interest is undesirable.</P>
    <P>We hope that by putting up these proposals for consideration, and as I said before for, I hope, acceptance, we will avoid the pitfalls inherent in the Minister's proposals.  Then we reach the position where having suggested that there should be a declaration of a <Col N="1184" /> testator's duty that duty should bind the testator himself; then there are particular cases where specified exceptions are mentioned and then we reach the stage of saying what should be done if a testator fails in his duty and this is dealt with in amendment No. 25.</P>
    <P>We suggest that where a testator fails by his will to make equitable provision for a dependant, such dependant may apply to the court to modify the terms of the testator's will so as to make such provision.  If that application is made to the court and the court is satisfied that the testator has failed to make fair provision and that the case does not fall into one of the exceptions which I have dealt with already, then the amendment goes on to detail the powers which the court should have to deal with that situation.  Amendment No. 25 suggests the insertion of a new section which goes on to say:</P>
    <P>(2)  Upon such application to the Court under subsection (1) of this section if the Court is of opinion&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the testator has failed by his will to make such equitable provision for the applicant as is reasonable having regard to his means, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that the application is not one to which paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) of section * apply,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;those are the proposals I have dealt with already&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Court may order that such reasonable provision be made for the applicant by means of payment out of the assets of the testator of such amount as the Court shall think fit, and thereupon the will of the testator for all purposes, including the enactments relating to death duties, shall have effect as if the testator had in his said will made the provision for the applicant ordered by the Court, and with such modifications or abatements as regards bequests and devises therein as the Court shall order for the purpose of giving effect to the provision ordered by the Court.</P>
    <P>I want to stress and to emphasise in connection with this that what we are <Col N="1185" /> proposing here is that in the case of the undutiful will the person who is aggrieved by it, the dependant who is aggrieved by it shall be entitled to go to court and ask the court to remedy the situation and we are proposing that the court shall have absolute discretion to deal with the situation.  We are also proposing in the next subsection that the court will not be limited merely to making payments by means of maintenance.  I am not familiar with the detailed workings of this type of legislation in other countries but I know that one of the criticisms which was voiced in regard to British law on the subject&mdash;the Act of 1938, the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act, 1938, and the Northern Ireland Act, 1960, and Acts of a similar kind in a number of Commonwealth countries&mdash;was that a weakness in those Acts was the fact that the court had not absolute discreation and was only entitled to award maintenance and that the maintenance came to an end whenever the dependency came to an end and that there was no discretion to the court to share out in an equitable and just fashion the assets of the testator who had failed in his duty.</P>
    <P>We are suggesting that we should go much further here than the legislation in England or Northern Ireland and that a court should have discretion to go far beyond mere maintenance payments and make adequate provision and that the court should have power to decide how that provision should be made, whether by means of lump sum or payments from estate of the deceased, or whether it might be necessary in some cases that the payments should be made by instalments, or again, in other cases where the applicant is an infant or is suffering from mental incapacity, that the payment, whether lump sum or instalments, be made to a committee or guardian for the benefit of the incapacitated person or infant applicant.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier, on other amendments, to one of the matters which we regard as fundamental.  That is the fact that the testator in making his will has to have regard, if he is going to do the job properly, to the personal <Col N="1186" /> and family circumstances that exist and I referred to the fact which I believe is true, that by clamping down any type of rigid system of general application, the Legislature cannot possibly have regard to these special circumstances which exist in every case.  I believe that the person, certainly the best person, if not the only person, to have full knowledge of what the circumstances are, is the testator himself but where the testator makes what is obviously, or appears to be, an unfair or unjust or inofficious will, then it is necessary to establish some alternative method of examining these special family or special personal circumstances which exist.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the court is the best alternative.  Certainly the Legislature cannot do it.  All we can do is legislate in a general way and, as a Deputy on the other Benches pointed out, hard cases make bad law.  If we, out of the kindness of our hearts, legislate because of particular hard cases and try to apply that to the general run of Irish will-makers, it is more likely than not we shall make bad law.  But if we set up machinery whereby a court of Justice will be able to examine the individual situation, the individual circumstances applying in individual cases, the chances of things going wrong, of any bad law being created or of any hardship arising out of that bad law are certainly reduced as much as is possible, humanly speaking.</P>
    <P>We suggest the courts should be put in that position and should be enabled to make that kind of an examination and enabled, in the case of a will which appears to be unjust or unfair or failing in a testator's duty, to examine the reasons for the disposition which the testator made, or failed to make, and that all these kinds of things should be taken into account.  Any lawyer knows, and probably non-lawyers know even more than lawyers, that very often there is great public interest in actions concerning wills.  Why that should be I am not entirely sure.  It seems that people like to draw aside the curtains and look into other people's lives.  I do not think that should exist in regard to the type of application we <Col N="1187" /> have in mind here and we are providing in these amendments that the applications to the court which we propose will be heard in private and that there will not be any publicity. We are spelling it out in the amendments we propose that none of the evidence, none of the documents and none of the other matters that will be mentioned will be printed or published. In doing that we are not casting&mdash;I certainly do not intend to cast&mdash;any reflection on Irish journalists or Irish newspapers.  That is not intended, but we feel these are private, family matters and that those bringing these applications are entitled to have them treated in that way, without prying eyes, without having purely private, family matters and circumstances&mdash; which should be considered&mdash;exposed for public viewing.</P>
    <P>That suggestion has been accepted in part by the Minister in relation to the scheme he provides for dependent children.  I cannot be accused of boasting when I say that the Minister got that idea from these amendments which are a repetition of amendments put down to the earlier Bill.  It is a good idea and I am glad the Minister has accepted it.  It is important that people bringing these applications should be free to have their cases considered privately, without the embarrassing publicity of neighbouring eyes being able to penetrate the curtain of their private lives.</P>
    <P>We also propose in these amendments that the procedure whereby these applications will be brought before the courts will be simple, speedy and comparatively cheap, as cheap a procedure at any rate as is known to the courts at present.  It is right that in putting forward his proposal, we should spell out, as best we can, the procedure to be adopted.  The Minister has the same idea in mind but his idea was open to the criticism that was made of it by Deputy J.A. Costello on the Second Reading of the Bill, that while the Minister's motives and good intentions are not in question, nevertheless the particular section&mdash;I think it is section</P>
    <Col N="1188" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 117, subsection (5), page 40.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking at the first effort of the Government. I think that section is evidence of the fact that the Minister is thinking along exactly the same lines.  He provides that the rules of court in relation to the procedure on applications shall be so made as to ensure that the proceedings are conducted as informally and inexpensively as possible.  While the Minister is entitled to credit for the intention, putting it like that in the Bill simply seems to be a pious aspiration which is likely to lead to trouble.  It is likely to be challenged at any stage, no matter what regulations are made, by a litigious-minded applicant who says, no matter what the procedures laid down in the regulations may be, that it could be conducted more informally or that it could be conducted less expensively. I think the suggestion we are making in our amendments, in spelling out the procedure, is the preferable one and we are suggesting in our amendments that these applications should be brought to the court by means of notice of motion.  The firm procedure is laid down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter of some importance that perhaps I should deal with at this stage.  It is provided also in our amendments that any application made to the court should be brought within six months.  Under the fixed legal right share system proposed by the Minister, a beneficiary, or a spouse, rather&mdash;it is limited to a spouse now&mdash;will have a year within which to elect with regard to taking a legal right share or devise or legacy or bequest under the will.  I think there is danger in having a long period.  This is a matter also to which we gave a very great deal of thought.  The British Act and the Northern Ireland Act each provide for a period of six months within which applications are to be brought.  When we were considering this matter, it was suggested that it might be desirable to ask that that period should be lengthened but on considering it the position is this, that either under the Minister's system of a <Col N="1189" /> fixed share or the discretionary system which we are proposing coupled with an application to the court, once there is in our legislation provision for an application to the court or provision for an election within a particular time, there is danger that the administration of the estate will be hung up until that period expires.  That exists in relation to the application by children under the Minister's proposals. It would exist also in relation to the application to the court under our proposals.</P>
    <P>In order to get around that and in order to minimise the difficulty, we are suggesting that initially the basic time for the application to be made should be six months but that in cases of urgency&mdash;and there will be cases of urgency regarding the administration of an estate&mdash;the personal representative should be entitled to serve on all persons who have an interest under the estate a notice that he intends distributing the assets in accordance with the will and we are suggesting that if such a notice is issued by the personal representative, that the various dependants, the spouse and the children, would then be required to bring their applications within one month of the service of the notice and we set out in the amendments the manner in which the notice should be served, that it should be transmitted through the Probate Registry, and so on.</P>
    <P>This, I suggest, is an improvement on the position obtaining under the English and Northern Ireland legislation. This is a simple system which would enable the personal representative to speed up the whole machinery in cases where it is necessary to speed it up.  In short, that is the scheme which we are proposing as an alternative to the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has had regard and will have regard to the fact that these proposals which we are making are being made in a completely non-controversial manner.  We are making them because we believe that they are good proposals and we believe that the proposals which the Minister has incorporated in the Bill would not be good proposals or, at least, that they would not be as good <Col N="1190" /> as the proposals we are making.</P>
    <P>The proposals which we are making have been circulated by us to any of the various bodies who seem to be interested in the subject, to the Incorporated Law Society, to the Bar Council, to the various Solicitors' Associations throughout the country, to the National Farmers' Association and others.  I can say quite truthfully that apart from one which was on a misunderstanding, not one single objection was received by me from any of these bodies.  Admittedly, a number of them did not reply.  Others replied approving of the suggestion we were making and the only one which raised any question was a particular Solicitors' Bar Association and that was on a misunderstanding and the particular person in question made it quite clear, on the misunderstanding being resolved, that he approved of the scheme as suggested by us.</P>
    <P>I did not get, and I did not seek in any active way, an expression of opinion from the Incorporated Law Society other than the opinions that they had expressed publicly through the newspapers.  The Incorporated Law Society cannot be regarded as being motivated by any political consideration whatever.  I dare say that two, possibly three, members of the present Government are members of the Incorporated Law Society.  If they are not, I think they ought to be, from their professions.  It is a body that represents the solicitors' profession.  It talks authoritatively on these matters. It approaches these matters not in any way politically, purely from the point of view of the best interests of the clients which the various members of the Incorporated Law Society serve in their professional lives and embracing as it does virtually the entire of the solicitors' profession, urban and rural, it speaks on a matter such as this with a voice which should be listened to very carefully by the Minister and by his Department and by the Deputies in this House.  The Incorporated Law Society has expressed itself in quite firm terms with regard to the Minister's proposals, both the previous proposals and the proposals contained in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> In a public statement issued by them and published in the newspapers, they pointed out that the chief difference between the previous Succession Bill and this Bill is that the fixed legal right shares for children have been abandoned and that children who claim to have been treated unfairly by a testator are given the right to apply to the court.  Then they go on and say that the proceedings will be in chambers and the court will have wide powers to do justice, that the important advantage gained is that the court in reaching its decision will have full knowledge of the circumstances and the parties in the particular case&mdash;that is a point I have emphasised already&mdash;and then they say that by contrast the fixed shares system is an attempt to do justice blindfold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's reply on Second Reading in regard to two matters.  One is the inquiry made by Deputy Cosgrave and myself in regard to the stations at Miltown Malbay, Screebe and Bellacorick, and the other is in regard to the future policy on the special service charge in relation to outlying districts.  On the first matter, I want to know what is the exact position: in both Miltown Malbay and Screebe, are they working and, if they are not working, if it is intended that they will be put into operation at some future date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>And the position at Bellacorick?  I am particularly interested in the Bellacorick station because the employment content there should be at the very highest peak, having regard to the general lack of employment over such a wide area.  I want to know how it is that weather appears to have interfered with the production of milled peat because from my own experience, passing by both day and night, there is activity on the bog and machinery is working there.  I should like to know what is the situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second matter, rural electrification and the special service charge on people who live in remote areas, I am of the opinion that something should be done about reducing this charge.  There is much more in it than the economic element.  There is a psychological element and an element of patriotism in it.  There is <Col N="1194" /> also the element that postal charges, for instance, are uniform, irrespective of how far the mail has to be delivered or how difficult it is to deliver it.  Petrol and oil charges are uniform.  Taxation is uniform.  It is only in this aspect of our life that there is this peculiar imposition&mdash;an excessive imposition, in my view&mdash;upon people who have lived through the years with great difficulty in these dwellings on hillsides, in remote fishing villages or in isolated mountain areas. Something should be done as a matter of policy in regard to the plight of these people.  I accept, and, indeed, these people accept, that they should pay probably something extra but the amount is at such variance with the regular charge that they naturally feel aggrieved as would anyone feel aggrieved if he were asked to pay five, six and even up to ten times the normal amount of the service charge.  I should like to hear from the Minister on these two matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bellacorick station was affected by bad weather and the amount of milled peat made available from the bog.  However, it will undoubtedly be operating and there is no danger in regard to the position of the station.  In relation to the three small turf stations, although I believe that reasonable prices were offered for the turf supplied and that reasonable grants were made available for roads into bogs where better communications would be required to bring the turf out of the bog on to the main road, the ESB has not been able to secure adequate quantities of turf for these three stations and as a consequence they operate at a rather low level.  They provide only a very small proportion of power to the ESB network so that they do not constitute any risk of a shortage of power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to rural electrification, it does not arise on this section, but as the Deputy has raised it, I may as well deal with it now.  I thought I had spoken on that in great detail during the course of the Second Reading.  As I said, some 95 per cent of all rural dwellers will be joined to the system under the present arrangements.  The average cost of joining a dwelling in <Col N="1195" /> the areas where these very high service charges are asked is of the order of £400 per dwelling.  What I said on the Second Stage was that it would be quite impossible to go beyond the provisions in this Bill by which we continue to subsidise 75 per cent of the cost of installation.  The maximum subsidy is £75 per dwelling.</P>
    <P>On a long-term basis, I am looking into the question as to whether anything more can be done for the people who live some distance from the main communication network.  I said that on the Second Stage and there is nothing more I can do.  If we were to abolish special service charges it would mean having to provide the ESB with £5 million capital in order to avoid very heavy losses on the rural consumption account, losses in the neighbourhood of over £2 million a year.  We would have to provide £5 million in order to connect some five per cent of rural dwellers living some distance from the main communication network.  That is actually the equivalent of the money now being raised under the terms of this Bill, the advance of the capital from £37 million to £42 million for the connecting of the rest of the people.</P>
    <P>We have, I think, done a reasonably good job.  There are quite a number of countries where not every single person in the community is connected. That is true particularly of those countries in which there is an absence of large city conurbations and towns. At this stage we can say, I think, that we will have done a good job by 1968 if something between 90 and 95 per cent of the rural population are connected. During that time I have undertaken to make an examination to see if I can assist those who feel they cannot pay this extra service charge.  In numbers they amount to some 12,000 rural dwellers.  When we started out with the increased subsidy in 1962&mdash;it was raised from 50 per cent to 75 per cent&mdash;there were at that time 112,000 rural consumers who could be connected and, of that number, 77,000 could be connected without paying any extra service charge, 23,000 on paying some extra service charge, but <Col N="1196" /> not more than 50 per cent, and then the 12,000 for whom the extra charge would be 100 per cent or over.  That is the position.  I have said I will have the position examined and, in the meantime, I think we can go on with the rural electrification scheme under the terms of this Bill.  That is going as far as I can go in the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not agree for one moment with the Minister's argument in relation to the undesirability of extending the service to 12,000 householders because their homes are removed from service stations and it would be too costly to give them this essential service.  Again and again I have brought this matter to the attention of the responsible Ministers.  I maintain it is unconstitutional to deny these people this service at the charge at which it is provided for others living in more favourable locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, as I say, unconstitutional.  When the ESB was established&mdash;I think in 1924&mdash;to provide a service for the nation as a whole, it was believed by the promoters of the scheme that the service would be supplied on the same basis for all our citizens.  Again and again the Minister for Transport and Power has told us that that is impossible.  Today he says it would take some £5 million to provide this service for these 12,000 people ignored up to the present under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can instance other schemes promoted and helped by public funds. Take the lime scheme.  Under that scheme lime is made available to farmers at a flat rate, irrespective of how far away they live from the lime kiln.  In my constituency a farmer living out at the end of the Berehaven Peninsula can have his lime at the same price as the man living adjacent to the kiln.  The fact that he is far removed from the centre of production does not preclude him from benefiting under the scheme.  Surely the same case could be made by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to lime as has <Col N="1197" /> been made here by the Minister for Transport and Power in regard to electricity supply.  The Minister for Agriculture could equally well argue that the farmers in the remote areas should be ignored because it would be too costly to supply them and impose too big a burden on public funds.  Surely, if supply can be given where fertilisers are concerned, and all our farmers can benefit equally under the scheme promulgated by the last inter-Party Government, it should be within the competence of the Minister for Transport and Power and the Board of the ESB to give the people living in isolated areas the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In my constituency a number of householders feel aggrieved by what they describe, and I agree with them, as an injustice in that the ESB asks them to pay this special charge.  The vast majority, if not all, are people of slender means.  Usually the type of person living in the more remote areas is not as well off as the urban or suburban dweller.  That is all the more reason why we should address ourselves to this particular problem because we know the burden of the special charge is too much for them.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if the money cannot be found by any other means, some of the burden should be put on the general bulk of consumers so that these people can be supplied with current at the standard rate.  I know money must be found to do any job.  If the Minister and the Government are not prepared to put the burden on public funds, there is, I maintain, every justification for increasing the all-over general charge.  I make that suggestion in order that these people may have justice.  No one likes suggesting increasing the price of anything&mdash;it is not popular&mdash;but it is very unfair of the Board, of the Minister mainly responsible, and of the Government&mdash;the Board cannot act if they do not get instructions from the Government and the Minister&mdash;to deny these people simple justice.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's figure of £5 million.  I do not like Ministers coming in here and <Col N="1198" /> saying that something will cost £5 million in round figures.  The Minister may be correct, but this seems to me far in excess of what it should take to supply these people.  I do not base that statement on any calculations I have made.  I base it on information obtained from people who know something about what is involved and something about the cost of providing this service at a fixed charge to these people in the remote areas.</P>
    <P>We should have a breakdown of this figure of £5 million.  I think it is an exaggerated one.  I want to stress as forcibly and as vehemently as I can on behalf of the 12,000 people denied this current at the standard charge that they are being treated unfairly and unjustly by the Government and by the responsible Minister.  If this issue were tested in the courts as to its constitutionality or otherwise, I have no doubt at all that the court would decide that the action is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stop making excuses now for not removing this special charge and in this year of 1965 he should make electric current available to all our people.  Current is essential.  These people cannot now even enjoy a television set, if they can afford one.  The farmer who has no electricity cannot provide himself with a milking machine.  Electricity is required for so much work around the house and the farm that it is absolutely essential to have it.  Whatever extra burdens are involved initially in providing the capital to extend the service, possibly, with the use made of the service hereafter, the burden would be reduced drastically.</P>
    <P>The people in rural districts as well as other districts realise that electricity is essential for many of the jobs carried out heretofore by other methods.  It would be completely out of place to let the opportunity pass this evening without protesting against the treatment meted out to the people concerned. That is the reason I availed of the discussion to repeat the protest I have voiced here back over the years at the denial of justice to such people. Until the Estimate comes up next year <Col N="1199" /> it is unlikely we will have another opportunity of addressing ourselves to this question.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter in the light of the disadvantages which such people suffer at present when they cannot get service at a reasonable charge.  If he examines it in that light he cannot but come to the conclusion to give them the service at the appropriate standard charge.</P>
    <P>We also have a number of people endeavouring to get the service but who cannot get it without a long delay.  I recently had a question to the Minister about the provision of service to some districts.  From private queries made to the board as well, I understand it is not unlikely that some of these applicants will have to wait a number of years before service is provided.  We should speed up the provision of service.  I am well aware of the difficulties confronting the board.  One of the main difficulties is the one we have been speaking about&mdash;the question of the special service charge&mdash;because some people in particular areas, mainly on account of the special service charge, will not avail of the service.  By reason of their refusal to avail of the service, the board will ignore such a district until such time as all the residents in the locality, if possible, have agreed to accept it on the board's terms.  It is a great hardship on people such as that to be left waiting for the current. While I know that the board are endeavouring, particularly in rural areas, to get 100 per cent acceptances, if that is not possible, as it may not be in some cases&mdash;people may consider it too dear or may not avail of it for some other reason&mdash;the others should be provided with service.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister, first, to wipe out the special service charge, which is unfair, and, secondly, to expedite the extension of service to all districts.  I believe that is not an unfair plea to make forty-one years after the foundation of the electricity scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister on behalf of the <Col N="1200" /> people in isolated pockets who will not procure rural electrification and those who will procure it at a special service charge.  There is much more in it than the Minister has just told us. Most of the isolated pockets are in the poorer, mountainous districts of the west, south and north-west.  As a matter of fact, I think I would be right in saying that practically 100 per cent of the pockets to which the Minister referred are in these poor, isolated, uneconomic areas.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, at the opening of a festival in Sligo said that the Government would have another look at the question of the provision of industries in the west.  In other words, they are now going to throw up the idea of industries for the west.  If the present Minister is not going to provide rural electrification for these pockets and if the Government are going to reverse their view about the establishment of industry in the west, it means the west will become more depopulated than it is today.</P>
      <P>For years we have been advising the Government and various Departments that industries set up in this country which are not based on raw materials provided within the State are most precarious. Surely electrification depends on home products for its progress and success&mdash;water and native fuel?  We have more rivers in this country crying out to be harnessed than have been harnessed.  Look at the amount of rural employment we could give in the uneconomic areas by the erection of more turf-burning stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become popular in this House to be parochial when speaking on matters such as this, particularly on Committee Stage.  I hope I will be forgiven if I become parochial.  I have on many occasions appealed to the Minister and his Department to establish more turf-burning stations in County Donegal.  We have an abundance of turf.  Turbary is about the only thing we have a surplus of.  The turf-burning station set up there already has been a success.  Bord na <Col N="1201" /> Móna have moved in and made a success of their station at Glenties. The provision of a further turf-burning plant at, say, Fintown in the Gaeltacht area of west Donegal, would give a considerable amount of employment to Irish-speaking natives of the county and encourage them to remain on in these pockets.  Although they may not have the amenities their neighbours may have in other parts of the county, they would put up with that if they got employment.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider the question of establishing a second turf-burning plant in Donegal, particularly in west Donegal, and thereby give much needed employment with local raw materials to native Irish speakers, who at least will have to migrate, if not emigrate, if something is not done for them.  Like Deputy M.P. Murphy, I know these isolated pockets.  I know the hardship these people suffer through lack of electrification.  I know the envious eyes they cast at their neighbours who have these amenities.  I know households who have procured electricity at a special service charge.  I know the disparity that has been created between neighbours in various counties as a result of the policy of the Minister. I do not think that is fair.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy M.P. Murphy that it is not constitutional.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the State was established, the ESB was set up for the purpose of developing the Shannon Scheme.  That scheme was not popular in some quarters.  I think it was once referred to as a white elephant.  Thank God, we have a few &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo;.  We have the Shannon Scheme, the ESB and the Sugar Company.  I think they were both branded as twin white elephants.  Thank God, we have them still.  The ESB was set up to serve the people and to provide electricity for the citizens of the State.  Why now should they be denied the amenity to which they are entitled under the Constitution?  It may be that it is not economic to provide electricity in very isolated pockets.  Neither is it econonomic to send a postman to these <Col N="1202" /> places to deliver one letter per day or one letter per week.  It is not economic to send a postman out there but these householders are entitled to such service from the postman and the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is providing that service for them.  Why then is the Minister for Transport and Power denying them the benefit of electricity?</P>
    <P>Even though it may impose an additional burden on others if we level off the charges it is not right that the people in these isolated pockets should be denied this amenity.  The Irish people have sufficient faith in the ESB to see to it that if money is required and a loan is floated by the ESB, it is oversubscribed in no time at all. People have such faith in the ESB that insufficient capital should not prevent the Minister providing this amenity for all residents in rural Ireland.  We all know that when all the areas are fully linked up and when sufficient power is generated, either through the fuel-burning stations or through the hydro stations, the Board will become a paying concern and that whatever money is borrowed will be repaid with appropriate interest.  The Minister should not let insufficient capital worry him so far as providing the facilities and amenities for people such as those I have mentioned is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am personally aware of a number of people in these isolated pockets who make a livelihood by sheep farming. They would be prepared to remain there and try to eke out what I might call a precarious livelihood in these pockets if they were given some of the facilities which can be given to them by the ESB.  Yesterday I attended a local authority meeting at which we discussed the erection of houses for farmers whose poor law valuation is under £5, under a scheme promoted by the Minister for Local Government. While discussing this matter, our county manager informed us that where farmers were in excess of the valuation, he did not think it was proper to build houses.  The Minister for Transport and Power tells us here that where these houses are in isolated pockets, they should not get power. He is, in other words, driving the <Col N="1203" /> people from the land into the villages, towns and cities of this country and depopulating rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all Parties have been trying to prevent this.  While it is all right for us to express sentiments about trying to retain the rural population, there is not much use in good sentiments unless we have action with them.  If legislation has the effect of defeating our intentions, then it is time we revised our legislation.  It is nothing short of mockery to find the Minister is not prepared to give amenities to people residing in these isolated pockets.  There would possibly be less ambiguity if we knew where we stood in these matters.  I would appeal to the Minister, no matter what the cost is, to abolish this service charge and to give rural electrification to everybody in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I want very briefly to repeat the case I made on the Second Reading of this Bill for the abolition or drastic modification of these special charges because I am not satisfied with the Minister's assurance that things will go on as they are until 1968 and that then he will see what can be done as a long-term policy to extend rural electricity to all those requiring it.  I consider there is a bad principle involved here, a principle which goes far beyond the amount of money which it would take to service all these isolated holdings and houses, or some of them not so isolated.</P>
      <P>We have to decide whether Government policy is to be aimed at arresting the flight from the land or whether it is to accelerate it.  We are told by Ministers from time to time, when we complain about the flight from the land, that it is something which is going on everywhere, something which is going on in every country in Europe, that the people tend to leave the land because there is not so much employment there for them.  That may be true, but it is admitted that the flight from the land is an undesirable trend and it should be Government policy to try to stop this flight from the land instead of encouraging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> The people we are talking about who require electricity and current cannot get it except at prohibitive charges. That is what these charges are, as I hope to show very shortly.  These people have not proper roads.  I know that is not the Minister's responsibility. These unfortunate people have not proper water supplies.  I know the Minister is not responsible for that, but he is responsible for this question of electric light.  Electric light and current, in this year of 1965, are no longer a luxury, especially in rural Ireland.  They are an absolute necessity.  These people, as I said on the Second Stage, contributed all through the years when the ESB needed to be subsidised.  When the ESB needed Finance, they contributed in taxes on cigarettes, tobacco and beer in order to provide the necessary capital.  Why should those people now be deprived of this amenity?</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell and others have spoken of those people as residing in isolated remote areas.  All of them are not so resident.  I had a letter this morning&mdash;I am again speaking somewhat parochially&mdash;from the district manager of the ESB in Dundalk.  He was dealing with an applicant residing in a cathedral parish within three miles of a town with a population of about 4,000.  That person has been offered a supply of electric current at a bimonthly ordinary charge of £1, plus a special charge of £4.  That, in my opinion, is tantamount to saying to that person: &ldquo;We are not going to give you electric light.&rdquo;  The end part of the letter states: &ldquo;Of course you can have bottled gas and we will give you a subsidy of £10&rdquo;.  A person living in a labourer's cottage less than a mile away from the person I am talking about can have a radio and a television set but this person, in this particular case, a widow, cannot have electric light or current.  That is fundamentally wrong. I think that if the Minister adopted a different approach to this problem, he would have the full support of this House and the complete support of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us this evening that it would take £5 million to service these remaining 12,000 people <Col N="1205" /> without any special charge.  I do not think anybody in the House is asking him to go just that far.  These people are prepared to pay some additional special charge but a special charge of 400 per cent, as I have quoted, is outrageous.  I think that if there were a special charge of 50 per cent, or something like that, all round, the Minister would find that the £5 million would considerably be reduced to a manageable figure.</P>
    <P>I do not think the taxpayers would mind coming to the relief of these people somewhat by additional taxation. I do not even think the people who have been enjoying the blessing and the comfort of electric light for over 40 years would mind a fractional additional charge to their bills in order to provide electric light for their less fortunate rural brethren.</P>
    <P>As I have stated before, and it has been stated again, whether or not we like it, the ESB is a State monopoly which enjoys all the privileges and benefits that go with a monopoly; but, if it does, it should discharge to the citizens the duty of a monopoly, that is, to provide a service in places where it does not pay as well as in places where it must pay very well.  The example of the Post Office has been mentioned and I pointed out the example of the transport company.  If the transport company were to run buses, when they are running, in places only where they pay, then I think the people of this country would have to walk all the year round.</P>
    <P>These people for whom I plead, as I have said before, contribute in taxes every day of their lives to amenities throughout the length and breadth of this country which are good for the country but from which they themselves derive not direct benefit.  They themselves will be contributing towards a £2 million Concert Hall in Dublin which is for a worthy purpose, to commemorate a great man, but, at the same time, while that may be of service to the citizens of Dublin and while they may get some benefit from the Concert Hall, the people for whom I speak will get none.  Therefore, it is only common justice and equity <Col N="1206" /> that these people should have their electric light and have it now at a reasonable charge.  If a special charge there must be, it should not be a prohibitive one.  It should be a charge which it is within the competence and the willingness of these people to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the question of the erection of another power station in the Arigna area.  In February of this year, and again in May, the Minister was asked about the policy of either his Government or the ESB in relation to the erection of another power station in that area. Since then, matters have worsened. Roughly 400 to 500 people are employed. They are all small farmers whose income is supplemented by the reward they obtain for work in the Arigna coalmines.  Their average valuation would, I suppose, be in the region of £10 to £12.  I am sure the Minister, as well as everybody else, realises that nobody could possibly live on the income derived from such a low valuation and a small farm of that type.</P>
      <P>I do not think it unreasonable to ask the Minister to tell us the intention about the erection of this extra power station.  During the past fortnight, the men for whom I speak have been working only every other week and emigration will face them.  I am sure they are more than anxious to hear about the position from the present Government.</P>
      <P>A tremendous amount of lipservice was paid during the recent general election by the Fianna Fáil Party in respect of the west and emigration and what would be done to cure it.  I think that this is something the Government should do in an attempt to put these people back into employment.  We may rest assured that, if they do not get employment, there is nothing for them but emigration.  I shall be glad to hear the Minister state the position about the erection of that extra power station, when he comes to reply to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, there is just one matter to which I should like to advert.  The <Col N="1207" /> Minister has told us that he will look into the matter for, say, the year or two ahead, up to 1968.  There is a point which I omitted to make in relation to the special service charge when I last spoke on this matter.  Educationally, I believe television will play a much more important part in the years to come, if it is properly used. It is possible for people without electric power to have the ordinary radio on the battery system.  We have all had it in the west of Ireland in our time.  We have the radio now, wherever there is electric power, and it is possible also to have television.  Consider the position of these 12,000 families in these pockets.  Generally speaking, in such areas, the families are large.  If education will be propagated by television, as I think it will and should be, then these people will be deprived of the most modern expositions on various aspects of education. That is a matter which the Minister should consider.</P>
      <P>I suggest very sincerely that he should use it in any discussions he may have with the ESB with a view to modifying these special service charges.  In remote areas, too, where there are sheep farmers, electricity is playing a part.  It is playing no small part in sheep-rearing, in pig-rearing and in very many other aspects of agriculture.  In particular, I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the matter of education through the medium of television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the supplementary charge.  As I have indicated, we have already made a very great contribution to bringing electric power to the people in the rural areas and to the People in the West of Ireland and the other congested areas.  This is a question of seeing whether anything more can be done for a very small number of people who are living in isolated pockets.  I have said that I have asked the ESB to examine again the position and, in fact, to do what some Deputies have suggested, namely, to see what can be done by scaling down the charges now required to a certain degree without abolishing them completely. <Col N="1208" /> I want to make it clear that this programme must proceed as at present and nobody should make a decision now, one way or the other, to refuse or to accept electric light because of the debate that has gone on in the Dáil.  I should state that the £5 million required to complete this work represents the actual cost of joining these 12,000 people, apart from the capitalised cost of eliminating all special service charges from those who already pay.  That is the explanation of the £5 million.</P>
      <P>I should also say that subsidies were abolished between 1955 and 1958 and that, of course, added to the cost of the ESB financial operations.  There was £530,000 approximately payment of interest for the provision of a good deal of rural electrification but we shall leave that out of the argument for the moment.</P>
      <P>I should also say in regard to these isolated areas that not only have we given the 75 per cent subsidy but we have also provided special capital grants for backbone lines.  We were able to bring power into the remotest areas.  Without these special grants we would not have been able to go into certain areas where there was no power before the 1962 Act.  Some areas were not covered for which some of these special backbone transmission lines were required.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is true to say that the Government have failed to do anything to arrest the flight from the land.  This is only one of the huge number of capital services made available for people in the west, and for small farmers, to improve their social and economic position.  All I can say about it is that I am having the matter examined further in order to see what can be done on a modified basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Reynolds, I have no news yet about the possibility of extending the Arigna power station. There are a great many technical difficulties associated with the project.

    <P>On that account, I feel that Deputies might not wish to be burdened today with a repetition of my predecessor's <Col N="1210" /> statement, and that it would be more for the convenience of the House if I were to confine myself now to the brief remarks which I have just made, undertaking at the same time to deal to the best of my ability with such questions, if there are any, as it may be desired to put to me arising from the Estimates. Nevertheless, I am completely in the hands of the House in the matter.  If it is desired that I should repeat my predecesor's statement, I have no objection to doing so.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one point to which I might, perhaps, refer specifically now, seeing that it was raised by some Deputies in connection with the recent Pensions Abatement Bill.  It is the question of the abatement of Defence Forces pensions where the recipients are in employment remunerated from public funds.  A Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme is at present being prepared, and should soon be ready to be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas, which will deal with this matter, with retrospective effect to 1st January, 1965, in a manner which, I hope, will be satisfactory to all concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is true that this Estimate was introduced by the Minister's predecessor in March last and there was considerable discussion on it.  At the same time, I am not aware of any agreement or arrangement under which this Estimate was to be passed without discussion. I feel it would be the wish of the House, now that we have a new Minister for Defence, to have a discussion on the Estimate and to get the Minister's views and ideas on defence in general.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of extending to the Minister my best wishes for a happy term of office.  I do not think I will be taken seriously if I wish him a long term of office but I certainly wish him a happy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Estimate was introduced before the then spokesman for this side of the House, Deputy MacEoin, spoke on it.  I think it might be appropriate now to put on record the loss <Col N="1211" /> that is felt by the absence of Deputy Seán MacEoin from this House and I think I will be pardoned and understood if I say that the work he has done as a soldier, as a statesman and as a member of this House will be long remembered and will stand the test of history.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said most of what I intend to say regarding the series of amendments we have introduced. I was making the point that the views expressed by the Incorporated Law Society certainly seem to support very fully the point of view which has been expressed by me, and expressed in these amendments.  I want to emphasise the point that the approach of the Incorporated Law Society to a matter such as this is entirely impartial so far as politics are concerned. Their interest is in no way a political one.  Their interest is to serve the people of this country who are the clients of the members of the profession they represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the fact that in a published statement the Incorporated Law Society described the system adopted by the Minister in this Bill as an attempt to do justice blindfold.  They also referred to the point made by the Minister in relation to his proposals, namely, that he did not want to drive the widow into court.  I think I am not doing the Minister an injustice in paraphrasing what he said.  He said that the big difference between his approach and the Fine Gael approach to the matter was that he saw no reason why the Legislature should drive the widow into court in order to get justice.  The Incorporated Law Society described that argument of the Minister's as unconvincing.  It is unconvincing. They pointed to the Minister's proposal that an application <Col N="1212" /> made by children should be heard in private.  Our proposal in these amendments is that an application from children or from a widow should be heard in private and without any publicity, so that there is nothing to this argument about driving the widow into court.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society also expressed in some detail the objections they have to the fixed legal right share proposed by the Government.  I want to quote now from their memorandum which was published in the newspapers some weeks ago.  They said:</P>
    <P>The basic objection to the fixed share system remains.  It is that the testator at the time of making his will is the best judge of the interests of his family and that the State is neither qualified nor competent to make the choice for him.  In the minority of cases, and it is relatively a small minority, in which testators fail in their duty, an alteration of his will should be made only by some body with knowledge of the circumstances of the particular case. The legislature cannot know the circumstances.</P>
    <P>They then set out what they describe as some of the practical objections to the fixed share system.  Briefly, the objections referred to by them are: (1) An undeserving spouse would have an absolute right to share in the estate of the wronged partner.  In order to deprive an unworthy husband of this right the wife will either have to obtain a decree of divorce a <i>mensa et toro</i> or leave him and live apart.  If, for the sake of the children, she decides to remain, the husband must receive his fixed one-third share, if he survives her.  The same position will obtain if the wife is undeserving; (2) Wives and husbands who have executed separation deeds and are sufficiently provided for may have to apply to the court for judicial separation orders to avoid the consequences of the Bill if it is passed; (3) There will be fragmentation of estates and bad management in some cases.  It may be best in a particular case to leave a farm or business to one or more children most competent to <Col N="1213" /> manage it.  The decision must depend on the character of the parties, family relationships, the means of the parties and other particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should read this in detail.  Four or five other detailed objections of that kind were voiced by this most authoritative body which, I have no doubt, were brought to the attention of the Minister.  I suggest to him that this is an opinion which he should not dismiss lightly.  As I said earlier, it is only a matter of opinion as things stand whether the number of cases of unfair wills is large or small. I agree, and I think everyone on these benches agrees, that whether the number is large or small, some steps should be taken to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>The view expressed by the Incorporated Law Society supports the view I expressed on more than one occasion, that while the problem does exist, it is not widespread.  They said:</P>
    <P>In the minority of cases, and it is relatively a small minority, in which testators fail in their duty ...</P>
    <P>It seems to me, as I said before, that if the Government have come to the conclusion that the majority of Irish will-makers make unfair and unjust wills, then the system proposed by the Minister is justified, and the Minister is entitled to come in here and ask the House to pass this legislation.  I do not think he is entitled to do that unless he is honestly convinced that the majority of Irish testators make bad, unfair and unjust wills.  If the Minister believes that, he is doing the right thing.  That is not my belief, and because it is not my belief I believe the Minister is doing the wrong thing and that it would be far better for this House to adopt the scheme outlined in the proposals we are moving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has really covered ground which was already covered during the Second Reading debate. This is concerned with a very fundamental principle, the principle of the legal right of the surviving spouse.  The amendments which Deputy O'Higgins is moving concern themselves with <Col N="1214" /> this fundamental right which is incorporated in this measure.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to emphasise that a number of representative bodies were met by me in regard to the Succession Bill as it stood originally, and in regard to the amendments which I incorporated in the original measure and which now form the basis of the Succession Bill, 1965.  The main point proposed to me by the National Farmers' Association and the Incorporated Law Society, when I first met them, was the question which would arise, as the Bill stood originally, of having a number of fractions made because of the children's share of one-third&mdash;a situation in which a number of children who might otherwise have been provided for could claim their share of one-third.</P>
      <P>I can say with truth that in the discussions I had with the Incorporated Law Society and the National Farmers' Association there was very little, in fact no dissent at that stage&mdash;it was before Christmas&mdash;from the point of view that it was right and proper that the widow should be looked after and have some basic legal right.  That right is incorporated in this measure and is being attacked by these amendments. All the representations made by these bodies, and by the Bar Council and others concerned with the problem of succession, whom I met collectively and individually, indicated that they were mainly worried by the question of the breaking-up of the children's one-third into a number of shares, some of which would go to children who might have left the farm or otherwise settled away from the farm or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could see wisdom in that point of view and I was personally convinced it was necessary, in the circumstances of this country, to ensure that a particular son or other member of the family chosen by the testator should get the property, be it farm or business, reasonably unencumbered, subject only to the obligation on that person to look after his or her mother. The weapon in the Bill to protect the mother in these circumstances, to ensure that the son or daughter looks <Col N="1215" /> after the mother, is written into the Bill in the form of a legal right for the widow to one-third, not just a one-third share in respect of which she has to go into the courts to claim, but a legal right share, which she can claim, and obtain from the personal representative if she has not been looked after within 12 months after administration has been taken out.</P>
    <P>We have, under the present Bill, enabled this situation to be achieved in two ways.  The first is where a man, with the consent of his wife, may make a family settlement giving the estate to one of the children, provided the wife consents to the deed of assignment.  The owner can make such a deed up to the day of his death. He can transfer the property to the son or daughter of his choice.  That is one way.  The other way we have proposed for the protection of the son or daughter of the testator's choice is to ensure that by his will the testator can give the estate to one of his children, subject to the legal right of one-third for the widow.  In addition, there is the important provision that, if the testator wants to give everything to his wife&mdash;which, as Deputy O'Higgins has said, is the case in 90 per cent of wills&mdash;he may continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the only division really between us at this stage is the question of the legal right for the surviving spouse&mdash;the widow, in most cases.  The position is that Deputy O'Higgins's amendments are designed to push the widow into court to prove her case. Let us examine what that would involve. It would involve&mdash;the amendment suggests it should be a private hearing&mdash;going to the court, raking up all sorts of embarrassing matters, including, very probably, acts of unkindness and unfaithfulness.  All these matters would have to come into open discussion before a judge.  It is not the sort of thing that, in all compassion and decency, any woman should have to do.  It is not something an Irish legislature should demand of any woman, having regard to her place in the home, her place in our Christian <Col N="1216" /> society and her position as written into our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I can see a very real difference between obliging a widow to go into court to prove her one-third claim and obliging, as we have it in the Bill, one of the children who may be victimised to go into court.  In regard to a dependent child, the basis of his application to the court in chambers will be necessity and dependency&mdash;the fact that he or she was dependent on the testator prior to his death.  It will be a matter of economic proof, a question of going to court to show that the child was dependent for his education, for his living, on that person at the time of his death.  The child involved in that case is in a very different position from that in which Deputy O'Higgins seeks to place a widow. He seeks to put on her shoulders the obligation to go into court to prove her rights to a share out of the testator's estate, a case which can only be refuted by allegations of unfaithfulness, of dishonourable conduct, which were better not opened up even if the court hearing is <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>Indeed, I see incorporated in the amendments tabled by Deputy O'Higgins a provision which I actually deleted from the original Bill.  In the original Bill there was a provision which I consider very undesirable.  It was very similar to the proposals in amendment No. 24 (c) which seeks to deprive of the right to make a court application any surviving spouse who is &ldquo;by reason of continuing dissolute, dishonourable, cruel or unfaithful behaviour undeserving of such provision&rdquo;. A provision along those lines was in the original Bill.  I thought it very objectionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the amendment seeks is that it should be written in here that any judge should have to decide on a moral basis whether a person is guilty of continuing dissolute, dishonourable, cruel or unfaithful behaviour. I would prefer to rely on the basic marriage vows&mdash;which are indissoluble&mdash;not to have these matters <Col N="1217" /> raked up before the judge, who would then be the arbiter as to where the moral right might reside.</P>
      <P>There is a clear distinction between the sort of rights an Irish legislature should give to a widow and the rights which such a legislature might confer on children.  Because of that I think the court application procedure as incorporated in the Bill and which, I take it, largely meets with agreement from Deputy O'Higgins, is the best way to deal with children's rights.  I can see a real distinction between that and the proposal to impose the obligation on a spouse, particularly a woman, to make a claim based on her dependency.  Her claim is based on her moral right as a partner in the affairs of her deceased husband, created originally by the marriage vows themselves.</P>
      <P>The Incorporated Law Society in their statement seek to say that this particular legal right in respect of the surviving spouse is some form of &ldquo;Statism.&rdquo;  They seek to convey in their statement that this is an unwarranted intrusion by the State.  I wish to say now that the whole notion of legal rights for the widow is grounded on moral law and Canon law and it came into most of the legal systems of the world through that source.  It is in the Catholic countries of this world that this particular legal right has been entrenched in legislation for hundreds of years.  The whole basis of the legal right of one-third for the widow is grounded on the basic moral principle that a man's obligation to his wife is something more than mere obligation created by her dependence on him.  She, by reason of the marriage contract, is very much a partner and has a claim on him which goes beyond the mere claims of dependency.  This, of course, is incorporated in our own Constitution which recognises this position.  I might say again that the leading moral theological authorities were consulted by me in connection with this and every one of them was wholeheartedly in favour of this provision and felt that this was the sort of provision which an Irish Legislature should enact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters involved in <Col N="1218" /> Deputy O'Higgins's amendment on which I would cross swords with him. One particular aspect concerns his basis of making a court application in respect of children.  I prefer our more flexible section which is there at the moment.  We do not go into the details of defining dependency.  At first when I came to look at this problem, I did bring before the House my own definition of dependency in respect of children but since then, on further thought, I have come to prefer the more flexible provision we have incorporated in this measure where we leave it to the court to inquire into the circumstances of the application made by the child, to look at it from the basis of the moral duty which the testator had towards that child and, in general, to make provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that that flexible approach would appeal to some of the people opposite who were so insistent on the court's rights and the flexibility of any judicial discretion. I will quote one or two obvious examples to show how you could become involved in trouble if you go into too narrow a definition of dependency. Under Deputy O'Higgins's amendments, you could have the situation where the bachelor son who remained on the farm until he was 27, 28 or 30, which is not an unusual circumstance, and who had toiled and worked the land, would not, under this definition of dependency, be entitled, whereas you might have a situation in which, under this definition also, an unmarried sister, perhaps a professional woman living at home, would be regarded as a dependant.  You could have a situation where somebody aged 22 or 23 might be attending a university and still have four or five years to spend there and would, therefore, be very much a dependant until the age of 26.  Yet if that person is over 21, he or she would be excluded by this narrow definition.  Therefore I think that it is preferable to have the wide, flexible procedure which we have prescribed in the Bill, providing for an application to the court in chambers, with power to the judge to <Col N="1219" /> look at the thing in the widest possible way, and apply as a criterion what the moral duty of the testator was to the child.  To seek to look at that as the operative criterion is more sensible, in my view, than tying us down to a rigid definition of dependency.</P>
    <P>In other words, it strikes me as being strange that Deputy O'Higgins and Deputies opposite who are seeking to make this a more flexible measure should in this particular instance, where we have provided for the utmost flexibility, seek instead to limit the judicial discretion by adopting a rigid, narrow definition.  It surprises me, because I thought that the approach opposite would have been more in line with my own approach.</P>
    <P>As I stated some time ago, that is largely a detail in regard to the method of the children's application. The main point between us is really a point decided by the Labour Party and ourselves in voting for the Second Stage, the question of the legal right for the widow.  I am convinced that the only way in which she can have the power to ensure that she is treated properly is to have written into legislation a legal right to one-third, or one-half if there are no children.  I think most of our people would agree with that as being very reasonable and, in fact, as I stated when the Bill first came up for discussion, after I became Minister for Justice I had discussions with the various interested bodies and there was very little point made on this.  In fact, it was accepted by them that something would have to be done for the widow.  The main criticism was in regard to the compulsory share for the children.  Indeed, the NFA, who would be most concerned in this matter, to see that there was no fragmentation, were fully behind the amendments which I discussed with them, and they have since assured me of their support both by way of deputation to me and in the columns of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>.  Therefore there is no opposition from that source.  The Law Society have come back on the widow's legal right <Col N="1220" /> question and that is the only outstanding matter between us.</P>
    <P>I feel I have met the points of the bodies mentioned more than half way in this measure, particularly when one considers that this legal right share residing in the surviving spouse is not a compulsory share to be extracted out of the State willy-nilly.  We are not, in this measure, interfering with the right of the testator, with the agreement of his wife, to make any disposition of his property which he wishes in accordance with law, be it a life estate or any form of disposition or arrangement which is suitable to the wife and the family circumstances.  I am saying, however, that if the wife is unjustly or wrongly treated, she has this right up her sleeve to insist that she is treated well and she can ensure that the people benefiting under the will will look after her.  If she chooses not to enforce the full right to one-third, she can insist on a fair deal.  On the other hand, if she is not well treated, she can insist on the legal right share.  This appears to me to be very reasonable and I think it is accepted by the public generally as a reasonable approach on my part to this difficulty.</P>
    <P>We have gone more than half way to meet the points made and, in my view, every legitimate point that was made has been met in a series of amendments in this flexible measure. I would appeal to Deputies on all sides to look at it from the point of view of a measure which is designed to remedy an injustice which Deputy J.A. Costello described on the Second Reading of this Bill as being of sizeable proportions and at the same time to preserve the maximum degree of flexibility, which was regarded as essential by critics of the Bill inside and outside this House.  I think we have now achieved the situation where we have the maximum degree of flexibility compatible with the essential principle of a married man, or a wife, ensuring that the spouse with whom he or she has lived over a long period of years is entitled to a reasonable share, not more than one third, out of the estate which has been built up by the efforts of the partners and that the particular share of the estate is not <Col N="1221" /> one reliant on dependency or any other economic argument but is a right of a moral nature that either side of the partnership is entitled to, because his or her share arises out of that partnership.  On that basis, I would ask the House to reject these amendments on the grounds that they are in fact a negation of the decision of the House reached by statutory majority after the Second Reading Division.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  I do not wish to speak on the series of amendments at the moment but the Minister has spoken all the time about the widow and children.  What is his attitude about the husband?  As the law stands at the moment husband and wife are on the same basis but he has spoken about the widows and the children only.</P>

      <P>I did so because the most usual case is the surviving widow but what I said applies equally to the surviving widower.  I know the Deputy has strong views on this and that, whereas he was well disposed towards having a mandatory legal right in the case of the widow, he did not see why that should exist in the case of the widower.  In my view that would be a retrograde step.  I am all for women's rights and all the suffragettes sought, and I am all in favour of equal rights for men and women, but I think if we build up this too far we would give more rights to the woman than to the man.  The women have come far enough by their own efforts.  I think we could push the principle too far if we had a situation where a widower was in a less favourable position than a widow.  With all due respects to widows I would not push their rights that far.  I may be fighting for their rights gallantly in the House but not to the extent of detriment to the male survivor.  I think it is a proper principle to have equal rights for men and women.</P>

      <P>Nothing could be more solicitous for the welfare of the widow than Deputy O'Higgins's amendment for he also provided further, not that the judge might have discretion but that the judge should order the exclusion from the court of all persons other than the parties, their counsel and solicitors and the officers of the court ... It is perfectly clear that the whole purpose of that amendment is to treat with discretion and in confidence all the stresses and strains of married life.  We consider that the amendments which the Fine Gael Party has put before the House take cognisance of the stresses and strains of domestic life which the original Bill and this Bill now do not allow for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody should know more than the Minister how unfairly the strict rules of law can apply to a particular case. He has reserved for himself, and society has given to the State, the power to remit penalties imposed in relation to criminal convictions and other quasi-criminal convictions and the purpose of this&mdash;which the Minister justified to the House within the past month&mdash;is that the court and the <Col N="1223" /> law could not take account of variations in human conduct which very frequently were open for consideration by the Minister subsequent to the strict application of the rules of law.</P>
    <P>That is the argument that we use in asking for a system which will not dictate the precise proportions that must be applied to partners in a marriage contract.  In many cases the one-third share which the Minister seeks to impose would be inadequate and in other cases it would be a wrong appropriation of the assets of the deceased spouse particularly when the survivor had substantial estate of his or her own.  That is why we think this is bad law which we are seeking to make.  It is bad law because we are trying to sow it in the infertile ground of the undutiful and inofficious wills which represent only a very small minority of the wills made in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks which the Minister and his advisers and many other people suffer is that they think typical wills made in this country are those which are fought out in court and hit the headlines in national newspapers.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, there appears to be a peculiar interest on the part of people in the wills and family disputes of others. There is something attractively gruesome about the family squabbles of others.  People are inclined to think the wills which reach the courts are typical and are the kind of wills that are made.  That is quite wrong.  I do not believe that the Minister has, or that his advisers have, ever taken instructions for the making of wills and I do not believe that anybody who has taken instructions for the making of wills could see any justification for a provision of this kind.  We are told there are no two people in the world alike and if that is true of people then there are no two families exactly the same.  Their circumstances and their relations with each other and with others and with other wings of the family all have a part to play in the past and future growth of families and legislation of this kind which seeks to apportion particular shares <Col N="1224" /> to particular survivors within the family will not meet human problems which we seek to solve in such a manner.</P>
    <P>Let us again state for the record, lest it be forgotten, that the principal pioneers in the campaign to provide proper provision for widows were the Fine Gael Party.  Long before the Minister and his colleagues thought of it themselves they were being pressed by Fine Gael on this side of the House to make adequate provision for widows.  If a simple solution of the kind which we advocated for years had been introduced years ago, many cases of injustice which have occurred since this matter was first mooted would not have arisen and many widows who are weeping because of their misfortunes to-day would not have been so unfortunate if the Minister and his Department had not tried to do too much in such an extraordinary way and had not tried to fit the circumstances of other countries into the particular circumstances which we have here.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the legal right which he seeks to introduce and which we seek to delete, as being a moral right of a spouse.  I am not aware of any wording in the marriage contract to the effect that one bestows on one's spouse one-third of one's worldly goods.  I may be wrong in this but I do believe that the recent amendments of the liturgy have deleted the words &ldquo;With all my worldly goods I thee endow&rdquo; but, whether they have been deleted or not, they certainly never provided for a particular proportion and I do not think that the Minister is right when he seeks to apportion any particular share of the worldly goods.</P>

      <P>I think it is true to say that the testator is the best judge of the interests of his family.  To enact legislation of the kind which the Minister asks this House to support is to pass a vote of no confidence in Irish people to make their wills according to the dictates of their family obligations and their understanding of their moral duties.  The effect of this is to say that any Irish man or woman who in the past has made a will in a form which did not accord with what the Minister now proposes made a bad will, made a will which the Minister says was contrary to his moral obligations under the marriage contract, that such person made a will which, according to the Minister's opinion, did not make proper provision for the family. That is the effect of the Minister's proposals. It may irritate the Minister to have somebody render down the proposals which he is making but that in fact is what happens when you render down this legislative proposal. You are saying that most of the wills which have been made in the past and which are being made to-day are bad wills because they do not conform with the theories which the Minister seeks to enforce as part of the law of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Society, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, has specifically mentioned the difficulties which are likely to arise in relation to voluntary separation deeds.  Many of these deeds have been entered into over the years primarily because of the anxiety of people to keep out of court the type of dispute which the Minister says should be kept out of court, that is, family disputes where allegations of cruelty, misconduct, and so on, are thrown from one side to the other.  If there is a saving section in the Bill dealing with this I should like the Minister to tell me.  Certainly, on my reading of it, I have not been able to find it.  But, clearly, it would be extremely unjust if we were now to change the law.  Up to now people who entered into voluntary separation deeds understood that they were clearing the slate and that bygones were to <Col N="1226" /> be bygones and both parties were to live apart as though they were single and neither party was to be free to make any claim upon the estate of the other.  The effect of this Bill will be to render nugatory such voluntary separation deeds.</P>

      <P>They have been thrashed out in the horror chamber which the Minister says nobody should enter. You would think from what the Minister has said about our courts here that no sane person would ever enter them.  I think he was being unfair to the whole institution of the judiciary in the remarks that he has passed.  But we do not think that he is going to solve the problem of undutiful and inofficious wills in this way.  He is going to create further injustice and as sure as we are here tonight discussing this Bill, if the Minister puts through this Bill without adopting the spirit and principle of the amendments coming from the Fine Gael side, we will be meeting in Dáil Éireann in the not too distant future to amend the legislation to provide for a more flexible system as there will be many cases of injustice which are bound to arise or, if we are not, we will certainly be failing in our duty.</P>
      <P>It might seem odd that the Minister should be at loggerheads with the profession which in the main draw up wills in this country, that is, the Incorporated Law Society, and it does seem most undesirable that any Department of State should be in conflict on such a serious matter as this with the profession which is primarily concerned with it.  It seems to me that the recent speech by the Minister for Justice in Cork in attacking the solicitors' profession has disclosed an unhealthy state of affairs and indicates the contempt which the Department of Justice has for it.</P>

If that unhappy situation should arise&mdash;I know it is certainly not the wish of the solicitors' profession that it should&mdash;then the Minister for Justice will have a great deal to answer for.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this Bill is to revise the law of succession and the law relating to the making of wills.  It is a reform of a branch of the law which affects very intimately and very closely all the people of this country.  Therefore, it is something that should be thought about very carefully and should be enacted only if the House is satisfied that it is the best possible reform that can be brought in.  It is certainly something that should not be fought out in this House on a political basis and it is certainly something on which the Minister or his advisers should not take a stand simply and solely for the purpose of face saving.</P>
      <P>The history of this Bill and its predecessor, the Succession Bill of 1964, suggests that the thinking of the Minister, and particularly his predecessor, and his advisers on this matter was very much out of line with public opinion and with the wishes of the layman and the professional man. There was, first of all, the Bill as introduced in its original state.  It virtually deprived a married person of the right to make a will at all.  It said the married person with children had first to give one-third to the surviving spouse and another one-third to be divided equally between all his children, irrespective of whether they were dependants or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> The reaction of public opinion to that was so violent that the then Minister and his advisers had to have second thoughts.  They came before the House and the country on the eve of a vital by-election with a crop of amendments under which they retained the obligation to give one-third of the testator's property to the surviving spouse; they altered the provision whereby a testator was obliged to give one-third to all his children and substituted therefor an obligation to give one-third to dependent children.  Again it became apparent that the people would not stand for that position, and this Minister had further thoughts on the subject.  He now comes before the House with this Bill under which there is an obligation on a married testator with a family to bequeath one-third of everything he has to his surviving spouse, and certain rights are provided for dependent children.</P>
    <P>Let it be said that this Party from the very beginning have taken up the attitude that there is a moral obligation, and that there should be a legal obligation, on a testator to make adequate provision for his dependent widow and dependent children.  Subject to that over-ruling obligation, we think there is no one in a better position to make a will making adequate provision for his wife and family than the father or mother of that family, than the owner of the property.</P>
    <P>One would think, as has already been said here today, that the vast majority of family people in Ireland made unjust wills, that they failed to make adequate provision for their dependants.  Everyone knows that is not the case.  Like Deputy O'Higgins, I have 25 years' experience of will-making in rural Ireland, of advising family people on making a will, and I am satisfied that married people in making wills go out of their way to be just to those who are left behind, go out of their way to make adequate provision for the surviving spouse and dependent children, having regard to the peculiar circumstances of each family.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his Second Reading speech that a great many <Col N="1230" /> people do not make wills, and when they die intestate, the widow takes one-third of the estate.  That is so, but the people who make wills, the people who insist on making wills, are people who have a particular family problem with which to deal, a problem which cannot be dealt with by an Act of Parliament, a problem which can be dealt with only by people who are familiar with the problem of that family.  Those are the people who never neglect to make a will and those are the people who long before old age is reached  before they become ill are careful to make a will.</P>
    <P>I am against the provisions of section 110 of this Bill and in favour of the amendments, the substitute sections.  First of all, I believe it is wrong to take away from a testator the discretion he should have in making his will, subject only to the legal obligation to provide adequately for his dependants.  That is wrong and unsuited to the circumstances in this country.  It is wrong that one-third of a farm should be put into cold storage for the life of the surviving spouse.  I know I will be told that need not happen.  I realise the Bill provides that by an ante-nuptial contract, one or other or both spouses can abdicate their rights, but how many people in rural Ireland will go to the trouble of entering into this pre-nuptial arrangement? That is not likely at all.</P>
    <P>I know also there is a provision in the Bill that during a marriage one or other of the spouses can abdicate his or her rights but it might be necessary to make another type of will to deal with that.  It is most unlikely that people would enter into such an arrangement during marriage.  I know also that unless the surviving spouse elects within 12 months of the death or extraction of representation, this compulsory provision goes by the board.  However, the surviving spouse who was likely to be difficult during life and who might not deal adequately or fairly with the surviving children is certain to exercise the election within 12 months and hold on to this one-third share.  That is not a reasonable provision.  The alternative provision <Col N="1231" /> suggested in Deputy O'Higgins's amendment by which the court can come in in a case where a surviving spouse has not been adequately provided for it is much more suited to the requirements of our people.</P>
    <P>I have made the case on Second Reading&mdash;and I think it might be appropriate to make it in detail here now&mdash;that the surviving spouse who elects to take this one-third share can do what he or she likes with it and can assign it away over the head of the member of the family who has stayed at home and worked for years and years, and can be lured into transferring it to the white-haired boy who comes home once a week or for an odd week-end, and who brings the occasional present and stirs up annoyance in the home.  That is possible, and it is more than possible ; it is likely in the case where a man or woman would have made a will to deal with a peculiar situation.  If this goes through, it is likely to lead to the breaking up of homes and the selling out of farms and businesses.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister bases his case for section 110 on his anxiety to ensure that the surviving spouse is adequately provided for.  But does section 110 do that?  It certainly does not.  In effect, the section means that, once the surviving spouse gets one-third of the estate, whether that is adequate provision or whether it is not, he or she has no further claim on the estate.  It might very well be that under Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, a court, having regard to all the circumstances and having regard to the financial position of other members of the family, as well as that of the surviving spouse, might say that the surviving spouse could be adequately provided for only by giving him or her the whole estate.  But that will not be permissible under this Bill.  Once he or she gets the one-third, that is an end of it.  Whether it is enough or whether it is not, that is all he or she has, as of legal right.</P>
    <P>Under section 117 children can go to court.  A dependent child who is <Col N="1232" /> not adequately provided for can go to court and claim adequate provision from a judge, but this one-third legal right share in the hands of an uncooperative surviving spouse may prevent a judge from awarding adequate provision to a dependent child because the section which gives the right to the judge says that nothing that he shall do under the section shall interfere with this sacred one-third, if my reading of the section is correct.  That is another thing which can lead to abuse.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Minister's attitude, seeing that he yielded on the compulsory legal right share for the children.  Why can he not now go the whole way and yield on this particular section?  I am afraid it is because, if he yielded on this, it could then be truly said that this, in effect, is a new Succession Bill; the old one is dead and has been buried.  That may be so, and it might be said.  Nevertheless, I do not think a consideration such as that should influence either the Minister or his Government in dealing with so important a subject, a subject which affects the life of the ordinary man in the street and in the field so closely and so intimately.</P>
    <P>I repeat that we believe adequate provision should and must be made for a dependant surviving spouse and children but, mark you, this Bill insists on giving as of legal right one-third of the estate to the surviving spouse, irrespective of whether that surviving spouse be a poor person or a very wealthy person, a good, intelligent parent or a reckless, spendthrift parent. I know that under the terms of the Bill the testator has the right to appoint trustees to look after this one-third share for the surviving spouse, but the surviving spouse can challenge that trust in court and, unless it is held that he or she is unfit to look after himself or herself, the court is bound to upset the trust.  That is a bad thing.  For the sake of prestige, for the sake of not yielding, for the sake of not having to admit they were wrong, the Minister and his advisers are insisting on bulldozing section 110 through the House, a section which is both undesirable and unsuitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> As the last speaker said, if the Bill goes through in its present form, I do not think it will be very long before public opinion will force the Minister, or his successor, to have further and better thoughts on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have strayed some distance from the terms of the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Higgins.  That is a pity because it has tempted us to conduct a Second Reading debate all over again.  As I see it, the point at issue really is that what is being proposed in the Bill basically is that, in the last resort, the surviving spouse shall have a legal right to a certain proportion.  As against that Deputy Michael O'Higgins is suggesting a different system altogether, a system which gives no certain right whatsoever to a surviving spouse, or to the dependent children for that matter.  His amendments, particularly amendment No. 124, appear to me to be completely impracticable. There are too many words which require interpretation.  I agree with the Minister that, if we accepted these amendments, we would make applications to the court inevitable in far too many cases.  I would much prefer that resort to the court would be the last resort and that every possible means should be taken to encourage reasonable family settlements.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggests in amendment No. 24 that it shall be the duty of a testator to make such equitable provision for his dependants as is reasonable.  To my mind that is incredibly vague.  What is an equitable provision? Who is to decide whether or not it is reasonable?  To me it puts an almost intolerable burden on any court to interpret such a clause.  I should much prefer that our first responsibility would be to the surviving spouse, who is normally a widow, and to ensure that she shall be adequately provided for to the extent of at least one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan seemed to have forgotten that there is no reason at all why a reasonable testator should not leave his entire <Col N="1234" /> estate to his spouse and that that would not be upset.  In their arguments, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Ryan, to some extent, seem to suffer from what I describe as cross-thinking. One moment they say testators are well able to look after their families and nobody is better qualified to do that than the testator himself.  They both say there is no need for this legislation.  Yet Deputy Ryan said if only it had been enacted more quickly and if there had been some sort of amendment of the present law of succession, very many families would have been saved from tremendous hardship and misery.</P>

      <P>No, because I have had practice.  I know a solicitor cannot advise an executor to administer an estate other than in strict accordance with the will as before him or the direction of the court.  I think the Deputy will agree with me there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy.  The Deputy has been advocating that people should be entitled to make settlements and arrangements.  Just to keep the thing in order, all these amendments, including amendment No. 26, are being discussed together.  I think the particular point to which the Deputy wanted an answer is dealt with in amendment No. 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can see that.  It is provided that it shall be lawful for dependants to enter into a deed of arrangement by way of compromise of their rights.  But that is not the point at issue.  Under amendment No. 24 the basic point is that somebody has to decide whether the testator had made such equitable provision as is reasonable.  If the solicitor acting for the executor or the solicitor acting independently for one of the dependants feels the disposition by the testator was inequitable or not fully reasonable, there is no way in which he can act other than by submitting a case to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that is undesirable.  I would agree with the Minister that, if we have this legal right share of one-third for the widow, that gives her a final weapon, if you like, to be used only as a last resort to try to defend her rights against those of the children.  I think everybody with reason and commonsense will see the point of that.  But, quite apart from the words &ldquo;equitable <Col N="1237" /> or reasonable&rdquo;, which seem to be far too vague to be taken really seriously, we come to subsection (c) of the proposed amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy leaves the first point, from what he is saying, I presume it can be taken he is equally strongly against the Minister's provision in section 117 of the Bill, which provides for an application to the court if the testator fails to make proper provision for children in accordance with his means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would agree with the specific point the Minister made on section 117.  The only point to be decided on section 117 is need.  What does the child need?  How dependent was the child on the testator up to the date of his death?  It is not a question of equity or reasonableness, but purely a matter of fact.  Was the child entirely dependent on his father for his upkeep, education, clothing and what have you?  That, to my mind, is a far safer basis on which to work.</P>

I should like to join issue with the Minister on section 117 when we come to it, but I would prefer not to get involved in it at this stage.

      <P>Such person is by reason of continuing dissolute, dishonourable, cruel or unfaithful behaviour undeserving of such provision.</P>
      <P>That, to my mind, is a nauseating suggestion.  I can quite see what the Deputy has in mind and on the face of it, there is a certain amount of justice for it.  It is a completely undeserving provision that there should be a discussion, even in chambers, whereby members of a family start accusing each other of continuing dissolute, dishonourable, cruel or unfaithful behaviour. That is sickening.  It is no way to wind up the estate of a person.  It is one way of fragmenting, not only the family estate, but the family as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with human nature as we find it but this is a provision whereby you are trying to give detailed guidance for the courts to decide on cases.  That is quite impracticable and I feel it would undoubtedly lead to far more trouble than it could possibly solve.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly happy with the Bill as it stands in that the minimum right is given to the surviving spouse and there is also a right, under section 117, to dependent children to bring their cases before the courts.  I would very much hope, however, that testators would tend more and more to make what I believe is an ideal will and to leave everything to the surviving spouse, either absolutely or for life, with the remainder to the children, equally or in certain reasonable shares. We must try to avoid any ruling of a family from the grave.  I consider we have gone as near as we conceivably can without leaving the widow without protection at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope through this debate and through the publicity which will be <Col N="1240" /> given to it, that more and more people will be encouraged to go to their solicitors and make a reasonable will at once.  There is no point in waiting until you are feeling a bit sick.  The time to do it is when you are well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We should also like to encourage testators to make their wills simple, as most solicitors encourage their clients to do.  It would be an ideal solution if this Bill had not to be invoked in the great majority of cases. We are trying to make provision here for the admittedly small proportion of cases where the widow is not provided for and likewise where the children are not provided for.  We have done this in a workmanlike, reasonable and practical way and I feel all these amendments by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, particularly amendment No. 24, are too wordy and would be capable of such variation in interpretation that they would defeat the purpose the Deputy has in mind.  The Deputy has got amendment No. 24 completely bogged down in the implementation of it.  I do not blame him for that because he was trying to do the impossible.  We will have the maximum flexibility in this and that is good.  I feel that when this Bill is passed, as I believe it will be passed, basically as it is, it will not give rise to any of the evasion effects which have been forecast for it.  We will be doing a lot of good if we can persuade people to make wills in good time and in a reasonable form.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment which is consequential on amendment No. 10. The phrase which it is proposed to delete, &ldquo;original or by representation,&rdquo; refers to the fact that an executor of an executor represents the original testator under what is known as the chain of representation.  Amendment No. 10 proposes to abolish the principle that the executor of an executor represents the original testator, and, accordingly, it is necessary to omit the reference &ldquo;original or by representation,&rdquo;. Heretofore the law has been that the executor of a deceased executor <Col N="1243" /> represents the original testator.  We propose to delete that.</P>

      <P>Administration would have to be extracted by one of the next-of-kin.  We feel it is a bit unreal to have an executor of an executor who has no real contact with the testator.

      <P>I think this is a sensible amendment.  I thought for a moment that the Minister would not make a case for it but he did in his last remarks.  As the Minister and Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> pointed out, the existing position is that you might have a person who willy-nilly has to act as personal representative in a case in which he does not want to act and in which he has no interest whatsoever. It is much more realistic in these circumstances to have the chain of the executorship broken and to require a new grant to be taken out by a person who will have some interest in the administration.</P>
      <P>I feel tempted at this stage to comment on whether we will ever have an end to the modifications which are being proposed by the Government of this Bill.  At this late stage there are more Government amendments coming in and I think one was circulated yesterday.</P>

      <P>There are a few points on section 3 which I should like the Minister to explain.  I notice that the definition of &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; here has been altered from what appears in the 1964 Bill.  Here the &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; means &ldquo;a grantee, lessee, assignee, mortgagee, chargeant or other person who in good faith acquires an estate or interest in property for valuable consideration;&rdquo;.  In the previous Bill instead of &ldquo;valuable consideration&rdquo;, it was stated to be for money or money's worth.

      <P>an estate or interest vested on any trust in any deceased person solely shall be deemed not to be an estate or interest to which that person was entitled at the time of his death;</P>

      <P>I wonder has the Minister given further consideration to this section?  There is no controversy involved here.  It is a question of trying to get the greatest degree of certainty we can.  The Minister is attempting to improve the position by providing that where &ldquo;two or more persons have died in circumstances rendering it uncertain which of them survived the other or others, then, for the purposes of the distribution of the estate of any of them, they shall all be deemed to have died simultaneously.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I raised the question on the Second Reading as to what the position was if a husband and wife who had no children, and had made mutual wills, were both killed in a car crash, or a <Col N="1246" /> plane crash, or some other tragedy of that sort.  Which will would be administered first, or would either will be administered first?  If a husband makes a will leaving everything to his wife but back to his own side of the family should she pre-decease him, and she does likewise, and if they are both regarded as having died simultaneously, what happens?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that solicitors and others who make wills will in the future insert a phrase that if the wife dies simultaneously with him, the husband leaves his property to someone else.  In that way the testator will avoid intestacy.  As I understand this section, it is simply putting <Col N="1247" /> into legislative form the practice of the Estate Duty Office that in assessing liability for duty, they assume that the parties died simultaneously wherever there is uncertainty.  In some other countries the assumption is to the contrary. They tend to accept that the wife survived the husband because of the assumption that women have greater powers of endurance than men.</P>

      <P>I told the Minister earlier I would repeat a question on this section.  I do not raise this simply as an academic debating point.  It is a point which occurred to me and others on Second Reading, one on which professional colleagues have written to me since the Bill was published.  It concerns the position of a testator who has made what is now a perfectly sound, good, valid will and who becomes incapacitated and unable to alter his will to comply with the legal right provisions and other provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The testator might become incapacitated mentally or physically and cannot, through no fault of his own, take any steps to comply with the provisions which the legislature is now forcing on him.  I want to know if such a will complies with this Act. If, for example, the will does not make adequate provision for one-third to the widow to discharge the legal right obligation, it seems to me that will must now become partially in-operative and that to that extent we are legislating retrospectively to upset a will which at the time it was made was perfectly all right under our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the testator had the mental capacity to make a will, the one-third or one-half would apply when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But he would have the problem of seeing to it himself. <Col N="1250" /> Take the position of the father of a family, leaving a farm or business to one of the children.  That will is made with the knowledge and approval of the wife and, in the knowledge that the will is to be made, a particular son stays at home and works the farm. Then the owner becomes incapacitated. The position then is that because of the will, the son has acted on the assumption he will get the farm and the wife at the time, in discussions between them, has consented.  Now, because of incapacity, the testator has no opportunity of revising his will. Consequently, even though at the time it was made everyone realised the will was leaving the estate to the son, now the widow will get the legal right one-third.  There is no opportunity, because of incapacity, for the husband to discuss matters to make a settlement and get the wife's consent to agree.  In such circumstances it is rather difficult, through this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point which was raised in the memorandum sent by the Bar Council to the Minister, arising out of this section and in particular out of subsection (2) of section 9.  This provides that nothing in the Act &ldquo;shall affect any duty payable in respect of real estate or impose on real estate any other duty than is payable in respect thereof immediately before the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;  It was suggested that under this Bill real estate <Col N="1251" /> and personal estate have become similar, indeed have become identical in so far as vesting in a personal representative following on the Administration of Estates Act, 1959.  If the personal representative is selling personal estate, the purchaser need not, and should not, inquire as to whether death duties have been paid or not. The purchaser is entitled to purchase. That did not exist before 1959 and does not exist in relation to real estate sold by a personal representative except in certain circumstances.  Where real estate and personal estate are being assimilated, there would not seem to be any logical reason for continuing this, and real estate and personal estate should be in the same position.  Perhaps the Minister would clear that up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that any change in respect of duty payable in regard to real estate, or any other change in any other section in regard to financial matters, is a matter for the Finance Bill and I have to assure the Revenue Commissioners that there is nothing here that would affect any payment in regard to real estate.</P>

      <P>I thought the resolution which was discussed earlier would have been more appropriate to the Finance Bill than to this Bill. However, we have this problem arising in this Bill and it could not arise in a Finance Bill because here, following the principle laid down in the Act of 1959 real estate and personal estate are now by this Bill being assimilated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position and between 1959 and now, the position was that a purchaser from a personal representative of a leasehold property or personal estate did not have to bother whether the death duties were paid or not but he had to bother about real estate.  When real estate and personal estate are assimilated, then logically the purchaser of real estate should not have to inquire.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave as the explanation of that, and it is an explanation I accepted&mdash;it is a sensible provision&mdash; that property should not be without ownership for a time and that it should be vested in someone.  The point on which I want clarification is: what is the position if the President of the High Court dies and there is no President of the High Court for a period, because the office is not a continuous one.  It is not a case of &ldquo;The President is dead: long live the President.&rdquo; There will be a period between the death of one President and the appointment of another.  It does seem to me that in that interim period, and in the circumstance indicated in section 13, there would be a period during which the ownership of the property would be vested in no one.</P>

      <P>This is only a small drafting point which I should like the Minister to consider.  It seems to me that in section 17 he is providing for cases in which the rights of an executor shall wholly cease but in the next subsection, he provides a case of withdrawal where a person has renounced and then withdraws his renunciation so that it occurs to me on section 17, one of the classes of cases where the rights of an executor are expressed to cease wholly are cases where an executor renounces probate.  But obviously they cannot wholly cease if he has rights under the next section to withdraw his renunciation. I suggest it should read ... &ldquo;his right to executorship shall, subject to section 18, wholly cease.&rdquo;</P>

They cannot revive if they have wholly ceased.  It is not a vital point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I appreciate that section 20 is a re-statement of the existing law but in this particular matter the existing law always appeared to me to be unsatisfactory. At present a man may appoint three executors of his will and one of them may extract probate, reserving the right of the other two. Notwithstanding the fact that discretion may have been by law conferred on executors, the proving executor can proceed to exercise that discretion under the will without any reference at all to and even without the knowledge of the reserving executors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is nothing new; it has always been the law, but I think it is unsatisfactory.  At least the executors whose rights have been reserved should <Col N="1258" /> have notice that they are executors.  As the law stands, it is quite possible, say, in the case of three executors appointed by the testator, that the will is in the custody of one of them.  That executor can, without reference to the other two executors or without giving them an opportunity of proving the will, prove the will himself and proceed to distribute the estate and make decisions.  That is the law as it stands. I think when we are reforming we should have a little reform here.  It says:</P>
    <P>... all the powers which are by this Act or otherwise by law conferred on the personal representative may be exercised by the proving executor or executors or the survivor or survivors of them and shall be as effectual as if all the persons named as executors had concurred therein.</P>
    <P>I think we should add: Before probate is granted, notice shall be served on the executor or executors whose rights are being reserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into this, but at the same time I think the arguments in favour of retaining the existing practice under the law are very strong.  In practice, what happens is that one of the executors takes an interest in proving the will and administering the estate.  The others do not bother; they may have gone away and cannot be found.  It is a practical thing to allow the executor who gets on with the job to do it.</P>

Take the example of the solicitor who makes a will and it is put in his safe and there are three executors appointed and, say, the solicitor is one of them and maybe his clerk is one of them.  He could go ahead, as the law stands, and take out probate without even acquainting the other two executors who may not even know that they have been appointed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to raise another point on this section.  This is a section which protects personal representatives under grants of administration which have been revoked and the second part of subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>and the personal representative who acted under the revoked representation may retain and reimburse himself in respect of any payments or dispositions made by him which the person to whom representation is afterwards granted might have properly made.</P>
      <P>That obviously refers to payment of debts and things like that but I have in mind an innocent executor who in a <i>bona fide</i> manner and without any knowledge that there is anything wrong, extracts a grant of probate and proceeds innocently and in the best of faith a certain distance with the administration of the estate and pays out some legacies, again innocently and in all good faith, and then somebody comes in and has the probate revoked on the grounds that the will is bogus or something.  Is the executor who acted innocently and in good faith liable for the legacies which he paid?  I think he is because certainly this subsection does not protect him.</P>

      <Col N="1261" /> and the personal representative who acted under the revoked representation may retain and reimburse himself in respect of any payments or dispositions made by him which the person to whom representation is afterwards granted might have properly made.</P>
    <P>In my case you have a person taking out probate of a will.  He is entitled to pay legacies directed by that will but if that will is revoked and declared to be void, a person who takes out a grant of administration intestate afterwards surely would not be entitled to pay legacies under the revoked or condemned will?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to use section 29, if I may, for the purpose of asking the Minister to do something about the outmoded forms that are still in use in connection with applications for probate and administration. This point was raised under the earlier Bill by Deputy Seán Flanagan and I agreed with him on that occasion.  The Minister should endeavour, when this mood of reform is on him, to bring the forms that are in use up to date.  The Minister probably knows that when an application is made, for example, for a grant of probate it is necessary for the applicant to make what is known as an oath of executor.  He might possibly have to file an affidavit as an attesting witness in connection with the will.  In both of these forms, I think I am correct in saying reference is made to the will being annexed to the affidavit but in point of fact and in point of practice the deponent is not allowed to annex the will to the affidavit; and if he does annex the will to the affidavit, he must then file another affidavit to explain why he annexed it and how the pin marks or staple marks appeared on the will.</P>
      <P>It does seem ridiculous that people must use these outmoded forms when the thing could be revised and brought up to date very easily.  Instead of saying &ldquo;the will annexed hereto&rdquo;, it should be possible to refer to the will being produced to the commissioner for oaths at the time the oath of executor is sworn.  These are very frustrating matters and it is very difficult, if not impossible, for a solicitor to explain to a person who is required to take an oath before a commissioner for oaths that while he is swearing in this document that that document is annexed to it, in fact he is not allowed annex it and that if he does annex it, he must make another affidavit to explain why he did it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Perhaps the Minister would give me the benefit of his advice on this.  It says:</P>
      <P>Where the personal representatives have given such notices to creditors and others to send in their claims against the estate of the deceased as, in the opinion of the court in which the personal representatives are sought to be charged ...</P>
      <P>The old rule on equity, and the well established rule in administering estates, is that the acceptable notice is a notice published three times in a newspaper and once in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

      <P>The Minister says it is preferable to deal with this by way of the rules.  The Minister may not know that there are many rules which it is very difficult to find and very difficult to locate.  It would be much better to put a simple provision as to what statutory notice should be given <Col N="1271" /> for the purpose of providing this necessary protection.  This statute will be the principal instrument in a few years and surely it would be a simple matter now to make provision here. There is plenty of precedents in earlier Acts passed by the Oireachtas requiring notice to be published in the newspapers. We should, I think, do the same thing here.</P>

      <P>There is just a small point here in relation to subsection (5).  This deals with the question of an assent by executors and subsection (5) provides:</P>
      <P>An assent not in writing shall not be effectual to pass any estate or interest in land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> Generally speaking, I can see the sense &mdash;it is there already since the 1959 Act, I think&mdash;of cutting out the idea of implied assent, but there are cases, which occur frequently enough, where the personal representative and the beneficiary are one and the same person. I am thinking of the case where the husband dies and leaves everything to his wife.  The estate may include a business or house property.  In such a case, where the executor beneficiary takes possession and ultimately has to deal with the title, it seems to me there could reasonably be an implied assent.</P>
