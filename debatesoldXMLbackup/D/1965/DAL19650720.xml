    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been seven meetings since November, 1964, of groups of officials from both sides for discussions on Anglo-Irish trading arrangements.  As stated by me in the Dáil on the 13th July, 1965, a fair amount of progress has been made in the discussions and I shall lead an Irish delegation for further talks at Ministerial level in London later this month.  Deputies will appreciate that it would be premature <Col N="1582" /> to give a detailed statement at the present juncture.</P>

      <P>The main construction work in the Garden of Remembrance has been completed except for the improvement of the approach along the eastern side of Parnell Square which is at present in hands and which it is expected will be completed in the Autumn.</P>
      <P>Apart from some difficulties which were encountered in obtaining supplies of dressed stone progress with the scheme has been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Excluding the memorial sculpture, a design for which has still to be decided on, the estimated cost of the scheme is £166,000.</P>
      <P>Pending the provision of the central sculptural feature, which must of necessity take a considerable time even if a suitable design were immediately available it has been decided, as a temporary measure, that a fountain in the form of a tall jet should be installed on the site of the feature. Arrangements for the execution of this work are in train and it will it is hoped be completed in the next few months.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in <Col N="1584" /> my introductory statement on the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings last month, the memorial to Thomas Davis will be erected in College Green inside the next 12 months.  The plaster model of the statue is at present being cast in bronze.  The statue will be erected on a paved platform measuring about 55 feet by 18 feet, 9 inches high which will also contain a circular pool embellished with bronze reliefs depicting Young Ireland.  The contract for the architectural work has been placed and the contractor has in hands the preparation of the stonework prior to making a start on the site.</P>
      <P>A project of this nature cannot be hurried and progress with it is in fact quite satisfactory.  The estimated cost of the entire scheme is £15,000.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware. The Special Employment Schemes Office sanction grants, in approved cases, for minor marine works recommended to them by the Department of Agriculture.  They have, in fact, recently sanctioned a grant for improvement works at Dolan's Pier, Aillebrack and arrangements have been made to start the work.  They have no other cases before them at present for West Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards local authority house-purchase loans, amending regulations were made on the 28th June bringing into operation the increased loan limits announced by me on the 15th June.  The new income limit announced at the same time, which is fixed administratively, was officially notified to the housing authorities on the 18th June.</P>
      <P>Provision for the revised income limit for supplementary new house grants in incorporated in the Housing Bill which is at present before this House.  It is proposed in the Bill to enable the new limit to be operated as from 1st July, 1965.  It will be a matter for each housing authority to decide to what extent and from what date they will operate the new limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether in fact he has made an order, or is he in a position to make an order, in relation to the upper limit of income for eligibility purposes?  I have a copy of the order in relation to the upper limit in respect of loans, but I was not aware that he had made an order in respect of income limits. Can the Minister by order increase income limits?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>May I further ask the Minister if allowances for dependants can be taken into consideration in the same way administratively, or can it be done by Ministerial order, or must we await the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the first part of the question relating to loans.  I think the matter which the Deputy is now inquiring about is the provision in the Housing Bill whereby the limit to qualify for supplementary grants has gone up from £832 to £1,045, plus £100 for each dependant, up to an additional £400.  That is before the House now in the Bill.  So far as the operation of the scheme under these new terms is concerned, it is proposed to make it permissible for the councils to operate it as from first of July last.  All of the income limits, including dependants' allowances, will be taken into account if the local authorities think fit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 47, after &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;landlord or immediate lessor&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down purely for the purpose of ensuring that we would get on the record the explanation that the Minister was good enough to send to me privately.  I understand from the Minister that the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; covers everything that section 6 of the Finance Act, 1928, covered having regard to the proviso contained in section 162(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, which is now being inserted in subsection (4) of section 3 of this Bill.  The section in question empowered the collector of taxes to recover tax charged on property by distress either on the goods of the person chargeable or on the property assessed.  The proviso ensures that where there has been a sale of the property for valuable consideration, the pre-sale liability of the vendor under Schedules A and B cannot be recovered after the sale by a distress on the property if the vendor is no <Col N="1594" /> longer in occupation.  In effect, the Minister says the property will, by virtue of the proviso, enjoy the same immunity from distress under section 162 as if the purchaser had been provided with a certificate under section 6 of the 1928 Act.  It is not necessary therefore, the Minister tells me, to include in the proviso reference to the landlord or immediate lessor.  I am perfectly happy to accept the Minister's explanation, and to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, shall be amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(10)  No direction shall be given under this section in respect of any accounting period after 6 years have expired from the date of the submission of the accounts of the company to the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the discussion with the Minister on Committee Stage, and to come back to the suggestions then made.  On Committee Stage, I moved an amendment suggesting that a direction should not be given once, say, a period of one year had expired. The Minister made the case that the effect of that would be to negative entirely the effect of the section itself in the Finance Act of 1922 and suggested that a period of three years was normal.  I have doubled the period of three years and made it six, and I want to urge on the Minister very strongly either to accept this amendment in its present form, or to give a categoric assurance administratively that the period will not be exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion the Minister indicated that his information was that the period of 20 years which I mentioned <Col N="1595" /> was utterly fanciful.  I have since taken the opportunity of verifying with certain accountants and I have received categoric assurance from an accountant of repute, well known to the Minister as he is to me, that there is on his desk at the moment a case in which the Revenue Commissioners are seeking by means of telephone communication to go back, under section 21, for a period of 20 years.  I want to suggest that is an entirely wrong approach.  I want to suggest also, as I suggested on the last occasion, that the method of telephonic communication under which, for the purpose of bluff&mdash;not to use any stronger word as I used on the last occasion&mdash;a certain company should be asked to pay £X in additional tax, and then an immediate drop, so to speak, in the Revenue demand to half of £X when it is challenged, is wrong.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that there used to be in the back duty investigation section of the Revenue Commissioners, and indeed in every section of the Revenue Commissioners, a clear and explicit view and understanding that the Revenue Commissioners demanded the tax which they believed was due by the taxpayer and that there was no question whatever of demanding more than they thought was due and in opening their mouth too wide, so to speak, at the beginning, laying the foundation for a settlement at a lower figure.  That is not the way tax legislation should be implemented.  The position should undoubtedly be that the taxpayer should be asked, and should be directed, to pay the sum that is legally and properly due, and there should be no question of a demand being made for more than is due, so that the taxpayer, out of a feeling of fear, will cough up something perhaps more than he might have coughed up if an excessive demand had not been made in the initial instance.</P>
    <P>I want to say that having discussed this matter with accountants, it is not a matter of which solicitors have direct cognisance&mdash;since the last Stage of the Bill, I am assured that everything <Col N="1596" /> I said on that occasion can be proved, and proved to the hilt, and that recently a new practice has grown up of endeavouring to frighten taxpayers into making some payment by demanding, at the initial stages, an outrageously excessive one; by suggesting, for example, in the cases I have mentioned, that the Revenue Commissioners proposed to go back for 20 years over a company's profits for the purpose of making a direction under section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922.  It is wrong; it is amoral; and it is extremely bad administration.  It is not likely to provide that certainty in the commercial community which is an essential pre-requisite of proper commercial development.  If companies cannot possibly tell where they stand for a period as long as 20 years, then how can they possibly make any plans in relation to their capital programme, to their capital expansion, to their capital development?</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I think, precluded by the terms of the statute from applying to the Revenue Commissioners for cases under name.  I am told, however, that I will be given the reference numbers of the cases concerned without being told the names of the people in question and that, on those reference numbers, the Minister can, without breaking the secrecy that is properly imposed on the Revenue Commissioners, verify whether or not what I have said is true, that, as I say, this practice has now become widespread &mdash;only recently become widespread. In fact, one accountant whom I met last week quite casually mentioned the matter to me.  He said: &ldquo;I heard that you raised in the Dáil the question of a direction going back for 20 years and that the Minister said that that did not happen.  I can assure you that I have a case on my table where it has happened and I will give you the reference number of that case if you want it at any time without disclosing the name of the client.&rdquo; It is because I met that accountant last week and because I got that categoric assurance from a second source, with the assertions I made here on Committee Stage, that I decided to put down this amendment today for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> It seems to me that there must be some method of arriving at administrative certainty, that a taxpayer can know, within a period of at least six years from getting his accounts, whether or not those accounts are completely acceptable.  They should be done in a period of two years&mdash;really, within a period of one year, but I will accept a period of two years.  Certainly, a period of six years is more than ample for anybody to deal with accounts and to see the pattern, and I would strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure that companies making profits will be taxed on the profits or will use their profits for the development of their businesses and expanding employment and trade.  It would be wrong to accept a specific minimum number of years beyond which the Revenue Commissioners may not go back.  It happens that companies, having made profits, do not distribute them.  If they distribute profits then, of course, they come into assessment for tax purposes.  However, if a company does not distribute profits on the ground that they propose to use them for the benefit of the business, for the purpose of expansion, and if, for one reason or another, they neglect to carry out that expansion or neglect to develop the business for the purposes for which they held back the <Col N="1598" /> profits, then it is not unreasonable for the Revenue Commissioners to ask them what they propose to do with those undistributed profits.</P>
      <P>If there were a time limit of three years or six years beyond which a direction may not be made, then it would be possible for a company to (1) refrain from distributing its profits so that they would become taxable on distribution or (2) to hold on to those undistributed profits up to a point beyond which a direction cannot be given and then those profits would be free of tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have prefaced my remarks: it is only for surtax. With regard to the point as to uncertainty as to what liability they will owe to the Revenue Commissioners ultimately, I am assured that in the case of any company who, for one reason or another, are precluded from carrying out the development for which they have held back those profits, the Revenue Commissioners are quite prepared to discuss the plans and proposals of that company and to do so in a reasonable way and to give the company every chance in case there is some factor which causes a delay to carry out the development they envisaged.  They can, of course, inquire into the method which is used, according to Deputy Sweetman, and which I accept, if he says it is so, of phone calls <i>in terrorem.</i> I think that should not be the case.  If it is, I shall investigate it and ask the Revenue Commissioners to go about making those directions in a proper and a better way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that by fixing a specific time, it would enable the company that would be, let us say, not frank&mdash;without using any stronger term&mdash;to withhold distribution of profits, not intended for use in the proper development of the company in such a way as would ultimately, after that period had elapsed, they would avoid payment of surtax.  I again want to assure Deputy Sweetman and any company who feels it is under a disadvantage by reason <Col N="1599" /> of there not being a maximum period, that if they consult with the Revenue Commissioners in this respect they will find them absolutely reasonable as to how those unused profits may be disposed of and how they become liable to tax.</P>

I appreciate the Minister's intention to investigate.  If his investigation does not provide the correct result, I shall have another opportunity of raising the matter with him.

      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 39 to 51 and substitute as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purpose of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a company shall be deemed to be under the control of not more than five persons if any five or fewer persons together exercise, or are able to exercise, or are entitled to acquire, control, whether direct or indirect, of the company and for this purpose persons who are relatives of one another, persons who are nominees of any other person together with that other person, persons in partnership and persons interested in any shares or obligations of the company which are subject to any trust or are part of the estate of a deceased person shall respectively be treated as a single person, and</P>
      <P>(b)  a company which is controlled by any one or more of the deceased and relatives of the deceased shall be regarded as being itself a relative of the deceased.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This follows from the previous amendment. It deletes the subsection and subparagraphs that appeared originally and substitutes this form which is consistent with what we have been just discussing.</P>

      <P>In page 15, lines 44 to 46, to delete &ldquo;or, if shorter, the period from the commencement of the receipt by the deceased of any such income or benefits to the date of his death&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Sweetman made a suggestion that the period to be taken into account here might be, in the case of a company which was not incorporated within the five year period, from the date of the incorporation of the company.  I think Deputy Sweetman had in mind subsection (3) rather than subsection (4).  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that income from a fund of this nature for the purposes of death duties will be averaged over a period of five years. In fact, that income might have been received in a period of only three years.  I think that the longer spread will give more relief to the taxpayer than was the case in the Bill as it stood.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 25, after &ldquo;determined&rdquo; to add:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided however that the value of preference shares which carry no voting rights or which only carry voting rights when the dividend is in arrear shall be the market value thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion on Committee Stage, I moved an amendment in respect of this matter&mdash;amendment No. <Col N="1602" /> 17&mdash;and I suggested that capitalisation value was the proper value for the preference shares.  On this occasion I have switched that to market value because some of the Minister's comments appeared to me to be more relevant to market value rather than to capitalisation value.  The Minister made his main objection to the section on the fact that a disponer might create a company and give to that company certain preference shares carrying a very low rate of interest and that on that account the value of those shares might be artificially low, even though he was getting a very substantial amount out of the company.</P>
    <P>I pointed out then, and I want to point out now, that what the person concerned would be getting out of that company would be the interest on the preference shares and nothing else as far as this sector is concerned.  Of course, the person concerned might be getting, as governing or other director, other income out of the company, but the Minister has already caught that in another subsection.  I should be glad if the Minister would confirm that the value of the income the person concerned would be getting as a governing director would be, so to speak, treated and assessed as a slice of the capital value of the slice of the income of the company.  If I am correct in that, it seems to me there is absolutely no reason why the amendment, or at least the intention of the amendment, should not be accepted. It is accepted by the Minister that this section does not apply to non-trading companies only, that it applies in addition to trading companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>That was in reference to subsection (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the similar amendment, No. 17, which was providing that preference shares would be valued on a capitalised value whereas now I am moving exactly the same thing but on a market value.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, in the course of Committee Stage we have changed the numbering of some sections by extra sections being put in and as a consequence, it is not always terribly easy to follow where we are but I think the Minister will see that amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage was in subsection (5), page 16, line 23, to add the proviso, and it is in the same one now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree that the spread of the section varies according to whether it is a non-trading company alone or all companies in general which are caught by this section, the Minister must agree that there is this pretty regular pattern in our ordinary everyday life, that is, that a company is formed by a man to carry on his business or perhaps to be a holding company for the various subsidiary manufacturing companies that there may be, in that company perhaps two sons are given the ordinary shares which have all the voting rights and the daughters are given the preference shares that have no voting rights whatever. If that is so, it seems utterly wrong to value the daughters' shares on the basis that they have the voting rights that control would give them.  So long as they have preference shares with no <Col N="1604" /> voting rights, they have no right to turn the company into liquidation and if they have no right to turn the company into liquidation, the only asset they have is the preference share with the right to receive a preference dividend. To suggest that, when they cannot turn the company into liquidation, their shares should for the purpose of death duty be valued as if they had an immediate right to receive a distribution on a liquidation is to me to ensure that those daughters' shares will undoubtedly be taxed on a value they could never in any circumstances approach.  That is unfair.</P>
    <P>When one looks at it, on the face of it, in that way, it is another example of the pattern that runs through this part of the Bill, that in an effort to catch the person who is trying to avoid paying his fair share, the Minister is hitting the innocent as well as the guilty.</P>
    <P>That is the whole basis of the argument that we have put from this side of the House again and again in relation to what was section 18 and which is now section 20 in the Bill in relation to death duties.  The same idea also permeates through other parts of the Bill which we will be discussing later on.</P>
    <P>It must be possible to provide a method whereby the person who is trying to avoid paying his fair share will be caught and at the same time the innocent person will not be hit. There is no doubt whatever of the effect of this section as it now stands in the case that I gave, which is pretty regular.  I am sure the Minister when he was practising at the Bar met the case often enough, as I meet it often enough in my profession, where the sons are given control of the family company and the daughters are given shares in that company, preference shares usually, in respect of which they have no control and the only right that they have so long as the company continues to carry on is to get their preference dividend.  But, if the sons tried to liquidate the company then the daughters must come in for a share of the assets.  The reason that is put in is to ensure that the sons must, in protection of the daughters, carry the company on.  If the provision that the <Col N="1605" /> preference shareholders could share in the assets on a liquidation were not included, there would be nothing to prevent the sons concerned winding up the company, paying out preference dividends and paying off the preference shareholders perhaps at an inconvenient time or in a lesser amount. It is precisely to protect them that that provision is put in.  Yet, the Minister is deliberately designing by this section to go out and to collect from daughters in that position tax on a value of their preference shares that they could never possibly realise, simply and solely because he wants to hit another person in another way.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to approach this problem.  It could be met quite easily.  I do not say for one moment that the wording of the amendment I have suggested is foolproof.  I have made it quite clear on Committee Stage, and I think the Minister accepted, that in relation to these revenue taxation statutes it was virtually impossible to draft them in the exact way that the drafter of the original Act would require and that what was essential in amendments was to make the intention appear.  The intention does clearly appear in this amendment and I would urge the Minister to accept that intention and to deal with whatever is necessary in regard to the wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to criticise the wording of the amendment because, as Deputy Sweetman has said, the wording as it stands makes it quite clear what the amendment is intended to achieve.  To accept the amendment would strike at the very root of what the section is to achieve.  The essential point of subsection (5) is to look through the securities of a non-trading company to the real value of the assets in order to see what they are for the purpose of assessment of estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might take some examples to give an indication to the House of what is involved: subsection (5) relates to the value for death duty purposes of securities in a non-trading company such as a man might form solely for the purpose of taking over his house, his land, rents, stock exchange <Col N="1606" /> securities, cash and otherwise.  Under the law as it stands, the shares of this company for death duty purposes would have to be valued on a hypothetical open market basis.  Therefore, the value would be substantially less than the value of a proportionate part of the underlying assets.  The very purpose of subsection (5) is to get away from this hypothetical open market basis and to make the value of the shares for duty purpose equal to the proportionate part of the underlying assets.</P>
    <P>As a rule, these companies are merely fronts to conceal the real ownership of assets and I may say there is no question here of hitting the innocent as well as the guilty.  As I said, it is only for the purpose of getting at the real assets of a non-trading company.  Take an example of such a company: Suppose a man forms a company to take over securities of one kind or another which he owns to the value of £50,000 and that the capital of his company consists of 500 ordinary £1 shares carrying all the voting rights and 49,500 two per cent £1 preference shares.  Suppose he keeps 490 of the 500 ordinary shares and all the preference shares.  If the income from the underlying assets is, say, £4,000 per annum, of this the two per cent preference shares would absorb £990 per annum, thus leaving £3,010 for the ordinary shares.  The company could declare dividends of 600 per cent which would give the owner an income of £3,950, that is, £990 on the preference shares and the balance of £2,940 on the ordinary shares.  If the amendment were accepted, the 49,500 two per cent preference shares would have to be valued on the basis of what they would fetch hypothetically on the open market and the hypothetical open market value of these two per cent preference shares would not be more than, say, 4/- each.  This would give a total value of £9,900 for the preference shares and on a wind-up basis the value of the ordinary shares, which would rank after the preference shares, would be their par value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole case the Minister has been giving there is in support of an amendment such as mine against ordinary shares.  I am not attacking the Minister's method in regard to ordinary shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On a wind-up basis, I understand they would.  The effect would be that estate duty would be payable on a hypothetical value instead of on the real value.  The intention of the formation of these companies is, as a rule to transfer the assets from the owner in such a way as ultimately to avoid payment of death duties.  As I said at the beginning the acceptance of the amendment would strike at the very root of what the subsection is intended to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the calculations the Minister has just made.  He said that for the purpose of death duty the preference shares would be valued in relation to the rate of interest stipulated for them at about 4/-.  That might be so for death duty but surely not in winding up.  Half way through his calculations the Minister nimbly sprang from the basis of interest payable, that is, two per cent, to the market valuation of 4/- per £1 share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My example was on the basis of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister nimbly skipped from the death duty basis to the wind-up basis and said that on a wind-up basis, the ordinary shares would have to be valued at their par value.  We cannot deal with this on two separate bases.  If the estate is being valued for death duty purposes and the Minister takes, as I believe the Revenue Commissioners would take, the dividend yield as the yardstick by which to value the preference shares, they would certainly be entitled to have reference to the income for which <Col N="1608" /> the remaining ordinary shares were eligible or actually in receipt of for the purpose of their valuation, and it would simply mean that the ordinary shareholders of this holding company would bear the bulk of the burden of the appropriate rate of tax leviable, which would be related not to the face value of the shares but to the underlying assets.</P>
      <P>However, in the case mentioned by Deputy Sweetman where the daughters are given the preference shares and the sons are given the ordinary shares for the purpose of preserving continuity of operation and control, it would operate to say that the daughters' share of the total burden of death duties would be approximately one-third of the face value of their holding, whereas the Minister said 4/- would be the probable value, while the sons would bear not death duties at £500 but death duties on the value of the ordinary shares measured by the value of the underlying assets which they held and through which they exercised control over the company.  That may be good or it may be bad but let us at least understand what we are doing.  I respectfully submit to the Minister that in his exposé he has taken two different bases of procedure for the purpose of determining how preference shares and ordinary shares would be valued in the same holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the type of avoidance the Minister is trying to catch and I can equally see a perfectly simple method by which that avoidance can be blocked and yet how the case of the daughters will be preserved. To take the Minister's case, the underlying value of the assets was £50,000. There were 49,500 preference shares carrying two per cent which he was going to value at the market value of 4/-, and 500 ordinary shares which he was valuing at par because the underlying value of the assets was still £50,000 and on liquidation the par value of the preference shares can be deducted.  The avoidance could be quite simply prevented without any hardship to the daughters in the case I mentioned if in the circumstances the ordinary shares were to be valued at <Col N="1609" /> the underlying value of the assets which the section provides less the market value of the preference shares.  That would mean that Revenue would lose no duty and it would equally mean that the genuine case of the daughters to which I have referred would be completely protected.</P>
      <P>This is a perfectly simple amendment. I do not agree entirely with the view that the Minister has placed on it but I am going to give him all that for the sake of protecting the innocent case.  Let us look at the Minister's case.  I understood the Minister to say the man was possessed of all the preference shares and of 490 of the 500 ordinary shares. What would happen in the case in question?  The preference shares would be valued at 4/-.  I do not think the Minister is right in that valuation but again I will give him that.  A £1 preference share carrying two per cent would, on present figures, be worth more than 4/-, but I shall be glad to use the Minister's quotation when I am arguing with the Estate Duty Office in relation to the value of a preference share.  The preference shares in those circumstances would be value for one-fifth of £49,500, which is £9,900, calculating on my feet; my calculations are never all that good and certainly, to have to calculate when I am talking, is not fair.  That would leave, on that basis, the underlying value of the assets left as £40,100 and the Minister would get duty in respect of the ordinary shares of £490, five one-hundredths of £40,100.  That would get him of the duty bearing a value of £400 a one-fiftieth of the total amount&mdash;one-fiftieth of £50,000, or £1,000.  The estate would be valued £100 less than it would be in the Minister's way, which is not worth arguing about in an estate of £50,000, and it would undoubtedly save the genuine case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be done quite simply by a proviso added to my proviso that, where there were preference shares and where they fell to be valued at the market value, it is that market value which should be deducted from the asset value when determining the value of the ordinary shares for estate <Col N="1610" /> duty purposes.  Quite frankly, I accept and recognise&mdash;I know the methods by which avoidance can be carried out&mdash;the Minister's desire to stop these methods of avoidance.  I am not trying to amend the Bill in order to create loopholes or perpetuate existing loopholes.  I am trying to amend the Bill in order to make quite sure that the genuine case will not be hit.  I regret to say that I do not see any evidence in the Bill that the appropriate care has been taken by the Minister to ensure that the innocent are not hurt with the guilty.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of such an amendment as I have suggested would undoubtedly mean that the Minister's case would be covered and the Minister must be advised that it will completely cover the case he has made except to the extent not of £100 duty but of duty on £100 which, in a £50,000 estate, is 27 per cent; £270 is nothing and, for the sake of £270 in a £50,000 estate, the Minister is going to insist on the inclusion of a subsection which will mean genuine hardship in relation to a family concern in which there is a holding company and the business itself is carried on under several subsidiary companies.  It is not right that the Minister should do that and the Minister, in his cool, sober, normal human judgment, would not do it.  I suspect he is being pushed into it because he believes that there is more behind it than there really is.  The method I have suggested would cover the Minister's case beyond question and he should accept it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(9) The provisions applicable to quick succession relief shall apply to duty payable under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister suggested that a quick succession relief applied to property.  It does, of course, and I suggested to him on that occasion that what he was doing, in this section was getting back behind the value of the shares to the value of the property. <Col N="1611" /> The example the Minister gave on the previous amendment shows clearly that that is what the Minister has in his mind.  I accepted that, for the purposes of the section, to get at what he wants, he is right in getting to the underlying value of the property, but, if he is getting to the underlying value of the property in one respect, he should also take it in another.  What is sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander; the Minister is taking the value of the property for the purposes of estate duty but he is not giving the reliefs that would be applicable to the value of the property underlying the value of the shares.  If he is going to take it one way, he should also accept the other.  I cannot understand why he will not and I should be glad to hear his observations.</P>

      <P>The provisions the Deputy has in mind&mdash;I referred to this on Committee Stage&mdash;are those contained in section 15 of the Finance Act, 1914, which provides that where estate duty has become payable on any property consisting of land or business, not being a business carried on by a company, and subsequently, within five years, estate duty again becomes payable on the same property, or any part of it that passes on death, that is, on the death of the person to whom the property passed on the first death, the duty on the second death should be abated.  Apart from the fact that the 1914 Act expressly excludes a business carried on by a company, the business as such cannot pass and, therefore, I suggest that section 20 of the Bill does not apply for the kind of relief the Deputy suggests in his amendment.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to follow the record in this form.  While Deputy Cosgrave is trying to find the reference in the record, may I put this to the Minister?  Section 15 of the Finance Act of 1914 expressly excluded shares in a company because it was the value of the shares in the company that was to be valued under section 15 rather than the value of the property the company held.  Does the Minister not agree that is so?</P>

      <P>Now, is the Minister not deliberately going back on the basic consideration that was there when section 15 of the Finance Act, 1914, was passed?  He is now saying it is not to be the value of the shares in the company that is to be taken into consideration.  In other words, he is completely upsetting&mdash;I am not arguing about that&mdash;the whole basis of the Act of 1914 and once he is upsetting it for one reason, it is upset <Col N="1613" /> for others.  We had a discussion on Committee Stage where the Minister indicated that it could not happen but it can happen, as I stated.  There can be a second death in relation to these shares and one must go back to the value of the property and one would not take the value of the shares.  If the Minister can persuade me that we are not going to take the value of the property on the second death&mdash;but only on the second death&mdash;then I agree that there is no necessity for quick succession relief but as the section appears to me to be framed, there is the possibility I have suggested.</P>

      <P>In page 17, after line 63, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The spouse exemption given by section 14 of the Finance Act 1914 shall be applicable in respect of duty payable under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wrote the Minister a letter as I promised giving a hypothetical case where there would be duty under this section and if the Minister has no objection to my reading a copy of the letter I wrote so that it can be put on the records of the House, I shall do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the case.</P>
      <P>A settles £100,000 on discretionary trusts for his children; he himself is not an object of the discretion and he lives three (now five) years after the settlement.</P>
      <P>The trustees pay the income (I assume 6 per cent) as to half to son B, as to one sixth each to daughters C, D and E meaning therefore £3,000 and three sums of £1,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>B dies and your &ldquo;slice&rdquo; principle duty is payable on £50,000, equivalent at 27 per cent, leaving aside any question of aggregation, to £13,500.</P>
      <P>After B's death the trustees have a fund of £86,000 with income of £5,190 which they pay as to £2,190 to B's widow and as to £1,000 to each of the daughters as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> B's widow dies and on her death her slice of the fund is £36,500 being 2190/5190.  Half the whole fund has already borne estate duty on the death of B and so under the 1894 Act Section 5 (2) as I understand it, half of her slice will now be exempt, but the other half, that is to say £18,250 will be subject to duty and will not get the benefit of the spouse exemption.  That seems to me wrong. When you are making discretionary trusts bearing estate duty in the same way as a fixed trust (and I do not quarrel with you for so doing nor do I quarrel with the slice method, as I think it is fair), you should provide for a spouse exemption in the same way as in a fixed trust.</P>
    <P>I deliberately took the figure of £100,000, because it was by far the simplest one to work down the percentages all the way along but of course the amount of duty that would be payable until one got down to the exemption limit would be exactly the same lower down.  It seems to me that on the reading of the section as it is there is no doubt whatever that the second spouse to die is caught under the discretionary trust section the Minister is introducing and I think he will say that is wrong unless he can show me that it does not operate in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The section refers, as indicated on the side notes, to discretionary trusts and the purpose is to apply to such trusts the slice system of assessing death duties, in the same way as it would apply in the case of a mandatory trust.  To apply different methods of assessment in discretionary trusts and mandatory trusts would be inconsistent.  I must confess that I am not very familiar with methods of assessment of the slice system as I have not had any practical examples of it.</P>
      <P>Since Deputy Sweetman read his letter to me, perhaps I might be permitted to read some of the notes I sent to him in reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in Committee that the effect of section 21 is to place on the same level for all purposes of estate duty, including exemption, the interest measured by averaging the benefits over five years of beneficiaries under discretionary trusts and similar interests arising under mandatory trusts.  Thus if, under a discretionary trust, A is paid an annuity of £x for his lifetime and after his death his wife B is paid an annuity of similar amount for her lifetime the consequence will be the same, so far as Estate Duty is concerned, as if there were a mandatory trust to pay A £x per annum for his life and after his death to pay £x per annum to his wife for her life. In neither case would there be a complete exemption on the widow's death.  There is no identity between the &ldquo;slices&rdquo; of the trust fund representing the separate annuities; they do not constitute a property of which A and B are successive life tenants.</P>
      <P>The extent of the exemption in the case of a mandatory trust depends on whether the trust property as a whole passes on both deaths or whether it is deemed to pass to a limited extent only and this in turn depends on the terms of the trust.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I should go on with this, but perhaps I shall read the next part of it: If, under a mandatory trust, a trust fund if held upon trust for A for his lifetime and after his death for his wife B for her life, whether or not the property is subject to annuities for C, D and E, the property as a whole passes on both deaths; there is complete identity in the property of which each spouse was life tenant; and the &ldquo;spouse exemption&rdquo; will operate in full.  The annuities to C, D and E, if payable, are in the nature of charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, the mandatory trust is to pay the spouses successively annuities, whether these are expressed as sums of money or as shares of income, there is not an actual passing of the trust property on either death. Instead, the trust property is, by reason of the cesser of the respective interests, deemed to pass to the extent of the annuity &ldquo;slices&rdquo;.  In such a case there <Col N="1616" /> is no full exemption on the death of the surviving spouse.  There is only a partial exemption to the extent to which the &ldquo;slices&rdquo; overlap.</P>
    <P>In regard to the hypothetical case mentioned by Deputy Sweetman in the note he sent me, the comments made are based on the assumption that in all cases where spouses have successive interests for life under a mandatory trust, there would be complete exemption on the death of the survivor, but that assumption is not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that would not be the case.  However, if I may return to what I was saying: In the case of a discretionary trust, there would be complete exemption on the death of a surviving spouse if the trustees in fact paid the entire income to the spouses successively for their respective lives.  Again, in a case in which the settlor dies within five years of creating the trust, so that the entire trust property pays estate duty on his death, as a gift <i>inter vivos,</i> and his wife is an object of the trust, there would be complete exemption on the latter's death, that is, the wife's, whatever the extent of the limited interest ceasing on her death.  There is a lot in that which I must admit I do not fully grasp, not having had experience of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister admits, there is an overlapping on which on the death of the second spouse duty is exempted a second time. There is, as the Minister admits at the end of the note, the provision where the whole income is paid to one person and why should not the same operate where the income is split?  I suggest that the Minister is splitting hairs and that what operates in respect of where the whole income is paid first to one spouse and then to another, should equally apply; if half the fund is paid to a son and the other half to three daughters and then the half that was paid to the son is paid to his wife after his death, it should apply. It would not have been very difficult <Col N="1617" /> to draft a subsection that would have covered it.</P>
      <P>As I said in my letter, and repeat here, I do not quarrel with the &ldquo;slices&rdquo; method of attacking discretionary trusts.  It was obvious that there had to be a section at some time to ensure that discretionary trusts could not completely escape duty.  I accept that at once but I am against this extra burden.  What it is going to mean in effect now is, with consequent embarrassment for the Minister for Finance in other respects, a considerable urge to dis-saving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to consider further the points made by Deputy Sweetman. I do not know whether the Minister has received representations other than those made in this House but certainly one representative organisation has expressed concern about the effect of this proposal.  Although I have not got full details, one case was brought to our attention in which discretionary trusts were so concerned at the possible operation of this section that in one case in which quite a considerable estate was involved, property amounting to almost £250,000, the trustees have had a preliminary meeting and&mdash; in this case, a minor is involved&mdash;have expressed the view that until they see the legislation in its final form, they will not decide whether to retain the interest here or dispose of it altogether. This estate provides considerable employment and very great concern has been expressed by the trustees at the possibilities involved in this section and the effect of it on the estate.</P>
      <P>Between now and bringing the Bill to the Seanad, the Minister might well consider introducing an amendment comparable with the one suggested to ensure that there will be no actual loss from the point of view of the State because in the event of the disposal of a property, a company or an estate of that sort, in which discretionary trustees have been appointed, the advantage to the country of the desirability of retaining such an interest here does not require any emphasis. For these reasons the Minister should consider further this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to ask the Minister a question?  Am I correct in thinking that section 21 as it now is, formerly section 19, applies not only to what we commonly call discretionary trusts but also to all cases whereby under a will or otherwise, power of appointment is given to a class?  In such cases it is usual for the income to be applied for the benefit of minor children where, for example, they are entitled to the capital only contingently on their attaining the age of 21 years, but it is a regular practice that where children are carrying a contingent interest if they attain 21 years, the income can be expended for them, for their maintenance, education and benefit&mdash;that is the usual phrase, as the Chair no doubt is aware&mdash;before they are 21.  If I am right in thinking that this section now covers not merely discretionary trusts as we ordinarly understand them but also every trust where there is that contingent provision for a child on his attaining at 21, then the section would make very much wider changes in the law than many of us anticipate.</P>

      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 37 to 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a somewhat similar amendment on Committee Stage.  I do not think I made myself clear in regard to the case I was putting forward because the Minister's note to me on it appears to be addressed to something entirely different.  I am quite happy to say the fault was mine in not explaining myself clearly.  As I understand it&mdash;again, for the sake of example, I shall take a figure of £100,000 as being simpler than a percentage&mdash;if we have a case where the underlying value of the property is £100,000, the actuarial value of the tenant for life is £60,000 and the remainder man's actuarial value is £40,000, if the tenant for life buys out the remainder man, enlarges his interest, as it is technically known, then the amendment is designed to ensure that the whole £100,000 will carry duty on the death of the tenant <Col N="1620" /> for life and that the £40,000 that was paid will not be treated as being within the operation of section 7 (10) of the Finance Act, 1894.</P>
    <P>I can understand that case, but it is not the type of case I have been trying to preclude.  In the case I have mentioned, if the deceased had, again for the sake of example, free estate of £40,000, then, in order to pay the reversioner his £40,000, he would have to sell the free estate.  He had no free estate left and he would have to pay duty on £100,000, which is quite proper.</P>
    <P>If on the other hand, he had no free estate of his own, if he had to borrow the £40,000, having borrowed it, he would have paid it out and on his death he would have only £60,000. Why, if he had only £60,000, should he pay duty on £100,000?  It is as simple as that.  It seems to me quite clear that it is proper for the section to operate so as to provide that the sum of money paid by the tenant for life to the remainder man was not the proceeds of the sale of the trust.  I do not want to provide that.  I want to provide that if a person has <i>bona fide</i> raised the money to pay the amount of the actuarial claim, in so doing it can be taken as a proper deduction just as it could be taken as a proper deduction if the person concerned had sold his free estate to make it go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Deputy Sweetman's amendment is to make section 7 (10) of the 1894 Finance Act operate in a case like this where the tenant for life buys out the remainder man.  If that never happened, if we take the case of £100,000 value on the property concerned, the estate duty would be based on the £100,000, whereas if he bought out the remainder man's interest he would reduce the estate for estate duty purposes by the amount he paid.  The exclusion of the words proposed by Deputy Sweetman would operate to defeat the purpose of the section and I am afraid there is not a good case for doing that.</P>

      <P>I came across a deal in the course of my practice in which I found myself specifically referred to in a legal arrangement in which I had no interest.  It was to the effect that a certain estate was to continue and pass from one person to another as long as I live.  Apparently the solicitor concerned thought I was reasonably healthy and had a fairly long expectation of life.  That was before I came into politics.</P>

      <P>Apparently they look around to see if they know a reasonably healthy person, a person who is likely to stay in the country, whose death they will become aware of and that will finish the trust fund.  I had no interest in the moneys involved. When I died, if it were not for the exclusion in the 1894 Act, the property involved in that settlement would be aggregated with whatever property I had and death duties would be charged on it.</P>
      <P>I had no knowledge of or interest in this legal arrangement.  Therefore I have obviously no interest in the property and am getting no profits from it.  Apparently a device was adopted many years ago, and probably is still there, that certain trusts will be created for the life of the descendants of some dynasty and the descendants of that dynasty will have no beneficial interest in the property.  The 1894 Act, because of that, provides that such property shall not be aggregated with other property passing on the death.</P>
      <P>In the course of time, because of that, people were able to provide non-aggregable benefits for their descendants. In other words out of my own property I could provide a benefit which was to accrue to my wife when I died and which was property in which I never had an interest so that the benefit would not be aggregated with the rest of my estate for assessment for death duty purposes when I died.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, people do that frequently. In the case of superannuation schemes where there are contributions the benefits arising on the death of the person making the contributions are liable to duty but may not be aggregable with the deceased person's free property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of non-contributory schemes, these benefits are not deemed to be provided by the deceased person. <Col N="1625" /> Property in which the deceased has no interest and which therefore is not aggregable also includes insurance policies.  We will probably be referring to these later.</P>
    <P>As the section was originally drafted, it appeared that the only purpose was to catch, for the first time, death benefits arising as a result of superannuation schemes.  That was not so. As I said, they already are liable under the contributory schemes but not under the non-contributory schemes. The section, as redrafted, will make that quite clear.  There is nothing new as far as contributory schemes are concerned.  They were always liable for estate duty purposes.</P>
    <P>There are many other forms of payment by persons, wealthy and otherwise, but the most obvious one, and the one that is principally being caught here, is the case of a company controlled by a man where the company makes provision for the man's dependants. They are not giving that particular man whatever he might otherwise earn from the company but they are putting it by.  In present circumstances, that would escape assessment for death duty.</P>
    <P>As I said, one of the purposes of the section is to catch these latter benefits. I would like to say also that I am bringing in for those death benefits that were previously subject to estate duty the relief which is being applied to the non-contributory ones not exceeding £5,000.  If these benefits are valued for £5,000 or less then they will not be taken into account at all. It is generally agreed that most sums arising on death as a result of superannuation schemes, hardly reach £5,000 at all.  At least there are very few of them.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to general statements made during Committee Stage to the effect that there was one class that would seem to be relieved of the obligation of having these benefits liable to duty. Civil Servants, in fact, are in that class.  I should say that in order to be subject to duty, the person entitled to the death benefit <Col N="1626" /> must have an absolute or enforceable entitlement.  At present, a civil servant has not got that absolute and enforceable right to pension, nor has the widow or dependants an absolute and enforceable right to the lump sum accruing on his death before he reaches retirement age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish the other point.  In effect, the death benefit to the dependants of a civil servant who dies before attaining retirement age is in the nature of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment and to bring civil servants within the scope of the Bill would catch these <i>ex gratia</i> payments, because it would <Col N="1627" /> be almost impossible to exclude them. That would be taking <i>ex gratia</i> payments paid after death.  Civil service gratuities fall into the category of <i>ex gratia</i> payments because civil servants have never had enforceable rights under the Superannuation Acts. Payments under those Acts are permissive, and civil servants have not been granted a legal enforceable right to them.  If the section did apply to civil servants, the £5,000 provided in the section would be high enough to exclude the vast majority of such gratuities from estate duty charges.  I propose to examine the question of bringing civil servants' death gratuities within the scope of the section by an appropriate alteration of the superannuation code, or otherwise as I may be advised.  I assure the House that this matter will have my early attention, but it is not appropriate to bring it into the current Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move my amendment to amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>To add to the definition of &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or who was then permanently disabled from earning his own living.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend still further the definition of &ldquo;dependent child.&rdquo; As the House is aware, the Minister's amendment contains a definition of a &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; which is a child, including a child adopted under the provisions of the Adoption Acts who had not attained the age of 16 years at the date of the death of the deceased or who was then receiving full time instruction at any university college, school or other educational establishment. The purpose of the amendment is further to extend the terms of that definition to include a child who might be over the age of 16 years but who was then permanently disabled from earning his own living.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Deputies are familiar with many cases of children who had passed the age of 16 years and who might have reached the adult stage who were permanently disabled by one form of personal disability or another.  In some cases it may be due to an accident, and in other cases it might possibly be the result of polio in their childhood, or they may have some disability which will affect them, in many cases, unfortunately for life. I feel this definition should be extended to cover those cases.  In fact, this aspect of the matter was brought to our attention by a number of representative organisations who expressed the view that the number of cases concerned, while not very large, in many cases involved hardship not only for the individual, but also for his or her family.  They felt they had an obligation and a responsibility to ensure that adequate provision was made for them because of the disability.  Consequently, they had, in many cases, to take exceptional steps to see that a person so affected would be adequately and properly provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, to some extent, improves the original section which the <Col N="1630" /> Minister in Committee undertook to re-examine; but I think it is still open to the objection that for the first time it aggregates this type of superannuation benefits with the free estate.  Considerable discussion took place here on Committee Stage.  During the course of that discussion, reference was made to the social advantages of superannuation schemes and to the fact that not merely were these schemes financially beneficial to the persons concerned but that there was a distinct social advantage involved in encouraging schemes of that sort.</P>
    <P>Up to comparatively recent years the number of firms which operated these schemes were regarded as being in the forefront of progressive social thought&mdash;firms which had undertaken responsibilities in encouraging and facilitating the operation of schemes for their employees.  Nowadays, with the considerable extension and growth in the social welfare code, while this need may not arise nevertheless for certain categories of workers or employees, it takes the responsibility from the State.  There are large sections who might otherwise fall to be dealt with by the State.  This has, in fact, distinct advantages in so far as it encourages thrift and encourages an outlook towards the provisions under the superannuation schemes which nowadays we take for granted to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>In that connection insurance companies have played a progressive part. One might say the insurance companies derive benefit from the schemes, but, on the other hand, people who contribute derive benefits from them. No matter what way it is looked at, the idea behind it and the concepts which these particular schemes have inherent in their various arrangements make it an idea which I believe we should endeavour to encourage and promote to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The proposals which are enshrined in this Bill will for the first time aggregate the benefits of these schemes, or the sums involved, with what is known as the free estate.  While it is to some extent true, as the Minister says, that possibly few of these schemes would reach or exceed the <Col N="1631" /> sum of £5,000, nevertheless the principle is bad.  We regarded this as one of the features of this Bill which are not merely financially but socially undesirable.  While the revised amendment as moved is to some extent an improvement, I still feel it is not anything like adequate.</P>
    <P>The suggestion the Minister has made may to some extent allay certain fears expressed here during Committee Stage.  I think it is unrealistic to suggest that people such as civil servants or possibly bank officials, merely because they have no legal entitlement under certain pension or superannuation schemes applicable in their case do not benefit.  I think it is a fact that it has never been known that any of the benefits to which people are entitled are withdrawn except the individual concerned infringes in some way or other the terms of the scheme. Then the benefit is withdrawn for reasons other than that the authorities concerned, for some reason or another, decided not to operate the scheme, or allow the benefits of the scheme to operate in respect of the person concerned. However, it is possible the Minister may at a later stage propose an amendment in respect of the superannuation code.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have no great fear about this except to the extent that it is liable to create a bad impression, in that those who are responsible for drafting or advising the Minister on the form of the legislation should advise one form in respect of the public generally and a different form in respect of those persons who are themselves responsible for advising in regard to it.  However, we shall await the Minister's further proposals on this.</P>
    <P>My purpose in tabling the amendment is to extend the definition to include a child who has passed the age of 16 and who, while not in certain circumstances still undergoing education or training, in a school or college, is permanently disabled from earning his own living because of a disability of a physical or mental character.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene now.  I do not propose to go into the merits at this stage of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  I probably will have an opportunity later.  I may have created a wrong impression when I introduced the section.  I spoke of aggregation.  Section 24 has nothing to do with aggregation.  Section 25 provides for aggregation.  I did say that, at the moment, contributory pension schemes or death benefits arising from contributory pension schemes are already liable to estate duty.  That is a fact.  I said that death benefits arising as a result of non-contributory schemes are not liable to estate duty at present. That is also a fact.  I should have added that benefits arising from non-contributory schemes are deemed at the present time to be liable to succession duty at 11½ per cent which in most cases and in fact in nearly every case, is a much more onerous imposition than estate duty and I am now proposing to make these benefits arising from non-contributory schemes liable to estate duty as well as benefits arising from contributory schemes, but, at the same time, relieving benefits arising from non-contributory schemes of liabilities to succession duty.  Later on, I shall be proposing certain and further other reliefs.</P>

      <P>This is a horribly technical subject.  As I understand the Minister, the purpose of section 24 originally, and the new section, is primarily to prevent avoidance measures.  I want, however, to refer the Minister to section 34 of the Finance Act, 1958.  Paragraph (m) of subsection (1) of that section provides:</P>
      <P>that no service of a person in whatever capacity while he is (i) a proprietary director, (ii) a part-time director, (iii) a proprietary employee, or (iv) a part-time employee, may be taken into account for any of the purposes of the scheme&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" />&mdash;the scheme being a retirements benefits scheme.  It goes on, then, going back to define what a proprietary director is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Proprietary director&rdquo; means a director of a company who is either the beneficial owner of, or able, either directly or through the medium of other companies or by any other indirect means, to control, more than fifteen per cent of the ordinary share capital of the company.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Proprietary employee&rdquo; is the same. A &ldquo;part-time director&rdquo; and &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo; are defined as being persons who are not required to devote substantially the whole of their time to the service of the body corporate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the section, it says that anybody who has more than 15 per cent of the capital of the company cannot get any benefit for any purpose of the scheme.  On the last occasion, the Minister indicated that approval of the scheme was for the purposes of income tax concessions in relation to the calculation of deduction of contributions and he made that case.  In fact, I had not checked the section then.  Now, I have checked it and the position does not seem to me to be what the Minister said on the last occasion.  It says:</P>
      <P>(m) that no service of a person in whatever capacity while he is:</P>
      <P>(i)  a proprietary director,</P>
      <P>&nbsp;(ii)  a part-time director,</P>
      <P>(iii) a proprietary employee, or</P>
      <P>(iv) a part-time employee,</P>
      <P>may be taken into account for any of the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means to say that anybody who has more than 15 per cent of the capital of the company cannot get the death benefit under any superannuation scheme because the superannuation <Col N="1634" /> scheme is <i>ultra vires</i> that section if the company bring it into operation. The section does not say, as I understood the Minister to say on the last occasion, that approval could not be given to such a scheme.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, the Minister said that approval could be sought for the scheme for income tax purposes but that it did not operate for death benefits.  The section, I think, is clear. If it includes a person owning more than 15 per cent of the capital in death benefit, then it is <i>ultra vires</i> the section and the scheme is inoperative, does not come into effect.  Therefore section 34 of the Finance Act, 1958, contains its own built-in, shall I say, provision against avoidance.  When one considers the matter in that light, it blows skyhigh the whole case the Minister has made for the necessity for this section.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to go on, in relation to the section, a bit further.  I may say at once now that not merely do I not very clearly understand, with the best <i>bona fide</i> goodwill in the world, the explanation the Minister has given but that I find it extremely difficult to understand the original section and the amendment as introduced.  As I understand these provisions now, and as it has been put to me by a person somewhat more skilled in superannuation schemes than I am, the effect of the new amendment the Minister is putting in is more penal than the old one.  I want to pursue that because on the last occasion we succeeded in persuading the Minister that section 24 as originally proposed by him would inflict on the dependants of a man of even moderate means some hardship and he agreed to consider raising the exemption limit of £5,000 and to look at the wider implications of the section. He indicated then, and I think correctly, that he wanted to see how the hardship on the dependants of salary or wage-earning employees might be ameliorated, bearing in mind that what he wanted to do was to avoid an anti-avoidance section.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the 1958 Act, page 24 of the long white copy of that Act, makes it clear that, as a means of <Col N="1635" /> avoidance, it is really not operative at all.  As I understand this now, the section will be even more penal, because what will happen now is that there will be a worse situation for non-contributory schemes than there will be for contributory schemes.  I must, with respect, discuss to some extent what arises under section 24 and the amendment to section 25 in order adequately to understand section 24. As I see it, the contributory scheme that will now operate will be that the proportion the last five years' premiums paid bear to the total number of premiums paid will govern the proportion of the total policy moneys that will be taxed.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that that will have an effect which I shall deal with in another way and which I tried to cover by amendment No. 13 which has been ruled out of order, partly through my own fault because I placed amendment No. 13 in the wrong place: it is correct but it is in the wrong place on the list of amendments. However, that will have the effect of hitting the young man with the family much more than the older man.  Perhaps I might make it clear why I say that.  Take a person who, when he is 25, takes out an ordinary policy of life insurance, and therefore a contributory pension scheme, for a period of 30 years.  If he lives the whole of the 30 years and dies one day before the policy becomes a payable endowment, then, as I understand it, the last five years' premiums are taken into account and the proportion on which death duties will have to be paid is one-sixth of the policy moneys&mdash;in other words, the last five years, in proportion to the total 30 years.  Accordingly, he pays duty on only one-sixth of the moneys and, when he is 55, with a bit of luck, his family will be grown up, reared, and able to manage themselves.</P>
    <P>However, if an unfortunate man dies at 35, when he has a young family, and when the widow and the young family really need the money, what will happen under the Minister's amendment is that having paid only ten premiums, the last five years will be taken and therefore at least half <Col N="1636" /> of the policy moneys will be taken into account for death duty purposes. The effect, therefore, of the Minister's amendment which includes amendment No. 15 which must be taken into account is to penalise the person who dies young.  The person who dies young is the very person we want to allow off with a lesser rate of duty because the presumption is that, if he dies young, he will leave a younger family to be looked after.  It seems to me therefore that the whole effect of amendment No. 15 is utterly anti-social in that respect. It was because of that that I framed amendment No. 13, but stupidly put it down as an amendment to the section instead of, as I had intended, an amendment to the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>What about amendment No. 12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Having understood that position in respect of contributory schemes, I want to come back to non-contributory schemes.  You must take one with the other.  The position is that in the case of contributory schemes the liability to duty is based on a value of one-sixth of the death benefit.  In the non-contributory scheme, under this section and under amendment No. 12, there is no such provision.  The position here is that the whole benefit is to be taken into account, except in so far as the aggregate value does not exceed £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Minister is deliberately drawing his legislation to penalise non-contributory schemes. That is utterly wrong.  I accept what the Minister has said, that the exemption limit may clear it.  I do not know enough about the situation to know that, but I know this, that about half of the superannuation schemes in this State are wholly non-contributory. That has been found as a result of examination. In relation to the contributory schemes in operation, almost all of them segregate the amount payable in contribution as between a pension amount and a death benefit amount. Where such schemes are written by insurance companies, they will be counted here as non-contributory schemes.  As far as I can see, therefore, <Col N="1637" /> the restriction of the £5,000 exemption is in fact going to be operative in only about 20 per cent of the current superannuation schemes.  That appears to be wholly wrong.  I speak with the greatest reserve on this because I found the original section, as I did this amendment, extremely difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that over the past 12 years there has been a marked growth of non-contributory schemes. He also would have felt, when he was sitting a little further down the gangway as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that such growth of non-contributory schemes was a symptom of enlightened industrial psychology. If that is so, and I think it is such a symptom, it seems to me that the differentiation he is making in these two amendments now is a very bad thing, particularly when it is wholly unnecessary because of the provision in the 1958 Act for anti-avoidance.</P>
    <P>In practice, the pursuance of that enlightened industrial psychology to which I referred has been that the employees contribute to that part of the superannuation scheme that provides for pension benefits on retirement, and the dependants' benefits are supported by the employers' contributions only.  I do not think the Minister will disagree with me when I say that the man with a young family is invariably the most heavily committed in regard to household expenses, school fees, rent and the repayments on his building society mortgage, if he was lucky enough to have a mortgage made before the Government made it virtually impossible to obtain accommodation from building societies.  He is going to find all these things a greater burden.  I am afraid the effect of this section, in keeping with the other provisions we have had here, may well mean a reluctance to join.  If the scheme has to be made into a contributory scheme for the purpose of getting within the exemption to which I have referred, that will mean a corresponding claim for an increase in wages and salaries in contravention of the appeal made by the Taoiseach the other day.  It seems, therefore, that the whole purpose of <Col N="1638" /> this amendment and of this section is going to entirely defeat its ends.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the purpose of this section really to provide that the Revenue Commissioners can decide what type of pension scheme the State is to have, or rather what type of pension scheme individual employment is to provide? Whether that is intended or not, if it does in fact have that result, it is very bad legislation.  I do not think anybody would suggest that the Minister for Finance or anybody able to advise him in his Department, no matter how expert he may be at his own job, is either qualified or competent to dictate the design of a pension scheme.  That is the specialised work of experts.  It is a type of specialisation which is obviously not available in the Department of Finance or in Revenue.  It is entirely wrong that there should be any such suggestion and that the effect of these sections is going to be to enable the Revenue Commissioners to dictate the type and design of pension schemes for industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Again, I come back to where I started.  In section 34 of the 1958 Act, there is a built-in prevention of the avoidance of duty.  That built-in prevention is quite adequate to prevent people avoiding their liability to duty, and anything the Minister does after that is only interfering in the whole superannuation scheme for industry for the State as a whole, and is something that will bring no benefit but rather, on the contrary, will be quite an objectionable feature of our taxation laws.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, possibly in a more comprehensive way the point would be met by the striking out of the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in clause (d) (i) of the Minister's amendment.  There is a case to be met and in so far as that part of the section is concerned, that would meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also must confess that I am somewhat confused as to the purposes of this section.  As I understood it, the primary purpose of the original section 22 was to catch a scheme, say, for the big company director who was referred to here, if provision were <Col N="1639" /> made for what one might call exorbitant sums.  Does Deputy Sweetman disagree with me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am agreeing with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the point, I do not know&mdash;I have not examined Deputy Sweetman's point so far&mdash;as to whether there is or is not sufficient answer in the 1958 Act as quoted but, if the answer is there, then we would want to know where the answer has failed in practice, or if it has failed and what are the purposes of the section.  It seems to me that one of the things that we should be told is how much more revenue will come in as a result of this section, on estimation.  Usually when legislation like this is provided in a section of the Finance Bill, the experts who prepare it have some idea of what the return of it will be.  I would be particularly interested in knowing what will be the average return in the ordinary case from the section.  It is a factor that perhaps we should have asked for earlier.  Then we could make some kind of guess as to what the incidence or the force of the section would be on the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>There is one other thing which I am afraid I must refer to.  The Minister referred to undercurrents.  I take it he was referring to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said here was not meant to be an undercurrent. I was responsible for the discussion here the other day in which I mentioned the class of cases.  I had a very good idea that there was one class, in fact, the class the Minister mentioned, that the original section 22 did not capture, namely, civil servants.  I was anxious to know, however, whether there were other classes.  For instance, Deputies on the other side of the House mentioned bank clerks but I think they would be captured.  The arguments proceeding from Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies on the <Col N="1640" /> other side of the House were all on the assumption that all these people would be captured by this section.  I did not mean this as an undercurrent.  I meant it as a point for examination and I was not specific at that time because I thought there might possibly be other classes as well.  It does seem to me that civil servants are excluded from this new section.  Frankly, I think, in principle, that should have been adverted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they are not captured by the section.  I will deal with that in a moment.  There may be very good reason for it.  As the Minister said, and I for one completely accept, the superannuation scheme is to be looked at.  What I do not like is the explanatory memorandum.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill simply says in relation to the original section 22: &ldquo;Section 22 provides that death benefits payable under superannuation schemes will in all cases be liable to estate duty except where the aggregate value of these benefits does not exceed £5,000.&rdquo; There is nothing more said but I think in the case of an explanatory memorandum, it should be explicit and it should be explanatory.  It was not as an undercurrent that there was the crosstalk there was in the House.  I simply wanted to raise the question that there were classes, or there was the possibility that there were classes, whether accidentally or not, and that it would need to be looked into.</P>
      <P>On the principle of the thing, I think I would agree with one of the remarks Deputy Norton made earlier where I think he implied that there should be uniformity where taxation is concerned.  I do not think anybody questions that.  I do not think there is any effort made to breach that principle. But, at the same time we should be careful that these things are adverted to.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I merely mentioned that there has been confusion and I tried to indicate how it has occurred in all our minds.  Then there is something for which the Minister is responsible, that is, he has introduced a new section which in his first set of amendments was amendment No. 7, dealing with insurance policies, and is now in the second set of amendments, No. 15.  He did not seem to be clear in his mind in the first instance, judged by his own statement and by the explanatory memorandum, as to what he was trying to cover in section 22 because it was labelled &ldquo;Benefits Accruing by Reason of Superannuation Schemes&rdquo;.  He went on to say it was a measure to catch non-contributory benefits, for example, death annuities provided by a man for his wife in which he loaded a lot of his money on to an insurance policy which his wife would get in the form of a lump sum or annuity or a mixture of both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it was under pressure from memoranda from insurance companies all over the country, or what, the Minister has now introduced a new section dealing entirely with assurance policies.  He has taken it from section <Col N="1642" /> 22 and has introduced it as a new section. That has caused some of the confusion.  Even though the Minister has said he is not responsible for the confusion in the first case he is responsible for the confusion in the second case.</P>
    <P>I should like to get some information from the Minister and I will put my questions to him as specifically as I can because it is not easy to follow some of this discussion.  I understand that heretofore contributory benefits were aggregable and liable.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister tells us they were paying more because they were paying succession duty.  I cannot argue on that point because I do not know how these figures are worked out.  I would want a table in front of me, but I shall take the Minister's word for it. Perhaps they were paying more but it remains to be seen, when their benefits are added to their real estate and those amounts are aggregated, whether they would be paying less than before.  I am quite convinced the purpose of the alteration is to get more money out of them and that the Minister will.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question here the other day on this matter of aggregation.  Although he is doing this, he does not know how much money it will bring in or how much money he may have lost over the past year.  The question was: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will give an estimate of the net loss to revenue which occurred over the past financial year by failure heretofore to provide the legal coverage envisaged by section 22 of the Finance Bill, 1965.&rdquo; He mentions the succession duty at 11½ per cent, which this wipes out.  He mentions the £5,000 benefit in respect of the widow and dependent children. He concludes by saying: &ldquo;No figures are available on which to base an estimate of the amount of duty which would have been payable if benefits not caught by existing law had been under a charge for duty in the last financial year.&rdquo; However, I do not know whether that concluding paragraph relates to section 22 as the Minister had originally envisaged it or whether it now relates to section 24 with the new section dealing with assurance policies siphoned off from it. It would lead to clearer thinking if in the original section the Minister had introduced his previous drafting and not have us tied up with superannuation schemes and assurance policies as we seem now to be.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 34 of the 1958 Act which Deputy Sweetman quoted and to which he referred in a less precise way on Committee Stage, section 34 of the 1958 Act is designed to facilitate people who want to draw up superannuation schemes that are contributory in order to ensure that the contributions will be taken account of for purposes of income tax and other aspects of the superannuation schemes that are examined by the Revenue Commissioners. It has no reference whatever to estate duty.  The fact that there is, as Deputy Sweetman suggested, a built-in exclusion of superannuation schemes as affecting directors of companies, the kind of persons whose financial activities <Col N="1645" /> are sought to be caught here, does not mean that those activities are not permissible anyway or have not been. The section as it stands refers to arrangements in its definition of a &ldquo;superannuation scheme&rdquo;.

These relate to having contributions reckoned for income tax purposes and there is also regard to the avoidance of undue payments of lump sums in the course of the operation of these schemes.  That, as I said, does not obviate the possibility of the director of a private company making, through the company itself, an arrangement for the purposes of <Col N="1646" /> avoiding estate duty.

Death benefits arising out of non-contributory schemes are not at present liable to estate duty but they are liable to succession duty and succession duty is much more onerous.  I am now relieving them of liability to succession duty and bringing them in with the contributory schemes benefits, making them liable to death duty as such and relieving the first £5,000.  In a later section, I shall be introducing an amendment which will enhance the value of that relief to quite a considerable sum, in some cases a sum that will relieve completely the type of case the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested, and Deputy de Valera supported him, that we might extend the <Col N="1648" /> relief which the section provides for dependents to children who are disabled. In subsequent sections, and for the purposes of this section, which will be applicable, I have an extension of dependency to include people over 16 years of age who continue a full-time course of instruction at school, college, or other educational establishment, or words to that effect.  It is very difficult to assess the extent to which a person is incapacitated or the extent to which that incapacity or disability precludes him from earning a livelihood. While one must have sympathy with the general type of case Deputy Cosgrave has in mind, I think that, having extended the type of dependency to persons over 16 years who are following a full-time course of instruction, I have gone reasonably far.  To extend it beyond that would create tremendous difficulty as far as assessing liability is concerned and would impose on the Revenue Commissioners the very onerous obligation of determining disability, and the extent of disability, and whether people with a disability are capable or incapable of earning, and how much.  I think the tenor of the Bill, as now amended as far as dependency is concerned, goes a fairly long distance to meet the type of case the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>Even if the figure were double what the Minister says, I should be still prepared to accept it as accurate. Half the figure the other night was, according to the Minister, of no importance whatsoever.  The Minister says he wants to catch the company director who had avoided his proper share of revenue.  Apparently he will not catch very many because all he will get is £50,000 a year.  This is not a question of collecting revenue to ensure justice is done and, on that, I go along with the Minister, but, instead of allowing duty on the first £5,000, provided it does not exceed £5,000, could he not go the whole way and make the first £5,000 exempt?  He will not lose very much and this would meet everybody's difficulty.  It will also catch the people he wants to catch, the company directors and those he feels are getting away with large sums in insurance.  The £5,000 exemption is designed to relieve the small cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason why company directors should be able so to arrange their affairs as not to <Col N="1650" /> pay their proper share.  What I am asking is they exclude the first £5,000, irrespective of the amount.  Since the Minister started off by admitting that this was bringing in practically no revenue, what would be the difficulty in making the first £5,000 free&mdash;not up to £5,000&mdash;for any amount?  This covers all the objections I have heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that we are not really discussing revenue. The amount involved is of little or no importance when it is coming from a section of the community from which we should be very loth to take money, widows and orphans, people in meagre circumstances.  In addition to what he has suggested, could he not also make the first £5,000, free, since it is going to cost very little?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister deal with his reaction to the point which I raised with him before on the question of existing pension schemes? Arrangements which are made with the knowledge of the Revenue authorities in advance for avoidance of tax liability may very well be caught virtually retrospectively as soon as the Revenue people get wise to them. Here we are dealing with existing superannuation schemes of which the Revenue has always been fully aware in the greatest detail.  The Minister may say that when the schemes were submitted to the Revenue Commissioners, they were not submitted on the question of death duties but purely on the question of income tax liability and relief in so far as the premiums were concerned, but the fact remains that those schemes were put into effect with the full knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners in order to build up a sum to help the widows and other dependants of the members of the schemes, either by way of providing a lump sum which will be a tremendous help in discharging the death duty on the remainder of the deceased's estate or by providing a pension for the dependants.</P>
      <P>When you get a lump sum, I can see there is possibly some reduction in hardship because at least the dependants have some liquid resources in hand but the way in which people have arranged&mdash;very properly&mdash;their affairs has been based on the fact that these death benefits would not be liable to estate duty at all in certain cases or would not be aggregated with the remainder of the deceased's assets. I cannot feel that this is a fair way of legislating when we provide that where a perfectly legal action has been taken as a result of which a formal contract has been executed between an employer and trustees for a superannuation fund, the Revenue authorities should then come and radically vary the effect of the whole arrangement. That seems very unfair and it seems to be going back to the same old business of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> It is quite possible for the Minister to say that it is difficult to legislate for different classes of cases.  There may be a question of administrative difficulty but I do not think that should ever be put forward as a reason for doing less than justice.  If the Minister feels it is absolutely essential in future that superannuation scheme benefits should be aggregated and taxable, well and good; let people therefore provide for increased benefits so that the net receipts to beneficiaries would still be approximately the same, but at the moment, with these pension schemes, there will not be time to amend the schemes in order to provide the same benefits as originally intended.  There is, therefore, quite definitely a case for making an exclusion in this Bill for all superannuation schemes currently in operation with the full approval of the Revenue Commissioners and with their full knowledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I want to point out that the schemes to which the Deputy refers are schemes which were submitted to the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of agreeing on the extent to which relief would be provided for contributions, whether by employer or worker or both, form liability to income tax.  I must again point out that contributory scheme benefits are already subject to liability for estate duty.  Therefore, I do not know what point the Deputy is making in that respect.</P>
      <P>The next section, which has not been recommitted is the one which deals with aggregation but aggregation seems to be worked into this section to the point that we seem to be taking advantage of the recommittal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what is happening as the debate is going along. I did not have the figures a few minutes ago when dealing with Deputy Norton's point but it is relevant to mention them in the case which Deputy Booth has in mind.  Is it those big cases which we want to ensure will pay that should benefit or is it the ordinary <Col N="1653" /> cases?  If it is the ordinary cases, I submit on the figures I am now giving, that the £5,000 exemption will with the increase in the abatement of duty that would otherwise be payable by widows and children, give very substantial relief.  In the case where there is only one dependent child, the point at which an estate of this nature would become liable is to be £7,010&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us start from there. I do not pretend to follow the intricacies of finance law, let us call it, but this could be regarded as a reasonable <Col N="1656" /> and an average sort of estate and a reasonable provision to be made for a widow.  I was quoted recently as saying that £8,000 would not be an unusual value for a house in present circumstances but we have to remember that the £8,000 includes not alone the value of the house but the rest of the man's estate.  It includes the furniture, his personal belongings and a car if he had one; therefore I do not think anybody could say that £8,000 was anything but average or, one might say, modest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Modest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither would it be an unusual provision that a husband who had a reasonably young wife&mdash;you can select your own age there&mdash;say a woman of 30 or 35 years, who had no trade or occupation but who was solely dependent on the provision her husband would make for her, would try to ensure for her an income of £10 a week.  When we think in terms of the value of houses, we must remember that the market value of houses is going up month after month. The labourer's cottage which at present might be valued at £1,000 or £1,200 could well be valued at £1,500 or £2,000 in a few years time.</P>
      <P>I want to see people paying their due amount of tax and I am with the Minister when he wants to ensure that people will not, in the name of avoiding their tax responsibility, do any sort of &ldquo;hooky&rdquo; business which although it might be within the law, would be morally wrong.  The House has been given this example by various people and by a certain association. Here is a situation in which a woman is left a house and personal estate to the value of £8,000 and her husband has made provision for a pension of £10 a week which, when capitalised, is assessed at £8,000 and the Minister himself has said that in those circumstances the widow, having no children, and even with the present amendment, will have to pay duty of £1,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does she get it?  Does she borrow it?  If she does, she will have to pay interest on it.  If she does not feel like borrowing it because she feels <Col N="1657" /> the terms are too onerous she will have to sell the house and then she will have to get another one, a more modest one.  The Minister should accede to Deputy Norton's proposal that a figure like £5,000, or some figure on which the Minister may decide, should be accepted as the value of a house and should be exempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have stressed this aspect earlier but I want to re-emphasise the points that have been made during the discussion.  The figures which are included in the Bill and which we have been discussing may have been reasonable enough before the drop in the value of money.  Nowadays people are no longer amazed at the price which property fetches because you have to discount a good deal of it, due to the effects of inflation.  While initially it may look well in print, in actual practice the drop in the value of money indicates that these figures no longer mean what they did.  Consequently, although the figures we have been discussing this evening may sound reasonable and appropriate, in so far as superannuation is concerned, a figure of £5,000 is still as much as any of these persons would get and I think the Minister should advert to the very dramatic changes in respect of house property.</P>
      <P>To some extent the present restriction on credit may have if not a downward influence on prices, certainly may prevent prices going higher.  The old prices and values no longer hold true.  Depending to a considerable extent on location and so on, price values very considerably.  For these reasons I believe the Minister should consider further raising the total value because, as has been pointed out, the amount involved for a widow, particularly one with children, can result in very considerable hardship.  Undoubtedly, the figures mentioned here indicate the problem that will present itself for widows with children if this Bill is passed in its present form.  The Minister should consider price levels in relation to the present depreciated value of money and the consequent changes in values that have occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not chase the money part further, but I shall take Deputy Cosgrave's point that there is a decrease in the value of money, meaning an increase in the value of property.  That being so, one must have in mind that the nominal value of an estate is likely to appreciate and is doing so rather rapidly. If the nominal value of estates is appreciating at the rate at which it is appreciating and if aggregation is to take place, which it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The nominal value of estates is appreciating and the effect of this section is in aggregation. Therefore, I would ask the Minister very seriously to consider whether in the <i>status quo</i> or should I say, the <i>ante status quo</i> situation on which the estimates the Minister gave us were based, £5,000 is sufficient or whether it should be reviewed.  Having got the facts by varying the limits, as undoubtely would happen later to meet cases as they occur, that variation will take place with a certain amount of friction and time lag and the net result will be to operate more severely and more harshly in the type of case Deputy Corish was talking about rather than on the estimates on which the £5,000 was based.  That is a point that should certainly be looked into.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Sweetman opened, he said he was confused about the section. So was I.  I have looked at it again and I have found that there is a change really only in the structure of the section and not very much in the section itself.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 12 as against section 24, previously section 22.  We should look at the point I am making.  Subsection (1) of the proposed new section states:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this subsection shall have effect in relation to a death benefit payable under a non-contributory superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>Anyone reading that would think it applies only to non-contributory schemes.  It applies to everything because subsection (2) (a) says:</P>

      <P>The original section 22 said that a death benefit meant any benefit which accrues pursuant to a superannuation scheme on or in connection with a death. The question I want to ask the Minister is whether under this section the definitions are broad enough.  I should like to know how is it that the Civil Service are exempt from this?  As one reads that section, the Civil Service are exempt unless a death benefit is not involved.</P>

      <P>In all seriousness, the first objection is that there are a class of higher civil servants, who, for the moment, will be exempt from this. I make no further point about this in itself but the Minister is going to look into it.  I make this point, however.  In all dealings with these matters, whether things concern ourselves in this House or public servants, there should be a complete disclosure in this House and to the public at large.  I consider that principle should be very clearly stated in this House.</P>

      <P>If that escape <Col N="1661" /> route is open in one case, why is it not open in another?  I shall repeat this point for the Minister's benefit.  If there is escape from the wording of the section on the ground that payments are <i>ex gratia,</i> that is, in regard to civil servants, if the reason the section does not capture civil servants is that the payment is <i>ex gratia</i> and at the discretion of the Government, why is it that a board of directors could not just sit tight, do nothing, and if one of their members died, the payment in his case would not be an <i>ex gratia</i> payment? Why could that not be open, and if it were, it would be easy to drive a coach and four through this section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I had not intended speaking on this amendment at all but since I came into the House, I have been rather shocked to have it brought home very clearly to me that we appear to be providing one level of death duty for the Civil Service and another level of death duty for the ordinary private citizen. If we are doing that, or even anything like it, it is something that is to be deplored and something which should not be allowed to pass without a protest from everybody who appreciates what we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I understand the position, a death benefit, to which the estate of a civil servant becomes entitled, is not liable to death duty and is not liable to be aggregated with the rest of his estate because it is regarded as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment from the State to the estate of the deceased person.  Every boy and girl entering the Civil Service knows that on his death his estate will become entitled to a lump sum.  I fail to see how that can be regarded as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment and I fail to see how it should be treated as such.  The reaction of the next-of-kin or the executors of any deceased civil servant. who are told: &ldquo;The State has decided in your particular case not to pay the <i>ex gratia</i> sum normally paid to people <Col N="1662" /> of this category&rdquo; would be to create an uproar.  It is quite right that there should be such an uproar because when that person entered the Civil Service, he did so on the basis of certain conditions of employment, one of which was that at death, payment of a lump sum would be made.  In the case of a creamery manager who becomes entitled under a non-contributory scheme to a lump sum payment to death, that lump sum payment becomes liable to death duty.</P>
      <P>There is a very big principle at stake here, all the more so, when we are dealing with a branch of legislation in relation to which the Minister, and indeed the Government, are peculiarly and particularly in the hands of the Civil Service.  I do not say that in any offensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I say it because I regard it as my duty to say it in this House.  Members of this House would be criticised, and rightly so, if they decided to pass legislation exempting themselves from death duty or income tax.  We know the uproar there was in the country when a portion of Deputies' salaries was exempted from income tax and how hard it was to convince the man on the street that that particular portion was an expense and not a remuneration.</P>
      <P>I cannot over-emphasise the risk of adverse comment to which we are leaving ourselves open if we allow this proposal to go through.  I say that it will be utterly impossible to explain to any intelligent citizen why a lump sum payable to a higher civil servant, or indeed to an ordinary rank and file civil servant, should escape death duty while the lump sum payable to the commercial traveller, the bank manager, the creamery manager or anybody else who might be participating in an non-contributory scheme, will be liable to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious some Deputies are getting in on this because they think there is a bit of copy in it. I said, at the start, I wanted to make <Col N="1663" /> it quite clear that it is accidental that this provision did not catch the Civil Service.  With regard to the extent to which it relieves civil servants, there were only about one or two cases in the whole Civil Service, and there is no point in getting attached to a whole spread of creamery managers and somebody else, because of death benefits that would arise in the superannuation scheme of creamery managers.  These kind of people would not be taken into account at all because £5,000 is being relieved.  That £5,000 would more than cover every death benefit that will arise in the case of civil servants.</P>
      <P>I have told the House specifically that the intention is, for what it is worth, and it is not worth a lot, except the point of principle as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that the benefits arising out of a superannuation scheme for civil servants will be taken in but this is not the appropriate Bill for it. They will be taken in under superannuation or other legislation which I have promised the House it is my intention to introduce.  Nobody should be importing anything sinister into this section.</P>

Some of the securities might have to be sold to pay it but I understand there is little, if any, evidence of anybody having to sell a house to pay for death duties as such.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Norton give nobody a chance. I do not interrupt when Deputies are speaking.  I want to say also the Bill will give relief.  Apart from the superannuation benefits case, there is extra relief given in this Bill to the type of estate in regard to value and size which Deputy Corish had in mind a while ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not be peevish about criticism while he is speaking or otherwise, because the fact is that he has come in here with a damned bad Bill, and a particularly outrageous explanatory memorandum. The Minister had better realise that that type of approach will mean that he will have to stay even longer in the House trying to explain the Bill. I might suggest that before we get another Bill with as bad an explanatory memorandum, the Minister would be wise to go to at least one member of the House I can think of and get some lessons in the technique of tick-tack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not yet explained to the House how the 11½ per cent succession duty was made up.  He has not yet explained to the House why he is putting superannuation death benefit under a non-contributory scheme in a worse position than benefit under a contributory scheme.  The position, as I understand it at any rate &mdash;I do not in any way suggest that I am certain to be right&mdash;is that in the case of a contributory scheme, the amount of the policy moneys of the <Col N="1665" /> death benefit which are to be taken into account will be only that proportion which the last five years payments bear to the total payments made. Therefore, in the case of a person living to 50 or 55 years, the proportion will be very small, and it has the unfair social result that where a person dies young, the proportion is larger. In any event, it is not the whole death benefit in a contributory scheme that bears the brunt.  It is only a proportion, or part, or share.  I think it is bad that the Revenue Commissioners should dictate the type of pension scheme we should have.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory pension schemes should be taken as part of an enlightened industrial psychology and should not be hit as they are being hit. This is bad and I think it arises because the Minister will not take the trouble&mdash;I do not mean that to be offensive but it is the fact&mdash;to write in a proper anti-avoidance section.  I think it is in the section, but supposing I am wrong.  It would be a very simple matter for the Minister to provide that section 34 of the 1958 Act would also apply to death benefits.  That would mean that a case of avoidance would be caught, and a person having more than 15 per cent of the capital would not be able to write out exemption from estate duty under a superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>That would be very simple.  It would require little more than a section of about four lines, saying that if the Minister is right&mdash;I assume he thinks he is right, but I am not prepared to agree that it would be so constructed by the courts&mdash;the provision in paragraph (n) of subsection (1), section 34 of the Finance Act, 1958, and the definition, would apply for the purpose of death duties as well as income tax. That would mean that all cases of anti-avoidance would be caught and genuine superannuation schemes would not be caught.  It would be quite simple for the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>In addition, I cannot see the answer to the point made by Deputy de Valera.  If <i>ex gratia</i> payments to civil servants are not caught in this Bill &mdash; I am not talking about the <Col N="1666" /> exemption limit &mdash; why could not a similar coach and four be driven through every part of the section by a company providing not a superannuation scheme as such, but <i>ex gratia</i> payments?  The point made by Deputy de Valera is entirely valid.  I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary came in and tried to curtail his contribution.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister wants to penalise non-contributory pension schemes in a way in which contributory schemes are not being penalised.  It is tantamount to saying that he will decide what pension schemes there shall be.  That is wrong. When he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am sure he took it as enlightened psychology that there should be non-contributory pension schemes in industry.  Section 34 of the 1958 Act is a built-in avoidance measure.  Let us apply section 34 to death duties and we will get the anti-avoidance restriction we need, and we will allow the superannuation schemes which are desirable for the purpose of good industrial relations to go through as they should go through.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I omitted to reply to the point raised by Deputy Sweetman on succession duties assessed on death duties arising from a non-contributory scheme.  I am not in any way penalising, or trying to affect in any way, the creation of contributory or non-contributory superannuation schemes in industry.  In cases of benefit arising from non-contributory schemes, the ordinary rate for succession duty is ten per cent.  That is, a succession derived from an employer.  In the case of successions not liable to estate duty, as these are not as of now, there is an addition of one and a half per cent, making a total of 11½ per cent.</P>

      <P>I can only say in respect of section 34 that it deals, as I said already, with provisions for avoiding liability for income tax in these cases, as agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not accept the argument of Deputy Sweetman that a simple reference in this Bill to that section and that providing for death duties would solve the type of problem with which I am trying to deal in section 24.  If it did, it would not be <Col N="1668" /> necessary for me to go through this long debate.</P>

If that is so, does the Minister not feel it goes a long way towards defeating the whole purpose of the section?  I do.</P>

      <P>The Minister may think he is having a pretty gruelling passage this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, we have been obstructing these provisions for weeks on end.  In the mass of technicalities which we have been discussing this afternoon, we can very well overlook the aim and the effect of these provisions.  Superannuation schemes are provided for salary earners.  Salary earners are, in this country, by and large, small.  Very few salary earners have salaries in excess of £3,000 a year.  The average salary paid is away below £2,000 a <Col N="1669" /> year.  These are the people we are taxing under this section.  These are the people on whom we are tightening the screw.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago a case was made that certain provisions in this Bill were serving as a disincentive to the wealthy class whom some persons want to see encouraged into this country.  The Minister was able to get up and boast that at the sum of £85,000 our maximum rate of estate duty ceases, whereas in Britain the rate over £85,000 increases tremendously.  The wealthy people in this country are taxed, relatively speaking, far less onerously than the small people whom we are getting at in these provisions. That to me is a nauseating thought.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the example of the widow with an estate of £16,000.  She does not get the benefit the Minister has been speaking of under section 28.  She gets no benefit whatever under section 28. The figure of £16,000 for the widow of a bank clerk living in a modest type house valued at £7,000&mdash;£8,000 today is a small estate for such a person.  If her house is valued at £6,000, it will leave her with a capital of £10,000 which, if she invests in Government securities, will give her an income of £500 a year to bring up a large family.  This is the type on whom we are tightening the screw in the section we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>The £5,000 limit which the Minister has brought in in his amendment is of no use at all to the young widow who has a large family.  If she is aged 30 or less, or is perhaps up to the age of 35, a pension of £10 a week in her case will have a capital value of about £8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts that cannot be got over.  The Minister must accept the responsibility for tightening the screw more rigidly on small estates. With the inflation which has taken place in recent years, the type of person who up to five, six or eight years ago would have had an estate of over £5,000, now if he has made any effort to provide insurance benefits for his dependants, will have an estate of up to £20,000-£25,000.  I <Col N="1670" /> would suggest to the Minister if he would remove the £15,000 margin in section 28, most of us would feel a lot happier about the provisions in this section.  If he would increase the maximum estate for this benefit for the widow and children&mdash;a very proper benefit&mdash;to, say, £25,000 or £30,000 I, for one, would feel much happier about these awful provisions in sections 24 and 25.</P>
    <P>I do want to urge on the Minister that the £5,000 limit in section 24 and in the amendment is of little or no value to the young widow.  I am sorry there has been so much to-do here today about the civil servants.  I accept entirely what the Minister has said about the position there, that he will rectify it in the superannuation code. Far from trying to draw civil servants into the net, I would urge on the Minister to extend to other salary earners the exemption in respect of superannuation benefits now available to them.  If he will not do that, of course, in the interests of equity and justice, he must make the amendment which he has spoken of in the superannuation code.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It has transpired in the course of the discussion in which the Minister is moving to make non-contributory schemes liable to duty that, apparently, rather by an accident, the Civil Service appears to be exempt, on the basis, as I understand it, that their benefits are non-enforceable and/or that they may be regarded therefore as <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  I do not know what the legal side of this may be or why their pension rights may be regarded as non-enforceable, unless it is that the King can do no wrong or the State cannot be questioned.  Accepting that as being so, to come back to the points raised by Deputy de Valera and others, can the Minister give us any assurance that, at the moment, there are other superannuation pension schemes in operation all over the country which may claim, and may claim in court, perhaps successfully, that their claims were non-enforceable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> The second point I want to make is this.  What is to prevent future schemes from being devised by firms so as to make their pensions or their annuities non-enforceable?  On the point the Minister has raised here, I would ask him if he thinks such may not arise in the future.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will not accept it, there is no point in pressing it.  I just want to know why non-contributory and contributory pension schemes are being treated in a different way.  I have not had the answer to that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not being treated so; that is the answer.  They are being treated in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being treated in a different way, I suggest, in this.  In a contributory pensions scheme, the contributions are taken, the same as premiums on a life insurance policy.  It is the proportion of the policy moneys which are liable to duty, the same as the proportion of the last five years' premiums bears to the total premiums paid.  For a non-contributory pensions scheme, it is the whole death benefit.  That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The five years' provision applies to life assurance <Col N="1672" /> policies but not to contributory superannuation schemes.  The insurance policy section applies to policies effected by the deceased on his own life.  But that section does not apply to superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister has delivered himself far more to me. He means to say that he is making the duty on a pensions scheme death benefit more penal than in respect of a life insurance policy taken out.  That is utterly indefensible in a situation in which we are trying to get a man-power policy, good industrial relations: we all accept that good pensions schemes are part of that.  Now, the Minister is calmly telling us that the contributory pensions scheme will not get the benefit I thought he had said earlier it would get.  Maybe, again, this is my mistake; I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the benefit of the concession given to limit the proportion of policy moneys liable to duty to the proportion which the last five years of premiums bears to the total premiums paid.  I can see no reason, no argument, no suggestion of fair play in that that should happen in a contributory pension scheme and not be the case in a life insurance policy.  It defies reason that the differentiation should be there and it will completely negative any hope of better industrial relations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just say this before we leave this section?  I know that, to an extent, I am repeating myself. I should like to make one last appeal to the Minister to see some reason.  We are not against people paying their full share of the death duties. We think that what we are dealing with now does not bear any relation to that.  The Minister introduced this section and used as a reason for doing so that people are avoiding paying their fair share of duty, and that some company directors are using their position to avoid it.  No evidence has been produced to bear out what he said.  Deputy Sweetman mentioned that a director in a company who has more than 15 per cent interest in the <Col N="1673" /> company is not eligible, in any event. The Minister produced no evidence of any kind to support his statement. The suggestion we made was that the first £5,000 should be exempt from estate duty in the free estate and also the full £5,000 as regards superannuation. These are small people, the widows and orphans of small business people or small employees in a company. In a superannuation fund, £5,000 is equivalent to £6 5s. a week and that is not a big pension.  Both the free estate and the first £5,000 superannuation should be exempt and then let the normal rates of taxation continue. This will catch the person the Minister set out to catch and will do justice to all sections of the community, particularly the small person whom we should try to help here today.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he hopes to get £50,000 from this.  It is a ridiculous figure to have such a lengthy discussion about in this House, bearing in mind the people from whom we are trying to take it, our widows and orphans.  There is a tendency in this country to regard the Labour Party as being anti-business and anti-money.  We see more reason and more light in this, apparently, than do Fianna Fáil.  We are not as anti-middle class, anti-business and anti-money as Fianna Fáil have shown themselves to be by this section of the Finance Bill.  I hope, when the next election contributions are being sought, that the people contributing to Fianna Fáil will bear this in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One last question. I cannot believe that such an obvious loophole as the one I have adverted to can have been overlooked.  Is there any specific regulation, statute or anything that gives protection to the public service beyond that or, on the other hand, that captures the type of case I am talking about?  Otherwise, it seems ridiculous for us to leave such a case open when we are all agreed that there is one type of case we want to capture and that is the one the Minister mentioned at the beginning.</P>

I do not believe that there will be this wide open evasion or means of evasion to which the Deputy referred.  I want to say this, in reply to Deputy Sweetman.  I want to satisfy him that we are not being inconsistent in what we are doing for insurance policies and death benefits. The section I am introducing to give certain reliefs to people who will be obliged to pay death duties on moneys they get from policies effected by the deceased will not apply, except in the case of policies indefeasibly vested. Therefore, if there is any contingency which might deprive that person of profiting from the proceeds of that policy, it does not qualify.  In the case of death benefits arising out of superannuation schemes, they are not payable anyway until death.  Therefore, I am suggesting the policy that is not indefeasibly vested is in the same position as superannuation benefits.  They are not payable until death takes place.  We are treating contributory and non-contributory on the same basis.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 26 and 27, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Nothing in this section shall make any moneys payable under a policy effected under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, liable to aggregation with the free estate of the deceased.</P>
      <P>Section 25 now provides that policies that are effected, and in respect of which the deceased has no interest, are now going to be liable for aggregation for estate duty.  Since the last Stages of the Bill, I have been making some inquiries.  I understand one of the things the Minister has in mind is to cover, for example, annuity bonds.  I feel therefore it is desirable that a policy effected under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, should be segregated in a separate way from the annuity bond for the purposes of this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is crystal-clear.  It is to provide, as I provided in the 1955 Act when I was over there, that all the policies taken out under the Married Women's Status Act will be liable to duty as an estate <i>in se</i> and that they will not be liable to aggregation in the free estate of the deceased.  It seems to me perfectly fair that in respect of annuity bonds you must aggregate them altogether.  A person could take out 20 bonds, each for £4,000, and they would not be liable to duty.  That is wrong and should not be permitted, and under the amendment I have provided, it would not be permitted.  My amendment provides that the system introduced in 1955 to prevent avoidance of that sort would be operative <Col N="1676" /> but that there would not be penalisation of the case mentioned by Deputy Corish in relation to the widow with an estate of £16,000.</P>
    <P>I said on the last Stage all I wanted to say on this.  It is crystal-clear that this is the just and social way of dealing with this, and in the present economic circumstances of the country, the desirable way of dealing with it&mdash;that we should increase and give every incentive to increase savings in this way.  Of course, it is noticeable that this Finance Bill does absolutely nothing, as it was originally introduced, to cope with our present economic difficulties.  The only possible addition there was to help saving was section 10 which was included, not in the Bill as published, but on the Committee Stage by the Minister.  It is merely an extension of the relief I provided in 1956 when I was over there.  This is a bad section as it is at present.  If the amendment is included, it will be a fairer section. For that reason, the amendment is one the House should pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, I think I said most of what I would say now on Committee Stage. We had the same kind of discussion. But I am strengthened on this occasion by what Deputy Sweetman has just referred to, that is, the relief being provided in the next section, which I can elaborate on when we come to it. While Deputy Sweetman agrees that annuity bonds deliberately taken out for the purpose of avoiding estate duty ought to be caught, as this section proposes to catch them, it is quite conceivable that people could carry out the same kind of operation with insurance policies.</P>

      <P>At least they can be aggregated.  A person could so split up his big estate in order to avoid higher death duties because of the non-aggregation as between the policy side and the free estate side.  Nevertheless, the considerable relief I am giving on the insurance policy side in the next amendment will take a lot of the teeth out of any argument that this is being <Col N="1677" /> anti-social to the extent Deputy Sweetman suggested.</P>

      <P>Let us take the example given by Deputy Corish.  A person leaves a house, furniture, other contents and other petty free assets valued at £8,000 and a policy for death benefit of another £8,000.  Unless this amendment is passed, that widow will be liable to pay £1,600.  With this amendment she would not.  She would have to pay only about £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Deputy Sweetman is correct.  In the existing circumstances, there is three per cent on an estate of £8,000 and another three per cent on an insurance policy of the same amount, £240 of each, making a total of £480.  Under this section, by which the beneficial estate and the personal estate would <Col N="1678" /> be aggregated, the payment would be £1,600.  Admittedly, in amendment No. 15, which will be a new section, the Minister is giving some concession, about which I am not at the moment clear.  In this particular case the concession, in so far as the estate is over £8,000, will not be applicable.  As Deputy Corish quite rightly remarked, a house with a bit of furniture and perhaps a garage and a few odds and ends, which is not a very big estate, when everything is realised, might make £8,000 and if you take the position of a widow in these circumstances, her liability is being jumped from £480 to £1,600.  The Minister may give reliefs in the lower brackets, which we will come to later on amendment No. 15, but there is no relief, as far as I can gather from the Bill, for a person with that type of estate.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In relation to a policy of assurance to which subsection (1) of section 11 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1889, applies and which was indefeasibly vested in a donee before the commencement of the period (in this section referred to as the relevant period) of five years ending at the death of the assured, the following provisions shall have effect if the assured dies after the passing of this Act and has paid any premiums on the policy during the relevant period:</P>
      <P>(a)  a part of the money received under the policy shall be excluded from the property passing or deemed to pass on the death of the assured and that part shall consist of:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  so much of that money as is equal to the price which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the policy would have fetched if sold in the open <Col N="1681" /> market on the commencement of the relevant period, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  if any of the premiums paid on the policy during the relevant period were premiums not paid by the assured, so much of the balance of that money as bears to the whole of that balance the same proportion as the total of those premiums bears to the total of all the premiums paid on the policy during the relevant period;</P>
    <P>(b)  such part of the money received under the policy as remains after the exclusion under the foregoing paragraph shall be treated for all purposes of estate duty as made up of or including the gifts deemed under the next paragraph to have been made by the assured to the donee,</P>
    <P>(c)  the assured shall be deemed to have made, on each date during the relevant period on which he paid a premium on the policy, a gift to the donee of so much of the part referred to in the foregoing paragraph of the money received under the policy as bears to the whole of that part the same proportion as the premium bears to the total of all the premiums paid by the assured on the policy during the relevant period.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give relief to benefits arising on insurance policies maturing on death.  The manner in which it is proposed to do it is to treat as part of the proceeds proportionate to each of the premiums paid on insurance policies as a form of gift and to treat the last five years as a period in which the gifts <i>inter vivos</i> provisions would operate, but only to assess the last five years' value of the insurance policy for death duty purposes.</P>
      <P>To give a simple case would be the best way to explain it to the House. A policy is worth, say, £1,000 on maturing on the death of the person who pays the premiums.  If, say, £600 was the value of the policy based on the premiums paid up to the commencement of the period of five years before the death, £400 would then be the value of that £1,000 policy for the five years up to the date of death.  I propose to charge only the £400 value but to give relief on the lines of the relieving provision for gifts <i>inter vivos.</i> In other words, 15 per cent of the value in the third year, 30 per cent in the fourth year and 60 per cent in the fifth year.</P>

      <P>This statement will, of course, be slightly wider but, if I am out of order, I am sure the Chair will intervene.  The purpose of section 25 of the Bill is, as the explanatory memorandum stated, a perfectly <Col N="1683" /> general one.  It was not simply to apply aggregation to policies effected under the Married Women's Status Act.  It was to remove from the scope of the proviso to section 4 of the Finance Act, 1894, all property of every kind which passes on a death and was derived from the deceased.</P>
      <P>The proviso, which excluded from aggregation property in which the deceased &ldquo;never had an interest&rdquo; was introduced into the Act of 1894 to prevent an extra burden of estate duty being thrown on a man's estate by the aggregation of property to which he had always been a complete stranger but which would, technically, pass on his death by reason of a settlement by some person who may have been a complete stranger to him.</P>
      <P>Such a case would arise where A settled property upon trust that the trustees should pay the income to B during the life of C and on C's death should transfer the property to D.  On C's death, the property would pass within the meaning of the Finance Act, 1894; and, but for the proviso, it would be aggregable with C's own estate and could cause a higher rate of duty to be payable on that estate than otherwise would be applicable&mdash; although C would never have had an interest in the property.  Section 25 of the Bill preserves the proviso in a case of this sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The proviso has, however, come to be regarded as applying to certain classes of property which have been derived from the deceased himself and which pass by reason of some act, disposition, or payment done or made by him.  In connection with some of these categories the proviso has been used as an avoidance device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Property in the following categories is at present treated as &ldquo;property in which the deceased never had an interest&rdquo; within the meaning of the proviso and accordingly as an estate by itself not aggregable with other property.  Section 25 of the Bill will make them fully aggregable.</P>
    <P>(a)  Death benefits payable under superannuation schemes and which are enforceable in law.  (When these do not exceed £5,000 and go to the widow and dependent children they will be entirely exempt from duty and, therefore, from aggregation with any other property passing on the death.)</P>
    <P>(b)  Policies effected under the Married Women's Status Act and which are indefeasibly vested before the death of the assured.  (A policy which was only contingently vested &mdash;as where it was effected for the benefit of the assured's wife if she should survive him&mdash;was never treated as &ldquo;property in which the deceased never had an interest&rdquo; and was always fully aggregable.) In relation to a Married Women's Status Act policy which is treated as &ldquo;property in which the deceased never had an interest&rdquo; the proviso works as follows.  Assume that the property passing on the death consists of such a policy for £50,000 and free estate of £60,000.  If the proviso did not apply, as it will not under the proposed legislation, the estate duty payable would be £44,000 (40 per cent on £110,000). By the operation of the proviso, the duty is £31,500&mdash;£50,000 at 27 per cent plus £60,000 at 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>(c)  Any other form of property which can be made to vest in a donee the moment it comes into existence.</P>
    <P>A typical example of this is an annuity bond.  This is at present being used for avoidance on a substantial scale.  A man contracts with an insurance company or a broker for the purchase of annuity bonds to be issued to a donee.  These consist of bonds for payment to the donee of either immediate or deferred annuities <Col N="1685" /> for a fixed number of years.  The bonds contracted for have no existence prior to the contract and from the moment of the contract belong to the donee. The bonds have, of course, an immediate surrender value and the donee can surrender them for cash to the insurance company.</P>
    <P>If the purchaser dies within three years&mdash;a period which the Bill increases to five&mdash;of the purchase, there is a dutiable gift <i>inter vivos:</i> the property liable to duty is the property taken by the bonds.  These are &ldquo;property in which the deceased never had an interest&rdquo; and are not aggregable. Moreover, since they are not policies they are not caught by section 12 of the Finance Act, 1955, which makes aggregable <i>inter se</i> all non-aggregable policies passing on a death.  Consequently each bond has to be treated as an estate by itself.</P>
    <P>In an actual case a man, six months before his death, paid an insurance company £180,000 for 15 such bonds to be issued to trustees on behalf of nine donees for whom absolute indefeasible trusts were declared.  Each donee became entitled to three bonds. The loss of duty involved in treating each bond as an estate by itself is over £60,000.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section under which the value, for duty purposes, of a policy indefeasibly vested in a donee will be abated, will give substantial relief in relation to Married Women's Status Act policies.  Although it is not confined to such policies, it will apply to all insurance policies that are donated.  It will operate as follows: If the policy is indefeasibly vested in the donee five years or more prior to the death of the assured, a sum equivalent to the value of the policy five years before the death will be treated as exempt and will, for estate duty purposes, be deducted from the proceeds. The balance of the proceeds will be treated as attributable proportionately to the premiums paid within the five year period; each proportionate part will be treated as a gift <i>inter vivos</i> made when the premium was paid; and, as in the case of other gifts <i>inter vivos</i>, the gift made in the fifth year before death will be abated <Col N="1686" /> by 60 per cent, that made in the fourth year by 30 per cent and that made in the third year by 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the policy is, say, one for £5,000 and has a surrender value of £3,000 five years before the death of the assured, £3,000 of the proceeds will be treated as exempt.  The remaining £2,000 will, if five premiums are paid in the five year period, be treated as comprising five separate gifts of £400 each.  For duty purposes, the notional gift of the fifth year will be abated to £160, that of the fourth year to £280 and that of the third year to £340. Accordingly, instead of £5,000 being liable to estate duty as at present, only £1,580 will be charged on.</P>
    <P>That is possibly a more lucid explanation of what I said <i>extempore</i> at the outset on the section.  I might now, perhaps, revert to the reason for my request for asking leave to amend the words to which I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to the amendment widens the relief because when the deleted words&mdash;these are the words &ldquo;and has paid any premiums on the policy during the relevant period&rdquo;&mdash;were in, the section would operate only when the deceased had paid any premiums during the last five years.  If he had not, for instance, if the policy became fully paid up outside the five year period, the section and therefore the relief would not operate.  That is why I said the omission of these words would give that wider relief which the section proposes to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement about the amendment to his amendment and about the deletion of the words at the end of page 4.  I think that deletion is a good one.  I am concerned, however, about the one anti-social effect there is in this proposal and it was because of that I put down amendment No. 13 but, inadvertently, I put it down to the section instead of putting it down as a proviso at the end of the Minister's amendment.  However, I can discuss it just as well now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand this position&mdash;and I shall take the example that the Minister <Col N="1687" /> has taken in the end&mdash;if a man takes out a policy for £5,000, shall we say, when he is aged 25, marries when he is 26, lives for five years until he is 31 and then, if he dies at 31, we are going back to the surrender value of that policy when he was aged 26, that is, one year after he had taken out the policy.  The surrender value in that case would be virtually negligible.  The surrender value would probably be about £250 and the whole value of the policy, less the surrender value, would be £4,750 which would be liable for duty.  That is the case of a man married four or five years.  Obviously, he has a young family and his widow is in a position of really needing funds to carry on, look after the family, maintain and educate them and it is one of the most needy cases you could have. As I understand the Minister's amendment, in that case £4,750 of the policy would be liable for duty.</P>
    <P>In the other case I am going to suggest where again, say, a man took out a policy at 25 but lived for 30 years until he was 55, presumably then this family would be grown up and settled and there would not be the same necessity to provide for their maintenance, education and benefit as there would be in a young family.  But in that case you go back to the surrender value of the policy as it was at the age of 50 and it is most likely that the value would have been about £4,000 on the figure in question.  Deducting that £4,000, only £1,000 of the policy becomes liable to duty.  It seems to me therefore that the Minister's proposal is anti-social because the young family that needs the money would be taxed more heavily than the family that is grown up and settled in life.  That is a bad method of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>I shall go further and be constructive in relation to this.  The situation could be met to cover a social effect of this kind by providing that it was the surrender value of the policy or the residual value, whichever is the lesser, that would be liable for duty.  If that were done, the case of the young family would be adequately covered. Would the Minister not agree that the effect is as I say?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am speaking <i>extempore</i>; otherwise, I should reciprocate the Minister's courtesy in sending me a copy of his memorandum.  In the case I mentioned where the young husband dies at 31, it is obvious that the need is much greater and that the amount of the surrender value would be only about £250 and the duty would be payable on a value of £4,750.  In the other case, the surrender value would be about £4,000 and the family is grown up and the need not so great and the duty would be on only about £1,000, the residual value.  The Minister could meet the case fairly by adopting my proposal.  I go so far as to say that with the exception of the anti-social effect I mention, his amendment does meet a great deal of difficulty that arises but he could meet it completely by providing that the amount on which duty is payable should be either the surrender value five years before or the amount of the residual value, remaining after deducting the surrender value, whichever is the lesser.  If he did that, it would help the situation immeasurably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister saw&mdash; I saw&mdash;a suggestion in, I think, the <i>Young Farmers' Journal</i> that death duties should be scaled by reference to the age at which we &ldquo;shuffle off this mortal coil.&rdquo; There is much to be said for that because it is in the case of people dying young that real hardship arises.  When people have gone on to a certain age, they have had some chance of making some provision for their dependants even with death duty: where they die young, the expense of the family is immense since a young, growing family has to be educated and there has not been enough time in life to make some provision. <Col N="1689" /> Frankly, it was that suggestion which I saw in a letter in the <i>Young Farmers' Journal</i> that made me frame an amendment to the Minister's amendment. I feel that an amendment on the lines I suggest would be fair and reasonable and meet the case of the young family.  If the Minister were disposed to accept it, I can give him an assurance from these benches that we would be prepared to adjourn consideration of this section until tomorrow and give it to him tomorrow without any discussion, if he would produce the section to meet that particular case.</P>

      <P>I am bringing in the amendments in section 28 to deal with the widow and young children, that is, increasing the amount of the abatement. The amount of the estate that a young person of the type to whom Deputy Sweetman referred, would have to have would be £12,500 or more before there would be a liability for duty.  Under the amendment as it stands, the proposed section on its face provides that £4,750 which Deputy Sweetman assumes would be the value of the policy for the five years before death would be subject to fairly considerable abatement.  Assuming its value for the five years, as in the example I gave, to be £1,000 for each year, that would be £600 abatement in one year added to £300 for the next year and £150 for the next year.</P>

      <P>In page 21, to delete lines 20 to 24 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) This section shall have effect only in cases in which the relevant disposition, surrender, assurance, divesting, determination, or other transaction was made or effected after the 11th day of May 1965.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is in similar terms to an amendment moved on Committee Stage objecting to the retrospective provisions.  We expressed the view then that these provisions should apply only from the date of the introduction of the Budget, 11th May.  The Bill as drafted means that it will apply retrospectively for a period of three years before the passing of the Bill.  A great many people accepted professional advice on the understanding that the law would apply as then in operation and it is our view that the law should not be amended retrospectively in matters of this sort. Although the Minister did quote an extract from a work on taxation, nevertheless it is a general view that it is undesirable to enact legislation dealing with matters of this sort having a retrospective effect.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the section will take effect only in cases in which a disposition or other legal instrument was made or effected after 11th May, 1965, the date of the introduction of the Budget.</P>

      <P>I said during the debate on Committee Stage that if this amendment were accepted, it would introduce new principles in estate duty legislation.  I repeat that it has been the principle of most legislation that it should apply as of the date of death. There is the proviso that it does not go <Col N="1692" /> beyond three years&mdash;that any disposition made three years or more before the passing of the Act will not be caught.  Once the death occurs after the passing of the Act, it is the principle of estate duty legislation that all transactions are caught.  It is consistent with all previous estate duty legislation, consistent not only with the authoritative quotations on tax law I gave on the previous occasion but also with what Deputy Sweetman, as my predecessor, contended in regard to retrospection generally.  It is consistent, <i>pro rata</i>, with previous legislation of this type&mdash;the extension from one to three years within which gifts made were subject to duty.  Mainly on the ground that it would be a breach of the principle in estate duty legislation I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I was not here for the Committee Stage debate on this section.  As I understand it, all those who made wills or dispositions three years before the passing of the Act are all right but the other people caught in the three-year period are not.  They made their wills during this three year period expecting that when the three years had elapsed, they would be free of estate duty.

None of us can make himself live two years longer to avoid a section in an Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put the point that, regardless of the question of precedent, there is the question of justice involved in the idea of retrospection.  I do not think the Minister or Government should feel obliged, because something was done before in a particular way in a Finance <Col N="1695" /> Bill, to continue to do so down through the years invariably.  I do not know whether the Minister has conceded this as retrospective legislation or not.  Certainly, whether the Minister has conceded it or not, it is generally regarded, and accepted, as legislation having a retrospective effect in that it may have the result of upsetting arrangements which were perfectly valid and perfectly lawful at the time they were made.  These arrangements were made on the best professional advice at the time.  The Minister is introducing a section in the Finance Bill which will render those intentions at least partly inoperative by the extension of the period from three to five years.  I would agree that the Minister is quite entitled to fix any period he likes for arrangements entered into, provided the Minister has made his announcement in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question of justice is involved when it comes to interfering with arrangements already made and which at the time they were made had the cloak and sanction of the legislation of this House, and the professional advice that was given to the makers of these arrangements.  I would appeal to the Minister to break away from tradition. Surely this is a case, if any, where the Minister has an opportunity of doing some fresh, dynamic thing on the question of estate duty generally. Surely this is a time when the Minister and the Government should feel that more is called for from them than merely following in the ordinary pattern because it was done in the <Col N="1696" /> 1908, 1909, 1910, or 1918 Act.  I would suggest that the Minister take his courage in his hands and look at it in that light.</P>

    <P>In page 22, between lines 23 and <Col N="1700" /> 24, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(7)  For the purposes of this section, but not further nor otherwise, a legacy to a dependant shall be deemed to carry with it a liability to estate duty on such legacy.</P>
    <P>This follows on an amendment I moved on Committee Stage when I showed the Minister, and he accepted, that in the case of a person with an estate of £15,000 and a widow and three children, if his will were drawn so that if he left to each of his three children £2,000 and the residue to the wife he would get only £150&mdash;now £250&mdash;whereas if he left his estate as to two-fifteenths to each child and nine-fifteenths to the wife, which is exactly the same thing, he would get the larger concession.  I think it is wrong that a concession such as this should be dependent on such a technicality. The Minister was not prepared to accept this because he suggested that to do so might leave it open to abuse.  I have suggested in this amendment that to provide that a legacy of the kind I indicated would be treated as carrying a liability for estate duty for the purposes of the section and, accordingly, the technicality would not operate to prevent the concession and would operate to prevent any possibility of avoidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been reconsidered on the redraft of Deputy Sweetman's amendment.  Even yet I am not satisfied that what the amendment tries to achieve would not be relieving people who may not be entitled to relief in the spirit of the amendment.  It would certainly provide an opening to give relief to non-dependants, for example, where a non-dependant was a residuary legatee.  I want to say, as I said at the start, that if a will is drawn in such a fashion as at first sight to preclude the abatement provisions applying, it could easily be drawn in such a way, by specific reference to these bequests that are made to the children, as to ensure that all the abatements provided would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that I am <Col N="1701" /> conscious of the odd case that might arise where a solicitor having drawn a will may not advert to the reliefs that have been given in the section or to the circumstances in which reliefs may be obtained.  But, in order to ensure that there is the widest possible knowledge amongst legal practitioners as to what the section purports to do, I suggest that the Incorporated Law Society might consult with the Revenue Commissioners, with a view to ensuring that solicitors will be fully informed as to the manner in which the abatement provisions can be fully availed of in drawing wills.  The Revenue Commissioners are quite willing to discuss with the Incorporated Law Society means of bringing this to the attention of solicitors so that the beneficial effects of the section will be fully operative.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 22, between lines 33 and 34, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty upon an account of property or an interest ceasing on death to which sections 20 and 21 of this Act apply or the duty due upon an account of chattels real, may, at the option of the person delivering the account, be paid by eight equal yearly instalments or sixteen half-yearly instalments with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date at which the first instalment is due and such instalment shall be due at the expiration of one year from the death, and the interest on the unpaid portion of the duty shall be added to each instalment and paid accordingly; but the duty for the time being unpaid with such interest to the date of payment may be paid at any time, and in case the property <Col N="1703" /> is sold, shall be paid on completion of the sale.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this amendment is covered by an earlier one.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow duty on property affected by sections 20 and 21 in respect of duty to be paid by instalments, to be paid either by eight equal yearly or 16 half-yearly instalments with interest at four per cent.  If the property is sold, payment can be made on completion of the sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, that way of paying death duty is confined to agricultural land.  To extend it to chattels real would create many difficulties and I do not think there is any good reason why it should be extended to leasehold property.  If we did extend it to that type of property, there would be demand for extending that method of payment to duty on other types of property.  Unfortunately, I have to adopt the same attitude as I did on Committee Stage of the Bill in resisting the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 12, to insert &ldquo;(other than a contract with respect to which the Revenue Commissioners, or on appeal the Special Commissioners, are satisfied that the disponer had no knowledge of its existence and that he had no reason for thinking that it existed)&rdquo; after &ldquo;contract&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are coming to the section dealing with the taxing of profits on land development.  Section 41 (2) (b) refers to the disposal of an interest in land by a person to some other person associated with him, perhaps in conditions in which it is obvious that he proposes to derive benefit from the <Col N="1704" /> ultimate development of that land. The purpose of section 41 is to ensure that where persons dispose of land in one form or another and maintain an interest in the development of the land, for example, a person selling or leasing a portion of his land to people who have entered into a contract with a builder to build houses on the land and the houses having been built, leases will be granted reserving fines on the portion of the land on which these separate houses are built.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that there is no intention in the section of making liable to income tax in such transactions persons who made genuine sales of their property.  The purpose of this amendment is to make that doubly sure by, on its very face, stating that the disponer had no knowledge of the existence of a contract or had no reason for thinking that a contract existed.  I think that, in this manner, I have gone the full way to meet the objections raised to the subsection as it stood and the genuine fears expressed by many of the Deputies opposite about the effect of the section as it stood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise three points on this.  First, is it clear that there is an appeal from the Special Commissioners to the Circuit Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all to the good.  Secondly, is it not unusual, to put it mildly, in a taxation statute to say that the taxpayer shall be judged guilty until he proves himself innocent, which is what this does?  This says that the taxpayer shall be guilty and have to pay the tax unless he proves himself innocent.  That seems to me, to put it mildly, a most unusual provision in our taxation code.  I should be very interested indeed to hear from the Minister of any single other section in any part of our tax code which puts the same burden of proof on the taxpayer.  Thirdly, I find it difficult to see how a person who has property and sells it to a firm of builders is not to be deemed to have reason to <Col N="1705" /> think that there is the intention to develop and the contract for development that is visualised in the section.</P>
      <P>I admit at once that the amendment is some improvement on the section but I do not think it goes adequately far.  It is desirable that there should be an appeal of the kind indicated. To that extent, it is good.  However, it is all wrong that the burden of proof should be put upon a taxpayer so that he will be liable to pay tax unless he disproves that he is liable.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister ever heard a story about what happened a certain very nosey inspector of taxes at the time when the Harcourt Street Railway was in operation and there were, many years ago, railway carriages which had a partition only about two-thirds of the way up so that one could hear clearly everything that was being said in the next-door carriage, though one could not necessarily see who was saying it.  This inspector made a practice of raising assessments and leaving the taxpayer at the expense of fighting assessment, whether or not it was justified.  Accordingly, two people decided they would teach him a lesson. They got into one of those carriages after he had got into the adjacent one, and they carried out a loud conversation all about how a certain person had been getting away with murder in relation to his tax appeals over mentioned specific things.  It is about 35 years since I first heard the story so that nobody who was present there can in any way be taken to task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happened that the inspector went off chortling to his office the next morning and issued an assessment straight away against the man who had been talking so loudly.  The taxpayer decided he would make it an even better lesson.  He appealed against the assessment and, when it went to the Special Commissioners, did not make any substantial argument but appealed to the Circuit Court judge and told him the entire story.  That inspector left with a very red face.  He did not go around the golf club in the same way afterwards trying to pry into people's affairs.  I am sure that would not be done in present times but the effect of this section is roughly the same, that <Col N="1706" /> the taxpayer has to prove that the story that was told was not true.</P>
    <P>I do not like the amendment on that account, though I do agree that it gives slightly more chance to the taxpayer than the original section.  It seems to me that the section needs to be dealt with more radically by way of an amendment to ensure that the sale by a person&mdash;where it is an out and out sale&mdash;is not caught and that there is nothing of the element of the capital gains tax in the transaction.  I take it that what the Minister intended a second ago was to say that there is no capital gains tax element in this.  On the last occasion, when he spoke about the values of land increasing, he rather gave some impression that he had a capital gains tax in his mind.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's withdrawal of that particular remark on that occasion, but, as he said it, it certainly implied it and shook many people very much in the interpretation of the section.  The amendment is an improvement except for the precedent it creates in that respect.  Being a Report Stage, we cannot do very much more about it but something on the lines of amendment No. 40 seems to me more desirable for the section as a whole.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy Sweetman that there is no question of finding the potential taxpayer guilty in advance.  If the taxpayer asserts he has no knowledge of the transaction, then I suggest the onus of proof is thrown on to the Revenue Commissioners.  As Deputy Sweetman has indicated, the matter is subject to appeal to the Circuit Court in the ordinary way.  I want to assure the House that the type of case that is being set out here is that of the man who lets a builder in on his land and <Col N="1707" /> makes no disposition at that stage.  The builder makes an arrangement with his clients and gives a number of plots to those clients to erect houses on them and the landowner then gives leases and imposes fines and all kinds of payments.  Therefore, he is in with the builder on this type of development. The man who makes a sale without any knowledge of the contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 30:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 28 and 29, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) a business of dealing in or developing land shall not be deemed to be carried on where the person so disposing of the same had been in occupation thereof for the whole of the three years prior to such disposal as his only or main residence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is again to safeguard the position where a person has not, and could not be said to have, bought for the purpose of development and had in fact sold or agreed to sell a house which genuinely was his own residence, getting as a result an accretion in value.  It is to ensure that there should not then be an imposition of tax on that.  The test I suggest in the amendment is a three year test prior to the disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the purpose of the Deputy's amendment, it is not necessary.  Under subsection (3) (b) (ii), a person who has a house like that constructed for him, if he occupies that house for substantially the whole of the period from the time it was built until its disposal, no matter how short that period is, will not be caught by the tax provision here.  The amendment as drafted would cover one type of the cases the section as a whole wants to catch.  It has been known that people in the building business build a house, occupy it, live in it for a while and then pass on, having built another <Col N="1709" /> house and occupied that, selling the houses as they go along.  It is possible that such a person could occupy a house built by him in that way for the period of three years, dispose of it, build another house and dispose of that in the same way.  I suggest that in any event the exclusion provided for in subsection (3) (b) (ii) is sufficient to cover the type of case the Deputy has in mind.</P>

There is considerable concern about the actual meaning of the phrase &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; and it has been suggested to me that the word &ldquo;developed&rdquo; would be more appropriate and should be inserted.  The impression is that there is ambiguity <Col N="1711" /> about the definition of the two words as phrased, that a person might do a particular work without necessarily constructing or reconstructing, and that if certain preparatory work were carried out, while not involving construction or reconstruction of property, the work undertaken would be in pursuance of the ultimate objective of developing the property.

I know the type of holiday residence Deputies Cosgrave and O'Higgins have in mind, the usual seaside bungalow, or a place like that, which a man having a city residence can occupy for perhaps only a limited period of the year or only a limited period of the summer and would have to let occasionally.  If he sees fit for any reason either of choice or necessity, to dispose of it then, a later amendment I propose to introduce will relieve that man of any liability in respect of any profit up to £1,500.  That is an amendment to section 43.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 20 and 21, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  This section shall not apply to any individual who occupied the land and/or buildings in question for his exclusive occupation or that of his parent or child for one year prior to the 11th May, 1965.</P>
      <P>The amendment arises in respect of a case I put to the Minister across the House that this section should not, in any circumstances, affect a person who had been genuinely living on the premises at the date of the Budget, the date when the announcement was made in relation to the provisions of this part of the Bill.  I understood the Minister at the time to indicate across the House that he was prepared to accept such an amendment.  However, I saw no amendment put down by him to that effect and hence I put down amendment No. 40.  In view of that, I might, perhaps, be permitted to suggest one of the reasons why I regard it as so necessary to pass some amendment like this.  This is to provide that where a person was living on the premises on Budget day the provisions of the section will not apply to him. I appreciate it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove where a man was actually living on one day.  Therefore, I provided for a period of a year before that date.  I think it is too long but I wanted to err in being generous to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I believe this is necessary is that I am frightened of the provisions of subsection (2), line 15 on page 32 of this section, where the word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; is met.  That word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; can be made to mean anything that it is desired to make it mean for the purpose of catching a person under this section.  The second reason why I am worried about this section is that it appears that it will clearly apply in the case of compulsory acquisition.  It is ridiculous to suggest that there should be a liability created to income tax, corporation profits tax if it is a company or surtax if it is an individual, in a case where <Col N="1718" /> the interest has not been sold voluntarily but has been acquired compulsorily.</P>
    <P>The third type of case which I am afraid may be caught by this section and another reason why I think the new subsection is necessary is that the section as it is drafted appears to apply to the purchase by an individual in possession of superior interests or intermediate interests.  If the individual who is in possesion buys out the ground rent, the owners of the ground rent and the superior rent beyond that ground rent could under this section be treated as being liable for something that is not development or trading in the slightest sense of the words.  I expect that it is not intended to catch them but I am afraid the section, as it is drafted, does catch them.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the section as drafted because it will undoubtedly in some cases&mdash;I admit frankly not a very great proportion of cases&mdash;create untold hardship.  As I read the section and this part of the Bill, if a tenant for life is in possession of land as a life interest and the land is sold for development, then the assessment must be made on that tenant for life though the purchase money for the land is received by the trustees.  The tenant for life gets a large assessment for income tax and surtax but the trustees receive the purchase money.  That seems all wrong and at the very least there should have been a saver in the section to provide that the tenant for life would be entitled to be reimbursed by the trustees the heavy tax liability that could be involved.  If that is not done, the Minister can be assured that no tenant for life will in any circumstances ever sell his land for building.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned here on the last occasion, and as we are, I think, all agreed, one of the great difficulties at present in relation to housing is that there is far too little building land, particularly on and near the building perimeter.  The next reason for my thinking it is necessary to have some sort of amendment to this section is that I am worried about the provisions in relation to the valuation going back <Col N="1719" /> for a period of five years.  Where a lease is running out, the value of the lessor has increased very, very rapidly in the last few years and that value increasing in the last five years, will, in effect, certainly mean, as the section stands at present, a capital gains tax. I do not think it is right that that should operate.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the section because, if it is passed in its present form, and without amendment, we then go on to section 42 to compute the measure of the tax.  For the life of me I cannot understand what subsection (2) (b) (iii) means.  Does it mean developed before or after the passing of this Act?  I understand that senior counsel has advised that it is beyond his wit to ascertain and direct what it means.  As I say, it is not the section we are discussing; it is the means by which the liability under the section we are discussing is computed. One of the things about this whole section is the fact that the time is not fixed.  I am not clear what period or passage of time is intended. Certainly, I am far from clear as to what time is effectively provided by the section.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I think it is essential to ensure at least that everybody who is in occupation at the date of the passage of the Act will be excluded.  If that is done the only people who could be affected would be those who acquire an interest after the passing of the Bill.  We have taken up to the 31st July and that is up to the 1st August.  If that is so, then the number of cases in which there would be a sale between now and the next Finance Bill would be very trifling and we would consider the position again then.  The Minister will agree with me, I think, when I say that it is most unfortunate that a wide Part of a Bill of this nature should be discussed in circumstances in which it is not possible to give the fullest publicity to the debates in this House and to explanations given by the Minister. In particular, it is not possible for the debates to be available in printed form to anyone who is trying to understand what is in this highly <Col N="1720" /> technical Part, a Part, I think I could safely say, that is ploughing to a large extent entirely new ground and ground with which many of us are not familiar. I think there is, therefore, a very strong argument for saying that everyone who is in <i>bona fide</i> occupation at the date of the Budget should be completely excluded, if he is an individual.  Of course, if it is a company I can understand the Minister's view that occupation by a company is technical occupation as a pre-development idea or pre-development dodge, if one likes to use that expression.</P>
    <P>Rightly, or wrongly, this Part of the Bill has caused very great uneasiness throughout the community and part of that uneasiness is, I think, because there has not been the kind of publicity there should have been, with the possibility of examining home the various implications of the Bill.  As I say, if it were restricted to anyone who acquired after the Budget speech we would have the breathing space the country wants of the 12 months until the next Finance Bill for the purpose of considering the problem.  I understood the Minister to accept the principle of this amendment on the Committee Stage.  In fact, I think he did accept it, but I am sorry to realise now, since he has not seen fit to introduce an amendment, that he must have had second thoughts in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Sweetman's amendment and the views he expressed.  It is true to say, and this is no exaggeration, that this section has frightened the people.  They do not know precisely at what it is aimed.  They feel its effect could be disastrous for many who have never dealt in or contemplated dealing in a speculative way in property purchases.  In his Second Reading speech the Minister told us that the object of the section was to deal with a particular example of tax dodging.  Like so many other things, what is put forward as the excuse for the introduction of a section results, in fact, in a profound change in the law. We have endeavoured to examine this section line by line and to amend as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section goes much further than <Col N="1721" /> merely dealing with the example of tax dodging which the Minister mentioned on an earlier part of the Bill.  There are people all over the country who feel that what may be their only asset will be seriously affected by the Bill.  If, because of a change in family circumstances, they wish to dispose of that asset, they feel that here is a legislative instrument which will foist on them a load of taxation they never expected to have to meet.  I know the Minister says that is not the object.  I know it has been said that this will deal only with the man who speculates in property.  But the wording of the section is so wide we feel a burden of taxation, which is not socially just, may be imposed on a great many people.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Sweetman seeks in his amendment is eminently reasonable.  It is in accord with our view that there should not be retrospection, that one should not change laws and conditions that people have come to expect.  It is certainly reasonable to say that this section shall start as from a particular date and that there should be excluded from it people who were in <i>bona fide</i> occupation of their property prior to the Budget Statement of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to meet in some way the point of view expressed in this amendment because there is considerable worry and anxiety about this provision and people are frightened.  If there is that situation, something should be done about it. The danger is that there will be a complete recession from the point of view of land being available for worthwhile development and that, in present circumstances, would not be good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that what I said in relation to subsection (2) (b) would have reasonably reassured Deputies about the sale of land, genuine sales to people, which is subsequently developed and the development is not subject to a contract of which the vendor was aware before sale.  I should agree with Deputy Sweetman that I thought the suggestion he put to me on Committee Stage <Col N="1722" /> was worthy of further consideration, that it was not unreasonable and I probably used some words to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But when I looked at the import of the amendment, I discovered that it would open the way to evasion or avoidance to a considerable degree.  The proposition put by Deputy O'Higgins now would seem to suggest that once an avoidance device is set up and in operation, we ought not change the law to catch it. That is what happens in all Finance Acts.  On the wording of the amendment, it would be possible for a person, although not a company, to be a builder of some substance, who, having bought a house and say, 20, 30, 40 or 50 acres of land, stayed in occupation of it for just one year or had it in the occupation of his parent or child, to proceed to develop it and would be absolutely free from income tax on the profits.  That would open the door to considerable avoidance of income tax.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Sweetman's fears are concerned, and he mentioned four or five, I shall deal first with the use of the word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; in subsection (2).  This is an arrangement or some transaction of which the vendor would be expected to have knowledge and it would have to be proved that this was so by the Revenue Commissioners.  I was concerned about the difficulties in the case of a compulsory acquisition, and having revised the section fairly fully, I felt it would be unusual, to say the least of it, that a local authority which is usually the type that would carry out compulsory acquisition, would have made a contract in advance for the development of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I had some sympathy with the fears raised in this connection but what I propose to do is this: let the section stand as it is and watch the situation, and if it did develop in such a way as to charge a person to tax who had to sell property acquired compulsorily by a local authority, then I can have a look at it again and, if necessary, give whatever provision would be involved in such a case retrospective effect to relieve a person who might be caught. Under the provision as it stands, I do not envisage that a person would be caught.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman also mentioned the case of a tenant for life but I do not think in such a case the tenant for life is likely to be caught, having regard to the provision of subsection (1) of section 41 which refers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Either.  If it helps the Deputy, I could read the part of the brief dealing with paragraph (f) as a whole:</P>
      <P>A person might have acquired land, by purchase or otherwise, fifteen years ago, say.  At the time when he acquired it he might not have been engaged in dealing in or developing land.  He might, for example, have utilised the land for a number of years afterwards for agriculture.  If at a later stage he developed the land by building, it would be inequitable to take the original value of the lands as trading stock in his accounts.  The broad effect of this paragraph is that, if the person sets about developing or disposing of the land within five years from the time he acquired it, the actual cost of acquisition or, where the land was not purchased the market value at the time of acquisition is to be the initial valuation of the land as trading stock. In any other case the initial valuation is to be the market value five years before the person embarks on development.</P>
      <P>These are all the points that were raised.  For the reasons I have mentioned initially, in particular the prospect of evasion that acceptance of the amendments would open up, I will have to resist them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 56, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following new section before section 63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  This section applies to a gift of money which, on or after the 6th day of April, 1965, is made to the Minister for Finance for use for any purposes for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided and which is accepted by that Minister.</P>
      <P>In this subsection &ldquo;public moneys&rdquo; means moneys charged on or issued out of the Central Fund or provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a person who has made a gift to which this section applies <Col N="1733" /> claims relief from tax by reference thereto, the following provisions of this section shall have effect.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of income tax (including sur-tax) for the year of assessment in which the person makes the gift, the amount thereof shall be deducted from or set off against any income of the person chargeable to tax for that year and tax shall, where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person or, where the person is a married woman whose income is deemed to be the income of her husband, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly.</P>
    <P>In this subsection &ldquo;total income&rdquo; means total income from all sources estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a gift to which this section applies is made by a company, the amount thereof shall be allowed as a deduction in computing for the purposes of corporation profits tax the profits of the company arising in the accounting period in which the gift is made.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which I sought leave to introduce on Committee Stage to provide relief for gifts by people who want to make such gifts for a purpose for which State expenditure would otherwise have to be incurred out of voted moneys.  In order to take advantage of one particular gift&mdash;and probably many others, I hope&mdash;it is desirable that we should give the relief in this amendment which seeks to introduce a new section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before paragraph (b) to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>( ) require manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to notify the Minister of any proposed increases in the prices charged by them for their commodities.</P>
      <P>We welcomed this Bill as a delayed effort by the Government to correct a situation which we believed would develop in the autumn of 1963 and which we saw developing over the past 12 to 18 months, during which period the Minister for Industry and Commerce resisted all attempts to introduce any new machinery for price control or, for that matter, to use the machinery that was available to him under the Prices Act, 1958.  However, it is a change of heart by the Government. This measure is being introduced because, as the Taoiseach said on behalf of the Government, the situation was such as to warrant new machinery to curb ever-increaslng prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> We believe that the Bill with certain amendments can be much more effective than it is in its present form. We believe also that it seems from some of the remarks of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who spoke here last week, that it may not be the intention to use even the powers embodied in the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1965.  For that reason, I move on behalf of the Labour Party an amendment to section 1 although, of course, the whole Bill is merely one section.  We propose a new paragraph to require manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to notify the Minister of any proposed increases in the prices charged by them for their commodities.  I think it is necessary that the Minister should have this power because, in the first place, it would be somewhat of a deterrent to those who regulate prices not to do so in any unjust or unfair way.  We know how prices have got out of hand in the past 18 months but we are not satisfied that there is a proper awareness within the Department of Industry and Commerce of numerous price increases.</P>
    <P>I do not know very much about the machinery the Minister for Industry and Commerce has within his Department for the seeking out of price increases and their notification to him. It does not seem to me that those in the Department of Industry and Commerce have been over-industrious.  I do not say they have been negligent, but it seems that price increases do not come to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce until a certain amount of damage has been done.  On occasions here in this House we have had to query the Minister by way of parliamentary question about the increase in the price of a certain commodity and in many cases the Minister tells us he has not received any complaints. I am not necessarily referring to the present Minister as he is not long enough in his present office.  But, we said to his predecessor for a long time that people who believed they were being overcharged should take out their pens or pencils and write immediately to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They do not do that.  They complain to us, as I am <Col N="1738" /> sure they complain to the members of their own Party, expecting that these price increases will be brought to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that there should be an obligation on manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to notify any increases in prices charged for their particular commodities. Somebody might ask why we did not include retailers.  I do not think it would be a practical suggestion to ask retailers in every shop in the country to notify price increases, even though it must be conceded in certain instances that prices by retailers have been increased unduly.  In any case, the main point is that it takes a long time for price increases to come to the notice of the Minister.  If that is not correct, I should like to hear evidence to the contrary.</P>
    <P>As far as prices are concerned, we know some of the causes why they increased over the last 12 to 18 months. We concede immediately that the increase in wages must reflect itself to some extent in increases in prices.  We recognise also that when the turnover tax was introduced prices increased further so that compensation would be given to manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers for this particular tax. But I think it must be said also that in very many cases when such a tax as the turnover tax is introduced, when there is a round of wage increases, that unfair advantage is taken of these occasions by the application of increases over and above what would normally compensate for such a tax as this and for such a wage round.</P>
    <P>Briefly, therefore.  I should like to submit on behalf of my Party that the Minister should in section 1 of the Bill take power to require manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to notify him of any increase.  After all, this measure has been introduced because the Taoiseach regarded the present situation as somewhat of an emergency.  It might be considered to be an unusual stipulation at an ordinary time but if the holding down of prices is so vital, I think a contributory factor in this would be to <Col N="1739" /> insist that the people mentioned in the amendment would notify any price increases to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My position in the Opposition in relation to this amendment is in line with our policy document which was issued some time ago when we advocated investigation of prices.  I do not feel it would impose hardship on manufacturers or wholesalers to request them to notify the Department of Industry and Commerce of price increases.  It means, as Deputy Corish pointed out, that the information is in the Department immediately the price increase starts and it means, in fact, that the sort of prices that were debated in the Taoiseach's Estimate together with the Prices (Amendment) Bill last week could, perhaps, be foreseen and steps could be taken to do something about them.  We do not think it is too onerous a task either. A lot of the work of notification of prices could be done through the Wholesalers Association, FUE, and the Federation of Irish Industries.</P>
      <P>All these bodies could very easily notify the Department of Industry and Commerce of price increases in their various spheres of operation.  These increases do not have to be placarded all over the place to be criticised, perhaps, correctly criticised.  They are merely at the behest and for the information of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who can then watch the barometer and see the guide-posts being established so that he can take steps when such steps are necessary to control prices.  We on this side of the House support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the amendment to section 1 on page 3, as Deputy Corish has said, it will be extremely difficult to have any notification at the retail level.  It will be quite impossible to have any sort of system in operation regarding price changes at the retail level where lt hits the housewife and where the increased cost is felt almost immediately. It would be impossible to have <Col N="1740" /> any machinery of notification for that level.  Therefore, we have suggested that at least at the levels of manufacture, wholesale and import there will be machinery for notification.</P>
      <P>We have been accused of being retrospective in our criticism of this Bill but the timing element is essential if a Prices Bill is to be satisfactory. Our main criticism is that the timing was wrong and that the Bill came after the real damage was done.  The Government may consider it uncharitable of me to say that one way of looking at this Bill is that it is a figleaf to hide the nakedness and inactivity of the Government in attacking rising prices during the lifetime of the national agreement.  This was not without warning from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There are letters on record from the Congress asking that action be taken immediately.  They pointed out that if the prospects of any national agreement were to be salvaged and if such agreement were to be successful as a means of arranging wages in the future, the question of prices must immediately be looked at.  These overtures were ignored.  We have been asked for our support in the matter of prices.  We were told that competition would regulate them.  Competition has not been sufficient to regulate prices and we now have this Bill.  We would regard it as insincere on our part if we did not try to weigh in and to give this Bill some power.  That is why we have brought in these amendments.</P>
      <P>We must divide the level of prices, the area of action, that we will take. The Minister will have an Order for prices.  We have chosen the base of wholesale, manufacture and import. Quite a weight of the increases that have occurred lie in the agricultural sector.  It is obvious that world trends in the price of beef, for example, will have to be taken into account.  You will have to have economists to keep an eye on the changes.  I think we would have nothing significant to say on prices unless we watched the imports factor very carefully and considered how the economy would be affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the wholesale level, we think we <Col N="1741" /> should try to be notified about changes. This would fill out our information about any changes that might be coming in the price structure ahead. If we could introduce almost a screen about prices and pick off any movement in prices over the spectrum between manufacture and imports, and if we could watch the movement in the three areas I have mentioned, it would dispel the mystery of an increase occurring at the retail stage without any prior warning.</P>
    <P>Already the price movement of the soap manufacturers is to be seen.  They have made overtures in respect of an increase in the price of soap.  It is at the wholesale level that the increase will be made and therefore it is of importance that action be taken at that level.  Briefly, what we have sought to do was to attack increasing prices at three different points, to have specialised information available at these three points, the only realistic points from which we can have information&mdash;the import, wholesale and manufacturing levels.  As the House is aware, they have had difficulty in Britain at the level of maintenance resale price on the aspect of governing prices at the manufacturing level.  It is something that we here would also want to watch.  These are the checkpoints that we suggest should be watched and it is in that spirit that we put them forward on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it would be weak if specialised information were not available from these three points.  It would mean that our Bill lacked the technical information necessary if effective action is to be taken in time before a mysterious increase hits our retail costs when, as at the moment, we begin to work back retrospectively for the origin of the cost increase.  Any manufacturer can get a pretty convincing alibi if our investigations begin on a retrospective basis, that is, if we work back from an established fact of a cost increase.  Therefore, we suggest that at those points of origin of increase in cost&mdash;manufacture, wholesale and import&mdash;it should be read into the <Col N="1742" /> Act that there be channels of notification available to use in respect of those changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister may answer that, by order, he can conceivably do many of the things here that we should prefer to see spelled out in black and white in the Act &mdash; what should be done, rather than the Minister's discretion being the only shield between us and rising prices.  In the past, Ministerial discretion and Ministerial action have not been sufficient to ward off increasing prices.  It is rather a sorry thing to say that canned fruits, jams and marmalades and a few houses out here in Raheny have been investigated for price increases when the whole economy is tottering with price increases.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations are in a turmoil because the cost of living has gone up to an unprecedented degree and there has been no firm action to withstand it.  Consequently, the trade unions are put in the position of trying to answer for their members in the present crisis situation.  Up and down the country, sections are asking for cost of living increases.  The answer, after official questions, is that they must wait for another 12 months for the expiry of the national agreement.  The Labour Party have only 22 Deputies and there are Parties in Dáil Éireann larger than a Party of 22 Deputies.  It is late in the day.  However, we should not be true to our policy unless we backed to the hilt any moves towards getting some form of price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to add a word to what my colleagues have said on this matter.  The amendment is put down primarily to ensure some form of restraint on those who would contemplate unfair price increases and, in an atmosphere where competition would seem to be non-existent in many spheres of commerce and industrial activity in this country, it is right and proper that a measure of this kind should be adopted.  I think the Government have been forced to bring in this measure because at last they have been convinced that competition has not had the effect of keeping prices steady.  The facts are that as a result of the admonitions of the Government <Col N="1743" /> in contemplation of our entry into the Common Market very many groups have merged together.  In industry and agriculture, we have seen grouping, merging and interlocking&mdash;a coming together to enter a Common Market of some 200 million people.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, I am coming to this question of prices.  These groups, rings and cartels have been known to fix prices in this country.  Is there not evidence of price fixing in respect of the very staff of life&mdash;bread and flour?  In respect of petrol, drink, clothing and numerous other items, there is evidence of a lack of competition and the coming together of cliques and groups who determine their prices in advance and foist those prices on the general public.  It must be admitted that where competition ceases in such an atmosphere, there is a moral obligation on the Government to intervene.</P>

      <P>If the Government are sincere in their wish to restrain price increases, they must accept this amendment, because it is only right and proper that there should be notification. If there is not notification, we will have the same free-for-all and grab-all-you-can atmosphere which we in the Labour Party deplore.  In this grab-all-you-can atmosphere social justice cannot be done to any group in our society.  That is why this amendment has been tabled by us.</P>

      <P>When considering this amendment, we should keep in mind what the Taoiseach said in introducing this Bill.  As I understood him, he advocated that everybody should co-operate to ensure we got over this present crisis.  We are not submitting this amendment in an attempt to <Col N="1744" /> chastise the Government or the Minister in any way.  Rather is it a serious attempt to have price control operated in a positive fashion.  There is no use locking the stable door when the horse has gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party, who undoubtedly represent the trade union movement, have been expected to bring about some sort of order in the country, especially in our ranks.  Trade unions are often called upon to play their part in overcoming a crisis.  We in the trade union movement are a party to the National Wage Agreement.  In that agreement, there is provision for notice of intention and provision for the expiration of time within which any further wage increases can be granted.  What we are asking here is quite reasonable.  We are asking the Minister to arrange that the people who are setting about increasing prices should give notice of their intention.  Trade unions must now submit to their respective councils notice of intention that they are going to enter into a trade dispute.</P>
      <P>We hold that this amendment is absolutely reasonable and will make this Prices Bill into something positive. If it is not accepted, the people in the trade union movement will not take for granted the intention of the Government in respect of price control. They will want to know for sure that every precaution will be taken to ensure that prices do not rise.  Surely it is not unreasonable to require manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to advise the Minister of their intention to increase prices?</P>
      <P>There is another good reason for this.  The Prices Section in the Minister's Department is a small one.  In order to enable the small band of men who will be dealing with this to ensure that if prices are to be increased, the case is made in advance, notice of intention should be given.  In the Labour Court workers have to make a case for an increase in wages.  In the same way employers should be called on to make a case for an increase in prices.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House at this hour on this amendment.  I stand up primarily to suggest that this is an amendment on which we should have the Minister's mind.  It would be helpful to all sides if the Minister would intervene and let us know if from his point of view, from the administrative point of view and any other point of view, there is any difficulty about the suggestion made here.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Donegan pointed out, it does not on the face of it appear to be an onerous requirement.  We have suggested this idea of notification, but we have done it in the context of a general prices and incomes policy.  If we were satisfied there would be an approach to a general prices and incomes policy which would establish the type of guide post of which Deputy Donegan spoke, then the suggestion put forward in this amendment might be one which could be extremely useful.  On the other hand, if it is simply left and so described as a single tooth in a particular Prices Bill its value is to that extent greatly diminished.  It seems to me it is a matter about which the Minister and his Department should have very pronounced views, which I would urge on the Minister to give to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party tabled this amendment to ensure that manufacturers, wholesalers and importers would notify proposals to increase prices.  The Labour Party had a very simple objective in putting it down. The Labour Party supported the Bill on Second Stage and indicated their support of price control machinery and welcomed the belated action of the Government and the Minister on the question of imposing price control.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party were not satisfied with a Bill that said the Minister would have power to impose price control or to do this, that or the other thing.  We are anxious to see that the measures to bring about price control in the interests of the ordinary citizen will have teeth in them.  This amendment is one of the suggestions being made towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what has happened since <Col N="1746" /> February, 1964, it is quite clear that it is not realistic to think in terms of price control or investigation of price increases weeks and months after prices have been increased.  Prices have gone up.  While many people have been inclined to place the blame for that on wage and salary increases, let us face the facts.  Of the approximate increase in prices of some 11 per cent since the negotiations leading to the ninth round adjustment, not more than two per cent can be attributed to increased wages and salaries.  The greater part of the price increases was the result of unilateral decisions to increase prices; some of the increases were the result of the policy of this Government, possibly even of this House; some of them possibly arose as a result of increases in the price of imported raw materials.</P>
    <P>No one in these benches would contend that if prices of raw materials, particularly imported raw materials, increase substantially, you can automatically clamp down on prices.  We are concerned with the fact that prices have gone up and are still going up. We are concerned to ensure that if the Minister and the Government, in introducing this measure, are sincerely anxious to do something constructive about the matter, they should get the support and help of the House.  The amendment is primarily for the purpose of ensuring that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have the necessary information.  The responsibility would be put on manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to notify the Minister of their intentions so that remedial measures may be taken at an early stage, so that investigation may take place at an early stage and so that decisions would not be taken weeks or months subsequent to the higher prices being charged in the shops, as has been the pattern so far, particularly in the past few months.  Week after week, increased prices appeared in the shops. The housewives, whether in urban areas, city areas or rural areas, were faced with that position at weekends. The suggestion has been that workers, in securing wage and salary increases, <Col N="1747" /> are responsible.  The responsibility is not theirs.</P>
    <P>We think this is an amendment which should recommend itself to the Minister.  At least, the Minister should indicate here that he accepts the principle of the amendment.  If there is a question of some administrative difficulty, certainly he will get support from all sides of the House and will be given whatever assistance is necessary to make the amendment effective. If manufacturers and, in particular, importers, pass on increased prices without comment, without report, without information, then the eventual sufferers, the ordinary citizens with families, will not get the protection this Bill should give them.</P>

      <P>I rise before the Minister intervenes merely to say that I should like to clarify for the second time the position of this Party and to say that price control was in our policy, that it was announced before the election. If Deputy O'Leary will not mind my saying so, I do not know of any better time to make an announcement than before an election.  I do not make any apology for that particular decision. It is in friendly fashion that I am saying this.</P>
      <P>The position is that we on this side of the House are supporting this amendment for that reason.  We are not suggesting that profits have been excessive or that prices have been raised excessively over the past six or 12 months.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into an argument as to whether or not they did.  We are merely saying that this is not an onerous duty.  Associations could very easily notify these prices.  It would mean that prior information would always be available to the Minister.  This is the only reason we are doing it.  We are not being flamboyant or extravagant about it.  We are not exaggerating.  We merely think it is an ordinary business step that should be taken in the Oireachtas <Col N="1748" /> and does not call for any extravagant statements or suggestions that there have been any excessive prices.  I am not saying that anybody has done this. I am merely trying to get it across that we are supporting the amendment for that reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy thinks it is OK.  We have introduced the amendment because we believe that unless it is carried and incorporated in the Bill, there will continue to be excessive prices and we believe excessive prices need not have taken place if a Bill with such a section as is suggested in the amendment had been introduced.</P>
      <P>As to the question of when it became policy, it has always been Labour policy to keep prices down to a reasonable level, and if Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil like to borrow that policy for the occasion of a general election, then they are welcome to it and I am glad they are sufficiently consistent to support it when an amendment like this comes before the House.</P>

      <P>In introducing this amendment, the Labour Party are conscious of the price increases that have taken place.  They are introducing the amendment to help the Minister in his efforts to ensure proper price control. We cannot rely on competition to <Col N="1749" /> ensure that normal prices will prevail because competition will not do that, having regard to restrictive trade practices and the combines which under different names introduce the same products.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department could not hope to look into every price increase.  While the Minister would be investigating one price increase, other insidious price increases would take place unknown to him.  In fact, this Bill would leave the onus on the public to notify the Department of increases.  This, the public will not do because they have come to accept price increases.  It would be wrong and unfair to ask the public to notify the Department of every price increase.</P>
      <P>We offer this amendment as a measure to help the Government and the Minister in their efforts to curb price increases.  We think that, if accepted, it will ensure a proper Prices Bill and satisfaction among the public and that it will take a load from the Department by having every price increase notified, so that they can be investigated before the increases can take effect.  If the Minister would support this, it is our view that the public would feel it was a test of his sincerity in ensuring the success of the Prices Bill and would be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this amendment first, I studied it because I thought it attempted to achieve completeness in the powers which the Government might give me.  However, we must try to visualise what will happen in the circumstances of attempting to control prices.  As far as I can see the future, such a general notification requirement would cause chaos.  It would hamstring traders, wholesalers and importers who have seasonal variations in their prices and variations in relation to sales promotion. As well as that, it would mean that all the resources I have to deal with this prices position could be swamped in routine notifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seek in this Bill fairly wide powers.  The alternative to accepting this amendment is not, as suggested by some Deputies, not having an effective <Col N="1750" /> Bill.  One of the powers I seek is to be able to say: &ldquo;Stand still; there will be no price increase.&rdquo; I am seeking powers to be able to make a swift examination at all levels and to make an order affecting prices at the various levels.  I also seek power to establish bodies to advise me and to extend the powers, which are limited in the main Act, of the advisory committees.</P>
    <P>If I could explain my reluctance to accept this amendment, apart from the fact that it would cause chaos and tie up some of my resources, it is also based on the fact that in the powers I seek, there would be flexibility which would make the Minister's activities much more effective.  I visualise, as soon as I do get authority, an immediate investigation by me of the distribution costs, say, of potatoes and meat. At the same time, I would set up a body which would advise me on the other commodities which should be investigated.  In this way all the resources we have&mdash;and I think members of the House realise how difficult it will be to implement price control&mdash; will be directed by these bodies, public bodies from various sections of the community, to commodities affecting the public and affecting the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I can see the idea behind this amendment as making for completeness but I can see it causing confusion. The alternative, flexible way of achieving price control by attacking over a narrow front with limited resources, which must of necessity be limited, will be much more effective in the long run.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that at first glance he thought this amendment would complete the Bill.  Of course, he had to look for flaws. Naturally he will find flaws.  If the amendment were to operate in the strict sense which the Minister has described, there could be chaos.  This is a Bill that has to operate, according to section 22A (1): &ldquo;Whenever and so often as the Government are satisfied that the condition of the national economy is such that it is necessary to maintain stability... the Government may by order....&rdquo; The Minister has <Col N="1751" /> pretty wide powers here which beyond doubt could cause chaos if they were used indiscriminately</P>
      <P>The Minister is missing a very important point.  We are giving the Minister certain powers here.  All his powers are discretionary.  We only ask this, that he will by order direct in respect of certain commodities that where there are to be price increases, these increases be notified.  The Minister's argument is that he would be required to make an order compelling notification in respect of every single item handled by an importer or wholesaler or made by a manufacturer.  We want to give the Minister this power in respect of what are normally regarded as essential commodities, essential foodstuffs, essential articles of clothing.  We are giving the Minister this discretionary power and I suggest that if he does accept the amendment, he will not cause chaos or hamstring himself.  He will have some discretionary power which is given to him by a Government order to inquire into cases of price increases which he considers to be excessive.  In page 3 he may require people to do certain things, to furnish information, books, accounts, and so on.  It could be said that those powers could cause chaos if he required them in respect of every single commodity.  What the Minister would be getting by this amendment would be power to require those who intend to increase the price of certain commodities to notify the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only suggestion the Minister made that seemed to make sense to me in regard to this amendment was that there were certain commodities which had a seasonal change in price.  One can think of fruit importers who would have higher prices at certain times of the year.  This would make the Department's duty a little more onerous but still it could be done.  However, if the amendment were accepted, it would have to be rephrased on Report Stage because the Minister mentioned meat and this item would not be fully covered by this amendment as it stands.  Meat generally in this country comes from <Col N="1752" /> cattle bought live from the farmer and killed in the butcher's establishment or at a public abattoir and sold direct to the housewife by the person who bought it from the farmer.  Therefore, that is something that would get through the Labour Party amendment net.  It could be rephrased on Report Stage; it is merely a defect in drafting. The Minister has not produced any real case as to why he should not accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat amazed at the Minister's intervention when he said he was reluctant to accept the amendment on the basis that it might cause chaos.  The logical conclusion to that is that the Minister must be expecting to be inundated with increases in the next six or 12 months.  This also brought back to my mind what we in the Labour benches said when the Bill was first introduced by the Minister, that is, that we wondered how sincere were Fianna Fáil in regard to price control.  We find it very hard to believe they are sincere in face of the statements which were made some very few months prior to the introduction of this Bill, that they did not believe it either necessary or desirable to introduce price control, and then within a short time they found it both necessary and desirable to introduce some sort of price control.</P>
      <P>We were very suspicious as to what motivated Fianna Fáil in doing this. However, we are prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and to accept even at this late stage something we had advocated over many years.  We are very glad to see the conversion, or apparent conversion, of Fianna Fáil to the necessity for and the desirability of price control.  However, when we go through the Bill, we find there are certain defects which could be rectified by accepting this amendment.  We find, however, a reluctance on the part of the Government to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we ask is that, if a manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, exporter or importer wants to increase his prices, he should notify the Department of his intention.  Surely that is not an unreasonable request?  If the Minister is really serious about keeping an eye <Col N="1753" /> on prices and if, as he stated in his intervention a few moments ago, he has not enough staff at his disposal to do even the routine work in which keeping an eye on prices will involve him, surely the intelligent approach in those circumstances is to put the onus of notification of intention to increase prices on those who intend to make the increases.  In that way the Minister will be aware beforehand that such and such an increase is intended. Surely that is desirable, if the Minister is sincere about his desire to control prices?</P>
    <P>We believe, too, that price notification of intention would act as a deterrent in the case of those who might otherwise try to get away with an enhanced price here and there.  If onus of notification is placed on them, together with justification ultimately of the intended increase, that will work as a deterrent in relation to those who might make an increase and reap the benefit of that increase over a period of, perhaps, several months before the Minister became aware that an increase had taken place.  Surely, if the Government and the Minister are sincere about price control, they will accept this amendment, an amendment which will make price control practicable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, I am sure, sincere when he says his resources at the moment would make it difficult for him to take on this task with regard to notification.  Far be it from us to say we should employ a few more civil servants but, if that is what is called for in this instance, then let us have a few more civil servants so that this particular part of this Bill can be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is correct in thinking this would tie up either his Department or the tribunal in useless work of duplication and notification of routine and unimportant price increases. The fact is that, in process of time, following the implementation of the section, it should be possible to see a pattern emerging in regard to notification.  Those employed in the particular section would become well acquainted with the pattern of price <Col N="1754" /> increases and their notification.  A seasonal pattern would emerge.  After a little experience, it would be found that price increases were not an isolated or unique phenomenon occurring without relation to other common factors.  A connection would be found and the pattern of increases could be plotted.</P>
    <P>The Minister can banish from his mind any idea of people tied up in unique occurrences quite unrelated to one another in regard to prices.  He would find a pattern emerging.  With a little experience in operation, he would find, I think, that the situation would not prove as chaotic as he seems to imagine.  The fact is we regard the present proposal as a little too loose and that is why we hold some attempt at notification is essential.  It is not as if the situation were such that nothing required to be done at the moment. Quite obviously, there is a crisis and it is because of that crisis that we have this Bill before the House now&mdash;too late, we maintain&mdash;and the purpose of our amendment is to give strength to the Bill.  We believe it would have the effect of eliminating increases that owe no part of their origin to economic factors.  No time would be wasted in investigating price increases that had no economic basis because any individual who might mistakenly think he could get away with something would be compelled by law to notify the Department of any intended increase. This would have a psychological effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to meat. Notification at the wholesale level would be bound to have an effect.</P>

      <P>The supermarts are there.  I know Fine Gael agricultural policy is a bit out of date, but the fact is the wholesalers are there and notification at that level would, as I say, have an effect.  In any case, should there be some really big increase, then the Minister could invoke the powers he is seeking elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard this amendment as important.  It is not, perhaps, as perfect <Col N="1755" /> as we should like it to be but we believe the Minister should seriously consider it.  We do not think its acceptance should involve any great increase in personnel.  Neither do we believe that the Minister would have to have a statutory provision for notification of price increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest about it, I think the amendment would be a help.  I am talking frankly now and as one who has gone through the mill. I should like CIE to be compelled to notify any increase in their charges and state the justification for it.  I should also like the Goulding monopoly to be compelled to notify increases and the justification for them. I should like some tribunal other than the joke before which I spent four days making a case, when everything had been cut and dried and we knew beforehand what the decision would be.  These are the things that affect the prices of the ordinary commodities people have to buy.  When we try to pass on the increase&mdash;I am speaking here for the agricultural community&mdash;in the commodity we are selling, we find we have to take strike action in order to extract it, or some portion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the position last year.  We found there was a very firm decision when it came to an increase in the price of sugar.  There was a very firm block there.  There would be no increase in the price of sugar.  The farmers were concerned there: no increase in the price of sugar.  We have seen the effect of that kind of action on two or three occasions before.  We saw it in operation when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture and Mr. Dan Morrissey, Minister for Industry and Commerce, and we saw the result of it and we shall see the result of it during the next six months. It is very easy to cut down the acreage as far as the farmer is concerned. Farmers were in the position that when they had their bargain made on price, they were notified a month afterwards by CIE that there was an increase in transport prices.  That notification should be given in time <Col N="1756" /> for the Department of Industry and Commerce to investigate it and to ascertain the position.  Last year, after the price of beet had been fixed, we were notified by CIE of an increase in price and then we got a similar notification from the Goulding monopoly of an increase in the price of fertiliser.  The cure found is to cut the farmer's production and increase the adverse trade balance by imports of foreign sugar.  Deputy Dillon tried that and got in an extra 75,000 tons of foreign sugar in one year.  The present move will have the same result.</P>

Last month we asked CIE to quote in regard to transport of peas to our Midleton factory.  We got a price from them and then we got a quotation for 15 per cent less from Cork Transport and then East Cork Hauliers quoted a price ten per cent less which meant there was a 25 per cent difference between the CIE quotation for the job and the East Cork Hauliers' quotation.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's interventions.  I am somewhat puzzled and I should like him to explain, if he can, how what we are suggesting would interfere with bringing about a proper Prices Bill. We are suggesting order in the place of chaos.  A chaotic situation exists at present regarding prices.  Deputy Corry referred to bargains being made.  One thing we must bear in mind in thinking of prices is the idea of conforming to the people's wishes.  We must remember that a bargain was made by way of national agreement which provided for an increase in wages for working people at a time when the cost of living stood at a particular figure and we must bear in mind that since that national agreement was reached the cost of living has gone up by 11 points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We want a positive Prices Bill.  This is the real reason for this amendment.  We want satisfactory price control.  We see no reason why the employers should not be called on to make a case for price increases as the workers are called on to make a case for wage increases.  Both sides should be required to give notice of intention.  The workers must do it and the employers should be made do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to say how he intends to operate this measure and how our amendment would inhibit its operation.  Does he intend to increase his staff and, if so, <Col N="1758" /> to what extent?  What will be the action taken when complaints are made?  Who will make them?  Will officials go out from the Department to ascertain whether prices have been slyly put up?  We are entitled to have answers to these questions because we are quite sincere in advocating teeth for the Bill and we submit that if these provisions are not put into the Bill, it will be simply a cod.  We are not attempting to chastise the Minister or the Government but I appeal to the Minister not to resist this amendment just for the sake of argument or simply because it comes from the Labour Party.  This is an obvious amendment in which we are seeking to put into practice what we have been preaching about curbing prices.  I see nothing wrong with it.  I should like the Minister to explain how it would not be possible to operate it because he has not done so in his interventions and he must do so if we in the trade union movement are going to sell this scheme and hold the line.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mullen has made it clear that in the trade union movement, not only is a trade union required by Congress and the Dublin Council of Trade Unions&mdash;should that trade union be situated in the Dublin area&mdash;to give seven days' notice of strike but it must also furnish to the proper body, such as the Dublin Council of Trade Unions or Congress, seven days' notice of intention to strike.  This is a very good thing because it enables the various people on both sides of industry to get together and try to prevent industrial upset.  In this regard the Labour Party amendment shows its weakness because there is no reference to time of notice in it.

Through the dropping of a word I had pointed out that section such-and-such, relating to contracts, eliminated any question of retrospection and I was taken to task because my sentence did not come over as it might have done.  At the same time, it is provided in the Bill that if a price increase takes place, the Minister can forthwith instruct the manufecturer, retailer, wholesaler or distributor to revert to the price that was in operation before his intervention.</P>

      <P>Even outside the trade union movement, there are associations such as the Countrywomen's Association and other associations, all of which keep a very keen eye on the movement of prices and the suggestion that I am making is that this Bill covers the situation where a price is raised, as the Minister can have the former price reverted to, that is, the price operating before he decided to have the investigation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mullen wanted me to make my objection to this amendment clearer.  Having listened to Deputy Corish, I see the light better now.  When I spoke first, I was objecting to having this power to make a blanket order on everybody that they should notify an intended increase. Deputy Corish said that what he intended was that in regard to certain commodities, this power should be enforced in order to prevent rises in the cost of these commodities.  I have a stronger power as visualised in the context of economic necessity over a short period for selective action over a range of commodities affecting the cost of living.  I can order a standstill on prices; not just to instruct people to tell me when they raise them but I can order a standstill so that there will be no increase, whether they tell me or not.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a fair defence, that he has this blanket power.  It is something quite different from the amendment.  It is a blanket power which has nothing to do with prior notification of price increases. This notification was meant, from our side of the House, to ensure that the full information before the event happened would be available to the Minister.  We felt that would be a good thing.  If we are to end up with a prices and incomes policy and a wages policy, intertwined between the two, then surely we should be in a position to know about increases in prices, if not before they happen, at least immediately they happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister through the operations of the Statistics Department, in the production of the Consumer Price Index, has quite a lot of information but I think he would agree that a lot of it is hindsight, <Col N="1762" /> information that is available some time after events have occurred.  This prior notification would ensure that the Minister would have the information immediately it was necessary for him to have it and place him in the position that if he felt it was necessary to impose the blanket order, he could do it at the right time.  We on this side of the House are supporting this in the most measured way, not with the feeling that there have been unjust increases in prices but because we feel it would help the Minister and make the Bill more complete.</P>

      <P>Obviously the Minister has made up his mind that he will not accept this amendment.  The Taoiseach has asked for the co-operation of the entire country and that includes the manufacturers.  The manufacturers would be most anxious to co-operate with the Minister in notifying him of price increases.  The blanket order might perhaps include justifiable increases and prevent these from taking place but the Minister knows that there may be unjustifiable ones.  In the other way, companies proposing increases notify the Minister. The onus would be on them.  It would be a measure of their co-operation with the Minister and would save unnecessary work.  I cannot see how it would cause chaos in the Department; it would cause chaos in the country if you let it reach the stage where inspectors went around the country looking haphazardly for increases. There is no predetermined measure to seek out any price increases but there is a very vast range of products which they would have to look into.  This amendment would ensure the Minister receiving notification immediately any increase was proposed.</P>
