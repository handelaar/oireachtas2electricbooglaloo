      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what steps are being taken to prevent the circulation in this country of a publication (name supplied) published in London in view of the indecent and objectionable features of introductory editions of this publication and of the fact that many copies are in circulation in this country amongst teenagers and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that he has not seen this, what I can describe as very indecent literature, thousands of copies of which have come into this country by post.  Surely, steps should be taken to prevent indecent literature from being flooded into this country for the purpose of corrupting the morals of our young people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be quite true that the customs authorities have no knowledge of this very indecent literature but, surely, the Minister ought to make inquiries and see what steps can be taken to prevent such indecent literature coming in in thousands in the ordinary post?  Seemingly, the postal authorities on the far side are not too particular as to what is sent to this country.  This is a matter worthy of the Minister's serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind moneys provided by the Racing Board.</P>
      <P>Details of the moneys contributed to the horse racing industry by the Racing Board are contained in the annual accounts of the Board which are presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to section 19 (3) of the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945.  The accounts for 1964 are not yet available but it is understood that they will show that after providing for the Board's expenses a sum of approximately £500,000 was contributed in that year compared with £339,800 in the previous year.</P>
      <P>I may add that on 15th June, 1964, course betting, including totalisator, at horse race meetings was exempted from turnover tax in view of the national importance of the industry and of the need for the Racing Board to raise more money for the development of the industry by increasing its totalisator deduction and levy on course betting.  It was also decided that the amount of turnover tax already paid by the Racing Board&mdash;a sum of £145,900 15s. &mdash;should be repaid to the Board and this was done during 1964 out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas through the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners <Col N="511" /> of Public Works could not undertake emergency works such as those suggested. They could deal with flooding in the area only as part of a comprehensive drainage scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 for the Lee catchment as a whole.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Much consideration has been given to the problem of the drainage of the Assaly catchment but it has not been possible to devise a scheme which at a reasonable cost would bring a fair degree of improvement to the area of land now flooded and which would not be unduly expensive to maintain.  Before taking a final decision in the matter, the Commissioners of Public Works sent to the Wexford County Council for their observations, particulars of the three proposals, but a reply has not so far been received.  It does not seem likely that any scheme will be carried out.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the differences referred to by the Deputy. I am also aware, however, of the pressing need of road authorities for financial assistance to enable them to maintain and to improve the public road system so as to render it fit for modern traffic.  This assistance is made available mainly from the Road Fund which is fed by the proceeds of the duties levied on all classes of mechanically propelled vehicles including public service vehicles.  In the light of these considerations I do not propose to proceed as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

The Act which came into operation on 1st October, 1964, requires each planning authority to prepare, within three years, a development plan indicating the authority's planning objectives, including objectives for the development and renewal of obsolete areas and to take steps to secure the objectives contained in its development plan.

      <P>It is highly undesirable that councils have to consider estimates without being notified.  The Cork County Council have expressed themselves strongly on this matter.  We feel the local authorities should be notified of the road grants in time for the estimates to be discussed at the estimates meetings. Would the Minister not agree that it is unfair to take the arterial road grants from the grants allocated to the county council generally?  In regard to what is meant in the second part of the question, the arterial road grants should be separate ones, outside the main county roads grants, and there should be separate allocations for them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether, in view of the serious hardship and losses suffered by farmers by reason of annual flooding of their lands, and of the fact that remedial measures under the arterial drainage scheme will take a long time to put into operation, he will make special funds available to local authorities to enable them to give complete remission of rates to the farmers affected between the months of October and March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the known liability of certain land holdings to periodic flooding is reflected in the valuation of those holdings, I do not consider that there is any special need for further relief from rates in respect of such holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not serious when he suggests that the value of certain lands was taken into consideration, when it is a fact that these lands were subject to flooding over the past 15 to 20 years. Is it not a fact that large areas of land in parts of the country have been subject to flooding in the past 15 years and that there is no remission of rates on such land?  Would the Minister in the circumstances give sympathetic consideration to the suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is of course available to the local authority adequate powers for dealing with any situation such as mentioned by the Deputy, by reason of recent flooding or whatever the cause might be.  That power is available to them under the Public Bodies Order 1946 which enables the local authority to write off part of the rates if they have good reason to regard them as irrecoverable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister will in the circumstances come to the aid of a local authority where such action is taken?  Surely it is not fair to burden a poor part of the country with loss of income as a result of giving this easement to people whose lands are constantly flooded?</P>

      <P>The Minister or myself would not like to be deprived of salary for six months of the year. Would we not have to pay income tax on it?  Surely a farmer whose land is flooded for five months of the year should not be expected to pay rates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the particular circumstances of recently occurring flooding, it would not have been reflected in the original striking of valuation of those lands as would be the case where there would have been <Col N="526" /> permanent flooding.  This is a matter for the local authority to deal with and they are in a far better position to deal with this locally.  It is to the local authority that these rates are being paid.  If they feel strongly about it and feel that an injustice is being done, they have the remedy and are in a position to decide upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this hardship is due to the delay in arterial drainage and until such action is taken, why should the local authority people be asked to pay for the relief of those people when the fault is due to the central Government for their failure to deal with it?</P>

These lands and others will ultimately benefit from it.  If a case is presented for any particular county, we will look into it.  If the people are not satisfied with the local authorities, they have the remedy in their own hands.

      <P>There are 63 old age (contributory) pension appeal cases awaiting decision and of these three are from addresses in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>The appeal longest on hands was received on 10th June, 1963, while the oldest appeal from County Kildare was received on 1st September, 1964.</P>
      <P>The application for pension longest on hands is an appeal received in 1963, and was, of course, decided by a deciding officer against whose decision the claimant appealed.  The application from County Kildare longest on hands is one which was received on 19th August, 1964, decided by a deciding officer on 25th August, 1964, and appealed by the claimant on 1st September, 1964.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the time taken to decide straightforward applications for old age (contributory) pension varies from three to six days.  In cases where this time is exceeded, inquiries, which may be protracted, are made in an effort to establish title to the pension.  Appeals cases normally involve extensive inquiries and there is an inevitable delay in finalising them.</P>

      <P>Land Commission workers, including those engaged on estate improvements in County Kerry, are employed on a five-day week basis for eight months of the year.

    <P>The current basic wage rate for Land Commission workers is marginally below the Kerry County Council total weekly wage rate.

      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 3rd June last, I had a complete survey carried out in January/February, 1964, of all the classes in the Dublin area in which there were more than 50 pupils.  As a result of re-organisation of classes in individual schools and the better distribution of pupils as between schools in each locality the majority of such classes were eliminated.  The remainder were with very limited exceptions catered for by the provision of 112 prefabricated buildings and 104 additional teachers.  The exceptions were by and large cases where representations were made that children of the one family should, as far as possible, be accommodated in the same national school.  It would not be proper for me to give the names of the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>The information which the Deputy seeks in relation to classes over 40 is not available in my Department. The collecting of this information will form the subject of a future survey.</P>

He re-enlisted on 7th January, 1964, and was discharged on medical grounds on 13th November, 1964.  The Army Pensions Acts make no provision for the consideration of a claim in respect of disease attributable to service during these periods, unless the disease was attributable to service with a United Nations force.  As the person in question did not so serve, it is regretted that he is not eligible to apply for a disability pension.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (a) whether, by letter dated 31st December, 1964, his attention was directed on behalf of a number of members of the fruit importing trade to the facts that despite an embargo on the importation of apples a considerable number were lying at the Port of Dublin, having been ordered by seven particular importers who had ordered them to be delivered there notwithstanding the embargo and who subsequently applied for licences to import them; and that the granting of licences in those circumstances <Col N="550" /> would be grossly unfair to at least 20 other firms of the fruit importing trade; and whether he was asked, in the interest of fair dealing that licences would be granted in such a way as would ensure that the seven particular importers referred to would not gain an advantage at the expense of their competitors and of the purchasing public by the grant of licences which would enable them to sell the apples which they had ordered during the embargo; (b) whether, by letter dated 6th January, 1965, he intimated to representatives of the 20 firms who had respected the embargo that licences were being granted to all fruit importing firms as from 8th January, 1965, with a consequential advantage to the seven firms who had already 13,000 boxes approximately landed at the docks; (c) whether he is aware that this advantage, which was created by his action, placed the seven firms in question in the position that they alone had apples immediately available for sale, while their competitors had now to arrange the importation of apples which has taken 28 days; and that in consequence these seven firms made a very substantial adventitious profit at the expense of their competitors and the purchasing public; and (d) whether he will lay copies of the correspondence before the House, and undertake that such preferential treatment will not again occur in connection with the importation of fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The full facts are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October, 1964, the Wholesale Fruit Importers and Distributors Association, whose members handle about threequarters of the total volume of our apple imports, approached me about licences to import apples from sources other than the UK.  I indicated that I would not be prepared to give licences until satisfactory arrangements had been made for the disposal of the home crop and that if the importers could make arrangements to take up the remaining amount of home grown apples still in stock I would then grant the import licences sought.  The importers association then entered into negotiations with the home growers represented <Col N="551" /> by the Apple Growers Association and the NFA.</P>
    <P>These negotiations continued through November and December.  Towards the end of December, I was informed by the Wholesale Fruit Importers and Distributors Association that, in anticipation of a successful outcome to these negotiations and because of a threatened shipping strike in the USA, they had ordered supplies of US apples, some of which had arrived. They pressed me to issue licences but I informed them that I could not do so until the arrangements referred to for the purchase of the home-grown crop were made.  Import licences were not therefore granted for these apples. On 6th January, I was notified that agreement had finally been reached between the Importers' Association and the Apple Growers Association for the purchase of remaining stocks of home-grown apples.  This agreement was conditional on the importers' side to the grant of licences for the early importation of a limited quota of foreign apples.</P>
    <P>I decided that it was advisable to grant licences for the early importation of a limited quota of foreign apples having regard to the agreement reached between the Apple Growers Association and the Wholesale Fruit Importers and Distributors Association, who, as I have said, represent the bulk of the trade.  All regular importers received licences, including firms which had undertaken no commitment in regard to purchase of home-grown apples.  In addition, the President of the Wholesale Fruit Importers and Distributors Association announced on 9th January that importers who wanted foreign apples would be given them at cost price if they agreed to take a share of the home-grown crop which the Association members had purchased. This put all concerned on an equal footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that I am correct in interpreting his reply as endorsing what is suggested in one paragraph of the question I put to him to the effect that the result of what was done by <Col N="552" /> him and his Department was that seven firms obtained for themselves a profit of from £1 to 25/- per case and the public had to pay 20/- to 25/- per case more for the apples than they would have had to pay if licences had been given, as requested, to the people on whose behalf I put down this question? Does the Minister agree that should not happen and would he further agree that, on the correspondence, the Co-operative Fruit Importers Limited were ignored except to the extent that they got licences at a time when it was impossible for them to get apples while their competitors, to whom the Minister has referred as the Wholesale Fruit Association, because they had ignored the embargo that existed and brought in apples in anticipation, as the Minister said, of getting licences, were able to reap this adventitious profit at the expense of competitors and of the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is completely misleading.  First of all, the situation is, and I could take my stand on this alone, that all the normal importers of apples got licences on the same date in proportion to their previous performance.  In so far as I did that as Minister for Agriculture, I discharged my obligation to be fair to each member of the trade.  But the situation is much more complicated than that.  These negotiations between my Department, on the one hand, the importers and the home growers, on the other, went on for over a period of two months and everybody in the trade knew that sooner or later licences would have to be issued for the import of apples from sources other than the UK.  It was only a question of when would they be issued. I took the view that no licences should be issued until I could be satisfied that the home grower had been satisfactorily fixed up and that arrangements had been made for the purchase of all the outstanding home-grown stocks.</P>
      <P>I said to the importers: &ldquo;When such a point is reached and when I am satisfied that all the stocks on hands at home have been purchased, then I shall consider the issue of licences for a limited quota of foreign apples.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> That is precisely what happened.  The only complicating factor in the situation was that at a point in time the importers' association thought, and with some justification, that they had succeeded in making a deal with the home growers.  On that basis they went off and imported a certain quota of apples.  Even though those apples arrived on the quay, when I was informed that the deal still had not been concluded I refused to issue licences for them.  Only when I was finally satisfied that satisfactory arrangements had been made for the purchase of the home crop did I decide I would issue licences.  On that date I issued licences to all concerned&mdash;the people who had purchased the home-grown stock and the people who had not&mdash;in fair proportion.</P>

I shall leave the rest out at the moment, the rest being whether he will undertake that such preferential treatment will not occur again.  He has not answered paragraph (d).  It is quite clear, I think the Minister will agree, that there is a certain amount of complication that cannot be dealt with here in question and answer.  Will the Minister lay the correspondence in connection with this matter before the House so that the public may see where the truth lies and ascertain whether or not something was given to a particular small group of seven people who took an advantage at the expense of the public and of their competitors?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Wool prices are determined from year to year by variations in supply and demand on the international market, including the effect of competition from synthetic fibres.  During the past year, the level of export demand and prices has fallen appreciably from the record high level of the previous year but the market recently appears to be steadying somewhat. I am not of course in a position to provide markets at assured prices for our wool exports.  I am awaiting the report of a committee appointed to consider the question of improvements in the handling, marketing and grading of wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a large proportion of the farmers who keep sheep and who are worried about the wool situation are small farmers and in view of the necessity to safeguard their livelihood by giving them a guaranteed price for their product, ahead as far as possible, would the Minister not agree that in this particular instance it is only reasonable to ask him to try to guarantee a price for the wool clip at least two years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be an ideal situation if we could ever arrive <Col N="558" /> at it.  I certainly agree with the Deputy it would be a magnificent boon to our small farm areas if we could achieve a guaranteed price for wool over a comparatively long period.  However, the reality of the situation is that at present most of the wool has to be sold on the export market and we could not possibly guarantee prices on that market. However, the Deputy knows that a committee is at present examining the whole situation in the wool trade.  I am awaiting the report of that committee and when I get it, I will certainly see what can be done to stabilise the wool trade and the wool industry from the point of view of the farmer and effect any other improvements which may be suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>I take it that if the Minister considers it feasible, he would have no objection to the setting up of a board which would be entitled to give us a guaranteed price for the wool clip and if the world price were to go above that particular price considerably, such an excess would go to that board to offset a loss the following year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by An Bord Bainne that they have inquired into the possibility of selling Irish creamery butter in the Channel Islands but have found that an effort to open a market there would not be justified. The total butter requirements of the islands are very small and, further-more, unless a direct shipping service becomes available, the market will remain unattractive because of very high freight charges.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the Summer Time Order, 1964, made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice under the Summer Time Act, 1925 (No. 8 of 1925), and the Justice (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1964 (S.I. No. 248 of 1964).</P>
      <P>This Order fixes the period of Summer Time for the next three years as follows:</P>
      <P>1965: from the 21st March to the 24th October,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> 1966: from the 20th March to the 23rd October, and</P>
    <P>1967: from the 19th March to the 29th October.</P>
    <P>These are the periods fixed by the British Government for Britain and Northern Ireland and it is usual for us to synchronise our time with theirs.</P>
    <P>Even if this Order were not made, we would have Summer Time, but it would be for a shorter period.  The effect of the Order is to extend the normal period by six weeks in 1965&mdash;three weeks in spring and three in autumn&mdash; and by seven weeks in 1966 and 1967&mdash; four in spring and three in autumn.</P>
    <P>If the Order were not made, we would be one hour behind Britain and the Six Counties for those few weeks in the spring and autumn, while our time would be the same as theirs during the rest of the year.  This would lead to confusion and serious difficulties for postal, telegraph and transport services.  Accordingly, I ask the House to approve of this Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account gives the Dáil an opportunity of reviewing the activities of the Government and the Government's policy particularly in relation to expenditure over the past year.  While all members of the Government, from the Taoiseach down, are speaking at public meetings, at luncheons, dinners and elsewhere in very loud tones, they appear to be dwelling on the great period of prosperity through which we are passing.  Last night when I was referring to the speeches on prosperity I invited any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party to indicate to me in what part of Ireland he experienced the <Col N="567" /> great wave of prosperity which they allege prevails today.</P>
      <P>The Government have to their credit a number of achievements.  Amongst those achievements ranks very high the fact that the rates are soaring skyhigh. Taxation has been increasing and we are now threatened this very week with a further increase in taxation and the possibility of an increase in the turnover tax.  We are told it is very likely that the next Budget will demand from the Irish taxpayers a further contribution to the pool of taxation.  This Government are getting £14 million per year from the turnover tax alone, a colossal sum, and having regard to the strictness of PAYE, they appear to be obtaining additional millions from the workers and other taxpayers that no Government ever succeeded in extracting from the taxpaying community.  The Minister for Finance gave an assurance in this House when the turnover tax was being debated that it would be unlikely that the cost of living would increase, that the increase would be so small that the taxpayers would hardly notice it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said all the time it would be a 2½ per cent increase.  I kept repeating that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of living has increased from 135 points in 1957 to 175 points in November, 1964, according to the latest official figures. Since May, 1963, when Fianna Fáil introduced the turnover tax, the cost of living has gone up from 159 points to 175 points, a rise of 16 points, which is equivalent to ten per cent or 2/- in the £.  The Minister has just told me that at the time of the imposition of the turnover tax, he said there would be an increase of only 2½ per cent in the cost of living.  How does he now explain the increase of ten per cent which has taken place in the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do agree that the Minister for Finance went to great rounds in this House explaining the situation and guaranteeing that as a result of the turnover tax, the cost of living would not increase beyond 2½ per cent.  That <Col N="568" /> is exactly like the guarantee he gave when introducing the Health Bill many years ago.  When he was asked what it would cost the ratepayers, he said 2/-or, at the most, 2/6d. in the £.  The position is today that in many counties the ratepaying community are unable to pay the rates and that the major increases in county rates are due to the Health Act.</P>
    <P>The time has come when a stop should be put to the ever-increasing demands on taxpayers and ratepayers and the anxiety of the Government to pile on additional burdens on the poor, because of their disregard for price control and their entire lack of interest in the consuming public and particularly in the wage earners who can be described as being in the middle income group.  We hear from all Fianna Fáil Deputies, and particularly from Ministers, and they speak very loud, about their generosity to the people and all they are giving.  Is it not a fact that anything the Government give with one hand they take back with interest with the other?  That can be borne out by the ample evidence we have that every single concession the Government give to the people is given with the beating of drums and the waving of flags and with full ceremonial from radio, television, public platforms and the dinner table.</P>
    <P>All is being given out, but, the moment it is all given, the cold, greedy hand of Fianna Fáil stretches forth to take it back with interest by way of new tax, hidden tax or by some other means by which the taxpayer can continue to be fooled.  We read all about the increases the Minister for Agriculture has given to the farmers. We read about farmers getting more for beet, wheat, barley and oats.  We see in big headlines statements by Ministers about bestowing what they call outstanding financial benefits on the farming community, but we do not hear them talking about the severe increases the farming community have now to meet in the form of a new all record breaking rates increase.  We do not hear anything about the manner in which the cost of living has increased on the farmers who are getting <Col N="569" /> paltry increases in prices.  We do not hear anything about the fact that the farmer is expected to pay his workers the increase in wages he is obliged to pay them, that he has to pay more for the petrol and oil for his tractor and his machinery, that he has to pay more for the petrol for his motor car and that anything the farming community get this year is already earmarked for return to the Government by either direct or indirect taxation during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, farmers are not better off now than they were.  As a matter of fact, they are poorer because they had the name of getting increased prices and the name of having financial benefits bestowed on them and, at the same time, they are being burdened with additional taxation, both direct and indirect, which takes from them completely the benefits which the Government have spoken so loudly about. It is the aim of a Fine Gael Government to ensure that there is a fair share of prosperity for all sections of our people.</P>

If my memory serves me right, the inter-Party Government in three years spent £14 million of Marshall Aid building houses, draining land, reclaiming land and housing our people.

It was all gone at the end of six months.</P>
      <P>Then he tells us the inter-Party Government squandered £18 million in three years.  We did&mdash;on hospitals, on houses for our people, on the drainage of land, on road making, and on the provision of homes for those who were homeless.  If that is squandering I am proud to be associated with it. If the expenditure of public money will go on houses for those who are homeless, hospitals for the sick and the drainage of land I want to assure Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Dolan that I would be associated with that kind of squandermania and be proud of it.</P>

      <P>The spending of £18 million on hospitals and on houses in three years was an achievement because it provided for this country what Fianna Fáil had neglected to do for many years.  I hope, when Deputy Dolan is making his speech, that he will give us the full details of the £24 million Fianna Fáil spent in six months, mainly on aircraft and runways.  I should like to ask any taxpayer in this country whether it is more important to have hospitals for the sick, houses for the people or aeroplanes and runways for the millionaires to fly around in, so that they can fly quicker from London to New York and from New York to Paris, dropping off at Shannon and on again to Paris.  Fianna Fáil were always more concerned with living in the clouds than with dealing with the practical problems of the people.  They have never dealt with this matter in a practical way.  Fianna Fáil were never concerned with houses for the people, proper living conditions, hospitals, proper social welfare benefits, and they are not concerned with them today. That is why, sooner or later, the Irish taxpayers will have to rebel against the manner in which their money is spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can see very clearly that in the last Budget a pittance was granted to old age pensioners and others dependent on social welfare benefits, all of whom are very hard hit by the turnover tax.  We see again that during the same year £10,000 of the taxpayers' money was spent on getting out a booklet entitled <i>Facts About Ireland.</i> No doubt Deputy Dolan will agree that this booklet, like the aeroplane, in a jocose way, in a supplementary <Col N="572" /> was more important than houses, hospitals and social welfare benefits. Will Deputy Dolan, or any other Deputy, tell us now whether it was right that £10,000 additional taxation extracted from the pockets of the poor by way of dearer bread, flour, tea and sugar, should have been spent on getting out that booklet?</P>
    <P>This year a couple of thousand pounds of the taxpayers' money was spent on sending out a New Year card to 250,000 farmers from the Minister for Agriculture.  Ten thousand pounds was spent on the booklet and a couple of thousand on a quarter of a million cards.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Minister that it is wrong and improper that the taxpayers' money should be used by a Minister for the purpose of recklessly sending out 250,000 New Year cards.  Indeed, some farmers got four New Year cards in one morning.  Other farmers, put to the pin of their collar to pay rates and taxes, were met on New Year's morning by the postman with three New Year cards from the Minister for Agriculture. I know the Minister for Agriculture is a very generous man.  I, once <Col N="573" /> question, asked him to include me in his Christmas card list.  I am grateful for the fact that he did but, like the farmer who got three New Year cards, I also received three Christmas cards from the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>We have taxation crushing our people and we have a Minister for Agriculture, who boasts of the increases which he is anxious to give to the farming community, standing idly by watching the heavy burden of taxation crushing them out of existence and off the land and using their money to send out greeting cards to them.  There is something wrong and improper about that.</P>
      <P>I hope, when the Taoiseach speaks, and it is likely he will speak today, that he will tell us something again about emigration and unemployment and that he will not come up with the same old story about hoping emigration and unemployment will be solved by 1970. We are concerned with the position as it is today.  There has been no effort on the part of the Government to deal with the problem of unemployment and emigration.  Our people want productive and profitable employment.  When we take up the newspapers or turn on the radio and hear of a new factory being opened up in any part of the country, we find the key of the factory door is usually turned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At the luncheon that takes place following the opening of the factory, the Minister speaks long and loudly on the importance of factories and the fact that factories should be established in areas where they can give maximum employment and in areas where employment is urgently needed.  You would think every factory opened is a free gift being bestowed on the area by Fianna Fáil.  I never heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in all those speeches, tell the truth about the origin of the factories, that the factories they are opening today to provide employment for our people are mainly due to the setting up of the Industrial Development Authority by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> I can recall, when the appropriate legislation was going through this House, the anger and the horror the Taoiseach displayed when he said the Industrial Development Authority was wrong and that if he got back into office again, he would repeal the measure.  As far as I remember, he went so far as to say that the men who were being appointed on the Industrial Development Authority might have to seek other appointments the moment there was a change of Government.  He said the Industrial Development Authority would go, that it was a useless set-up.  He could see no good coming from it.  It was not going to produce results and there would not be a single factory in Ireland as a result of it.</P>
    <P>A change of Government took place. Fine Gael went out of office but did the Taoiseach disband the Industrial Development Authority?  Did he repeal the Act or do what he said he would do?  No, he did not, because he then realised that the Fine Gael approach in establishing the Industrial Development Authority was the right and proper one.  He found how wrong he was when he was in Opposition.  That showed his insincerity because he knew very well when he was on this side of the House that the Industrial Development Authority would be of outstanding advantage to the country in their promotion of industrial development.</P>
    <P>The good work undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority is in no small way responsible for the many industries for which Fianna Fáil Ministers for Industry and Commerce are turning the key at opening ceremonies. When those industrialists who are setting up industries are being welcomed by the Government, never once do we hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance saying that it was the Fine Gael Government who gave the tax concessions to enable them to come here, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil spoke loudly against it when they were in Opposition.  Dare they take steps to change it when they are in Government?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The factories that have been opening up all over Ireland did not happen by accident.  They do not just spring up just overnight.  If it were not for the tax concessions made available by Deputy Sweetman and the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority, the factories Fianna Fáil are boasting about today would or could never materialise.</P>

The position is that whether Deputy Dolan likes it or not, the industries that have been established by Fianna Fáil in recent years are the responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority, and the grants and financial concessions that were made available by Deputy Sweetman made it sufficiently attractive for the industrialists to come over here and start their factories and provide employment.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what steps the Government will take to change the priority of drainage from practically the bottom of the list, because if our landowners are to produce more, to have better quality stock for export and better quality crops, it is only right that they should first be put into the position of having good land.  Drainage is becoming a great national problem.  If we ask any of the Ministers what is responsible for the holdup of drainage, he will tell us that they cannot get engineers.  Nobody believes that cock and bull story.  How many engineers have emigrated because they could not find employment in recent years?  I do not believe for one moment that arterial drainage cannot be undertaken because there are no engineers.  I believe that it is the policy of the Government to keep arterial drainage on the bottom of the list.  It has been remarked here time and again that the farmers are expected to pay big rates for lands they do not see in many instances for five months of the year.</P>
      <P>I deplore the Government's handling of the drainage problem.  It is disastrous. It is something they should be ashamed of and something which reflects no credit on any Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Since 1961, we have had extraordinary manoeuvring by the Government in what we can describe as hidden taxation.  I want to refer to the manner in which the Government have ruthlessly been responsible for the increases in bus and train fares, postal and telephone charges, radio and TV licences.  These are all methods of hidden taxation which the Government have imposed on our people against their wishes in recent months.</P>

      <Col N="577" /> Our housing position is so deplorable that it would make any of us ashamed to be Irish.  The amount of money we invest in education is insufficient. We need more schools, particularly in rural Ireland.  The investment in education is not at all up to the expectations of this Party when we see in many parts of rural Ireland overcrowded and insanitary schools and teachers having to endure great difficulties in trying to teach in over-crowded classrooms.  Many of those schools I can describe as a disgrace to civilisation.</P>

I trust that the Taoiseach will make a statement on the matter, when he speaks, so as to clear the air in that regard.  For business and for those interested in the development of the country, there is nothing as bad as an atmosphere of insecurity or a feeling of instability.  The Taoiseach has been taught too many lessons.  He knows that an angry electorate is waiting for him.  If there were a general election now, Fianna Fáil would lose at least 20 seats.</P>

      <P>You have a nice way of admitting defeat.  Fianna <Col N="578" /> Fáil policy and their conduct in relation to health, housing and taxation have been rejected in Dublin, Roscommon and Galway and will now be rejected in Cork.  Does anybody think that, with that trail of rejection from voters in an angry mood, the Taoiseach will declare a general election? A schoolchild would not do it.</P>
      <P>It really does not make any odds whether the general election comes this year or next year: Fianna Fáil are going out whenever it comes and the next time they go out never to return. If the Taoiseach were brave enough to test the present angry mood of the people, there is nothing to stop him from dissolving Dáil Éireann tomorrow night, if he wants to do so; but, if he does, many of the men behind him will not be returned.</P>
      <P>Our people are now in the mood for a change.  It is all the same whether it comes this year or next year; Fianna Fáil have had it.  Once a Party start to slip at all, they slip well and this Government Party have slipped and are slipping.  The people have no confidence, no belief and no trust in the Government.  There is no reason why they should or could trust the Government. That is the very reason why, the moment the electorate get a chance, Fine Gael will be charged with the responsibility of the government of this country.</P>

      <P>Well, anyway, what Deputy MacCarthy says is always constructive.  I do not propose <Col N="579" /> to detain the House any further on this matter beyond registering my complete disapproval of the manner in which the Government have administered the affairs of this country in the past 12 months.  I really feel that they have completely lost contact with the people.  They have got away from realities.  A change of Government would be good for this country and I have a feeling that it would be good for the health of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance as well.  A few years of rest on this side of the House might not do them any harm at all, physically, when one remembers that it is 33 years today since the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were made Ministers.  Thirty-three years is a fair innings, all right. They have served a whole generation. It is only natural for the people to expect a change of Government.</P>
      <P>May I wind up by telling the Taoiseach that the Irish voters have already made up their minds, which is very clear to all Deputies who meet the general public and talk to them and discuss matters broadmindedly with them.  They will say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil: they are too long there and a change is no harm.&rdquo;  That is the attitude all over this country today.  I hope and trust we shall have no general election until October, 1966, because then we shall have more people in that mood and frame of mind.</P>
      <P>The time has come when the people have entirely lost interest in the Government.  They have been served three times recently with notice to quit but they have ignored the service of that notice.  They are now likely to be served with it for a fourth time.  Surely that, in itself, is an indication that the Government are hanging on and limping from crisis to crisis in the hope of currying favour with other Deputies to keep them in office, knowing and realising that the vast majority of the Irish people have lost trust and confidence in them as a Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a couple of occasions in the past few weeks, speaking at functions outside this House and <Col N="580" /> attempting to forecast the course of events during this year, I expressed the view that it is likely to be a difficult year.  I think the difficulties will arise from a variety of causes, but, as of now, the Government are mainly concerned with those they are likely to encounter in the field of public finance. The financial implications of a vigorous development policy, until they are fully understood throughout our national community, are likely to remain the central point in political discussions in the House and outside it.  It is, I think, appropriate that on this Vote on Account, which gives the Dáil the first indication of the financial problem facing the Government this year, that this aspect of our affairs should receive major attention.  The year may also prove to be difficult because of the possibility of changes in the international situation which can have a bearing on our national development plans.</P>
      <P>The Government are dedicated to the proposition that national economic and social progress will not happen of its own accord, that it has to be planned and organised and that it will cost money.  The progress which is possible in every economic and social sphere in which the Government operate, depends, firstly, on the sound-ness of the plans for development which are adopted and applied, and, secondly, on the willingness of the public to underwrite these plans in their taxation and in their savings. This, of course, is an elementary fact but it seems it is still necessary to restate it from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution which the Irish people make for public purposes in terms of taxation, expressed as a proportion of the national income, is still very much lower than that made by most other European countries; certainly it is very much lower than in the case of the countries with which our circumstances and our level of public services are most usually compared. So far as plans for development are concerned, it can be said now that they are reaching an advanced stage of preparation, have indeed been completed in many sectors, and that in operation they are proving to be sound <Col N="581" /> enough.  At any rate they are already working out much as we attempted to forecast.  The speed at which they can be developed and operated depends on the public support and the public financial backing which they can secure.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the Vote on Account which is now under discussion that the Government are proposing to increase spending on many public services in the coming financial year. Now, some part, indeed quite a considerable part, of this higher spending reflects higher levels of remuneration in the public services.  The ninth round adjustments in wage and salary scales throughout the community have been followed, so far as the public services are concerned, by a series of status adjustments, supplemental to the eighth round adjustments, which, however, is now nearing completion and which indeed must be wound up quickly if the expanding tax revenue is to be made available for development operations.</P>
    <P>These status adjustments were justifiable in the circumstances of each case; while the Government accepted arbitration awards about which they may have had some doubt, nevertheless by and large the adjustments which have been made were due, and in a few cases overdue, but the cumulative effect on the cost of the public services is very considerable and apart from raising the total level of the Estimates for these services in this year by a substantial sum, it means money is being diverted to these purposes which might otherwise be available for the reduction of taxation or the financing of further developments in respect of social welfare and similar services in which Deputies are interested.</P>
    <P>It is now fairly clear that there can be no increase in public expenditure this year over and above what is now intended as foreshadowed in the Vote on Account, without substantial tax changes and indeed even to meet the proposed level of spending may not be possible without some changes.  There is certainly no method by which taxation could be reduced which did not <Col N="582" /> envisage a substantial cut in Government spending over a wide range of services.  That is something which nobody in this House wants and which certainly nobody here has proposed. We, for our part, will not be a party to any policy of public deception in this regard.  More Government spending upon social welfare, upon education, upon housing or anything else must mean more taxation.  If higher taxation is to be avoided, and one could visualise a case for that course being advanced reasonably by some Deputy, then it must necessarily mean a slowing down of development in all spheres of Government activity in order to make that feasible.</P>
    <P>This has been described, not merely in this country but in most countries in the world, as the era of rising expectations and certainly it is our experience that all public comment on national affairs seems to be directed towards justifying higher spending upon these social services, including education, housing, health and so forth.  Indeed, higher spending on these services may be desirable but the consequences of doing so upon our taxation rates must be understood also and the Party which fails to make its position understood in this regard, in my judgment, sacrifices its right to be taken seriously at all.</P>
    <P>This is the constant dilemma of the Government: we never have to justify to the Dáil higher spending on these proposals; the pressure here is always for more Government expenditure in almost every field.  While we want to push on with all these economic and social developments which we debate here, it is our duty as a Government to keep the rate of growth of public spending within a tolerable level of taxation and to try to get the public to understand that cutting our cloth to our measure is still an essential operation of public housekeeping and indeed is a safeguard to the continuation of the nation's economic and social advances.</P>
    <P>I saw in one of our newspapers this morning, the <i>Irish Independent,</i> a suggestion that this year we should solve the Budget problem by budgeting for a deficit.  That would be a method <Col N="583" /> of avoiding one problem by creating other problems which indeed would prove to be far greater and more intractable.  Deficit budgeting even in one year would, by raising doubts about the integrity of the Government's financial policy, have serious repercussions upon our investment policy and upon our capacity to secure the use of public savings for national development purposes.  In any case the capital resources which we can command are not unlimited and if they are diverted into financing a Budget deficit they cannot then be used for other purposes and the cutting down of the Government's capital Budget would be unavoidable. That then is in broad outline the nature of the financial difficulty which the Government foresee facing the Dáil and the country during this year.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the Press engaged in a guessing campaign at the present time about the date of the next general election.  They possibly have some motive in this, though I am in some difficulty in understanding what it may be, and I have certainly no desire to spoil their game, whatever it is, by introducing an element of certainly, because certainty in this respect is just not feasible.  There are, however, some factors which these newspaper commentators seem to me to be leaving out of account.  The first is that the public do not wish to have a general election.  There is no desire amongst the public for a general election at this time and, indeed, it is my judgment that the public would be very critical of a decision to bring about a general election without obvious justification.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that I could call a general election tomorrow, if I so desired.  However tempting that prospect might be from the point of view of advantage to my Party, I believe that an election precipitated solely for tactical reasons would be resented by most members of the public. Furthermore, there is the fact that we are, as I have said, facing a difficult Budget.  If there is not to be some cutting back of plans for economic and social progress, an increase in taxation <Col N="584" /> this year seems at this point of time to be unavoidable and it is not a characteristic of this Government to run away from difficulties of that kind as did the Coalition Government in 1957.</P>

      <P>If the rate of progress, particularly in regard to public social arrangements, cannot for these Budget reasons be substantial in this year, we would wish, because the prospects next year would seem to be better, not to risk those prospects being frustrated by a change of Government.  Furthermore, my judgment in this matter is and will be influenced by the fact that I believe that many members of the Irish public of today, and for many years to come, would be totally unforgiving if I should decide on holding a general election at the wrong time at the risk of a Fine Gael Government coming in to mess everything up all over again.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, there are inevitable uncertainties in the situation in which the Government have only a small working majority in the Dáil and where the illness of a few Deputies could make effective action difficult.  The pending by-elections have also to be considered in this connection. If I should find that the Government cannot do their work as thoroughly as we would wish, then I should regard it as my duty to ask the people to rectify that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, talked about the undesirability of uncertainty in this regard.  If there were any genuine or widespread belief that the next general election would bring about a change of Government or of Government policy, then any uncertainty about its timing would be, I agree, a disadvantage to the country, but, as it is, there is no serious disadvantage because there is no uncertainty. The election will take place therefore, in so far as the decision rests with me, any time between the passing of this Vote on Account and November, <Col N="585" /> 1966.  The Opposition Parties have now been notified and can make their preparations accordingly.  Subject to all the qualifications I have mentioned, I still think it is more likely next year than this year.</P>
    <P>As I am speaking on political matters, I should like to refer also to a growing disposition on the part of some of our newspaper commentators, led by the <i>Irish Times,</i> to present a picture of Irish politics in which the only motivating force is represented as self-interest. I believe this picture to be fundamentally false.  I believe it also to be damaging.  The cynicism with which it is presented does not wholly conceal the basic immaturity which inspires it. While politicians are of necessity concerned with political power, because otherwise they would be condemned to frustration and ineffectiveness, the motives which I have encountered all my life in most politicians, regardless of Party, are honourable and relate only to the national welfare in accordance with their ideas and their policies. I think that some newspaper should seek to present a more reliable picture of Irish political life and of our political motivations than is now current.</P>
    <P>In this connection I wish to refer also to some comments upon the Irish representation at the funeral of the late Sir Winston Churchill.  Sir Winston Churchill was a great English leader who, during his life, served the interests of his country to the best of his very high abilities.  He held no public office at the time of his death.  The arrangements made to associate this country with his funeral were strictly in order, even if they did not represent the capin-hand attitude which these newspaper commentators seem to think is the appropriate posture for Irishmen in their relations with Britain.  This country has moved very far from that position and it is time that everybody recognised that&mdash;the leader writers and letter writers of the <i>Irish Times</i> no less than the tree fellers at Abbeyleix.  The world will respect us in the degree that we respect ourselves.  There may be a need for a public education campaign to promote understanding of what national self-respect requires in individual <Col N="586" /> and group behaviour.  I suppose it is useless to ask the Opposition Parties to support us in this, but it would be very valuable if they did.</P>
    <P>Against this background of budgetary difficulties&mdash;the growing cost of public services, the need to provide a wider basis for public finance if the national economic and social progress is to continue&mdash;I want to put the record of what has been achieved since the programme on economic expansion was initiated and the general outlook in the economic field for the coming year.  The country's economic progress is continuing.  Our national production in 1964 exceeded that of 1963 by 4.3 per cent in real terms.  This was in accord with our programmed rate of growth.  Our agricultural output was up by between two and three per cent.  The prospects for 1965, looking at them from this point of time, are that these rates of growth will be maintained in this year.  Our national income rose last year by £84 million or by 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Now, it is true that a large part of that growth in the national income was attributable to the higher rates of remuneration which became operative last year.  The position in this regard, so far as 1965 is concerned, is that the growth of national income in real terms will probably continue at about the same rate but what it may represent in money terms is almost impossible to predict at this stage.</P>
    <P>Last year the profits made in Irish agriculture rose by £21 million or by between 15 or 16 per cent.  This was the first year for many years in which the rise in agricultural incomes outpaced the rise in incomes in other occupations.  The expenditure of our people upon ordinary day-to-day consumption rose by £65 million or by nearly 11 per cent in terms of current prices or four per cent in terms of volume.  The retail traders, who feared the impact of the turnover tax on the volume of their business, are no doubt pleased that their experience has been otherwise.  Fixed capital formation rose by £31 million at current prices over 1963 or by 14 per cent in volume. The total savings of our people insumptio <Col N="587" /> creased by £25 million over the 1963 level and stood for the first time at over £100 million.  The ratio of investment to gross national product was almost 20 per cent, which is by no means an unsatisfactory figure by any international basis of comparison and which certainly compares very favourably with our experience in earlier years in this country.</P>
    <P>Consumer prices rose by 6.7 per cent.  I shall speak in greater detail about that situation later.  Agricultural prices were ten per cent higher and prices of imported goods rose by two per cent on average.  I think it can be said there are good reasons to assume, and certainly some basis for hoping, that greater stability in respect of prices is possible in this year.  The prices realised on average for our exports increased last year by 6.7 per cent.  The terms of trade improved in our favour by 4½ per cent.  While export prices are not likely to decline in this year, import prices may well rise, in which case the terms of trade this year will be less advantageous to us than they were last year.</P>
    <P>There was a substantial increase in the number at work in non-agricultural occupations.  The calculations of total employment in the occupations which are insured under the Social Welfare Acts, based on the sales of social insurance stamps, are invalidated in some unknown degree by reason of the fact that some number of non-manual workers receiving salary and wage increases last year were brought outside the present insurable limit.  But, notwithstanding this, the sales of these insurance stamps in the first nine months of last year&mdash;the figures for the final quarter are not yet available&mdash;indicate that the average weekly number of persons in insurable employment was higher by 16,500 than in 1963.  The decline in agricultural employment continued. The net gain in new jobs was, of course, less than the rise in industrial and other forms of non-agricultural employment.  I think this is likely to be the picture for some years yet.</P>
    <P>The rise in industrial output was <Col N="588" /> 11 per cent.  All our major industrial groups participated in this increase. There was a significant increase in industrial exports.  Discussions with our leading industrialists have justified forecasts of a corresponding rate of growth in industrial output and industrial exports during this year.  The export figures for the month of January, however, show a fall of £1.4 million as compared with January, 1964.  The significance of this figure cannot yet be assessed, nor can the variation in the volume of exports be allocated to any particular category of goods or to any particular market.  The volume of activity in building and construction was up by 12 per cent, notwithstanding the effect of a protracted trade dispute in the Dublin area.  Given industrial peace and given more efficient production methods, for which all sections of that industry are now striving, a still greater increase in 1965 can with some confidence be forecast. Net emigration showed a fall last year as compared with the previous year and it was estimated that our population rose by about 8,000.</P>
    <P>It may be early yet to make any predictions as to how the Second Programme will work out, but all the indications are that the targets set in that Programme have been achieved so far.  If the assumptions in the Second Programme prove to be accurate, we can expect a continuation of our progress and that the 50 per cent increase in national income in real terms by 1970 will be realised.  The Government are of course very much concerned with the possibilities and difficulties presenting themselves in our external trading situation.  Our trading policy is directed at securing and developing wider outlets abroad for Irish goods, although it is necessary to keep on reasserting at home that, wherever outlets may be found and developed, they can only be availed of by continuous efforts to achieve maximum efficiency and higher productivity in the production of goods for export.</P>
    <P>It is because of the imposition of the British import surcharge last October that we had to think in terms of a possible setback in the implementation of our policy.  Because of what appeared <Col N="589" /> at first sight to be the implications and consequences of that decision of the British Government, we sought immediate discussions with the British Ministers at the highest level and subsequently decided to take measures to offset the effect of the surcharge upon Irish enterprises.  There are now press reports about the possibility of some reduction of this surcharge being announced in the near future.  Indeed, an announcement in the next few days has been foreshadowed in some British newspapers.  May I say straight away that I have no knowledge of any kind of any such decision by the British Government but I certainly assert that an early reduction of that surcharge seems to be essential if they are to establish the <i>bona fides</i> of their assertion, when they imposed it, that it was to be only temporary in its duration.</P>
    <P>The response of the firms concerned with industrial exports and, indeed, of the community generally, to the British surcharge was most encouraging.  The effects of the surcharge, while they were substantial enough, have not been as serious as was first feared.  One reason for this, of course, was the acceptance by our manufacturers and exporters of the undertaking given by the British Government that the surcharges would be removed as soon as possible and there were also the measures adopted by the Government to reduce its effect.</P>
    <P>If further increases in costs can be avoided there is every reason to hope that we can maintain our exports to Britain in 1965 at least at the 1964 level and that an increase in our exports to other countries is also possible.</P>
    <P>Recently, I spoke upon an aspect of this question to the members of the Cork Chamber of Commerce and urged on them and, through them, upon their fellow businessmen throughout Ireland the necessity for maximising efforts to explore alternative outlets for our industrial products and I gave them an assurance that firms that are willing to do this can count upon substantial Government help either in market exploration or in reducing the risks involved.  I urged them also not to think of this effort to secure markets <Col N="590" /> outside Britain for industrial exports as merely a temporary device to meet the problem of the British surcharge but as something which would secure permanent benefits for the national economy and which, therefore, should be continued even after the British surcharge has terminated.</P>
    <P>Our external payments situation is still a cause for some concern.  In 1964, we had a capital inflow of about £35 million, which, of course, more than offset the deficit upon current transactions and resulted in an increase of £5 million in the net external assets of our banking system and departmental funds.</P>
    <P>Various misstatements about the composition of this capital inflow have been made in this House and outside it from time to time by Deputy Dillon and members of his Party and I think it is desirable that I should try to put them right by giving them the information that the Government have regarding it.</P>
    <P>Included in this capital inflow there was a sum of £5.3 million which represented a loan floated in New York by Aer Lingus; £4.6 million represented external subscriptions to ESB issues and £2 million external subscriptions to our National Loan.  External capital participation in industrial development here cannot be exactly evaluated but it was obviously the largest factor of all.</P>
    <P>Irresponsible suggestions have been made from time to time that this inflow of capital which has produced the improvement in our external reserves, notwithstanding the deficit on current account, represents sales of Irish agricultural land to foreigners.  This assertion does not stand up for one minute to examination.  The total sales of land to non-nationals recorded in 1964 amounted to just £2 million in value. Of this, almost one-half&mdash;£.9 million &mdash;represented the purchase of land for industrial purposes and £½ million represented sales of exempted estates with Land Commission approval where no question of land policy was involved.  Land sales to non-nationals which were subject to the 25 per cent stamp duty represented an almost insignificant part of our capital inflow. <Col N="591" /> Nevertheless, the Government decided that there were reasons of national policy why sales of that kind should cease and we have introduced in the new Land Bill a provision which shall become operative when the new Land Bill is enacted which prohibits the sale of farm land to non-nationals entirely, except, of course, with the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke here yesterday evening about prices and he expressed some views as to the causes of the recent increase in prices which, if allowed to go unrectified, would give a very wrong picture of the situation.</P>
    <P>Between August, 1963, and November, 1964&mdash;and I selected these two dates because the turnover tax came into operation between them&mdash;the consumer price index rose by 10¼ points. A breakdown of that figure shows that the increase was made up in this way: higher prices for meat, potatoes and milk accounted for three points; taxation, including the turnover tax, accounted for 3½ points; imported materials accounted for ¾ points and increases due to other causes to 3 points.</P>
    <P>A rough analysis shows that one-third of the increase is attributable to the rises in the prices of these three agricultural items and to the cost of imported materials; one-third is attributable to tax increases and the remaining one-third to increases in the general level of prices due mainly to wage and salary adjustments.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course, control the cost of imported materials although, perhaps, collective buying arrangements could in some instances achieve economies.  The rises in agricultural prices have contributed to the increase, which I stated amounted to roughly £21 million, in the income of Irish farmers during the year and helped to bring about the situation in which the disparity between agricultural and other incomes was narrowed considerably during the year instead of being widened as indeed it was feared it would be about 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The other two-thirds of the consumer <Col N="592" /> price index increase was attributable to increases in taxation and to advances in prices generally.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the Vote on Account here this time last year, I said, in referring to the ninth round wage agreement which had just then been made, that as the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries for which the agreement provided was likely to be in excess of our resources, increases in prices were to be expected, subject to whatever extent these increases might be offset by higher productivity and greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>As regards this ninth round wage and salary adjustment, Deputy Sweetman said here yesterday that these increases were given without economic justification and by reason solely of the Government's political needs at the time.  Deputy Corish said that the Government had nothing whatever to do with it, that the agreement was made between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.  Neither Deputy was precisely accurate.  It was Government action which initiated the negotiations and it was our undertaking to apply whatever agreement was made, if an agreement was made, in the public service and throughout the State boards and local authorities which helped and, I think, helped considerably to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The amount of the increase finally agreed upon was higher than we had considered wise.  I so informed the parties to the negotiations during the process of the negotiations.  I expressed my view in the House when the negotiations were in progress and I expressed that view here also when the negotiations were completed, and that view was based upon the possible effect on prices of an increase higher than prevailing economic conditions appeared to justify.  Nevertheless, when the agreement was made the Government accepted it and applied it throughout the public service and directed its application throughout the State boards, as I have stated.</P>
    <P>In the event, we have had an increase in prices as a direct result of that ninth <Col N="593" /> round wage and salary agreement, offset in some degree, in fact in quite considerable degree by higher productivity. The improvement in productivity last year was substantially greater than in previous years and this, I think, is attributable to the fact which I stressed here in a previous debate that the maximum pressure upon industrial managements to look to their costs and methods of working and to achieve economies comes when higher salary and wage scales are arranged.</P>
    <P>It should be realised, however&mdash;and this is the main point I want to make here to the House&mdash;that a large part of the increased taxation which has contributed to this rise in the cost of living during the year was imposed to provide the revenue required to pay the higher wage and salary bill in the public service in fulfilment of that undertaking which we had given that the agreement would be applied throughout the public service.  Adding the effect of these tax increases to the increased prices of commodities directly attributable to higher wages and salaries, it is apparent that almost two-thirds of the higher cost of the items covered by the consumer price index can be traced back to the situation created by the ninth round.</P>
    <P>This situation can in large measure, if not entirely, adjust itself in this year provided certain conditions are met. These conditions were fairly stated here yesterday evening by Deputy Corish. First, the drive to achieve higher productivity in every sphere must be sustained and must prove to be at least as successful in 1965 as it was in 1964; secondly, the rise in overall national production in 1965 must not be less than it was in 1964; and, thirdly, there must be stability on the wages front as was envisaged in the ninth round agreement.</P>
    <P>I know that some Deputies will persist with the suggestion that in order to prevent prices from rising unjustifiably in present circumstances, we need some form of general or at least widespread official price control.  I doubt if the Deputies who argue for this really believe in its effectiveness, and probably their only purpose is to suggest to the public that price increases <Col N="594" /> could be avoided altogether if the Government so desired.  This is an absurd proposition.  Higher costs must mean higher prices and if by Government action higher costs are not allowed to be reflected in prices then the only consequence will be to bring production to a stop and to cause unemployment in the affected trades</P>
    <P>Circumstances develop from time to time when it is necessary for the Government to intervene to question prices and to take action to check increases which appear to be unjustifiable. In such circumstances the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken promptly the action necessary. The Prices Act of 1958 gives him the necessary powers which he has used and will use in particular cases whenever he believes that the public interest would be served by his intervention. The policy of allowing free competition to determine prices and to take official action only where there is evidence or a suggestion of unjustifiable increases is deliberately adopted by the Government not because we are indifferent to the upward movement of prices but because of a conviction born of experience that this is the best policy in our circumstances for keeping undue price rises in check.  I should like to make it clear that in any particular case, where on investigation the Minister is satisfied that prices are excessive, he will use the powers of the 1958 Act.  Intervention will be selective but action, when called for, following investigation, will be effective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred yesterday to the measures in this regard recently announced by the new Government in Great Britain.  Naturally we will watch with interest this British experiment but Deputies should not be misled as to its significance.  It is true that the British Government have seen the logic of linking up prices with wages and they are proposing to give the new body which they are setting up functions of supervision in both respects. It is a matter of interest that the British Trade Union Congress has apparently agreed to this arrangement.</P>
    <P>These measures may, we realise, influence public thinking here and perhaps lead to a wider understanding <Col N="595" /> that restrains on price increases must go back along the line to cover all the factors which can affect prices.  This is a matter of instructing public opinion and the British action may contribute to this in this country.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that the British Government are proposing in regard to prices not to go nearly so far in respect of taking powers of control as we have already gone in our Prices Act.  The success of their policy depends on voluntary compliance by business firms with the findings of their proposed board.  The British Government say in their White Paper that they propose, and I quote: &ldquo;to give the voluntary method every chance of proving that it can be made to work&rdquo;. They are proposing to rely on pressure of public opinion to get results. Nevertheless, I think their decision in this regard must be regarded as in line with our policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stressed yesterday that the avoidance of further price increases due to internal causes must be a major objective of national policy this year.  The whole future of our development programme depends on our ability to continue our exports and this in turn depends upon our goods being competitive.  Improvements in productivity resulting from greater investment in development and the application by Irish enterprises of the most recently developed techniques in management and organisation, as well as in production and distribution, will, I hope, offset higher costs in many industries and other sectors of activity and so help towards the avoidance of price increases.  The new Irish business journal <i>Business and Finance</i> in its issue of the 5th of this month, commenting on remarks which I made on this matter, expressed the view that, and I quote again: &ldquo;Price increases are under present circumstances as inevitable as the buds of May&rdquo;.  In my judgment, that is just lazy and inefficient thinking.  I want to say expressly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to say expressly to industrialists and businessmen, who may have been reading observations of that kind, that the Government reject entirely the proposition that price increases are inevitable and urge them to do the same, to reject that proposition in the same way.  There may indeed be cases where price reductions may be possible as a result of improvements in productivity. This is the justification for the financial assistance which the Government are providing to these firms through our Technical Assistance Scheme, through contributions to the expenses of the Irish National Productivity Committee, and in many other forms of aid for the development and modernisation of industry.  The efforts of management and workers organised under the auspices of State-financed and State-aided agencies such as the Irish National Productivity Committee and the various adaptation councils, and the Irish Management Institute have already resulted in an appreciable and continued improvement in productivity.</P>
      <P>There is also evidenced among our businessmen and our trade union leaders a lively interest in continuing their joint efforts to improve their efficiency, and an understanding of the need as may be seen from the various programmes of lectures, seminars, discussions and so forth which are now a feature of our life.  I urge on manufacturers to redouble their efforts to adapt and modernise their enterprises, to improve their methods in consultation with the trade unions and take full advantage of the advice and assistance now available to them from official agencies.  By accepting the challenge to change in this way, they can do a lot to keep prices stable as well as being more efficient and more profitable to themselves and their workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want at this stage to say a few words about our health services.  These <Col N="597" /> have been under consideration by a Select Committee of the Dáil for a long time.  I do not know yet when a report may be forthcoming or what the prospects may be of an agreed report&mdash;not very great, I should think.  Our total expenditure on medical care in this State as it is now, expressed as a percentage of our national income, is as high as, or higher than, in any country of the European Economic Community.  If we were to increase our expenditure on these medical care services, it would bring the proportion of national income which this country devotes to them substantially higher than in any of these countries.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael Members have, I understand, put to this Dáil Select Committee proposals for a considerable increase in expenditure on the health services which they themselves would estimate would cost about £6 million a year over and above the present level of expenditure.  It is not contended by the present Government or our representatives on the Committee, and certainly not by me, that improvements in our health services are not desirable, even if higher costs are involved; but there is a discussion proceeding in the Dáil Select Committee, I understand, to which Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred in a recent television broadcast, which seems to be concerned mainly with the method by which the higher cost envisaged is to be met. There is a proposal, endorsed by the Fine Gael Party, I gather, for a compulsory individual contribution to the costs of these health services, a contribution which will be called insurance even though it is in reality indistinguishable from a flat-rate poll-tax.</P>
    <P>Let me express my immediate view on that.  Social insurance contributions paid weekly by workers and employers are a satisfactory basis for the financing of income-maintenance schemes operating in particular circumstances of unemployment, illness, old age, and so on, under which the obligation of each participant can be precisely defined in law and where the total outgoing in any particular year can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. But the financing of a general health service, the cost of which cannot be <Col N="598" /> contained within any pre-defined limits by that method has never been found satisfactory in any country.  The Commission of the European Economic Community has so reported.  The present British Labour Government appear from speeches made by members prior to their General Election to be pledged to its termination.  We do not know the Labour Party views here, but the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are notably unenthusiastic.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has described this as an arrangement particularly suited to the circumstances of this country.  That is basically and demonstrably untrue.  This system of social insurance, as it is called, based on weekly contributions by workers deducted by their employers from their earnings, was devised for the highly industrialised countries, where the great majority of the people were wage and salary earners, and is particularly suited to their circumstances. It cannot be suitable in the circumstances of a country more than one-half of whose occupied people are not employed by anybody, who are farmers, shopkeepers, independent craftsmen working on their own. Therefore, the basic proposition that this so-called insurance system of financing the health services is more suited than the present system to the circumstances of this country is without firm foundation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, this system is excessively rigid.  Everybody knows here that it is a matter of acute political difficulty for any Government to propose an increase in the amount of the weekly social welfare contribution which workers must make.  The probability of improving our health services is curtailed by the introduction into it of a rigid system of this kind for financing it.  It is regressive in an extreme degree.  It means that the lowest paid worker, the smallest of our farmers, will be required to pay the same weekly contribution as the better-off workers and better-off farmers and get only the same benefit.</P>

      <P>The hope of an agreed scheme which would take our health services outside the arena of controversial politics appears to be dim.  The situation, as I see it, is that Fine Gael regard themselves free to advocate their ideas while the Government regard themselves as inhibited from putting these ideas into operation or developing alternative proposals by the very existence of the Committee. I think, therefore, it is desirable that this Committee should finish up its work one way or another, preferably <Col N="600" /> by submission of a report which will at least ensure that the facts set out will be better known than they are at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other matter I want to raise and that is in relation to the National Industrial Economic Council.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, this council's role is advisory but it is playing an increasingly important part in the co-ordination of an economic programming. This is what I envisaged and desire. It has now completed its first year in operation and a number of quite important and significant reports by it have been published.</P>
      <P>This council, in its report upon manpower policy, expressed the view that an integral manpower policy is urgently required in Ireland.  Their report indicated the aspects of a manpower policy which they considered should be first developed.  Arising out of that report, the council have maintained a liaison with the inter-departmental committee of senior officers who are studying the administrative arrangements required for the implementation of a manpower policy and they are considering how the activities now being carried on by different bodies concerned with manpower policies, together with such new activities as the council consider to be desirable, could best be co-ordinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A manpower policy, as we envisage it, means not only forecasting needs for particular skills and better placement services but it also means training and retraining workers and provision for dealing with redundancy due to policy and technological changes.  We must also seek to move, if we can, in this matter, by way of agreement, certainly to secure the widest measures of agreement that are possible and I would <Col N="601" /> deprecate any action which might precipitate decisions on any aspect of this very important and very wide question in advance of the discussions and the examinations which are now in progress.</P>
    <P>I began by saying that this would be, in my judgment, a difficult year.  I suppose we must never expect to have an easy year certainly when it is the aim to mobilise and organise a great national effort for economic and social progress.  The momentum of progress now set up must be maintained.  As national production is expanded the nation will acquire additional resources which will permit us to attain social achievements which are, at this time, beyond our capacity.  Notwithstanding the difficulties we foresee, our confidence in the future of the country and in the plans which we have made to ensure that it will be a better future remains constant as does also our determination to make sure that not anything or anyone will be allowed to place it in jeopardy.</P>

I can assure any of the Deputies who were not in the Dáil at that time, if they feel like it, they can read that speech virtually word for word, and certainly cliché for cliché first delivered by the present Taoiseach any time from 1932 to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That speech was full of the arrogant convictions in the assurances that he was putting forward, the plans he was proposing, the great benefits that inevitably must flow, the social changes, prosperity, full employment, end of emigration and all the same guarantees as we were promised here today by the same man, only 30 years older, but, unfortunately, obviously no way wiser.  The facts of the matter are that this man who has just spoken has had complete control of the whole organisation for the past 30 years.  He is no neophyte in politics; he is no new man who has taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man has sat in that seat, or <Col N="602" /> next door to the man who sat in that seat and approved, presumably, of the policies which have been carried out for the past 30 years.  The speech we listened to here today was about prosperity, stable prices, wage agreements, manpower policies, educational services, better social services and better health services.  Instead of all that, he has watched, and his colleagues have watched beside him, while between a quarter and a half million people got out of the country.  They did so because of the failure of the policies of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach, and all the other things we know so well which have been put up since the 1930s and, in fact, since the 1920s.</P>
    <P>The best part of one million people have gone out of the country because of the scandalous position in relation to educational services, lack of scholarships, lack of opportunities for young people, improper school buildings, all the unemployed people&mdash;six to eight per cent unemployed&mdash;a position which in any other country would bring about a revolution.  As well as all this, the old people are getting only 37/6 a week.  How can an intelligent man like the Taoiseach continue to make the same speech year after year for a whole three decades, or the best part of it, and yet not feel that he is either defrauding the public or fooling himself?</P>
    <P>Very briefly, in relation to his most recent comment on the health services, I want to say, so far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we agree with his stricture that the Dáil Committee should have produced some positive results, which they did not do because of their belief that it was simply a time-saving evasion on the part of the Minister for Health to avoid making any changes in our health services.  Notice of our resignation from that Committee was handed to the newspapers early this afternoon.  We hope that other members of the Committee will take much the same action in order that we can expose the attitude of the Minister for Health, who has consistently taken <Col N="603" /> every opportunity he could to see that no finality was arrived at in regard to our deliberations and that certainly no constructive health service proposals could come back to this House for implementation, presumably for the reason mentioned by the Taoiseach, that he or the Government was afraid of the cost.</P>
    <P>These are the people who continue to talk about the expanding economy, about rising productivity, about greater prosperity, about a state of society which was never as good as it now is. I would like to refer to the Taoiseach's comments in regard to prices because they are the matters which he appears to believe are incapable of solution&mdash; the continued increase in prices.  The Taoiseach seems to have overlooked the fact in his discussion of the causation of wage increases that, in fact, the Government's attitude in regard to taxation and particularly in regard to the imposition of the turnover tax was, of course, the initiating influence in the upward spiral of prices which led inevitably to the increase in wages.</P>
    <P>We know well that price increases are necessary from time to time.  It is the inflation of prices to which we object.  The fact that inflation has taken place in regard to prices has been shown by the small, timid action taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to petrol, in which it was seen that these people were trying to rob the public of another quarter of a million or half a million pounds or whatever it was.  They gave no serious justification for it, and the Minister when I asked him the other day for the reason they had given showed that no cause has yet been given by those people.  I am certain that if they had consistent cause for increasing petrol prices at that time we would have had that reason pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister was able to curtail the increase in sugar prices, and in regard to flour it was possible to get a tiny reduction in price in this most essential commodity.  Of course, this is completely inadequate.  The Minister's attitude to price increases has been <Col N="604" /> flaccid, complacent, and he is selfsatisfied. He does not appear to have to concern himself at all about the impact of prices on the ordinary housewife. If he was conscious of the present effect he would know that the position is that the average housewife is becoming more and more frightened of the Friday night wage packet, which she knows cannot cover the outlay on the next day's purchases that she will have to make for her family.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seemed to me to be thoroughly naïve and ingenuous in his suggestion to us that the Government believe in the operation of free compeition to reduce prices.  Who in heaven's name does he think over the age of 12 or 15 believes that there is any significant competition in the prices of essential commodities?  The Minister knows quite well that you can go from one end of the city to the other and you will pay the same price in different shops for the average article of clothing, footwear, food, bread and milk, petrol, cigarettes, if you smoke them, and drink.  Is there any essential or quasi-essential item of consumer goods which is subject to free prices?  No attempt whatsoever is being made by the Government to insist on free prices. It is alleged to be a dynamic private enterprise mechanism, but the first thing they strangle is free competition in prices, because of course the system does not work and they cannot allow it to work.  There is no question whatsoever of there being this free pricing system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach suggested that we should rely on the pressure of public opinion to get results.  He can take it from me, and I am sure from most of the Deputies who have any contact at all with the public or are members of the public themselves, that there is great resentment at the moment at the high prices of particular commodities, particularly meat, and that in spite of the public resentment, there is no way in which they can bring down prices and maintain a reduction in prices. That is the function and the purpose of the Government.  That is why we are nominated and elected here, so to order society that they will not be exploited, their pockets pillaged by <Col N="605" /> those people who want to make extravagant profits at the time when the average householder, white-collar worker or any worker, is having a hard time to get his children's mouths full of even bread and tea at the present price rates.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is fond of talking about the futility of looking for price control, and yet he tells us that he has a Prices Act.  What was the purpose of that Act?  What was its function meant to be?  Surely it was meant to be a mechanism whereby the consumer would get his goods at reasonable, fair prices?  If he thinks that that can be operated, why does he sneer at us for suggesting that there should be some form of price control, when he has not operated the Act which gives him the authority to interfere with unfair prices?  The Taoiseach cannot have it every way.  He read a little extract from a note in this new paper <i>Financial Comment</i> that &ldquo;price increases are as inevitable as the buds in May.&rdquo;  I think it is about time the trade union movement, if they cannot get a guarantee from the Minister on this question, should have it equally clearly stated in their organ that &ldquo;Wage increases are as inevitable as the buds in May, unless there is some price control and profit control and control of dividends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how many people saw the advertisement which appeared when the Labour Government were elected in Britain in October of last year in the <i>Financial Times</i>&mdash;a long advertisement in the corner of the paper which proclaimed &ldquo;No Labour Government here in Ireland, no control of profits, no control of prices, stock exchange index rising by so many points.&rdquo;  Clearly they considered this country and the consuming public as a captive body and fair game&mdash;take all you can get from it.  Nobody will question what they do or how they do it.</P>
    <P>Take the reports of the various companies in this financial year.  I have seen those for clothing companies, boot and shoe companies, hire purchase companies, banks&mdash;all of them showing 15, 16, 17 and 18 per cent profits.  The profits are increasing <Col N="606" /> all the time.  Yet the consumer is told that, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the prosperity of the community, and so on, he must tighten his belt and learn to live on what he already knows is inadequate.  Why should these people who represent the bankers, industrialists, Ranks, Guinness, and so on, be allowed to take these great increases in their already great wealth?  Why should it be tolerated?  Surely these people have more than they can spend already? They have more motor cars than they can use in a day and they have more luxury houses than they can live in. They already can go wherever they want to go for their holidays and can enjoy themselves as they please.  What do they want with more money?  Why should it be tolerated?  Why should this man Rank, from somewhere in London or England, or wherever he lives, be allowed to tell us that he does not propose to introduce the modernised methods needed in our flourmilling industry, the result of which must be greater efficiency and then a possible reduction in the price of bread, certainly not an increase?  Why should that be tolerated?</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that the Government have been very quick where the industrialist has been concerned.  No matter in what position he finds himself, whether it is price control, dividend control, profit control, nobody will lay a finger on him.  Then, when it came to the British surcharge, we were practically recalled by telegram to find the percentage of the charge so that the industrialist should not get hurt or damaged in any way.  Yet, while this unlimited money appears to be available for this section of the community, when it comes to finding money for the redundant worker, for his retraining, for his re-settlement, for any inconvenience that may be caused to him, it is a difficult matter.  We have not got any communication from the Government as to what will happen to the worker if, for instance, any of these lazy people who have failed to take the Government's offers of help to modernise their industries take the Government's assistance and introduce mechanisation or even automation in <Col N="607" /> their industries.  The worker does not know.  Why?  Why do the Government not tell him?  Is he important? We have 61,000 unemployed&mdash;the pool of unemployment which was once described as desirable in the capitalist economy as one can then pick and choose.  Is it because they are available and that the unemployed can get out and get to Britain?</P>
    <P>Why have the Government not taken any steps to announce a positive policy in relation to redundancy?  I believe that the worker who takes any part whatsoever in modernisation, in improved method management or in time and motion studies to increase efficiency is a very foolish man until he gets from the Government a clear-cut statement as to what happens to him if he co-operates in working himself out of a job.  I should like to see from the trade union movement a refusal on the part of the worker to collaborate in any of these schemes until the Government have been kicked into activity and a clear-cut policy in relation to the redundant worker is agreed upon and accepted by the unions, after which every assistance would be given in the creation of efficient industry.  Outside of that, I think the worker is very misguided if he gives any help or assistance at all.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave us at some length a breakdown of the figures in regard to the 10¼ points increase in the cost of living figure.  Meat, potatoes and milk went up by three points. These are part of the basic staple diet of the majority of our people.  A significant increase in their price has meant an effective reduction in the standard of living of our people.  Tax increase accounted for another 3½ points.  The public do not care how the cost of living increase was brought about, particularly when it concerns an essential component of consumer goods.  They do not care if it is tax because if it is money out of their pockets as turnover tax, then it is money that they are not spending on bread, meat, potatoes or milk or whatever they may need for their children. Therefore, to say that 3½ points were due to taxation, as if it were a negligible <Col N="608" /> or a relatively unimportant thing is to say, as far as the public are concerned, money was spent on paying the Government the turnover tax that might otherwise be spent on essential food commodities.</P>
    <P>One of the myth-makers in the Civil Service at one time created the idea that social spending&mdash;non-productive capital investment is the name they gave to it in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i>&mdash;is a waste of money, that it is non-productive.  It was considered that better houses, slum clearance, better roads, better schools, hospitals, better conditions for old people or whatever you like of that kind are not like a potato chip machine or something that could produce a clear-cut return for the investment and consequently are not really desirable. Human suffering, the needs of old people, of sick people or of young people were all reduced to an item in a profit and loss account and were regarded as non-productive capital investment.  The result is Griffith Barracks and all the other chaotic conditions our people are enduring at the moment, overcrowded conditions, young married couples living with their families, and so on.  That is all because of the advice given by this brains trust to the Minister and I am blaming the Minister for taking that stupid advice.  They decided that this kind of thing was non-productive.</P>
    <P>It has been changed in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and now we shall have the houses. People will be able to send their children to proper schools.  We shall have better communications and things of that sort.  They are such self-evident needs that it is difficult to understand how anybody could dismiss them as unimportant, even on the strictly administrative or pounds, shillings and pence cash-register assessment of national needs of any society, leaving aside humanity and christianity and all these words one hears so much about and sees so little of.  That has been exposed and we are now to have these things but I am surprised to hear relatively young Deputies like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Malley&mdash;for <Col N="609" /> whom I have considerable admiration in his Department's administration&mdash; and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Lenihan, and sometimes Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Agriculture, subscribing to the new idea about taxation which presumably is being put out by their advisers.  I am not blaming the advisers; I am blaming the people who accept this idea in regard to taxation policy that indirect taxation as a tax on expenditure has less of a disincentive effect on economic activity than tax on income.  The general idea is that if you have high direct taxation, that is a bad thing, but you can have pretty well any level of indirect taxation and the people will swallow it.  That is a most dangerous doctrine from the Government's point of view.  It is none of my business to worry about the dangers besetting the Government but for what it is worth, it is a foolish conclusion to arrive at. First of all, nobody likes taxation of any kind, direct or indirect, but, as the Taoiseach said, certain social services have to be funded and consequently the money must be got somewhere.</P>
    <P>I believe there has been a retrograde development on the part of the Government in recent years, that is, the increase in the indirect taxation ratio to the direct taxation ratio.  Clearly, direct taxation had the great virtue that it soaked those who were well able to pay it: you paid according to your means.  That policy has been reversed so that the indirect taxation burden has been greatly increased.  What is frightening in the speech of the Taoiseach is the thought that they are now going to increase greatly the level of indirect taxation, primarily by turnover tax.  The Parliamentary Secretary's recent speech on these financial matters seemed to me to hint at that, that you may increase that if you wish and it will not have any undesirable repercussions.</P>
    <P>The Government are greatly mistaken in that view, just as the Taoiseach was when he referred to the three point increase in the cost of living and appeared to dismiss it as an undesirable but inevitable necessity.  As far as the public <Col N="610" /> are concerned, he might as well have said that it is due to an increase in the price of bread, tea, butter, or whatever it may be, because the money that went on the tax would have gone on those essential commodities.  For that reason, any increase in indirect taxation is an increase, effectively, in the price of essential commodities and inevitably will be reflected in prices and in wage demands.</P>
    <P>The Government have to face this choice.  The worker is not the supine, bucolic, indifferent-to-his-lot type of individual he once was.  Thank God for that.  He has become particularly conscious of his responsibilities but also of his rights.  He has become particularly conscious, above all, of his strength and his power.  He knows you cannot get on without him and he knows it is quite a simple matter to prove that.  He has done it before when you wanted to put us all in jail for going on strike.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would suggest to the Government that they reconsider this latest nostrum which they have received from their Civil Service advisers, that it is all right to impose indirect taxation but there is a great evil in direct taxation because it reduces incentives and so on.  The idea that non-productive capital investment was a bad thing has been exploded and you have reversed engines on it.  You may not get the opportunity to reverse engines on this mistake about indirect taxation.  Bring it in in the Budget in a significant form and out you will go and out you will stay.  Deputy Flanagan was right in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice referred to Coalition Governments and made a comparison between his Government and the inter-Party Government and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley, does the same.  May I point this out to them?  Nobody believes that a Coalition Government, basically speaking, or democratically or politically speaking, could ever be as efficient a mechanism for Government as a single Party Government.  Everybody would agree on that.  When the Government speakers are criticising the multi-Party type Government, it would not be a bad idea if they considered <Col N="611" /> rather more carefully the prospects for single Party Government for the next ten or 15 years.  I will leave it at that.  May I also put it to the Government Party that if they have been operating what we all believe to be the most efficient form of mechanism of government, that is one-Party Government, for at least the past eight years and the best part of 30 years, why is the country the way it is?  Why are you gasping for support with the back-to-the-wall speech by the Taoiseach and when only three or four years ago you had the greatest over-all majority which any political Party had since the State was founded?</P>
    <P>What did you do with it?  How did you squander it?  Why did you reduce it?  Do you ever ask yourselves those questions?  Do you ever ask for an explanation as to why you have to rely on Deputy Sherwin or Deputy Sheridan, or whoever it is you depend on?  What happened that majority and the position you had?  Why did you not use that power, as you tell us it is the only power that matters&mdash;single-Party Government, and full authority to implement all your plans and programmes? Where did it get you, minority Government with a diminishing support in the country?  I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to agree with me, but I would ask Government speakers to do a little deep thinking on the question.  The public have been, I think, particularly patient with and particularly tolerant of them.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Justice asked us to be fair and to plot a graph in order to determine anything.  Deputy Corish made the point that in recent years the figures for emigration have gone up.  There were in 1963 roughly some 22,000 emigrants.  The figure for 1964 is 27,000.  Where does one start the graph?  Where does one finish the graph?  Do we take the life of this Government, eight years or so? Do we take the life of the Fianna Fáil Party since 1932?  Do we take the life of all the Governments since 1922? In 1922 the emigration figure was <Col N="612" /> 16,000.  That was in a situation of national chaos.</P>
    <P>When we reach the Lemass millennium in 1970 we shall still have at least 10,000 of our people getting out each year&mdash;that is, if his plans materialise. We shall still have 10,000 being kicked out to be fed by John Bull, the man we keep kicking around.  They will be kicked out to be fed, clothed and housed by John Bull, and given jobs.</P>
    <P>Why is there no attempt on the part of the Government to plan for full employment?  Why has there never been any attempt on the part of any of our Governments to plan for full employment?  Is it an impossibility? The Scandinavian countries, the Central European countries and New Zealand all say that full employment is merely a device of politics and that full employment can be created with just a little bit of disorganisation of the existing vested interest of one kind or another.  Full employment is not a new idea just thought up by me here. It is an accepted cliché of government in most of the civilised countries.  The Taoiseach comes in here and tells us he will send out about 60,000 emigrants between now and 1970.  Threequarters of one per cent is the figure for the increase in employment, which represents about 8,000 people, leaving something around 12,000 to emigrate every year.  I do not think that is an achievement.  It is a continuing failure.  It is the chronic repetition of the old failure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach seem to think that the only source of wealth in any society is taxation.  If one has to tax, then it is my belief that the Government should impose further direct taxes on high incomes of one kind or another. Deputy Corish suggested last night a capital gains tax of some kind or other.  Certainly justice should at least be seen to be done, or attempted to be done, and those who are already well off in our society should be hit, and hit hard.  If the Government do that they will certainly get our support.</P>
    <P>One of the mistakes the Government continually make&mdash;the Minister for Health is an expert at it&mdash;is to <Col N="613" /> query where the money will come from unless we double taxation, increase the turnover tax, or whatever it may be.  It cannot be done, they allege, because the country cannot afford it.  Education, health, social services, and so on, cannot be improved.  The very fact that the Government cannot afford to feed the old, look after the sick, educate the young is the clearest indictment of the failure of the Government's social and economic policies over the past 40 years.  Four decades, and the Government are still as complacent and as self-assured.  The Taoiseach is as certain of success now as no doubt he was in 1932 when he made precisely the same promises.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made by one of the newspapers&mdash;strangely enough, the <i>Independent</i>&mdash;that there should be deficit budgeting in order to avoid taxation.  What is wrong with deficit budgeting?  The Taoiseach always gives the impression that he is a goahead, courageous individual who is not afraid to try out new ideas.  What is so wrong with deficit budgeting when the Taoiseach is so certain that he has a gilt-edged plan for economic prosperity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in operation at the moment, a plan that cannot fail, a plan that will lead to an expanding economy, to greater national wealth, to an increase in agriculture, industry, salaries, wages, profits and dividends. Everything will go up.  Why cannot the Taoiseach for just one year take a chance?  Will he not have money to burn in 1970, according to himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach used the words &ldquo;immature thinking&rdquo; today.  The Taoiseach himself has patently displayed his own immature thinking.  On the one hand, he tries to run a five or 10 year economic programme.  That is a perfectly intelligent thing to do.  It is what most developed countries are doing.  The annual budgeting system is a cod.  Everyone knows that now. What does it mean?  Giving old age pensioners an increase operative six months later.  It is mere ritual.  It is incense burning.  It has no meaning <Col N="614" /> any more.  No one takes any notice of it.  It has virtually no implications at all from the point of view of the economy.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is serious about his planning policy, if he has any faith in it, if he believes that it will succeed, then he should be able to say to himself that, within five years, we will balance our budgets all right.  There will be ups and downs but the overall pattern will be the successful implementation of an economic policy designed to create prosperity by 1970.  If the Taoiseach believes that, then he should not be a bit worried about what will happen in March or April of this year.</P>
    <P>The reality is, of course, that he is worried, very worried, and quite rightly so.  I sincerely hope the Taoiseach will present this budget.  Have an election after it, if he likes, but present the budget first.  We had a great deal of ballyhoo from the public relations officers on the television, on the wireless, in the newspapers and the danger is that the myths may be accepted. The danger is that those who generate the myths may come to believe in them themselves&mdash;never had it so good, society bursting at the seams with wealth, the country flowing with milk and honey.</P>
    <P>What is the real picture?  61,000 unemployed. Old people living on a pittance of 37/6 a week.  How can the Government reconcile these two transparent contradictions?  It is just as well the Government believe in the annual budgeting system because they will be faced with their failure to balance their accounts.  The impudence of the Government.  They cannot even operate our society in accordance with their own rules.</P>
    <P>It would, in my opinion, be desirable that the Government should go to the country.  Let them do what they like after that, but I think it is important that the public should know the truth. They should first have the opportunity of examining the profit and loss account.  Then the after-dinner speeches and the chambers of commerce diatribes we have had to suffer over the years will be exposed.  The Government are still hard up.  The Government have to go to the very ordinary <Col N="615" /> members of the public, the men with four, five and six children, already hard pressed because of the high prices of essential commodities, in search of money.  They are not going to the people who patronise the Canary Islands, the Bermudas, or anywhere like that.  It is the unfortunate ordinary people who have now been served with notice that Lord Moyne, Jacobs, Rowntree and all the rest of them can sleep easily in their beds tonight, because there is plenty of money in the pocket of the unfortunate fathers of six or seven children and they will take it from them.  It is the reverse of the Robin Hood principle&mdash;robbing the poor in order to help the rich, making it easy for them in their tax burden.  That is the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Government to duck the Budget, having another multi-Party Government coming in and making a failure of it and then getting the blame later on by Government speakers saying that if they had not been interrupted there would have been prosperity unlimited.  That was the catchphrase in regard to the inter-Party Government.  I want this whole game to be played out to the last card. That means this Budget coming up with the type of taxation that will be required, showing at the same time the failure of the Government to take any really effective steps in regard to the one hundred and one things that require doing today as they did 20 or 30 years ago when the Taoiseach first started to make that kind of speech.</P>
    <P>The worker is given homilies by endless speakers about the necessity for maintaining the competitive pricing position in regard to European competition. Why is it that he should be asked to tighten his belt?  Is it not a fact that our goods sell in Europe &mdash;if they sell at all to any extent&mdash; because our worker is underpaid already by anything up to 30 per cent compared with the wages paid to European workers?  In various other aspects, our worker gets less from society than his fellow worker in West Germany, Britain, France and Belguim. <Col N="616" /> Prices are between eight per cent and ten per cent higher here than in Britain and other countries; yet wages are up to 30 per cent lower.  He has a long way to go before he has anything like parity with his European comrades. I do not think he should be asked to starve himself or tighten his belt or restrict his consumption or his simple pleasures, which he must restrict now particularly when there is a prospect of increased taxation.</P>
    <P>Does our competitive position in regard to prices in Europe not rest practically entirely with the manufacturer and industrialist, who has shown himself to be completely indifferent to the Government's calls for action in the national interest?  He does not give two damns for the national interest.  He is self-sufficient.  He lives better than he ever lived before in his life.  He spends as much money as he wants to.  He gives his young people everything the heart of man could desire.  He does not care what happens after that.  As I said, they put it in the paper&mdash;no profit restriction, no price restriction, the stock exchange indexes going up and up. This is a wonderful society for that type of person&mdash;the amoral individual who feels he has a right to take whatever he can from the captive consumer.</P>
    <P>The Government&mdash;the Taoiseach did it again tonight&mdash;continue to exhort these people to change their ways.  Nobody seems to recall that it is only a few months since we heard they are operating one of the most incompetent and inefficiently organised industrial arms in Europe.  What is worse, they have gone on doing it after being told. No wonder they have to underpay their workers and provide indifferent social services and health services for our people.  They will not take any significant steps to improve or automate their plants.  The absurdity of appealing to the worker to increase production is shown by the position that would face any society&mdash; face ourselves if they were to get around to automating their plants tomorrow.  Automate any of our factories we can automate&mdash;and there are precious few&mdash;and you could run them with half a dozen people.  What is the <Col N="617" /> Government's plan for that position? You have half a dozen people producing what 500 people produced before. It was nothing to do with the worker that productivity has increased. It increased because the industrialist mechanised or brought in automated plant.  This talk to the worker about increased productivity no longer has any relevance in industrial relations. The worker produces as fast as the plant will allow him to produce.  With the type of industry we have here, he is restricted by the rate of production of that plant.  That is what is going to determine pricing in Europe in the years ahead.  As I said before.  It is a case of the man with the bulldozer and the man with the shovel.  Tell both of them to shift the hill.  Who will do it more quickly?  This haranguing of the unfortunate worker to increase productivity is completely absurd, while allowing the industrialists to get away with complete indifference to the same type of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody accepts the Taoiseach's warning to the country that it is going to be a difficult year and is prepared for it but the Government should recall, when they talk about cutting our cloth according to our measure, that the fact that the size of the cloth is so small is the result of the failure of Government policy. There are 60,000 unemployed.  That, clearly, is a number of people who could be gainfully employed if there were intelligent Government policy in operation in our society.  The fact that so many people have to get out is another loss.  The Government have failed to use that potential as the basis for the creation of national wealth. Most important of all, of course, is the failure to use agriculture and industry as wealth-creating potentials.</P>
      <P>We are still told that the rate at which people are leaving the land is around 10,000 a year.  That is a drop from the 12,000 of the average findings in the Report of the Commission on Emigration.  So that, the rate of flight from the land is still very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened on the land is particularly interesting because, while there has been pretty widespread mechanisation, on the bigger size farms at any rate, the mechanisation, instead of being used as it should be used to increase production from the land, is being used to replace manpower on the land.  So, over the past 20 or 30 years we have seen in operation the tremendous problem of redundancy in agriculture and the relatively backward type of industry but in agriculture there has been this redundancy to the tune <Col N="619" /> of between 10,000 and 12,000 a year from an industry which happens to be in process of being mechanised.</P>
    <P>One of the dreadful comments on the activities of successive Governments is that they have taken no serious steps to cater for that very high level of redundancy over the past 20 or 30 years.  It is no use saying that this has been a European or a world problem. It should not be a problem in a predominantly agricultural community. Mechanisation and machines should have been used to increase production from the land, not to displace men from the land and on that, of course, should have been based the industries such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and the other industries that Deputy McQuillan spoke about last night.  The raw materials of industry should have been based on increased production from rural Ireland.  In that way one would have got both industrial employment and the use of agricultural land to the optimum in our society.</P>
    <P>That is probably the greatest reason why there is not the money available for developments in other spheres.  I accept what the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health and all these people say.  I accept that there is not the money available for the things that we would like to see.  As they operate our economy, the money is not there, but it is their fault.  The raw material is there.  The raw material is the land.  That is our mineral wealth. The men&mdash;the labour&mdash;that was our wealth but we squandered it, we exported it and, as I have said, we are going to go on doing so until 1970 under this wonderful programme.  Ten thousand to 12,000 a year have to get out.  We are depending on them to get out for the success of the programme &mdash;60,000 or 70,000 plus 60,000 presently unemployed &mdash; 120,000 souls who are going to live on the dole. That is a prosperous society! That is an expanding economy! That is a worthwhile place to live in, is it not? Instead of living, as they are on this pittance, they could have been creating the wealth with which we could do all these things.  That is on the agricultural side.</P>

      <Col N="620" /> On the industrial side we have these fiddling industries which are producing relatively little at high cost, frequently a bad product, not because of the workmanship or the craftsman-ship, which is as good as the best in the world, but because of the out-ofdate, antiquated ideas, the laziness of the average industrialist.  That was proved by the Minister's own CIO Reports and the finding subsequently that only one in ten had bothered his head to contact the Government in relation to their offer to help to bring them up to the 1960 standard of industrial development.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons the unfortunate consumer has to be overtaxed, why he cannot afford to live as he would like to live, why he cannot afford to educate his children as he would like to or why the Government cannot afford to give us proper health services. The money is not there because the Government have not used either the agricultural industry or the textile or other industries to create the wealth which is there for the creation, as has been shown in so many countries of the world, from Sweden to New Zealand.  It is the Government's political failure, not the failure of the workers or of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position in this country from both the political and economic point of view certainly seems to make it desirable if not essential that the Taoiseach should end the present uncertainty and that he should do that by seeking as early a general election as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of the conflicting views that will be heard in the House and elsewhere as to the merits or otherwise of the Government, all of us will agree that the state of confusion and uncertainty which has arisen because of the weakness of the Government and the inability of the Government to command support throughout the country is not doing anyone any good. So long as the Taoiseach is able to command a sufficient number of votes in the House there is nothing we can do on these benches effectively to end that uncertainty.  The Taoiseach can end it.  He can end it tonight if he <Col N="621" /> decides to pay a visit to Árus an Uachtaráin and secure the dissolution of the Dáil, and for my part I would recommend that course to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil may fancy themselves in the role of doughty veterans doggedly holding on in the face of adverse odds.  It does not occur to them that the picture they present to the public may be quite a different one and the view of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Ministers in that role may not be the picture as seen through the eyes of the public.  I am quite willing to accept that the Fianna Fáil Ministers appear as knights in shining armour to the eyes of those huddled together behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil cumainn meetings but that is not the picture they are presenting to the public.  It is time members of the Government, in particular, came to a realisation of that and the sooner they do come to that realisation the better.</P>
    <P>The present cocksure attitude of Government spokesmen&mdash;and we have seen it in evidence in the course of this discussion&mdash;is not inspiring confidence, as they seem to think it is.  On the other hand, it is arousing a certain amount of resentment, a certain amount of anger and contempt among the ordinary people who see not a picture of courageous politicians doggedly fighting with their backs to the wall but a group of politicians clinging to office despite the clear indications that have been given to them that their tenure of office is, in the eyes of many people, at an end. They give the impression not of hardy warriors but of people whistling rather loudly to put on a display of confidence and to keep up the morale of the troops in the trenches.</P>
    <P>The Government Party have very often persuaded the people to judge them on paper plans rather than on the result of their work.  As a political Party in government or out of government they have failed to grasp the fact that nowadays people are inclined to judge the Government on results and not on paper plans.  Despite the fact that they have been upwards of 20 <Col N="622" /> years as the Government of the country, we still have Fianna Fáil speakers producing new plans and inviting the people to judge them on the plans rather than on the performances.  The Government Party do not seem to be able to grasp that, notwithstanding the lesson which they should have learned the hard way in Roscommon and in Galway, and we still have talk of Government plans and more Government plans.</P>
    <P>Looking to results rather than plans, I wish to be told what are the results on which the people are to judge. What is the performance of the Government on which they can invite the people to pass judgment?  I do not think any Fianna Fáil Deputy listening to me will deny that when the present Government were out of office and seeking to regain office and when they were seeking to tear down the inter-Party Government that was there before them, the three main points of their attack on that Government were, first, in relation to the numbers of unemployed; secondly, in relation to the amount of emigration; and, thirdly, in relation to the cost of living.  I do not think there is any Deputy opposite who will deny that the whole trend of the Fianna Fáil attack in those days, the ladder on which they relied to climb back to office, was formed by those three rungs: unemployment, emigration and the cost of living.  It is fair, therefore, to ask the Deputies opposite and to ask the country at large to consider the record of the Government Party in relation to those three items in particular.</P>
    <P>Can anyone in this House forget the type of advertisement which appeared seeking support for the Fianna Fáil Party in those days in regard to unemployment?  Can anyone forget the positive pronouncements from Fianna Fáil spokesmen that unemployment was the acid test which was to be applied as to whether a Government's policy was a success or a failure?  Can anyone forget that at the same time as that attack was being mounted on their predecessors in office on the question of unemployment, Fianna Fáil spokesmen were talking <Col N="623" /> glibly about 100,000 new jobs if Fianna Fáil were re-elected to office.</P>
    <P>As I said before in this House, Fianna Fáil Ministers and Deputies are rather sensitive when they are reminded of this matter of the 100,000 new jobs.  They say it was not really a plan, that it was only a proposal for discussion.  I do not think it matters and certainly I do not care two hoots whether it is called a plan, a proposal or a promise, because the fact is, as every Fianna Fáil Deputy knows, that at the same time as they were mounting that attack on their predecessors, Fianna Fáil were talking about 100,000 new jobs if they were re-elected as a Government.</P>
    <P>Is it not fair to ask now in the year 1965 where are the 100,000 new jobs? Would we not be entitled to criticise the Government during the discussion on this Vote from these benches if they came before us and claimed that they have not succeeded in getting 100,000 new jobs but that they had got 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000, would we not be entitled to ask what about the other 70,000 to bring up the figure to the 100,000 new jobs they were talking about?  What are the facts?  Will any Deputy opposite deny them?  Is is not a fact that as compared with the year 1956 when those statements were being made, instead of 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 or 70,000 new jobs, we have 73,000 odd fewer people at work than we had in the so-called black year of 1956?</P>
    <P>That is the record of the Government so far as employment is concerned. Instead of creating 100,000 new jobs, they have succeeded in producing a situation in which there are 73,000 odd fewer people at work and in which there are still 60,000 or 61,000 people unemployed.  I wonder is that a record any member of the Fianna Fáil Party can be proud of?  Is that a record to inspire confidence?</P>
    <P>The second main point of the Fianna Fáil attack in those days was on the question of emigration.  I do not think any of us can afford to be complacent about either unemployment or emigration.  I would prefer <Col N="624" /> that both of these matters should be tackled, if it were possible to do so, in a national way on the basis of agreed national policy, but I think those of us speaking from this side of the House are certainly entitled to remind the House and the people that the question of emigration was raised in those days&mdash;1955 and 1956&mdash;as one of the sticks with which the Fianna Fáil Party sought to beat their political opponents, their predecessors in office.</P>
    <P>We remember the pictures painted then of the emigrant ship being loaded down in the water by the weight of the emigrants leaving this country.  Was any effort made by Fianna Fáil speakers in those days to show sympathy with the Government who went before them who endeavoured to deal with this question on any kind of national basis? Is it not true that they were only too glad to use that particular stick to beat their political opponents and to use it as one of the rungs in the ladder to bring them back to office as a Government of this country?</P>
    <P>Again, if a Fianna Fáil Minister were to come in here this evening and say they did not succeed in stopping emigration but that they had succeeded in reducing it considerably, even on that basis, is not any Deputy on these benches entitled to say to them that they failed in their undertaking as a Government?  In fact, the census figures published some years ago show that between the years 1956 and 1961, more than 200,000 people emigrated.  My note of the figure is, and I think it is an accurate one, that between these years, 215,641 people were forced to emigrate.  On a rough calculation, I think that works out at 15 people for every 1,000 in the country.  According to published British figures in the years 1961 and 1962 alone 120,000 people emigrated from this country to England, not counting those who went to America, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa or anywhere else.  In those two years alone 120,000 people emigrated according to the British figures, to England, and nearly 100,000 of those were people who emigrated for the first time, so that, in addition to failing completely and miserably on employment, I do not think I can be accused <Col N="625" /> of exaggeration in saying that this Government have also failed completely and miserably on emigration.</P>
    <P>What does the record show in relation to the third main matter Fianna Fáil put in issue in those days, the cost of living?  Deputy Dr. Browne and other speakers have referred to this already.  I doubt if it is necessary to say very much more on it.  At any rate, whatever possibility there is of persuading Fianna Fáil Deputies that they have fallen down on the job, I am quite certain that it is no task at all to persuade the ordinary member of the consuming public of that fact. They know it already.  In reply to a question not so long ago, it was disclosed that since 1957 the cost of living has increased by more than 28 per cent.  I wonder is there any Fianna Fáil Deputy who can sit easy and feel complacent in the knowledge that the policy of their Government since the year 1957 has succeeded in driving up the cost of living by more than 28 per cent?  Imagine what that means to the ordinary housewife who has to pay her grocery bill each week, to the father of a family who has to try to find the means each week to pay the grocery bill, to pay for food, clothes and fuel and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>I think people might forgive the Government if this were something beyond their control, if it were something that happened by accident, if it were something the Minister and his colleagues were not to blame for; but, again, the fact is, and all of us know it, that to a very large extent this was caused by the deliberate positive action of the Government Party.  It was not something that happened by accident; it was not something that happened when Government Ministers were not paying attention.  It was something done deliberately by the Government, by positive action, firstly when they reduced, and then swept away, the food subsidies that had been maintained by their predecessors in office.  By doing that, the Fianna Fáil Party in Government succeeded in saving something in the region of £8 million a year for revenue.  That £8 million a year came out of the <Col N="626" /> pockets and the purses of the people who had to pay their grocery bills each week.  When that was done, the cost of living had to be forced up at least to the tune of that £8 million a year which was taken away from the people on the abolition of the food subsidies.  That was something which did not happen by accident.  It was done deliberately by positive Government action.</P>
    <P>Again, only 12 months ago, when the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the Fianna Fáil turnover tax, the cost of living was increased deliberately by positive Government action when they decided that that tax was to be applied to food, clothes, fuel and the other essentials of life. In addition to that, we have virtually day by day to pay a hidden type of taxation imposed by various Government Departments.  We have postal charges going up; we have telephone charges going up; we have increases in bus fares, increases in rail fares. We have radio licence and television licence fees going up.  One increase or other like that is imposed.</P>
    <P>Throughout the entire countryside, year by year, the rates are being increased and often increased as a result of Government policy.  Therefore the net result for the ordinary people is that there has been an increase of more than 28 per cent in the cost of living since the year 1957.  This is a record that no Government could be proud of. No amount of talk about a first economic programme, a second economic programme or anything else is going to mollify the people who are hit hard by these increases, particularly, as I say, when they are brought about deliberately by Government action.</P>
    <P>That is not a record to be proud of. It is not a record about which any Government should feel complacent. I believe the truth of the matter is that many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party must be worried about the situation which they themselves, by lending their support to the Government, have created.  I believe there must be many Deputies in the Party who would be relieved if the Taoiseach would take the advice I have tendered to him, <Col N="627" /> that is, that he should seek dissolution and return to the country at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>The world has changed a great deal.  I always believed the Fine Gael Party were the most conservative Party not only in this country, but indeed in western Europe, outside the Unionists of the North.  It is horrifying that their ideas are those of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  If we put them into office, in the very near future, this country will be controlled by screaming teenagers as we had down in Middle Abbey Street on one occasion.</P>
      <P>I had second thoughts about the Fine Gael Party and I think the situation has now become very serious indeed.  I know in the maniac ideas they have, they have lost control so much that they have decided they must get control of this country by hook or by crook.  They have decided the best way is to appeal to the teenagers in this country.  I have nothing in the world against the teenagers but on the other hand, it is a shocking situation, in 1965, that anybody with ordinary common sense in his head, if he has a head or any brains in it, should adopt the attitude of appealing to these screamers who go down after the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the other idiots who masquerade as some kind of paragon for our people today.  I am surprised that the hierarchy or the clergy of the country have not tried to call a halt to this before now.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy M.J. O'Higgins's speech.  I do not believe the most simple-minded man in Ireland or the most simple-minded Deputy here&mdash;there are many simple-minded Deputies in his Party&mdash;would be interested in it.  I am not an old man; on the other hand, I am not a young man.  I am old enough to remember 1951 and 1956 when a cheque, even from a local authority and from most Government Departments, was worth roughly the 2d stamp stuck on it.  It is worth 3d now.  That in itself would give it some kind of uplift.  That was the position at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Deputy M.J. O'Higgins told us of the Utopia that lies ahead of us so long as we change Government but we are not so shortsighted and so shortminded that we forget the position that arose back in those years. I happened to be in the county manager's office in Castlebar in December, 1956, when he was phoned in regard to a cheque by a man, who who had been carrying out a contract for the county council.  The only way he could pay the man was to give his own personal security for the cheque.  He turned around to me and said: &ldquo;Joe, it is a very sad day when County Mayo is not worth £100.&rdquo;  It was far worse in Roscommon and Clare at that time.</P>
    <P>Today, we listened to this gentleman who told us that a Utopia will be set up again if they get back.  I want to say to the public of this country that they would want to be of very short memory to forget the Utopia in 1951, 1954 and 1956.  I have to go back to my own constituency to give examples. In 1956, one of the biggest expansions of bog in all Ireland took place.  There were 12 men employed under duress, as a result of very severe pressure by Deputy Calleary, to try to keep the weeds out of the drains on that vast expanse of bog.  It was only as a result of Deputy Calleary's intervention that the drains were even kept open to let the water flow.</P>
    <P>The people who represent that area are very foolish if they think the people in that part of the country have forgotten the position at that time.  There were 12 people employed. The maximum employment rate was 12, to keep the drains open.  Today, as a result of the change, we have hundreds of people employed.  In fact, we are in the happy position that we cannot get enough people to work there.  As a result of the change, Crossmolina is one of the biggest boom towns in the west of Europe.  In fact some of the people there have decided that in case they would get into any kind of trouble, they must stop any German development in my area because they are afraid of being turned away from my public house. <Col N="629" /> That, of course, is only a parochial matter.  If the Germans do go back to my area and develop it, we are perfectly prepared to accept that.  It is better that we should work for Germans in Erris than go to work for John Bull or Uncle Sam or in some other country.  We will not be intimidated by the Crossmolina people in an effort to prevent our doing that.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of mud being slung, and I am not a mud slinger, but on the other hand I can be as dirty as anybody in the House when I want to be. If the mud is to be slung, I will sling it.</P>

      <P>I am telling you that when we have it slung, then it is not to me that it will stick but to the people who are coming in here as holy innocents.  I know that there are people down there on the front benches of Fine Gael who are praying for an election but the back bench Fine Gael members are not praying for an election.  My seat is a safe one and I do not have to worry about it, but the people there would be very much surprised if they had to go up for election tomorrow.  The position is that the ordinary person in this country does not want an election, no matter what Deputy O'Higgins said a few minutes ago, because the ordinary people, no matter what anybody here says about them, are not fools.  They do not forget the past.</P>
      <P>There was not a house in my constituency in 1932 not to mind employment, and anything the people in my constituency have they got from Fianna Fáil.  I am prepared to say that here openly and I do not think that anybody can contradict it.</P>

      <P>I want to be honest about it and say that it is a shame to see the political humbug which is going on.  I did not think I would live in this country to see a political leader get up and bring himself down to the level of the Beatles and the Stones, but we have come down to that, and I have to defend my case on the basis of that fact today.</P>
      <P>As I said, I could give examples enough from my own constituency, the fact that in 1932 we had not a decent house in the place; there was no such thing as employment and the people were generally in a bad way.  Today we had an official return for the housing position in my area, showing that we have less than 2 per cent of bad houses as compared with something like 20 per cent then.  People in that area can thank nobody except Fianna Fáil for giving them the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we have Bord na Móna operating, and the ESB station; we have Min Fhéir Teoranta, and the people in the experimental station and other things in the offing.  As a matter of fact, we have so much money to spend that, believe it or not, our only trouble is that we have not sufficient engineers and technicians to spend it.  That may be news to some people who are trying to throw mud against the Government. Our only trouble is that we just have not got sufficient engineers and technicians to carry out these jobs <Col N="631" /> for us.  If those wreckers in Fine Gael who try to throw mud against the Government and are so fond of saying that they will provide miracles in the future can give me the names of ten engineers tomorrow morning, I will have the ten employed.  It would make a big difference in the area.  Instead of that, they come along taking the opposite attitude and just try to denigrate the Government and to cast all the aspersions they can and forget their own nasty past.</P>
    <P>We know that practically all the newspapers are on their side, and we see the latest and nastiest type of aspersions which can be cast being cast on people.  I do not know whether those newspapers try to insinuate that people are dying or trying to get out of this House by other means, but over the last week or fortnight we have seen what those papers have written. They have insinuated all kinds of things.  I do not know what they mean.  Perhaps some Deputies know what they mean.  That type of journalism is the lowest of the low, but anybody who was living in 1913 and who can turn his mind back knows what certain newspapers, the same type of newspapers, at that time, came up with, which are now trying to fire mud on us and make us out to be a crowd of idiots.  I do not know whether Deputies here are prepared to die.  Of course, we will all have to die but this lowdown type of journalism that is now going on is beneath contempt.</P>

      <P>This is a pretty open debate and I am fairly well entitled to speak over a fairly wide range of subjects.  Once again, in 1948, we had that unhappy marriage between Labour and Fine Gael.

      <P>I was not shot going into the church to Mass anyway.  I was not one of the bridesmaids, whatever about being the bridegroom, which shows your stupidity and ignorance anyway.  We had that unhappy coming together again.  Do honest people believe, despite the position in those benches in front of me, that there is to be another reunion?  I do not think so; I think it would not happen.  I do not think the Labour Party, however foolish they would be, would ever be foolish enough to get themselves involved in that union again.  If there were an election tomorrow morning, the position would be rather an unhappy one because it would mean there would be no Government at all in this country. You would have a crowd of chancers, some of them calling themselves at the moment shadow Ministers, but I prefer to call them ghost Ministers who would certainly take a chance on trying to run the country.  I do not believe there is a financial house in this country which would give them 6d.</P>
      <P>A great deal of political capital has been made out of the Land Bill and the Succession Bill.  Of course, it is all bunkum, The present Minister for Lands is about as decent a man as can be found at any level of society.  The last thing he would do would be to cause trouble to anybody so far as taking his land from him is concerned, except as a last straw.  We people down in the west where land is scarce and poor were chased out of this end of the country where land is good and plentiful. It is about time we got back to the territory from which we were chased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult for any man from the west to sit quietly here when he thinks of Lord So-and-So who is living abroad and who owns thousands of acres in this country, making no use out of the land beyond letting it on the conacre or some other system to our people and raking in a devilish amount of money for it.  It is very difficult for us to sit quietly here and to <Col N="633" /> tolerate it.  Surely it is time it came to a halt.  It is going on all across the midlands</P>
    <P>I shall not make any apology here for the millions of Lord So-and-So or Lord So-and-So.  It is time the land were taken back and given to the Irish people and put to proper use.  Anybody who says otherwise in this House is either lacking in intelligence or is antiIrish or anti-us.  Those people took the land from the Irish people by fire and sword in the days gone by.  They have lived on it and made a fortune out of it without putting anything into it. We all know the kind of land in Meath, Kildare and Westmeath.  They took those lands and they have had them for hundreds of years and made fortunes out of them and they go over and live in England and come back probably for a jump over the fences on a horse or for a ball or some function that is taking place here while our people down in the west are trying to subsist on three, four, five or six acres of land with the result that some members of the family must go over to Britain to earn money to help to eke out an existence.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies say that the lands should not be taken from the people about whom I complain and that the Land Bill should not go through.  Unfortunately, some Mayo Deputies have said it.  In my view it is a public scandal. The lands should be confiscated. They should have been taken from those people 40 years ago, not to mind now, and given back to our people.  I want to say on behalf of the people of Mayo that it has never been known that a man who went from Mayo to a holding in the midlands failed.  He always did well.  If the present Minister for Lands never did any other thing in his political lifetime than to introduce that Bill and pilot it through both Houses of the Oireachtas so that it will be placed on the Statute Book he has erected to himself a monument that will never be knocked down.</P>
    <P>It is fired at the Minister for Lands that in places this Bill will be used against the little small holder in County Mayo who went to Britain to earn a few pounds to enable him to come <Col N="634" /> back to buy a few bullocks to start his farm.  The Minister for Lands will be the last man to use the Bill in that way.</P>

      <P>Another set-up has been started against the Succession Bill.  I shall not discuss this at any length: I have already made a statement on it.  I think it will knock a lot of solicitors, lawyers and other legal chancers out of money.  It is well past time that Bill were introduced and I shall support it to the hilt.  I do not want to discuss it further because it will be coming up and we shall have our opportunity of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>The question of unemployment in this country has been raised.  Deputy O'Higgins laid stress on it this evening. We all have our views on unemployment in this country.  I shall not pass any comment on the actual numbers. There is a tremendous difference today between a man who is regarded as unemployed and who gets unemployment benefit as compared with what a man got when Deputy O'Higgins was in office.  I do not say that it is wonderful now.  The rates are a bit low but they are a big improvement on those obtaining when the Coalition Government were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have appealed to the Minister for Social Welfare on a number of occasions to remove some stupid anomalies. As the Minister for Finance is present, and as he is probably one of the most influential men in the Government, I shall draw his attention to one of them.  I want to congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on removing the means test so far as the small farmers of the west are concerned.  That was a good day's work on his part.  I think he intends to alter it but, lest he does not, I should like the Minister <Col N="635" /> for Finance to influence him as fast as he can in relation to signing-on as evidence of unemployment.  Up to the time of the five-day week, every unemployed person had to sign six days a week for the dole.  It is rather significant that since the five-day week came into operation in the Civil Service, the man on the dole only signs on five days a week.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to use his influence to ensure that in future every man in receipt of unemployment assistance will have to sign only on one day a week.  The position is that many of these people are small farmers, living on very small holdings, and if they come into town, we know the temptations that are there and they may not be inclined to hurry home.  If they have to come in five times a week, they have to waste a lot of time which could be put to much better purpose in improving their holdings. One day a week is surely sufficient.  If they happen to live five or six miles away, they have to sign only one day a week, but if a man is living within one mile or less, he has to sign five days a week.  It does not make sense.  I have an idea that the system is being altered but I would ask the Minister to press his colleague in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the west we have a problem, that is, land drainage.  While wages and salaries have been increased, the price of the Land Project for drainage has not gone up.  To-day it is completely disproportionate as regards the cost of carrying out the job.  When the Minister is drawing up his Budget, possibly he has already done so, instead of giving the ordinary man £30 an acre or less for the various charges, he should bring it up to at least £45.  If this kept only a small number of people at home, as it would, the Minister would be doing a good day's work.  It does not take much to keep a man in this country.  Most Government schemes are quite well intentioned but unfortunately it is the big man who does not require the money who derives the greatest benefits from these schemes.  It is well past time <Col N="636" /> that this side of the problem were looked into.</P>
    <P>I know that whatever we have got has been from this Government, but, as I say, unfortunately it is often the man who deserves the least who gets the most.  There must be some way of getting over this.  If a man builds a huge byre in the midlands&mdash;he may have thousands and thousands of pounds&mdash;he gets a huge grant but the man in my part of the country who wants to build a byre, and does so, will have to go into debt and he will only get a very small grant.  He is doing it, of course, and does not grumble, but it is wrong.  There should be no comparison between the amount the small farmer in the congested areas of Mayo will get per cow in the byre and what the man in Meath with a big farm will get.  Of course I am not raising any objection to the man in Meath with a small farm.</P>
    <P>When this matter comes to be looked into in the very near future, I would ask the Minister to ensure that people in the congested districts are treated in a different way.  Even if this would cost money, it should be done to give these people the opportunity of living in their own small holdings in the west.  These people are workers; they are not chancers, or people who want to go to the races or the dogs, and so on.  They are people who are prepared to make a livelihood from their land in their own way and who appreciate what is done for them. Unless something more is done for them, they must just head for the emigrant ship.  That would be a very sad commentary on our policies.</P>
    <P>In the area from which I come, the people are such good workers that they do not worry about such things. If you travel further into east Mayo, the position is much worse and I suggest that in any distribution of Government monies to agriculture, the present system should be completely altered and the small farmers should have a very considerable edge on the big farmer.  If that were done, it would bring considerable results in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with some of the points raised by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, I should like to refer to several statements made by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He began his speech by stating that the speech he had heard from the Taoiseach was the same speech the Taoiseach had been making year after year since 1932.  There is no need for me to refute that statement because there are few speakers whose statements are as realistic as those of the Taoiseach.  I would suggest to Deputy Dr. Browne, in no spirit of animosity, that if he re-reads all the speeches he has made since I came into the House, he will find the same old clichés and the same old slogans purporting to pay tribute to the freedom of the individual while at the same time advocating that he should be put into a straitjacket.</P>
      <P>Another point which he made was in relation to the money being made available by this Government to industries to help them overcome the British surcharge.  He said, in effect, that this money was simply a hand-out to industrialists.  The fact, of course, is that this money is being allocated to industry to protect the livelihood of the workers.  It would appear that the Deputy is completely out of touch with reality.  I come from a constituency which is very largely industrialised and I mix with the workers.  I suggest that Deputy Dr. Browne should see some of these workers and discuss this allocation of money to the industries and ask them what their opinion is about it. He will very soon find that the workers greatly appreciate the money which is being made available and which, as I said, is not to help the industrialists as individuals but to protect the livelihood of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins painted a picture of what he believes the people see when they look on the Fianna Fáil Government.  Of course, the true picture is very different from what he imagines it is.  I should like to refer to one statement he made to show the subterfuge the Fine Gael Party find necessary in order to get some stick with which to beat the Government. He stated, and this statement has also been made by the Leader of his Party, <Col N="638" /> Deputy Dillon, by Deputy O.J. Flanagan and by Deputy Donegan on many occasions, that there are 73,000 fewer people at work today than there were in 1956.  The inference is there are 73,000 fewer at work since we came into office.  I should like to put the facts before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the facts now.  The facts are that there are 73,000 fewer people at work in this country since 1st April 1956 and, from 1st April 1956 to 1st April 1957, when we came into office, 41,000 of those 73,000 went out of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are that 41,000 lost their employment in that calamitous year of 1956 when the Coalition Government were in power. Secondly, and this is even more important, in the year 1963, more people went into employment than lost their employment.  For the first time in years, there was an overall increase of 1,000 in the total number at work.</P>

      <P>It would be very helpful to this discussion on the Vote on Account if the Fine Gael Party would, before they come in here to speak, make up their minds as to what attitude they intend to adopt.  We had Deputy O.J. Flanagan today following what I call the old Fine Gael Jine, talking about the very large amount of money the Government are looking for, the backbreaking load on the backs of the taxpayers.  We had Deputy Sweetman, and some other members of the Front Bench of Fine Gael, changing from that particular attitude.</P>
      <P>Year after year, since I came in here, I have listened to Fine Gael speakers on the Vote on Account following the line I have already mentioned in relation to Deputy Flanagan.  This year there is a marked change in the attitude of Fine Gael.  We find Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Donegan, as reported in today's Press, saying they are not so concerned about the amount; what they are concerned with is how the money is spent.  We are glad to see them converted.  Of course the reasons for the conversion are obvious.  Fine Gael are a Party in search of a policy.  Since before the 1961 general election we have had three policies from Fine Gael.  I believe they are now in process of formulating a fourth policy.  Secondly, in their television political broadcasts Fine Gael have been promising the moon.  Agriculture is to get millions more.  Health is to get millions more. Education is to get millions more, and so on.  They are now in a cleft stick and they find it somewhat difficult this year to suggest that the amount we are asking is too much because they have already told the public in their television political broadcasts that, if they were in power, they would spend more millions than we are asking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason Fine Gael have adopted this particular attitude now is, I think, that they have found that our fiscal policy is a successful policy. They have discovered that the people realise it is a successful policy.  For <Col N="640" /> that reason they have now decided that they had better try to filch one more part of our policy, as they have filched so many other parts over the years.  To those who suggest the amount of money we are looking for is too much, I say they should remember that, in 1956, the amount which the Coalition Government looked for was very much lower.  We must, however, remember that in that particular year 41,000 people lost their employment. There were 95,000 unemployed. Emigration was unparalleled at the highest figure since the Famine.  We should remember, too, that national production was down, the national income was down, national loans were unfilled and the future of the economy was in the melting pot.  Those who talk glibly about overspending should at least try to show us where we are overspending.  If we are to go by the political broadcasts, the Fine Gael Party obviously intend, if they ever get into power again, to spend very much more than we are spending.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates this year, there are increases under many headings.  These are designed to increase productivity and, in so doing, to improve the standard of living of our people.  It has been said that the money should be spent wisely.  Everybody agrees with that.  When we consider the results so far, and I judge on my own constituency, it is obvious that we are definitely making proper use of the money being made available.  A few minor mistakes may have been made. We do not pretend that no mistakes are made.  We should, however, remember the maxim that the person who never made a mistake never made anything.</P>
    <P>Under Education, £1 million extra is being allocated for vocational education. No one can object to that.  A small developing country like ours must base its hopes in the future on education.  Lack of technical training is a serious lack in an era of developing economy.  It would be interesting, if that were possible, to find out what industries we may have lost in certain areas simply because we did not have sufficient technical training in those areas.  I know of many instances <Col N="641" /> where industrialists decided to set up industries in this country and had intended starting with hundreds of workers but were forced to start with a very much smaller number because they had not sufficient people with the technical training necessary.  As far as my own constituency is concerned, the people there will be very pleased with the increase in the money being allocated for vocational education and one reason will be that a technological college is about to be built in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of agricultural grants, there is a very large increase.  I do not think anybody can cavil at this increase, particularly when we remember that agriculture is our basic industry, that manufacturing industry is either directly or indirectly dependent on it&mdash;directly when it uses the produce of the land and indirectly when the produce of the land we export pays for the raw materials for our factories. For that reason we are very much dependent on the prosperity of our agriculture.  We need these grants to help the farmers produce more and produce more efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is also an increase in the amount being allocated for fisheries. It is a matter in which I am particularly interested, because I come from a constituency where there is a considerable number of fishermen.  I believe that fisheries should rank next to agriculture.  Anything that can be done to ensure it assumes its proper place in the economy is something which shall always have my support. One of the difficulties in relation to fisheries is the question of credit.  If we can provide sufficient money to enable fishermen to have more credit than they have at present, that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>There is also a considerable increase under the heading of Posts and Telegraphs.  We know from questions put down here practically every day the Dáil sits that there is now a greater demand for telephones than ever before.  This underlines the advances we have made in our economy. More telephones are needed only when the economy is moving rapidly in the right direction.  When we recall the pressure being put on the Minister <Col N="642" /> for Posts and Telegraphs, both by Deputies on this side and on the other side of the House, we must all be in agreement with the extra money being made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the extra money being made available for industry. This is vitally important so far as our people and the economy generally are concerned.  While agriculture is our basic industry, at the same time we are dependent, and will be so for a considerable time, on manufacturing industry to employ more of our people.  It is our aim to employ all our people.  Reference was made here to maintaining the number on our farms.  That is a big problem at present.  The fall in the number employed on the land is a fall not only evident in this country but in all the developed and developing countries of western Europe.  It is essential, therefore, to ensure an increase in the number of people employed, that we should do our utmost to help develop our manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether to be amused or amazed at the efforts being made by the Fine Gael Party to claim they are responsible for the remarkable expansion of industry over the past few years. They are basing their claim on an Act they passed in 1956.  It is strange that that Act was so ineffective and they had so little faith in it when they were in power that they ran out of office in 1957.  As far as my constituency is concerned, it was ineffective for a number of years after we got into power.  Our main effort at that time was to try to bring confidence back to our people, to try to get the economy on an even keel and to be in a position to provide money to help industry.  It is going a bit too far to suggest that a Government, who were unable to pay even the low housing grants available in 1956, could be expected to finance industrialists wishing to set up industry in this country or Irish industrialists wishing to extend their industries or start new ones.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Fine Gael Deputy in my constituency charged me with taking the credit for the industries which have come into Louth.  We have <Col N="643" /> got four new industries in Drogheda and some in Dundalk.  We have another industry coming into Greenore. There has also been a very considerable expansion of existing industry in Louth.  As an example, one industry, which in 1956 was reduced to employing 211 workers on a four-day week, now employs 1,400 workers on overtime. As I said, I was charged with claiming credit for this.  I do not need to claim credit for this.  Everybody in Louth knows who is responsible for those industries.  Who in Drogheda, for example, could visualise an industry coming into that town in 1956 when the industries in it were knocking men off every Friday and when confidence in the economy was completely gone? These industries came in here when we got the economy moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I would be only too glad to bring some of those who have doubts about our industrial expansion down to Louth any time they like and show them the vast improvement in industrial employment in that constituency over the past few years.  Our policy has been to provide employment for all our people.  We never pretended that was going to be easy, that all you had to do was wave a magic wand and get employment started.  We knew it meant hard work and unpopular decisions.  We knew it meant taxation, and we knew taxation was not popular. But we knew where our duty lay.  We felt it was far more important that we should employ our people at home, even when it meant taking unpopular decisions, than let them leave this country to work in some other country. We are succeeding in what we set out to do.  We do not pretend for one moment that we have been completely successful.  We do not pretend that we have been nearly completely successful. What we do say is that we are on the right road and that we intend to continue along that road and have no doubt as to what the final result will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in speaking in this debate is to refer to a matter mentioned in the House by the Taoiseach earlier today.  In the course <Col N="644" /> of what the Taoiseach had to say, he proceeded to criticise the Fine Gael proposals in relation to health policy. I can understand the Taoiseach voicing any criticism he wishes in relation to anything that I said in my television broadcast but I was somewhat surprised to hear from the Taoiseach that, not only was he criticising what I said on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in a television broadcast, but he also sought to criticise the proposals which I had put forward to the Select Committee on Health Services.</P>
      <P>I circulated to the Dáil Select Committee in April of last year a comprehensive proposal for the reform and re-organisation of our general medical services.  I regarded, and I was put in the position of having to regard, the circulation of that memorandum as being confidential and, although, since April of 1964, when no consideration of that memorandum took place and when criticism was expressed outside with regard to the work of the Dáil Committee, I was sorely tempted to disclose the fact that, so far as my Party are concerned, we had put forward constructive and concrete proposals, I felt I was not at liberty to do that by reason of the fact that this had been done at a Committee of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I find now that not only was the fact of this memorandum not confined to the Select Committee but it was circulated, apparently by a member of that Committee&mdash;I assume, the Tánaiste&mdash;and was handed for discussion to the Taoiseach.  I do not object to that.  But, certainly, I do object to the Taoiseach coming in here in this debate today and proceeding to misquote and misstate what is contained in our memorandum on health services. At least, if he thought it worth dealing with it at all in this debate, he might have taken the trouble to read it and, if he had taken the trouble to read it, he would not have made some of the rather silly statements which he made in the debate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say at once that this memorandum deals with one particular facet of our health services, that is, the general medical services.  It does not provide, as the Taoiseach apparently thought it did from the scanty reading <Col N="645" /> he gave to it, that £6 million of new money will be required for the new services which we propose, nor does it provide, as the Taoiseach apparently thought it did, that farmers and other persons will be expected to come along to a post office once a week to pay 2/-or half a crown, or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>This memorandum, which was submitted in my name on behalf of my Party, was carefully considered and carefully worded.  It was put forward in the view that the Select Committee in considering this important problem &mdash;and it is an important problem, whether the Taoiseach regards it as such or not&mdash;should not be inhibited in its work by the present accepted divisions of the population into particular income groups or by the system under which present services were provided.  We were concerned, and it is so stated in the memorandum, that the Committee should consider as objectively as possible whether from a national point of view the essential needs and the welfare of our community as a whole require that essential health services should be organised on a wider and more general basis.</P>
    <P>That was the object of this memorandum and, not only did it set out that object, but it endeavoured in a careful and reasonable manner throughout many pages to give details of the manner in which our health services could be organised in a better and a more suitable manner.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke as he did this afternoon, he was obviously not aware of what happened as a result of the circulation of this memorandum and I propose now to disclose to the House what did happen, and I propose also, a Cheann Comhairle, in collaboration and discussion with my colleagues, to feel free to circulate also at a later stage the full contents of this particular memorandum.  But it should be recorded that the memorandum which the Taoiseach referred to was circulated and came before the Dáil Committee on Health Services at a meeting held on 9th April, 1964. The meeting was a short one.  When the meeting convened, the Chairman of <Col N="646" /> the Select Committee proposed, in view of the contents of my memorandum, that the Committee should adjourn so that the matter might be fully and adequately considered.  The Minister for Health, who was present, seconded that proposal and went on to say that he would like to put the other side of the case against Deputy O'Higgins' memorandum.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I think we should congratulate and thank Deputy O'Higgins for putting the latter before us because we can at last get our teeth into something. I hope both memorandum and counter-memorandum will be considered on their merits&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Committee then, on the proposi-Minister, adjourned to a later date to consider fully this proposal of mine and any counter-proposal that the Minister might wish to put forward. For the record, I should like to state that was the last meeting of the Select Committee on Health Services at which a discussion took place.  There was never any counter-proposal circulated by the Minister, nor was the further meeting to discuss my proposal ever convened.</P>
    <P>From 9th April until today, no step has been taken by the Minister to get that Committee together or even to put forward any criticism of what I, on behalf of my Party, took the trouble to put down in black and white, or any counter-proposal.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, perhaps, not surprising that certain members of the Committee, who sincerely felt that the Committee could be fruitful in its work for the people and that the problem of health services could get some real, non-controversial attention, should have become despondent and should have notified the House, as apparently they did today, that they were resigning from the Committee.</P>
    <P>The fact is, a Cheann Comhairle, it is now apparent that this Dáil Committee on Health Services was a political gimmick by the Minister for Health.  He never intended it to work; he never wanted it to work.  All he desired to do was to tie up health and <Col N="647" /> a discussion on health in some back committee room.  The Committee was set up following a motion in my name which was discussed here in the autumn of 1961.  The Committee held its first meeting on 20th May, 1962. It held, in all, 46 subsequent meetings and, as I have mentioned, the last meeting in a deliberative way was on 9th April, 1964.</P>
    <P>The members of my Party on that Committee attended all those meetings. We attended many times when the Dáil was not in session.  We were frequently working at meetings of that Committee from early in the morning until late at night.  We went into the Committee sincerely concerned to try in a non-political way to secure an improvement in our health services.  All the time, apparently, we were just being fooled by the Minister for Health.  He was sitting back determined that nothing would emerge.  We took the trouble to put down in black and white our constructive proposals and we were fooled by the Minister saying: &ldquo;All right; we will consider it and we will get another meeting together some time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to protest as strongly as I can as an individual Deputy against the manner in which we have been treated on this Committee.  This House also has been treated in an appalling manner.  I should like to remind the House that when the Committee was established, it was provided in the Minister's amendment to my motion that the Select Committee would report to this House by 7th November, 1962. A time limit was put on the work of the Committee.  The next thing this House heard of this Committee was a proposal passed by the Committee at the instance of the Minister that that time limit be extended for six months. Then there was another proposal from the Committee at the instance of the Minister that all time limits be removed.</P>
    <P>Many people throughout the country who have been looking forward with hope to a report from this Committee, who have felt genuinely that something was at last being done to solve the <Col N="648" /> perennial problem of health in this country, will be aghast at the disclosure today that the Minister for Health was not serious and was not prepared to have the Committee meet again to consider my proposal and any other proposal that might be put forward.  It is a very bad thing and it illustrates more than countless speeches the bankruptcy of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to worthwhile thought on a matter so important as health and the wellbeing of ordinary people.  The Taoiseach could come in here illinformed and criticise my proposal.  He is entitled to do that, but let him show me something better.  Let him or any Deputy here show this House any better way of improving our health services than the way which has been suggested on behalf of my Party and on behalf of other Parties, too.</P>
    <P>It may be that particular aspects of what is contained in this memorandum or what I have said can be improved.  Of course, I would have hoped that in the discussions of the Select Committee improvements would be suggested.  I certainly feel that in relation to contributions it might be possible to have them related as a percentage of a wage packet rather than as a fixed amount.  All those things could be considered, but all we have had here from the Taoiseach today is a bland condemnation of a proposal put forward, not impulsively but after due and careful consideration, by a responsible political Party. The Taoiseach just sweeps it aside without even taking the trouble of reading what was in the document before him.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the situation has developed in such a way that Deputies from the Labour Party who were working well on that Committee, when the Committee was working, have found it impossible to continue.  That is a decision the Labour Party were compelled to take by the manner in which the Minister for Health has acted.  I have no doubt that my Party will in due course consider that matter also but I am not going into that now. However, I do want to say that, so far as this Committee is concerned and the work that went into it, it is <Col N="649" /> to me and to my Party and, I believe, to the country, a very serious disappointment that the whole thing was a political subterfuge and that there was no sincerity behind it on the part of the Minister for Health</P>
    <P>It now remains, so far as we are concerned, to advocate what we believe in in the political way that we have always endeavoured to do in the past.  We never had any doubt when we went on to that Committee on Health Services about what we stood for.  The Minister for Health and the Fianna Fáil representatives apparently had no policy and they sought to get it from us.  We were quite prepared to help them in any way possible but if the situation now is, as apparently it is, that they are not going to budge from their Health Act and the policy it enshrines, then it will be our duty democratically to bring our proposals elsewhere.  There will not be any Committee of this House.  It will be the people themselves and I have little doubt that sooner or later, inevitably, the proposals which the Taoiseach so airily condemned today will represent the health policy of this country in due course.</P>

      <P>I am rather amazed by the statement of Deputy O'Higgins that in relation to the Committee set up by this House of which he and other members of his Party, members of the Labour Party and members of our Party were members, he brought proposals before that Committee last April, ten months ago, and that the Committee did not meet since.  That is rather an extraordinary and amusing statement by Deputy O'Higgins.  If I were a member of a committee and believed in anything I proposed, I would take good care that the committee would meet to consider the proposal and if I did not succeed, this House would hear about it every week until that committee met.  The only conclusion I can reach is that Deputy O'Higgins had no faith in the proposals he put forward.  If he had, surely he would have insisted that the Committee would meet within a period of ten months.  If he desires an example I shall give it to him.  In 1956, members <Col N="650" /> of that Party, when the Coalition Government were in office, went over to Britain and we had an agreement signed with Britain to collect not 12½ per cent but 33? per cent in this country for Britain.  We paid some £2 million because of that idiotic agreement.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, I must go back a few years. It is a long time since we had a &ldquo;mixum gatherum&rdquo; Government here, thank God.  We had an industry at that time in Haulbowline, Irish Steel, giving employment and good employment at that to some 600 men.  The inter-Party Government came in.  They said the iron was too good.  Therefore, they were to buy no more billets.  All the iron was to be manufactured from scrap.  The next round came then; the scrap was too good; only third grade scrap should be bought.  The result was when we got rid of the then Government there were 430 fewer people employed in that industry than were employed on the date they came into office.  Today there are 950 men working in that industry.  That is the difference.  These attacks are the same as we had a few months ago about the dockyard, because 1,000 young Irishmen find a livelihood here who would otherwise have to go to Britain or some other country to find employment. That is the difference I see between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would trust them.  Any industrialist, in any industry in this country, who found that team coming into office would pull out immediately. That is the trouble.  We must have a Government that will inspire confidence in the people.  Fine Gael will never inspire that confidence.  I saw it in every town in my own constituency. The former Deputy Gorman, God rest his soul, was told of the conditions in Youghal.  The people had no employment there except for three months in the summer time when holidaymakers came in.  During the rest of the year every young boy had to go on the emigrant ship and look for employment elsewhere.  When I visited the houses I was told: &ldquo;Poor Michael, who was here last year, is over in <Col N="654" /> England trying to earn a few shillings.&rdquo;</P>

The Opposition are not going to get anywhere that way.  If they have a policy, let us know all about it.

    <P>If this country is to go ahead and to progress, it must have a Government who are prepared to go ahead and not afraid even to make mistakes.  It must have a Government prepared to see to it that our children will get employment in their own country and that if not enough provision is made for our children, the Government will step in and do their part.  That is the main principle.  If they are not to do that, if <Col N="658" /> we have a Government who will do what those gentlemen over there did, it will be no good for the country.  Maybe they had sound reason for it.  It is hard to blame a man who has not a penny in his pocket and nothing to pay anyone and to stop him from groaning. You were in that condition in 1956 and nobody can deny that you did not have a penny.</P>

I have no objection to its working out successfully anywhere.  That is not the way to judge.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote on Account could be described as unique for many reasons.  Perhaps the main reasons <Col N="659" /> giving it its unique value are, first, that it is the largest Vote on Account presented to this House since the foundation of the State, and secondly, that it is produced to the House at a time when the country was never more uncertain.  It is not quite certain as to whether this House will live to implement the Vote on Account.  I just make reference to that in my opening remarks because tonight reference has been made to the back-benchers of Fine Gael being afraid of a general election.  As a back-bencher, I can speak only for myself, and I am satisfied that every other backbencher will also speak for himself.</P>
      <P>It does not particularly bother me as a back-bencher whether there is a general election tomorrow morning, next month or in 1966.  While this has been an uncertain Dáil, it has lasted longer than most.  I understand the average life of a Dáil is two and a half years: we are now well into our fourth year.  At any time, a man in public life must expect and be prepared for elections.  Even the most secure Minister in this House will agree that elections are not pleasant.  Political life can be rather hazardous and elections can be rather unpleasant, even if one is successful.  Nobody likes the turmoil and the personal strain involved in fighting an election.  However, as a back-bencher I am not afraid of a general election in the morning because of the condition of my Party or my standing in my constituency.  I am quite happy in the morning to appear before my constituents in North Mayo and indeed I can say the same for every member of the Fine Gael Party.  I feel we could never go to the country at a better time.  Despite Deputy Corry's crocodile tears.  I am sure he would not like to have to face the country now in view of the present unpopularity of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make reference to another statement made here tonight.  It is true that at Question Time today, in the interests of my constituents, I asked a question about a German industrialist who is reported to have plans for a nuclear shelter in my constituency of Mayo.  Perhaps I might preface my remarks <Col N="660" /> in this respect by saying that I have nothing personal against the industrialist, Mr. Hans Paul, and that I am not taking advantage of the privileges of this House to be derogatory. In fact, I do not know the man or his intentions.  I want to say&mdash;and I hope I shall be reported as saying&mdash;that I welcome Mr. Hans Paul or any industrialist who will come into my constituency or into County Mayo to develop industry there.  However, as a responsible citizen and a responsible representative, my attention has been drawn to rather startling statements which have appeared in the <i>Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the journal <i>Business and Finance</i> Volume 1, No. 21 of 12th February, 1965, in which it is stated that a German industrialist plans a nuclear shelter in Mayo.  With the permission of the Chair, I should like to quote from the journal <i>Business and Finance,</i> page 6, which states, under the heading &ldquo;German Industrialist Plans Nuclear Shelter In Mayo&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>A rich German industrialist, who has bought thousands of acres in the west of Ireland in recent years, is now planning an approach to the Government for permission to build an international fall-out shelter where selected people could live through a nuclear war.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was allowing the Deputy to proceed on those lines but he seems to have changed from that and to have brought up an entirely new subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a reference, in your absence, that I was trying to preclude, for personal reasons, an industrialist from coming into my constituency. That is not true.  I shall finalise the matter by saying that <Col N="661" /> rumours are current and that the matter is reported in what I consider responsible national newspapers.  I want to lay the facts before the House. I have the utmost confidence in the various Ministers concerned that my constituency will not be used as a threat to the national security of the country.</P>
      <P>I welcome Mr. Hans Paul into my constituency, where he has bought several thousand acres of land, but if his intention is to build an international nuclear fall-out shelter or to do anything which would constitute a threat to the security of the country, then I urge that he should not get permission for such activities.  However, if he plans industrial expansion, it has my full approval.  I shall be only too delighted to welcome him in any industrial development in my constituency, provided it is not as reported in those responsible papers.</P>
      <P>I want to refer in general to the Vote on Account.  I have been four years in this House.  I have always found the Ministers courteous.  I have always found the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is now presiding, courteous on any personal request I have made to him. Collectively, however, I want to criticise the Government for their failure in relation to the people of North Mayo.</P>
      <P>When I made my maiden speech here approximately four years ago, I outlined the three main problems that affected the people of my constituency &mdash;the fishermen along the coast; the small farmers in the centre of the constituency and the people living in the towns.  I regret to say that, after four years, very little, if anything, has been done for the fishermen along the coast. The Fianna Fáil Party or the Government, indeed, cannot be proud of the fact that the fishermen have been completely forgotten.  Recently, in a storm, many fishing boats used by fishermen along the coast were destroyed due to very bad landing and tying-up facilities along the coast.  The Government have failed to live up to their responsibility in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that the small farmers <Col N="662" /> are gone and that the population in Mayo is a dying race.  We have mass emigration from every part of the county.  If, over the next 20 years, emigration from Mayo continues at the rate it has proceeded in the past, then it would appear that the population of our county will disappear.  The acid test of any Government policy is that people remain on the land.  They will do so only if it is remunerative for them.  I want to support what Deputy Leneghan said tonight.  I was particularly pleased to hear him say that the Government are trying to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  He mentioned grants in relation to various schemes.  He mentioned the heifer grant and pointed out that the various rebates handed out in agriculture are not of maximum benefit to the small farmer.  The small farmer is getting a very small percentage of these aids.  It is the big farmer who is benefiting from them.</P>
    <P>I have at all times maintained, and I think it is conceded by all economists, that the backbone of our country is the small farmers.  Despite what Deputy Corry may say about the ability of the Minister for Agriculture to deal with the poultry problem and the matter of the dual purpose hen, poultry production in Mayo and indeed the west of Ireland has become extinct.  There is virtually no poultry production there now.  That is the result of inept Government policy. They have failed to get a market and a guaranteed price for poultry and fowl.  The poultry industry to provide money for Christmas is becoming extinct among the small farmers&mdash; again, the result of inept policy.  The pig industry was a mainstay in the west but there is virtually no pig production there now&mdash;again, the result of inept Government policy.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the bullock and the cattle are quite good at the moment and I am very glad they are. However, were it not for his foresight in the Agreement made by the present Leader of our Party whereby he tied the price on the British market to our price here, we should be taking more than £20 a head less today for our bullocks.  It was through his efforts <Col N="663" /> and the Government will have to concede that were it not for that, we might be in a much worse position with regard to our agricultural produce, like our industrial produce when the British Government imposed the 15 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>I remember eight years ago, when I first became a member of Mayo County Council, the rates for the county were bordering on £2.  Today the county manager has made a request for a rate which is close on £4. It is conceded that we are one of the largest counties and that the people are the most hardworking people in Ireland but we stand today with the rates demand the highest in the whole country.  What have the people got in return?  A dwindling population and ever-rising rates.  My mind goes back to a unique problem created by increasing rates and which is a direct result of Government expenditure.  We were told at one time that the Health Act would cost no more than 2/6 but today in Mayo the cost is well over £1, leaving aside the question of roads and other expenses which have to be met.  The stage has been reached at which the people in the county cannot afford the ever-increasing rate burden placed upon them.</P>
    <P>It will have to be recognised that there exist at the moment&mdash;and I do not wish to split any farming organisation&mdash;two types of farmer, the small farmer and the big farmer.  The small farmer is not getting a fair crack of the whip.  Something will have to be done for the counties along the western seaboard to ensure that the vast sums of money allocated to agriculture will be allocated in a more just manner.  I am quite satisfied that the counties along the western seaboard have an equal and a very just claim for a rates equalisation fund.  In my constituency, there is a vast amount of land which is waste land and because of that, valuations on average are small.  Where you have small valuations, you have high rates.  We have a vast expanse to be covered with roads and we have a great number of people who, due to their poor circumstances, require free <Col N="664" /> medical services.  While the Government pass legislation adopting schemes, it is the local authority which has to provide the money for them.  Added to a high rate burden, the cost of living has increased by 28 per cent since the Government took office.  The essentials, sugar, bread, butter and flour, have increased by 28 per cent in price but production from the farm has not increased but has dropped.</P>
    <P>A great case could be made by all Deputies from the west, irrespective of their political views, that we in the west have a distinct problem.  While it might appear that it would be a good policy for a Government to produce plans and finances for the country at large, the west is becoming the main sufferer.  Today at Question Time Deputy M.P. Murphy asked if the Government had any plans to do something about the rates problem as promised by the Taoiseach a year and a half ago and he was told by the Minister for Local Government that they had not.  Because of the cost of living and the very high rates, small shops are rapidly closing down in the west.  I would appeal to the Minister, when allocating the various sums, especially for local government and agriculture, to treat the west as a separate unit with a separate problem, and indeed a very acute problem. Capital should be made available to the small farmer.  As a businessman, my experience has been that while increased grants of all sorts have been allocated&mdash;for the erection of cow byres, hen houses, piggeries and so on &mdash;there is no practical use in giving me a big shop or a business to work, if I am not given the capital to run that shop or business.  That seems to be the main problem of the small farmer. There is no point in giving a man a grant for an eight-head cow byre if he has not got the capital to put eight cows into the byre.</P>
    <P>It is not true, as has been stated here tonight, that Fine Gael deliberately obstructed the Land Bill.  I do not wish to make the Land Bill an issue and I will only touch on it.  We on this side, in the main, accepted many sections in the Bill but opposed very <Col N="665" /> firmly several sections which we considered repugnant.</P>

In fact, I might mention that our Party produced a new land policy some years ago and this was a quick rush on the Government's part to outdo our land policy.  The Land Bill should have been tailored before it came to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The Chair has been rather indulgent with me, and for that reason I should not trespass on its generosity.  I shall conclude by saying that the cost of living, especially in my constituency, has gone beyond the beyonds.  High rates have made it impossible to live in the west, and, unless something is done to help the small farmer, unless some type of rates equalisation fund is set up for the western seaboard counties, it will not be possible for the people to meet the demands upon them.</P>
      <P>Finally, I appeal to the Government, even at this eleventh hour, to pull up their socks and face the grim reality that there is complete unrest and dissatisfaction with their policies throughout the country.  I hope that after the result of the by-election in Cork is known, the Government will realise it is time to change their tune.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again the House and the people are presented with the first instalment of what may be described as the annual debit note. We may be told by some Deputies, and even by some outside Dáil Éireann, that this represents an unbearable burden, an intolerable imposition.  These charges might constitute valid criticism if it could be proved that the <Col N="666" /> moneys asked for, or some substantial portion of them, are not moneys well spent.  Nowhere in the list of moneys required is there any item of proposed expenditure to which any responsible Deputy could object.  Indeed, there is a consistent demand for increased standards in every aspect of life.  There are demands for a higher standard of living, for more extensive and better education, for greater aids to agriculture and industry.  There are demands for more employment opportunities and for comprehensive schemes of social welfare.  More and more people are looking to the Government to supply these almost insatiable demands.</P>
      <P>No Government worthy of the name, I submit, would wish to shirk their responsibility to meet reasonable demands.  It cannot be too often stressed that the provision of every service requires money: everything must be paid for.  It is inevitable, therefore, that the greater the demand for social amenities and rising economic standards the more money will be required to meet them.  It may be asked&mdash;we all have a right to ask&mdash; are we getting good value for our money?  The only way to answer that is by asking another question.  Since the cost of Government has increased every year since the present Government took office, has the country progressed as a result of that increase? I submit every unbiased observer must agree there has been progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of pointers to this happy conclusion.  First, there is the confidence shown by foreign industrialists in their willingness to invest here, to purchase land, to open branches of industry and to start new ones.  These people are not alone expressing confidence in an Irish Government or an Irish Parliament but are also expressing confidence in the Irish people.  The decision to invest in Ireland springs from a belief in the stability, intelligence and industry of the Irish people.  The Government can do no more than emphasise these virtues and integrate and channel them into an ever-growing profitable economy.  Deputies and others should be slow to denigrate these industrialists. They are risking their money, opening <Col N="667" /> industries, and providing employment which we might find it impossible to provide by our own efforts.  Fianna Fáil have approached this matter intelligently and with foresight and the result has been of incalculable benefit to the whole community.  Would any Party, or combination of Parties, in this House dare to change that approach?</P>
    <P>Another pointer to progress is to be found in the number of people wishing to purchase their own houses.  Even newly weds and engaged couples are queuing in their thousands to avail of the loans and grants, secure in the knowledge that they will be able to meet their commitments.  The building industry is working to full capacity. Never in the history of the State has there been such tremendous activity in this industry.  In the financial year 1964-65, Dublin Corporation will be spending over £5 million on acquisition and construction.  I believe this is the largest sum spent on housing since the inception of the State, and this will be supplemented by the 3,000 houses to be built in Ballymun at a cost of £10 million, about which we hear very little from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>In this connection tribute must be paid to the Minister for Local Government for the energy and initiative he has brought to the job of providing homes for all who need them.  We have come a long way from the conditions which obtained six or seven years ago when the demand for houses fell at such an alarming rate that Dublin Corporation found it necessary to suspend or slow down its building programme.  Under a Fianna Fáil Government, and the economic progress which goes with it, such a situation will never arise again.</P>
    <P>A further indication of the improved circumstances of our people is to be seen in the vast numbers of children attending secondary schools.  No longer is it necessary for boys and girls to leave school at 14 in order to go to work and subscribe to the family exchequer. Thousands of families can now afford to send their children to secondary or vocational schools.  These <Col N="668" /> schools are bursting at the seams, a sure indication of greater economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>In the field of social welfare, the Government have nothing of which to be ashamed.  It has always been the aim of Fianna Fáil to provide as far as the economy would allow for the old and infirm.  Social service benefits are not all that might be desired but we are moving nearer to a more comprehensive scheme.  This scheme will eventuate when it becomes obvious that the people can bear the cost of it. With an expanding economy, more jobs becoming available and more money circulating among a rising population, that day may not be far distant.</P>
    <P>It is well to remind those who like to compare our social services with those obtaining in Great Britain that the stamp which costs 11/10 here costs 26/- in Great Britain.  If my information is correct, I think the British stamp was further increased recently. Great Britain is, of course, a highly industrialised country with a population of some 50 million.  It may be that we will have to introduce a less ambitious scheme but, whatever the scheme, it will have to be financed. You cannot get something for nothing. The money must come from somewhere.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to blame the Government for every inequality or imperfection which appears in the country's economy.  This is nowhere more evident than in the matter of an incomes policy.  From the point of view of the trade unions, this is a very sensitive matter.  Such a policy can come only from negotiations between employers and employees.  Any attempt by this or any Government to impose a settlement of the division between workers and employees would be resisted by the trade union movement. The trade unions are, quite rightly, jealous of rights which have been won at great sacrifice over the years.  The best a Government can do is provide the machinery for negotiation where such is obviously required.  Our desire is to see all men and women in secure and well paid employment and we express the hope that both Parties to <Col N="669" /> negotiations will pay due regard to the country's needs.</P>
    <P>The State should not be looked on as a sort of fairy godmother, who can by waving a magic wand resolve all our difficulties.  State control is not, of itself, a sure cure for all our ills. Fianna Fáil are neither a doctrinaire socialist nor doctrinaire capitalist Party.  It is striking just the right balance between State and private enterprise.  Only by striking such a balance can we, employers, workers and trade unions, preserve the democratic liberties to which we have a right.</P>
    <P>The country is moving forward on all fronts.  This is a fact which cannot be denied except by those who do not wish to see.  Therefore, this House should give its approval to the Vote on Account and demonstrate its faith in intelligent and well-ordered Government.</P>

      <P>We had an interesting discussion on the Vote on Account, with speakers ranging from the Taoiseach to Deputy Corry and the Deputy who has just sat down.  I am struck very forcibly by the change of policy which has taken place in that Party over the years.  Perhaps it would be a bit boring if one were to examine all the twists they have made in their policy over the past 30 years. The last speaker said they were neither a doctrinaire socialist nor doctrinaire capitalist Party.  I heard that used many times in another context&mdash;that they were not doctrinaire something else also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach intervened today and made two or three interesting statements. The first that struck me forcibly was that there will be no general election declared between now and tomorrow night.  He was quite clear on that.  But from the taking of the Vote tomorrow night until the date this Dáil is due to end, it can happen any time in certain circumstances.  I can assure him the people are anxious for it.  I am anxious, although I am not as young as I was, to face an election. I am anxious that the people get an opportunity of deciding whether <Col N="670" /> this Government retain their confidence or not.  I am satisfied they do not.</P>
    <P>The next point the Taoiseach made was in regard to the memorandum on health services by Deputy T. O'Higgins.  The Deputy has already dealt with this.  The Minister condemned that memorandum out of hand.  However, Deputy O'Higgins need not think he is alone when condemned by the Taoiseach.  We know that previously the Taoiseach condemned very vigorously Dr. Dignan's plan for health, which was then shelved.  But, strange as it may seem, an OEEC observer recently resurrected that plan and recommended it for reexamination. Deputy Corry told us that if he had been a member of the Committee on Health Services it would not have remained without a meeting since last April.  Deputy Corry forgets the Commission set up on vocational education, over which a very learned, honoured and reliable ecclesiastic presided.  The Taoiseach declared its report to be a very slovenly one.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Deputy O'Higgins is in fairish good company when his memorandum is condemned out of hand like that.  If Deputy O'Higgins' memorandum is as bad as the Taoiseach pretends, the Tánaiste could have called the Health Committee together any time since April and condemned it out of hand.  The fact is that the Committee have not been called together. In fact, they adjourned for the purpose of considering that memorandum. The Tánaiste was even good enough to thank Deputy O'Higgins for having produced it, with the comment &ldquo;Now we have something to get our teeth into.&rdquo;  He got his teeth into it; they are still stuck in it and his mouth is shut ever since.  I make these comments in reply to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should not on a Vote on Account like this bring in these matters, unless he has his tongue in his cheek in regard to the question of a general election.  He is preparing something.  He got in a preliminary canter today.  However, these preliminary canters may be instructive <Col N="671" /> sometimes but they are not always reliable</P>
    <P>There are two other points I want to make before I come to the Vote on Account itself.  It has been said here that no Deputy has pointed out where reductions can be made.  I am glad the Minister for Finance is here now. Deputies will recall that, last year, on the Vote on Account and the Budget I pointed out that the Minister had made no provision for overestimation and that, in my opinion, he should have taken credit for at least £10 million in the Budget.  The Minister very properly said that he could not do that because he had to make provision for the payment of the increased salaries to civil servants, the guards and so on and that would eat up that £10 million.  He intervened in the course of my speech to say that.  The truth of the matter is that he had that £10 million and had a buoyant revenue of £25 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said that then.  But, together with the amount that he budgeted for, he has, in my calculation, an extra £15 million that he collected.  There was a buoyant revenue to that extent and all that is eaten up; it is all gone. Now he says he has a deficit for the year now under review of £15 million.</P>
      <P>Again, on £220 million, a five per cent allowance for over-estimation gives him over £12 million.  So that the deficit that he is, or that he pretends to be, faced with is practically infinitesimal and he is erecting an aunt sally to shy at, as has been the Fianna Fáil tactics and practice for a number of years.  It is alleged that we are going to have a tough year and a difficult year and then they are able to do so much that it shows what great fellows they are.  That is playing fast and loose and the sooner the Government get down to brass tacks and say what the position is, the better for all concerned&mdash;Government, Opposition, and the people as a whole&mdash;because then we would know where we are.</P>
      <P>Today there were objections when the Taoiseach was speaking about the Marshall Aid being spent.  I remember the then Taoiseach saying that when they came in there was only a remnant of £22 million.  Prior to that it was stated there was none at all but in Fermoy he made the statement that there was £22 million unspent.  There was never any Government in the history of this world that left as much ready cash to another as did the first inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister would like to get me off this particular line because it is a flat contradiction of everything they said, which they said up to a time and then admitted it was incorrect.  Deputy Childers went to Newtownforbes and described our own budget proposals as the rake's progress because there was a £2 million increase and suggested that we were spending right, left and centre.  I shall not comment on the rake's progress except to say that while I am delighted, and hope it will be a success, that an Irish Government have bought over the B and I line&mdash;I assume some of the money we are voting today will be earmarked for it or that it will be coming in course of payment soon&mdash;it is a reversal of the view expressed by the Minister for External Affairs that he wished every ship was at the bottom of the sea.  In Athlone, in my presence, he declared that if every ship was sunk, then, instead of the Irish people having to tighten their belts, we would have so much to eat that we would have to loosen them.  That is a complete reversal.  It is a great conversion, which I welcome.  Unfortunately, it has taken too long&mdash;30 years&mdash;to educate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to comment on the very heavy expenditure that is taking place on this House.  While accommodation is needed and while it is important that Deputies should have suitable <Col N="674" /> offices and accommodation the expenditure has been too great.  When I consider that expenditure and look at this Chamber I feel that, if that £800,000 was being spent on Leinster House, then there should have been 51 additional seats created here so that the Government could say: &ldquo;There are 51 seats in Leinster House for people from Northern Ireland to occupy whenever they feel like it.&rdquo;  Planning is required in connection with the expenditure of such a large amount of money.  There is no planning about it. If there were planning, it would be a very big day if there were 51 seats available here that the Government could point to and say: &ldquo;Gentlemen, the seats are ready.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Retail Price of Meat.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday I put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding a matter of considerable topical importance in Dublin city at present, namely, the enormously high retail price of meat. I tabled the question to the Minister for Agriculture but it was transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The retail price of meat in Dublin at present is scandalously high. Ordinary people can no longer afford to buy it.  It has been priced off their table.  In the face of that situation, the Minister gave me a meaningless reply referring me back to equally meaningless replies of 21st May and 5th March, 1964.  When I asked him by way of supplementary question if he could hold out any prospect of alleviation of this appalling situation, he gave me what was, in effect, a negative reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> Meat has been priced off the dinner tables of the ordinary people of this city, not only beef but mutton and pork.  I have here a list of typical prices: mutton chops to-day were 5/10 per lb.; a year ago they were 2/8 to 3/10 per lb., that is, an increase of nearly 100 per cent.  The staple diet of working people, minced steak, was selling to-day in Dublin at 3/10 per lb.; a year ago it was 2/6 per lb., that is, an increase of over 50 per cent.  Pork chops&mdash;a very ordinary unextravagant dish in the past&mdash;were selling to-day at the fantastic price of 6/6 per lb.; a year ago they were 3/- to 3/6 per lb., another increase of virtually 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which no reasonable person can condone and I feel obliged in conscience to protest with all possible vigour at the Government's inaction in the face of this development. It is due in part, and in part only, to boom conditions which exist in the livestock industry.  May I say straight away that I welcome the boom prices which the farmers are obtaining for their cattle?  I recognise, as every member of this Party recognises, the basic importance of the agricultural industry.  I glory in the fact that there are now prospects for beef and mutton exports.  The cattle trade, in particular, is of fundamental importance to our economy.  If the farmers are prosperous, the entire country is prosperous.</P>
    <P>It appears that in recent months the Belgians, the French and the Dutch have lost their traditional taste for horseflesh and now have hankerings for a superior type of meat.  That means that my constituents in North-East Dublin have to compete with these wealthy foreigners for an essential item of their traditional diet.  The increased retail price of meat in Dublin is quite disproportionate to the increase which the farmers have obtained for their cattle.  I have no time to quote the full statistics but I am sure the Minister is as well aware as I am of the truth of what I am saying.  What is the cause of that?  I do not know.  I have certain suspicions but it is the Minister's job to tell us here if he has investigated this disproportionate increase in the <Col N="677" /> retail price of meat and, if so, to apportion the blame and to state further what he intends to do about it.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared to tolerate a state of inertia in this regard.  These increases call for Government investigation and action.  Meat is much cheaper, 2/- to 3/- per lb. cheaper, in rural parts than it is in Dublin; yet the rural butchers have to pay virtually as much for their supplies as is paid in Dublin city.  We must ask ourselves whether there are perhaps too many middle men battening on the consumers of fresh meat and on the cattle trade in general.  It has been represented to me that a factor in the increase is that due to the public health laws virtually all meat in Dublin is now slaughtered in the abattoir, and butchers are no longer killing their own livestock.  Whatever the cause, the fact is that the retail price of meat rarely if ever comes down, notwithstanding the reductions which take place from time to time in the price of cattle on the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>We must take into account in this connection the preposterous situation that we are now, for the first time as far as I know, subsidising carcase beef exports, at a time when my constituents are unable to buy meat, working people in particular.  This Fianna Fáil Government are not only paying foreigners to eat our butter but they are now paying them to eat our beef as well.  This carcase beef subsidy about which I read in the papers a few weeks ago has apparently only been introduced as a transition measure.  We have not been told what the cost of it is&mdash;that seems to be unknown&mdash;but it seems it is intended to be temporary. That being the case, it seems to me if the Government expects a reduction this year in cattle prices, it will result in reduction of meat prices and a similar transition should take place for the Dublin consumer.</P>
    <P>As far as the Minister's reply to my question last week is concerned, the outlook for the future is pretty grim. I do not think we can hope for any alleviation because the Minister told me we can only hope for a reduction in meat prices if cattle prices drop.  He <Col N="678" /> does not seem to contemplate any stable price reduction or price support policy.  From what I read in today's <i>Financial Times,</i> it seems quite unlikely that meat prices will drop on international markets.  There is a world scarcity of meat, as the Minister knows, largely due to the drought in the Argentine two years ago.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are now faced with the fact that the Minister is complacently accepting this outrageous increase and is not prepared to do anything about it. It is certain prices will not come down unless the Government take action. I suppose in the ordinary course of supply and demand increased demand will result in increased production and I suppose it is Government policy to increase production.  That takes time, as with prices, and in the cattle trade, it would be a period of three to four years.  This lack of concern about the vicious increase in the cost of meat is only one aspect of Fianna Fáil slaphappy policy of complacency in regard to this cost-of-living increase.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that the Minister properly appreciates the hardship which many people in this city are undergoing at the present time, due to the increase in the cost of living. It has rocketed beyond all reasonable limits.  It is higher in this country than in Britain, where the state of prosperity is much more advanced than here.  It is in a large extent due, in addition to the factors I have mentioned, to the inflation initiated by this Government when they introduced the turnover tax last November 12 months.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to, and demand, an explanation from the Minister for this increase in a fundamental commodity of our people.  We are entitled to demand that there shall be no lessening of our standard of living and no lessening of our consumption of meat in our agricultural country.  We should be able to afford it.  We should not be expected to pay the same price as the Americans and the French, and those who in the past have eaten horse flesh, are now prepared to pay for prime meat.  It seems to me the Minister has a lot to answer for.  He is unable to answer the questions I put to him as to what action he will <Col N="679" /> take and I suggest he should give this matter immediate consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect that in an agricultural country such as ours, with a high ratio in agricultural productivity and with tremendous agricultural potentiality in the natural resources of the country, that butter and meat would be the staple diet of the working people in our relatively small towns and cities.  But the Fianna Fáil policy of subsidising these commodities for the foreigner and making them dearer for the Irish people has meant that tens of thousands of Dublin families never see butter on the table, consuming instead margarine which is made of imported oils, and those families who up to now were fortunate enough on a few days a week to enjoy some meat now find themselves because of the policies of the Government, both price control policy and agriculture policy, without any taste of meat at all except such as is afforded to them by putting a penny meat cube into the pot when cooking the potatoes. Were it not for these meat cubes, there are many Dublin families who would not know the taste of meat at all.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that city people, people with an urban outlook, do not concern themselves more with agricultural policies because the basic reason for the appalling increase in prices of meat in Dublin lies in the fact that there is not sufficient meat available to provide it at reasonable prices. The reason for this is the appalling failure of the Fianna Fáil Government in the department of agriculture.  Were it not for their failure in agricultural matters, there would be a reasonable amount of meat available to meet the not unreasonable demands of people in Ireland for meat.  It is quite clear that a greater output of beef and mutton is required and I do not think we are going to get that under the present administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, and it is the kernel of the difficulty, Deputy Byrne has rightly drawn attention to the fact that the increase in the retail price of meat in Dublin is not in keeping as the Minister suggests with increases <Col N="680" /> which farmers are enjoying for their beasts.  I think the price of meat on the hoof has increased by some 25 per cent in recent times.  No one can deny the farmers a better price for beef on the hoof, as only in this way will we have sufficient stimulus to increase production.  The fact remains that while the producer is receiving only 25 per cent increase, Dublin housewives are paying anything from 33? to 50 per cent increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred per cent in some cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the last two or three months.  Certainly over the past year prices have risen sharply.  But the increases in the past few months are 33, 35 and 40 per cent on prices that have to be paid for what ought to be the staple diet of the family.</P>
      <P>It is true to say, as Deputy Byrne has said, that there has been considerable change in the mode of slaughter and marketing of meat in Dublin. There was a time when the animals were purchased on the hoof by the small butcher who slaughtered them himself and made the beef available to his customers.  Now a new ring has developed and it would seem there is some degree of price-fixing.  Butchers are now forced to slaughter in the abattoirs and a ring has been created which the Minister refuses to investigate. We think that is undesirable and we beg the Minister that, as he broke the ring that tried to increase petrol prices, he should also break the ring that appears to exist, and is growing, in the meat markets in Dublin, so that something will be done to protect the consumer in Dublin against the unreasonable increases prevailing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned a subsidy which is being provided for carcase meat.  This subsidy has been attacked by producers and exporters here because they contend it will have serious effects on the export market.</P>

      <P>I have kept silent and did not interrupt the Deputies.  I think this is a blatant case of political opportunism on the part of Deputies Ryan and Byrne.  Both have spoken with their tongues in their cheek.  They know the price of meat must be related to the price paid for cattle.  They know well that it is not practicable to control prices, particularly the price of meat.  Deputy Byrne knows his own Party are committed to the policy of free competition as being the best and the most effective means of price control. He knows also, as a man who, I suppose, studied economics in the course of his degree, that while cattle prices are high the price of meat must also be high.  It was not unnatural that he should put down a question on this subject a week ago but I suggest it is for no other reason but to seek political Party advantage to raise it on the Adjournment a week later.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows the price of cattle increased on the Dublin market by 41 per cent between November, 1963, and February, 1965.  The average price of six or seven cuts of beef in ordinary demand rose by about 16.4 per cent between mid-November, 1963, and mid-November, 1964.  I acknowledge that these figures are not up to date so far as current prices are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had these prices investigated in no fewer than 75 butchers' shops in Cork and Dublin.  I know that the price of the various cuts between November, 1964, and the current date increased by about five pence, six pence or eight pence per pound.  The prices varied from 5/6 to 8/- per lb in the case of sirloin steak and 3/8 to 5/- for chuck roast.  How can Deputy Byrne, with <Col N="682" /> his knowledge of accountancy, say there has been an increase of 100 per cent in those prices?  I know how he does it.  He takes the lowest price possible in one butcher's shop and the highest price possible in another.</P>

      <P>With regard to price control, let me quote what was said when the prices Bill, 1957, was being debated in this House in October, 1957. Deputy Cosgrave, who was the chief speaker, on the Second Stage stated at column 125, volume 164 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, to a considerable extent, with the view that competition is the most effective method of price control. <Col N="683" /> In fact, I doubt if in present circumstances, there is any faith in the effectiveness of price control in this country.</P>
    <P>Later in column 126 he says:</P>
    <P>I suppose experience has taught Deputies on both sides of the House but it is possible that both sides have contributed to the illusion that prices can be controlled by Government action or by some statutory authority.  Experience in recent years, however, has demonstrated that, with occasional exceptions, that it is not so.  In fact, experience of wartime and emergency conditions has shown that with the exception of the special circumstances pertaining to wartime or emergency conditions and then only in relation to goods which are either rationed or within the control of the Government, it is not possible to make price control effective.</P>
    <P>How does Deputy Byrne suggest the price of meat, which is one of the most difficult of all commodities to control, can be controlled effectively?  How does he suggest that can be done in view of what the Prices Advisory Body, which was supported by Deputy Byrne's Party, said in 1956.  I quote:</P>
    <P>They recommended that statutory price control on fresh meat should not be introduced for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>(a)  the meat trade is so complex as to make it extremely difficult to formulate an equitable system of control;</P>
    <P>(b)  fresh meat is at present available at a wide range of prices for the same cuts, (presumably because of variation in quality);</P>
    <P>(c)  there is evidence of competition between victuallers in the main population centres, inasmuch as meat is available at a variety of prices;</P>
    <P>(d)  the financial accounts of victuallers examined in the Department show that the profit margin is small;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> (e)  any attempt to fix maximum prices would militate against the consumer.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Minister for Industry and Commerce confirmed that.  In reply to a question in the Dáil on 28th June, 1956 regarding the retail price of meat he said he was satisfied that intervention by him in this matter would not be in the best interests of the consumer.  That is something I have been advocating time and time again. In respect of the 70 odd investigations carried out, the inspectors reported that for the same cuts of meat in the same street in Dublin the prices per pound varied as much as 1/6d.  Every housewife knows that on every butcher's block there is a variety of cuts and for each cut there is a variety of quality. How then can you control the cut of meat and the quality of meat by fixing certain maximum prices?</P>
    <P>Any Deputy can see, by glancing at the price tags in any butcher's window, the tremendous variety of prices there is for different cuts and even for the same cut.  Deputy Byrne knows well in the area in which he lives, Rathmines, that prices vary from shop to shop. In the shopping centre of Rathmines, you could hardly walk, literally, yards, without coming up against butchers' shops, all in keen competition with one another and all having different prices for the same type of meat.  If the Deputy is not satisfied with that, let him take a walk down Moore Street and look at the butchers' shops there. He will see there is a tremendous variety in prices for the same cuts of meat.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Byrne and Deputy Ryan go to mid-Cork for the byelection, I invite them to take a walk through the Corporation Meat Market, which extends from Grand Parade to Prince's Street.  They will see there possibly the greatest concentration of meat on retail sale in Europe.  This meat market consists of scores of butchers' stalls, all in competition with one another.  I know the majority of the butchers personally and I know some of them are finding it difficult to make ends meet, having regard to the prices they have to pay for cattle.  I <Col N="685" /> can assure Deputy Byrne and Deputy Ryan there is keen competition and the butchers are trying to sell meat at the lowest possible price that will attract and hold their customers and give them a fair return.  Suffice it to say that the suggestion in regard to subsidisation is not feasible in present circumstances.  Subsidisation was condemned by all sides of the House when it was first mentioned.  It was regarded as being a device which should be used only in times of national emergency <Col N="686" /> such as we had in the last war.  The Deputies know well it is impossible to effectively control the price of fresh meat.  They have subscribed to the policy that competition provides the best control of prices and I do not think anyone can deny there is very keen competition in the retailing of fresh meat.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18th February, 1965.</P>
