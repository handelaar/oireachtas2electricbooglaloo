      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the suggested negotiations between EFTA and the EEC, referred to by the British Prime Minister as bridge building between the two groups, are likely to have any impact on the Anglo-Irish trade discussions; and if he is kept fully informed of the position relative to such discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The exploration of the suggestion of a link between the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Community is still at a preliminary stage.  It is unlikely, therefore, to have a direct impact on our present trade negotiations with the British though the possible implications of such a link are, of course, being kept in mind.  The Government are following closely developments in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the fact that the United States has imposed drastic restrictions on the quantity of duty-free spirits which may be taken into the US by returning tourists, he will ensure that the sale of Scotch whisky will be discontinued at the Shannon duty free shop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that any useful purpose would be served by discontinuing the sale of Scotch whisky at the Shannon Airport duty-free shop. Many of those who purchased duty-free spirits are not US residents and are, therefore, not affected by the new restrictions.  It is hoped that the impact of the restrictions will be appreciably reduced by an improved sales campaign and that sales of Irish whiskey will be maintained at least equal to those of previous years.  In any event, if the sale of Scotch whisky were to be stopped, passengers would not necessarily buy Irish instead.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Question Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature and extent of this particular <Col N="986" /> project and the procedure proposed were set out in public advertisements, which invited building interests to apply for a more detailed documentary brief.  The advertisement stated that negotiations would be entered into with building interests whose capacity and ability to undertake the project were accepted.  Approximately 100 applications for the detailed brief were received.</P>
    <P>The brief required that interested firms should advise me in detail, <i>inter alia,</i> of their experience of major housing contracts and of their general competency, with particular reference to the professional and other resources available to them.  They were also required to outline the time schedule foreseen by them in the light of the requirements of the brief, distinguishing between planning, development, the rate of completion of houses and their approach to costs.  It was stated in the brief that detailed negotiations would be undertaken with a selected firm or firms with a view to entering a contract at the earliest practicable date.</P>
    <P>I subsequently held detailed discussions with all firms who appeared to satisfy the requirements of the advertisement and of the brief provided by me.  I also examined exhaustively the guide prices which they submitted.</P>
    <P>In the event of any future such large scale housing contract being contemplated, the procedures to be followed will no doubt be determined according to the circumstances obtaining at that particular time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether, in a package deal of this nature, any detailed specification is looked for?  The Minister says they were asked to apply for a detailed brief. Would he say if such detail would require them to give a specification for doors?  In a case such as this, you might have 18,000 doors and would they just supply these doors and if they were unable to supply them in accordance with the contract, could they just reduce the quality of the doors, or of any other materials, such as windows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of <Col N="987" /> doors and windows and other such materials, these would be indicated in advance in relation to the general standards and these standards would have to be conformed to as a minimum. Anything over and above what is indicated as the minimum would be arrived at only after agreement had been reached between the National Building Agency, acting on behalf of the corporation and the consortium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be fair to say that the Minister is depending more on the standing and integrity of the firms concerned than on holding them to the quality of their work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The question of standing and integrity did come into the general review of the original applicants but only in the final analysis, in the detailed examination of their proposals, did their type of equipment, their experience in the past and so on come into it in a broad general way. The record in that regard is not being relied upon to ensure that they do the job in a proper manner.  It is much more closely tied up than merely by relying on any such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said that the National Building Agency have equipped themselves with such advisers and consultants as would be prudent in such a case and that there are available to them the quantity surveyor, the structural engineer and the heating and services engineering advisers.  These are available to them for the duration of the contract.  In addition, they have a resident engineer on the site on their behalf who is not only there to see that things go as pre-determined but also to correlate and co-ordinate operations <Col N="988" /> in whatever way is necessary as between the Agency, the Department, the corporation and the contractors.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that it is necessary for recipients of unemployment benefit to queue in the open street while awaiting payment during the hours when the offices are open at three of the four exchanges mentioned by the Deputy, namely, those at Northumberland House, Gardiner Street and Werburgh Street.  In fact I am quite satisfied that the accommodation at those exchanges is more than adequate in present circumstances.  It is a fact, however, that some people come to these exchanges in the morning and afternoon before they are open to the public and wait outside until they are open.  There is no necessity for this but if people choose to do so I think the Deputy will agree that the <Col N="1002" /> provision of extra accommodation is not going to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to the fourth exchange, that at Victoria Street, accommodation is somewhat restricted there and some years ago my Department had a covered passage built outside so that when a large number of people attended together at that office they would not have to stand in the open. Generally, however, the accommodation at that exchange is not what I would wish it to be and I am having the position examined.</P>

      <P>Until towards the end of June, market prices were higher than in 1964 which was itself a very good year for sheep.  Since then, prices have approximated more to the 1963 level.

The daily samples are combined and preserved until the end of the sampling period when they form a composite and representative sample of the milk delivered by that supplier during the period.

      <P>If there are discrepancies between the results of tests carried out by creameries and by public analysts, they could arise either from the fact that samples are not identical or that the method of testing used by the public analyst is not as prescribed by the Order.</P>

Apparently, the situation was that the footpath was blocked by a group of people.  The Gardaí sought to have this blockage terminated.  They approached a number of people and asked them to move on. As far as I know, the Gardaí in some instances were not aware that the people were journalists.  The Gardaí have no desire whatever to interfere with journalists in the proper execution of their difficult task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 8th November. The loan will be for £25 million, but £3.9 million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices and an application for £5 million of the stock is being made on behalf of funds under my control.  The balance of £16.1 million will be underwritten jointly by the banks and the Government.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest will be 6¾ per cent per annum and the price £100 per cent.  The stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1991 and may be redeemed at any time from October, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual provision is made in the prospectus whereby only 10 per cent of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further instalments spread over the period to the first week of January. Those subscribers who wish to pay the full amount on application next week, or to complete their subscription on 1st December, will be entitled to discount equivalent to an <Col N="1021" /> interest rate of 6¾ per cent per annum on the advance payments.</P>
    <P>The tax privileges attached to recent National Loans are again included. Interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source, but, of course, holders ordinarily resident in the State will be liable for whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes.</P>
    <P>Stock of the issue will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part. The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1965, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The attractive interest rate it carries, its status as a trustee security, the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and substantial sinking fund allocations should ensure that the stock will always have a high market value.  The Government stockbroker will be ready continually to buy and sell reasonable amounts of the stock, and this will help to maintain an active market in it.</P>
    <P>The loan is required for the financing of State capital outlay on agriculture and industry, on housing, sanitary services and schools, on afforestation and fuel resources, on transport and on other development schemes in pursuance of the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>The prospectus of the issue will be published in tomorrow morning's newspapers.  Copies of the prospectus, with the application form for subscriptions attached, will also be available as from tomorrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 12th November.</P>
    <P>I ask every Deputy in the House to give the issue his full support.</P>

      <P>Whatever criticisms we may offer as to the <Col N="1022" /> manner in which this country is at present being governed, we have no doubts as to the inherent soundness of our economy.  For this reason, an invitation to invest in the economy of the country is an invitation which we can support and do support with enthusiasm and confidence.  We believe that on grounds of patriotism and of profit, this loan should commend itself for widespread public support.  An attractive rate of interest is a real inducement but the dominant attraction is the opportunity of investing in a sound economy and of contributing to the prosperity of the country.  This country can only be developed economically and socially if there is adequate investment in agriculture, industry, drainage, afforestation, housing, hospitals, schools and generally in the provision of employment at home for our people.</P>
      <P>The present economic difficulties should not obscure, and, I believe, will not obscure, the basic soundness of our economy.  If we are to provide our people with the standards to which they aspire and which they should have, increased capital investment is essential.  We, therefore, in the Fine Gael Party commend with enthusiasm this loan to the people generally.  We would stress that the loan is an attraction not only to the big investor but also to the small investor throughout the country and we hope that it will have, both from the bigger investor and from the small investor, general and widespread support.</P>

      <P>Raising a loan for national development is not and never has been a matter of Party controversy. For that reason, I, on behalf of my colleagues in the Labour Party, should like to express our full approval of the raising of the sum of £25 million by way of loan.  We also strongly recommend the public to avail of it in view of its most generous terms.  We approve of the method and we approve of the amount because such an amount is needed, as the Minister has said, to finance certain important schemes of capital outlay. Not only are the terms attractive but those who subscribe to this loan are <Col N="1023" /> doing so in the knowledge that the £25 million so raised will be put to good use in the further development of agriculture and industry and in the provision of houses, schools and sanitary services, and the development of afforestation and activity of that kind.  Above all, it will help to maintain, and possibly improve, employment in these various projects.  When considering raising money from the public, we should realise that it is mainly by our own efforts here, for greater production and consequent better incomes and greater savings, that we can provide for the future development of our country.  I trust that this attitude and the attitude of the three Parties here today will be reflected in the response by the public to this loan of £25 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:</P>
      <P> (1)  the relativities that are appropriate between the rates of remuneration payable to recruitment clerical grades in the employment of the principal State-sponsored bodies, including Aer Lingus Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, and to corresponding recruitment grades (other than departmental grades) in the Civil Service and the service of the local authorities, with due regard to the staffing structure and the circumstances of each employment and to the interests of the national economy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  the absolute levels of pay <Col N="1024" /> for grades mentioned that with due regard as aforesaid, are appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increase in pay.  </P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to enable a tribunal to be set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, with the terms of reference indicated.  The House will, no doubt, wish me to outline the reasons which have prompted the Government to act on these lines.</P>
    <P>For some time past the Government have been concerned at the serious implications for the economy of the apparently unending series of pay increases occurring between or independently of agreed national increases in pay.  The deficit in external trade and payments is such that this constant injection of fresh purchasing power, in excess of the national productivity increase, cannot go on without disastrous consequences.  The rise in the volume of spending would inevitably stimulate imports and widen the already excessive deficit in the balance of payments. Moreover, the recent steep rise in prices and unit labour costs would be accelerated with consequent further damage to the competitiveness of industrial exports.  Unless there is a more orderly development of income increases in relation to national productivity, much more of the impact of policy measures to protect the economy must fall on capital expenditure and imports, and, therefore, on employment.</P>
    <P>The most immediate danger appears to the Government to lie in the field of clerical employment.  When, in 1959, the upturn in the economy made possible the seventh round of wage and salary increases, it was hoped that, for the future, the rise in the national product would permit of the improvement of the living standards of all our people in a just and orderly way.  The years since then have seen substantial improvements.  Pay levels for salaried workers, in particular, have increased to a considerable extent but, largely because of the number of arbitration bodies operating independently of each other which are concerned in determining pay, the <Col N="1025" /> approach has been unco-ordinated and neither finality nor consistency has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Pay rates since 1959 were, first of all, increased in what has been called the eighth round.  That round, on account of the period of time involved, was not self-contained.  On various grounds, such as fair comparisons, loss of status and efforts to secure uniformity or near uniformity in clerical rates of pay, a number of adjustments of eighth round settlements were effected.  All resulted, of course, in an increase in take-home pay.  Then, there was, in addition, the 12 per cent ninth round increase.</P>
    <P>The situation over recent years may fairly be summarised in this way.  On the one hand, a large body of clerical staff have been seeking parity with the highest rates while, on the other, the holders of these rates not merely have not accepted such parity but have claimed the continuance of pre-existing differentials.  In the hope of ending this economically dangerous leap-frogging, the best immediate course appears to the Government to be to set up a tribunal to consider pay levels of the recruitment clerical grades in the main State-sponsored bodies, such as Aer Lingus Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, and corresponding recruitment grades in the Civil Service and the local service.  Between them these services contain the bulk of clerical employment.  The tribunal would be asked to report on what in its view constituted appropriate pay relativities in this sector, account being taken of the staffing structures and the circumstances of each employment and the interests of the national economy. The tribunal would also be asked to report on what absolute levels of pay for the grade concerned are appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increase in pay.</P>
    <P>This will be the first occasion when all these grades will have their pay rates examined simultaneously by an authoritative body in the light of all available material.  The findings of a responsible tribunal of this kind will obviously receive the closest attention <Col N="1026" /> from all concerned in the fixing of pay rates in individual employments.</P>
    <P>The present proposal has been formulated to meet an immediate and pressing need and to meet that need with the minimum of delay.  For this reason, its terms of reference have been confined to the basic recruitment grades, since what is determined to be appropriate for these grades generally sets the pattern for pay increases in related grades.  Even with this limitation, the task of the tribunal will be a formidable one but, in view of the urgency of the problem, I intend to ask the members to set 1st March next as their latest target date for reporting.  If they can report earlier, so much the better.  The tribunal will operate under the provisions of the 1921 Act to which I referred earlier and it will cease to function once it has presented its report.</P>
    <P>Pending receipt of the tribunal's report, it would clearly be contrary to the national interest that its findings should be anticipated.  The Government have, therefore, decided to defer and to request other employers in the public sector to defer, until the tribunal's report is available, the granting of any pay increases to groups whose rates are to be the subject of investigation by the tribunal or to directly related groups.</P>
    <P>This decision will not affect claims awaiting hearing by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  The vast bulk of Civil Service grades have already been dealt with on the basis of key decisions given by the Board bringing pay into line with rates previously in operation outside.  The claims still to be heard by the Board concern small numbers in departmental grades and are based largely on internal relativities with grades which have already had revisions.  It would clearly be unfair to prevent these small groups from processing their claims in the same manner as the larger groups have already done.</P>
    <P>Invitations to act on the tribunal have not, of course, been issued at this stage but it would be my wish to have the tribunal drawn from the Labour Court with some additional members, including in that number an economist. <Col N="1027" /> This would be in line with the Government's policy of enlarging and strengthening the Labour Court and giving it the ultimate responsibility for dealing with salary as well as wage claims.  The pay structures and relativities in the clerical employments with which this tribunal will be immediately concerned are, of course, only part of a wider problem which the Government intend should come within the scope of the responsibility of a reconstituted Labour Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No one with any sense of responsibility can now have any illusions as to the danger and the folly involved in national wage and salary increases which are unrelated to national productivity.  We, the ordinary people of the country, have had bitter experience in this regard over the past few years.  The past few years have been a period in which resolution and certainty on the part of the Government have been singularly lacking, a period in which far-reaching decisions were arrived at not because they were logical or desirable in the circumstances but because they represented an attractive compromise between what the Government felt they should do and what the political exigencies of the moment dictated was expedient to be done.  Certainly, since 1963, the people have been bewildered with demands from the Government for stability in wages, followed by Government contrived upsurges in prices and inevitable movements towards wage adjustments which because of an inherent leap-frog character seemed to develop into a further cycle which in itself was unending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire to go back over any number of years, but in order that this problem, the problem which the Minister endeavours to deal with in this motion, may be properly understood, I should like to remind the House that a little over two years ago, in February, 1963, there was issued on behalf of the Government a White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i>  That White Paper was issued at the apparent end of a round of wage increases. In it a number of things were stated <Col N="1028" /> and a number of sentiments expressed on behalf of the Government.  Paragraph 1 on page 3 said that the purpose of the White Paper was to draw attention to the economic danger caused by the gap between incomes and productivity which had developed over the past year or so&mdash;that is, 1962 &mdash;and which threatened to become wider, and to seek the understanding and co-operation of all sections of the community in efforts to close this gap. That was printed in February, 1963.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 10 on page 7 of the White Paper, the point was made that:</P>
    <P>When income increases greatly exceed the growth in national production there are adverse effects also on the country's trading position.  Home-produced goods are made less competitive in foreign markets by the rise in production costs.  At the same time some of the new purchasing power is being used to buy a greater volume of imports. Less exports and more imports mean a bigger gap between what we earn abroad and what we spend abroad &mdash;an increased deficit in our balance of international payments. </P>
    <P>These sentiments were expressed in this White Paper in February, 1963. On page 9 in paragraph 18, this was stated:</P>
    <P>There is a general obligation on the Government to promote the highest possible growth rate and the highest possible level of productive employment consistent with reasonable stability of prices and external payments. </P>
    <P>And on page 10 in paragraph 20, this statement is made:</P>
    <P>As a more immediate matter, the Government are convinced that it is necessary to avoid the damage to the national economy which would occur if further wage and salary or other income increases, whether in the public or private sector, took place before national production had risen sufficiently.  General restraint is essential and may reasonably be expected. </P>
    <P>Then in paragraph 21, the Government stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> In the light of the considerations set out in this White Paper, the Government deem it necessary that Departments and State-sponsored organisations should not accede for the present to any claims for increases in wages and salaries, or for changes in conditions of work having the same effect, which would arouse expectations of similar increases in other employments.  They trust that there will be a full appreciation of the fact that the Government should not, in respect of persons whose remuneration is provided directly or indirectly from public funds, or whose employment arises in the provision under statutory authority of public services, follow a course they are convinced would be contrary to the national interest.  It is not envisaged that conciliation and arbitration procedures should be put in suspense but rather that the findings should be considered in relation to their possible reaction in other sectors and, if necessary, not applied until this can be done without damage to the national economic interest. </P>
    <P>I direct the attention of Deputies to that White Paper, to the sentiments it contains and to the expressions of policy to which the Government subscribed in issuing that document, and I want the Minister and the Government to imagine what the general public expected would be the course of conduct of the Government following publication of the White Paper in February, 1963.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be thought or was thought of the sentiments which were expressed, the country was entitled to expect action by the Government at least consistent with the opinions they had expressed: &ldquo;Stability of wages could only be maintained if there was stability of prices&rdquo;, and the point was made in the White Paper, <i>Closing the Gap,</i> that now with the year 1962 over, it was essential to maintain stability in prices and costs if we were to trade competitively with other countries and were not to run into further difficulties in our balance of payments and matters of that kind. That at least was expected from the <Col N="1030" /> Government, and a Government who were resolute, who knew their mind and were certain of their policy and confident in their future would have been expected to act in a decisive way in relation to a problem of that kind.</P>
    <P>Many people have been for too long too patient with the lack of consistency shown on the part of the Government. This document had scarcely been published and digested by the public when a dramatic change in the attitude of the Government took place, or rather a course of conduct was embarked on, which was in direct contradiction of the demand for stability made in <i>Closing the Gap.</i>  Deputies will remember that a few weeks later we had the introduction by the Minister for Finance of the turnover tax.  I do not wish to debate the merits of that tax or to go over any of the ground that was covered so often, so vehemently and so energetically in this House and elsewhere in regard to the turnover tax: I merely want to remind the House that a Government who made such a virtue of stability in costs and prices, a Government who pointed to every section of the economy, to every group of workers and every person engaged in any productive activity in the country in February of 1963 and intimated as they were entitled to do, to the sense of patriotism and nationalism in all of us, the importance of stability, a few weeks later came in and by their own act proceeded deliberately to destroy the vesture of stability.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the turnover tax met from Fine Gael benches the criticism in which we said that this form of taxation would step up inevitably increases in prices.  When a tax of this kind comes in, based on goods which people had to buy, it was inevitable that the cost of living would begin to creep up and that the possibility of stability of prices and wages would be remote.  It is now beyond controversy that immediately following the operation of the turnover tax, a violent upward surge in prices took place.  So dramatic indeed was the increase in prices that there were near riots in many large stores throughout the country.  It was in that <Col N="1031" /> situation which had its dramatic effect in the autumn of 1963 that the full mischief involved in the turnover tax became apparent to the people. Stability disappeared.  Here again were a muddling Government, unsure of themselves, unsure of their policy, doing something completely inconsistent with the principles set forth in the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i></P>
    <P>The turnover tax increase in prices began to create, as it inevitably would, considerable political embarrassment for the Government.  At that time the Government were maintained in office on a shoestring, and a rather frayed shoestring at that.  In the autumn of 1963, there were two by-elections, one caused by the death of a Fianna Fáil Deputy and the other caused by the death of the late William Norton.  In those circumstances, as the country will recall, to deal with this situation caused by the turnover tax, the Taoiseach decided to grasp what he regarded as the nettle and to grasp it firmly.  He did himself initiate the ninth round of wage increases.  That was done in the autumn of 1963, eight months after he had in this White Paper pointed out to all concerned the importance of stability and the national danger of further wage increases which were out of line with national productivity.</P>
    <P>Why the change?  What had taken place in these eight months which would have justified such a drastic change of front?  He was either right in the autumn of 1963 or he was right in the February of that year.  Certainly his conduct was inconsistent.  We now feel, and we accuse the Leader of Fianna Fáil and all who were party to it at the time, that this time two years ago, they thought first of Party interest and only secondly of the national interest.  The principles so firmly stated in February, 1963 counted for nothing when they were likely to lead to a Fianna Fáil defeat in Cork city or Kildare.  In those circumstances, national interest stood by while political expediency took the first seat.</P>
    <P>We had then the 12 per cent initiated by the Taoiseach, conducted <Col N="1032" /> by him and brought on by him for the purpose of winning two by-elections and so securing his Government in office.  Now that is over.  The elections were won but today every worker's job may be in danger and this country may be at risk to pay the cost of Fianna Fáil victories in Cork city and Kildare.  That is the result of the Government's action which is here to be read and thought over by the country two years later.  It is serious that we should have, in these circumstances, to attribute to the leader of the Government, the Taoiseach, irresponsibility. We do not do so lightly. We do so because we are convinced from what we have experienced and seen that the past two and a half years have been an exercise by him in political expediency which, in fact, has worked to the national harm.</P>
    <P>This motion is introduced now on behalf of the Government who have created such a sorry mess.  It is introduced in an effort desperately to stop a cycle which was started for political purposes in the past.  I suppose some effort has got to be made, sometime, somehow, to deal with the situation which, if it is allowed to remain unattended, will grow to enormous proportions.  We wish to direct the attention of Deputies and the country to what is the motive behind this tardy Government action.  The 12 per cent wage round achieved its purpose but unfortunate workers found that the increase which they got melted away in their pockets and that, in fact, the ninth round of wage increases was eaten up as rapidly as it was granted by further increases in prices.  The year just concluded has been a year in which there has been, following the 12 per cent, a rapid increase in living costs, bringing the pinch of want into many homes in this country where it had not been felt for a long time before, and in the past 12 months, most workers, irrespective of the size of their pay packets, learned well the danger and the folly of a national wage increase which was not related to an increase in national productivity.</P>
    <P>As to the rise in prices in the past 12 months, in the last Dáil and in this Dáil and during the course of the <Col N="1033" /> general election, we in the Fine Gael Party directed public attention and the attention of the Government to what was happening, to the fact that wage increases were being eaten up by price rises.  We asked and demanded time and again that something should be done by the Government to stem, stop and curb rising prices and we were told contemptuously by Government Ministers that there was nothing in the problem that we were advocating, that rises in prices did not matter, that if an effort were made to curb prices, unemployment would follow, that everything was grand, the sun was shining, we were all making hay, and it was only the bad boys in Fine Gael and other Parties who were endeavouring to suggest that clouds were gathering on the horizon when they were not.</P>
    <P>Despite everything we said and advocated, nothing was done by this Government to deal with prices.  In the course of this year, in a most important &mdash;I say this and I do not mind whom it offends&mdash;a most important political document was published, that is, the political manifesto of the Fine Gael Party, a plan, <i>Towards a Just Society.</i> In that document, in March of this year, many things were advocated, many constructive proposals were put forward, all of which are now becoming generally acceptable to more and more people.  Amongst the things we advocated in that document was the introduction of a rational prices and incomes policy.  Our policy for incomes and prices was based on the firm conviction that a proper incomes policy should have as its object a continual and orderly growth in the economy, a continual and orderly sharing by all workers, by all producers, in a continual increase in national wealth.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that our ideas and our policy proposals in that regard pre-dated anything subsequently done in England by the present Labour Government.</P>
    <P>We realise, and realised then, and in the document I have mentioned it is realised, that prices and incomes cannot be separated and that &ldquo;incomes&rdquo; must include not only wages and salaries but also dividends and other unearned <Col N="1034" /> income.  We suggested at that time as part of the incomes policy that price behaviour, the trend in relation to prices, should and could be estimated if it were accepted as a principle that prices should fall when productivity was increasing faster than the national average and would rise when productivity was increasing more slowly.  We indicated that by machinery to watch that trend and those circumstances, it would be possible for a Government who knew where they were going and were confident and sure of their own policies to be able to indicate likely price behaviour and to take steps and have appropriate machinery to react accordingly.</P>
    <P>Believing these things were possible, believing in our prices and incomes policy, we saw in March of this year, and still see, no difficulty in a Government who know what they are doing, initiating through appropriate machinery a national incomes policy which would be related firmly to productivity and which would end the crazy and disastrous race between wages and prices.</P>
    <P>I mention the Fine Gael document <i>Towards a Just Society</i> and our policy in relation to wages and prices, our incomes policy, at this stage in this debate for the purpose of saying once again how our views are now beginning to be seen to be correct even by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the general election the Taoiseach went on record in criticism of our incomes policy.  He spoke in Mullingar on 6th April of this year, the eve of poll, and the <i>Irish Press</i> carried the heading &ldquo;Wages.  Taoiseach hits out at Fine Gael incomes policy.  Fianna Fáil stand by free negotiations.  Wage control opposed by the Government.&rdquo; The Taoiseach was reported as follows:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that Mr. Dillon had not defined his policy. He probably meant and certainly intended the public to understand some system of Government regulation of wage and salary increases </P>
    <P>&mdash;a thing of course, that was never intended or contemplated&mdash;</P>
    <P>and he went on to say : &ldquo;We in <Col N="1035" /> Fianna Fáil do not believe that any system of this kind is workable.  It has ever been successfully operated in any country except the Communist countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the Taoiseach high and merry on the eve of poll saying to the people of Mullingar that &ldquo;an incomes policy is out; we will not accept it; we will not tolerate it; we will not have it; no country has it except it is a Communist country.&rdquo;  He went on to say in that speech that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government believed in wage agreements freely negotiated and that no hurt or hindrance, bar or regulation, would be imposed to prevent such agreements.</P>
    <P>Now the election is over.  All the hustle and bustle has died down and the country is face to face with reality. The bills have now to be met.  It is now recognised that during the past two years, certainly the past 18 months, we went through a period of roistering inflation, a period in which there was unlimited expenditure by the Government, a period in which the banks advanced to any investor what money he wanted to take a gamble on the stock exchange.  The rumours of a new loan, a new flotation, sent many investors to their bank managers, there to get what credit they wanted to take a flutter.</P>
    <P>It was a period in which the Government set an example to the country&mdash; spend and spend and spend.  It was a period in which every section was taught to believe in the Good-Time Charlies and so forth, a period in which an election was held in an atmosphere in which &ldquo;Lemass was to lead on,&rdquo; in which the clock was not to be put back.  Levies and all the things of the past must be voted against by keeping Lemass in office, the Fianna Fáil Party doing what they had been doing.</P>
    <P>The banners are no longer waving. The posters are rain-stained now, peeling from the walls.  The face of the Taoiseach that appeared on every hoarding is no longer to be seen.  Now, in the autumn of the year, the facts <Col N="1036" /> have to be faced when the leaves are tumbling from the trees.  The incomes policy, this Communist device, this thing that Fine Gael advocated, that only would be thought of in a Communist country&mdash;the thing Deputy Lemass in his Mullingar speech referred to when he said: &ldquo;I want to make it clear we are definitely against it.  If we are in government, we will not apply it; if in Opposition, we will oppose it strongly&rdquo;&mdash;is all right now.</P>
    <P>Now what has he to say?  On 27th October&mdash;last week&mdash;the Taoiseach spoke, as is now the habit of members of the Government, at a dinner outside this House.  He spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  Of course, important statements are never made here where they should be made and discussed in the Irish Parliament.  The Taoiseach said this:</P>
    <P>An incomes policy is a fundamental requirement of continuing economic growth and it is also the foundation of a just&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I thought I was about to read &ldquo;society&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;social policy which must involve degrees of income redistribution. </P>
    <P>An incomes policy was put forward by us in the general election after we had thought it out.  We did not require a group of civil servants to do it for us.  We got down to this planning for a just society in order to deal with current Irish problems.  Our views in relation to an incomes policy, the things we advocated, are now recognised by the Taoiseach as being a fundamental requirement of continuing economic growth.  I suppose a convert is always welcome.  We know that the prodigal was welcomed by the killing of the fatted calf.  It is better now than never that there should be a recognition by the Government of the sanity involved in an incomes policy. It is better than never that the things we advocated in the last election and which the people could have had six months ago if they had taken the wise decision of putting in a Fine Gael Government, should now be recognised and that there should now be some faltering steps towards this objective <Col N="1037" /> than that there should be the continual display of political expediency which we saw, to the national cost, just two years ago.</P>
    <P>An effort was made in the past fortnight to deal with prices.  I say an effort because it is merely a bit of windowdressing.  It is very little use controlling prices when they have already gone beyond the limits of the ordinary people.  Price control should have been adopted, not along the lines the Minister has adopted but steps should have been taken to deal with prices many months ago.  If it had been done even in the spring of this year, if it had been done at the time we advocated its doing, I do not believe the country would be face to face with the economic crisis which causes dismay to everyone.  The present dismal situation has been brought about because the Government did not face up to the facts when we urged them to do so.</P>
    <P>Now we have price orders, the old-fashioned way of dealing with prices, the old blanket restriction, instead of an intelligent approach to prices, instead of economic planning.  However, we have to accept, and we do accept, some step as being better than no step until such time as it is possible to get into office a Government who will know surely where they are going, know surely the methods to achieve their purpose.</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that this motion is proposed by the Minister. It is not a motion that is particularly attractive to us or indeed to any section of the House.  However, it is a motion which we understand to be a genuine attempt to investigate a problem. Quite certainly no one could advocate or wish to see a leap-frogging into the months or years that lie ahead which would threaten the employment and the security in employment of all sections of the community.  That would be nationally disastrous.  If a start must be made in seeking out the causes of leap-frogging, we hope that start is justified.</P>
    <P>This motion deals with particular aspects of clerical employment.  It <Col N="1038" /> refers in particular to employment in the State-sponsored bodies such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, CIE and the ESB, and also refers to the corresponding grades in the Civil Service. In relation to these, the allegation has been made by successive Ministers for Finance in the past three years&mdash;it was made in <i>Closing the Gap</i> and it is being made now again by the Minister for Finance&mdash;that these inequalities do exist and that they tend to initiate and spiral off unjustified wage increases at a time when the economy cannot meet such.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  I have no means of knowing it.  I have heard it said so often by Ministers for Finance, but then, I have heard Ministers for Finance say so many things that subsequently on investigation do not appear to be precisely adequate. I feel that that particular allegation should be inquired into.  An inquiry should take place into this matter so that it may be clarified once and for all.</P>
    <P>I say that in the conviction and belief that this is not, and is not intended to be, a wage freeze.  It has not been so introduced by the Minister and I accept that such is not involved. We see no reason why, if the proper methods are applied to the economy and the aims we have in common, there should not be an orderly expansion of the economy, with all sections of the community getting their fair share.  We certainly see no justification in present circumstances for endeavouring to apply old-fashioned methods&mdash; the idea of a wage freeze so often talked of in the past.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an inquiry, I hope it will be quite clear that it will not affect the existing applications and the arbitration and conciliation machinery relating to present claims. As far as we are concerned on these benches, we introduced the idea&mdash;we fought an election to do it&mdash;of arbitration in relation to the Civil Service. We believe in it.  We believe it is the right way of doing things.  We trust it is clear that all applications which are in the pipeline will not be affected by <Col N="1039" /> this motion.  I should also say in relation to arbitration that we take credit for the fact that it was we who introduced arbitration for the Army, teachers, Garda and Post Office workers.  These things are important to remember and are worth preserving and fighting for.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister is going to appoint his board or tribunal. I think the term &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; is unfortunate. I suppose it arises from the Act under which this motion comes.  I hope it is not going to be a star-chamber operation.  I hope the board or court or whatever it may be will be, and will appear to be, impartial.  It is a pity that they must be appointed by the Government.  I suppose no other ready machinery is available.  But I hope the Government will realise how essential it is that there will be confidence in a body of this kind.  Their inquiry should relate to existing inequalities and should not subsequently be used as a coin for the future.  I shall explain what I mean.  This tribunal will operate in a time of economic difficulty for the country, a time in which many problems may appear very definite, very large and very real.  In relation to many of their recommendations, I hope they will be tempered by a realisation that in other times, in times in which things are easier and better, many of the views they form may be varied.</P>
    <P>The country now finds itself facing a situation which, in our view, is directly attributable to indecision, muddling and feet-changing on the part of the Government, to decisions taken on the ground of political expediency rather than national interest.  Because this situation is now upon us, we are faced with stormy weather and all the rest.  It is because of that we feel that some form of inquiry such as indicated by the Minister should be supported and agreed to by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what contribution the establishment of this tribunal will make towards solving many of the problems which beset this country.  Contrary to what the Government <Col N="1040" /> stated on 15th October, there was no consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this matter.  There was no consultation, as far as I know, with the National Employer Labour Conference.  As far as my information goes, there was merely notification by the Minister to this particular body that he had this proposal in mind.  I do not think anybody should be under the impression that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions either directly or tacitly have given approval to the proposal now before the House.</P>
      <P>We are more than suspicious about this proposal.  When one has regard to the record of the present Government in relation to their policy on wages and salaries, I think we have every reason to be suspicious of it. We had the Wages Standtill Order of 1940 or 1941.  We had the threat of a standstill order in 1947.  We had what was in effect a wages cut some years afterwards with the complete withdrawal of the food subsidies.  We had, in September of 1961, the introduction of a compulsory Arbitration Bill to be applied to employees of the Electricity Supply Board.  Many members of the House will, I think, remember that in that connection the Dáil was called specially In the month of September in order to pass the measure proposed by the Government, a measure designed to introduce compulsory arbitration. We remember, too, that the Government very quickly realised their mistake, within the first few minutes of the discussion on that Bill, and subsequently trimmed down the Bill to the point at which it was not anything like as effective as they meant it to be when they introduced it.</P>
      <P>We had then their <i>Closing the Gap.</i> That was a virtual standstill in relation to many thousands of employees and, again, with the inconsistency of the Government, for the reasons to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, we had their green light, or their &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo; signal, at the end of 1963; and now we have this tribunal which proposes a standstill on the wages of certain categories of clerical workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are against the principle of the <Col N="1041" /> standstill as proposed in the motion before the House.  Mark you, it is not alone for the Civil Service.  It also includes the semi-State bodies mentioned by the Minister.  In that connection, I should like to ask him if the semi-State bodies he has mentioned are the only semi-State bodies which will be included.  I assume that he also means the other 55 or 56 odd semi-State companies.  But this measure goes even further.  It exhorts all other employers of a similar type of clerical worker to defer any wage increase until this tribunal reports. What action is to be taken after it does report, we do not know.  Neither has the Minister made it clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his speech that even in the public sector employers should defer pay increases.  I think everybody must appreciate that, in respect of certain clerical employment, or, should I say, a great deal of it all over the country, wages, or salaries, to give them a more highfalutin term, are very depressed indeed.  The Minister suggests this tribunal will report by 1st March next.  That is quite a long wait for these people before they can get increases which they may be at present negotiating.</P>
    <P>Another peculiarity is that the proposal is to investigate and report on the wage or salary of the lowest paid clerical workers.  This, I am sure, must come pretty hard on these people when they remember that this follows on higher civil servants getting pretty steep increases, much more than the 12 per cent that was negotiated in the National Wage Agreement in respect of the bulk of the workers in the country.  It is also peculiar that this tribunal will deal with recruitment grades as against promotion grades.  I wonder would the Minister be good enough to comment on that when he is replying?</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us would say that the machinery for fixing salaries in the Civil Service is perfect, but it should be remembered that the wage scales, the basics that have been arrived at, were fixed by arbitration and that there has been no new trouble in the sense that there has either been a strike by or a threat of strike <Col N="1042" /> amongst the Civil Service grades.  If this proposal of the Minister does not mean an end of arbitration, it certainly constitutes, in my opinion, a grave threat to the principle, the principle that was unanimously accepted by every Party in this House and, if my memory serves me correctly, prior to the general election of 1951. I wonder if the Minister in his proposal has had regard to the fact that, as far as the Electricity Supply Board are concerned, they were given the right to arbitrate by legislation.  Is it proposed now in respect of clerical grades in the Electricity Supply Board to repeal that part of the Act ?  In my opinion, this is the thin end of the wedge by the Government in order to control free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>Again, may I pose the question dealt with by Deputy O'Higgins: is this the introduction of an incomes policy and, if so, should we not be told ?</P>

      <P>There has been pretty vague and loose talk about an incomes policy over the past few years.  The Government on occasion, through their spokesmen, and particularly in the general election, ridiculed the idea. On 27th September, at the function to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, the Taoiseach seemed to be in favour of it.</P>

      <P>If we are to have an incomes policy, then I think we should be told.  If it is an incomes policy that will satisfy all sections of the House and all sections of the community, it might be a good thing if we had one, but this business of attempting to fix even basics for very lowly paid workers is not, in my opinion, the best way of approaching such a policy.  A great many people have been speaking about an incomes policy and, in speaking about it, they talk about it merely in terms of a restraint on wages and salaries.  The majority of those who are involved expressed themselves very clearly at the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in July <Col N="1043" /> of this year.  There was at that conference a motion, which was unanimously approved, setting out, in very fair terms, what the trade union movement thought an incomes policy should be.  I do not think anybody could take exception to the terms of that motion in respect of an incomes policy.  In the motion: &ldquo;Congress declares its opposition to any attempt by Government to control free collective bargaining between trade unions and employers and reaffirms its rejection of any form of incomes policy that does not deal effectively with prices and profits.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Anyone who imagines we are going to have an incomes policy without some sort of control of prices and profits will certainly not get the results he believes an incomes policy might give.  there is no real indication that the Government are prepared to do this.</P>
      <P>With regard to prices, I do not think I should deal at length with them in this debate because next Tuesday and Wednesday, we shall have a general debate on the economic situation at the present time and it will be more appropriate to deal with prices on that debate.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Government are entirely blameless in what they describe as leap-frogging in the salaries of certain grades, particularly in the Civil Service.  Their recent record on prices is not good and, with all due respect to Deputy O'Higgins, I do not think the Fine Gael Party were particularly vocal about price control in the past 12 months, certainly not in the Dáil.  I must confess I was not at many of their election meetings, but we were ridiculed for asking, at a time when it was proper to ask, that there should be some form of price control. I remember the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, saying he did not believe price control could be operated; he did not believe it was desirable to have price control except in times of emergency, and nobody has talked about an emergency even yet.</P>

      <P>If that had been done in the spring of 1964, or if the Government had even created some sort of atmosphere with regard to prices, I do not think we would now have the situation we appear to have in relation to incomes and to prices.  Since the introduction of the turnover tax when it was necessary to exercise some form of control, since the National Wage Agreement providing for a 12 per cent increase was effected, if the Government even then changed the attitude they maintained up to July last year, I do not think we would have had the situation we now have, because every Minister, including the Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce said, and maybe believed, that free competition in prices would ensure that they would not rise too steeply.</P>
      <P>The second paragraph of this motion says:</P>
      <P>Congress considers that an acceptable incomes policy must not only adjust the total volume of increased demand to the total volume of increased national output but must have as its primary objective a just distribution of income.  To this end Congress calls for an examination of long-term policy concerning the distribution of incomes which materially affects the form and character of our society. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not accept the implications in the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i>  We do not agree to apportionment in the manner described in that White Paper.  We believe that in the distribution of the wealth of the country regard should be had to the numbers in the various sectors and that consideration should be given to <Col N="1045" /> the size of the population working in these various sectors.</P>
    <P>When we talk about an incomes policy and think of future adjustments of wages, we do not believe that lowly paid workers should have increases given on the wages they now have.  We do not believe that lowly paid workers should be given just a percentage increase on what they now have.  If that were so, lowly paid workers in the rural areas and lowly paid workers in clerical employment would never have any sort of an income that would enable them to meet the ordinary expenses that people in families have from week to week and from year to year.</P>
    <P>As far as an incomes policy is concerned, we believe it should mean a re-distribution, particularly for those in the lower income brackets, and more particularly for those who are dependent on social welfare benefits.  We are glad to say that this year in the Budget the Minister made some move to try to ensure that the level of payment to these people will be improved. We trust it will be continued.</P>
    <P>We can go along with Deputy O'Higgins when he says that an incomes policy should include incomes other than from wages or from salaries. It must apply not only to wages and to salaries but to profits from industry, profits, If there may be such, from agriculture, and profits from rents.  There is no use in thinking in terms of one, two or three sections of the community. If it is an incomes policy, it must be applied to all sections in the community.</P>
    <P>Implied in a discussion on a motion such as this is that the National Wage Agreement has not been successful.  I believe, and the evidence is there, that it worked, in the main.  I do not say it worked 100 per cent but in the vast majority of cases, the National Wage Agreement worked.  It is not generally appreciated even yet that the National Wage Agreement, concluded in the month of January, 1964, did not preclude claims for adjustment of hours or for service pay and did not preclude special consideration being given to lowly paid workers.  If anybody is under the impression that this was to <Col N="1046" /> be a 12 per cent increase and no more, he did not read the agreement properly. If the agreement was faulty, advantage was not taken of that, because it was recognised to be faulty by the trade union movement.  That agreement was subscribed to by the trade union movement, knowing that they could make special claims in the matter of the adjustment of hours or for service pay, and particularly for lower paid workers.  Even in the matter of claims for adjustment of hours or service pay, that clause in the agreement was availed of for a very limited number.</P>
    <P>When there is a strike or a threat of a strike, people get hot and bothered about the trade union movement and even in recent times when we had strikes for service pay or in an effort to bring up the wages of lowly paid workers, the impression of many people was that the National Wage Agreement was being contravened.  I think the employers will agree that as far at the national agreement was concerned, it was deemed to be a success. It was the first time that there was a national agreement in the sense that it obtained for a particular period, and all of us would like to see a continuation of such agreements between employers and the trade union movement. It was a contribution of the trade union movement to stability, but again, as has been said and as we have said many times, the 12 per cent which the bulk of them obtained as a result of this National Wage Agreement was eaten into to the extent of ten or 11 per cent because prices got out of control.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, in any case, that this tribunal will solve the problem that has been described by the Minister. This will go some way towards antagonising those who are supposed to be catered for in it.  The machinery is not perfect and I do not think any machinery in industrial relations can be perfect, unless there is goodwill and understanding between the two parties, and that, at all levels.  I do not think we should attempt in any manner to do away with the idea of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion in the Minister's speech that the Labour Court <Col N="1047" /> should be extended to include the Civil Service and the other organisations he mentioned in his speech. There are, however, some questions the Minister has left unanswered in what I consider to be a pretty brief speech.  He spoke about leap-frogging and this seems to be the general criticism against the different grades in the Civil Service in their seeking to improve their salaries.  This leap-frogging situation arose out of the deferment of the eighth round of wage increases until the ninth round had been negotiated by the trade union movement generally.  The official side, both in the Civil Service and in local government, deferred for far too long the settlement of the eighth round claims, so that although there was no actual leap-frogging, there was all the appearance of leap-frogging because of the deferment of the eighth round settlements. I wonder how many in the Civil Service and in the local government service were so patient for so long in the matter of the time they had to wait in order to have their claims under the eighth round settled.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not very clear as to the composition of the tribunal.  In his speech he mentions one specific person or one specific group who might be included in it.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Invitations to act on the tribunal have not, of course, been issued at this stage but it would be my wish to have the tribunal drawn from the Labour Court with some additional members, including in that number an economist. </P>
    <P>That certainly does not give us an idea of the type of person or what sectors of the economy will be included in the tribunal.  Perhaps the Minister would clear that up in his reply.</P>
    <P>It is not clear either what the tribunal is going to do, apart from some investigation it may make.  Can evidence be given before this tribunal? Will the trade unions and staff associations be entitled to present evidence to it?  The Minister might also let us know what specific grade or grades are to be subjected to the inquiry and whether or not the grades extend <Col N="1048" /> beyond the clerical officer or the Civil Service executive officer.</P>
    <P>This seems to be a job evaluation. How it is going to be done I do not know, but if it a job evaluation, surely evidence should be accepted from those engaged in the job being evaluated?  The Minister might also tell us what will happen when the tribunal reports.  I assume that the report will go to him.  Is it to be given the force of legislation?  Is the report to be presented to the official side and to the trade union staff side?  The Minister will have to be more specific about the proposals for this tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that as far as my Party are concerned, we reject this idea, firstly, because it creates a standstill in respect of certain employees, and secondly, it asks employers outside the Civil Service to impose a standstill.  It appears to me to be the thin edge of the wedge to do away with conciliation and arbitration. We know the history of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to wages and salaries and with regard to control by the Government.  We reject that and therefore we are voting against this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been amazed at the way in which both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Corish have been trying to have it both ways.  They have both been criticising the Government because they say they lacked decision, that they have not been able to act radically enough; yet they both reject absolutely any question of final control of wages and salaries and both commit themselves absolutely to the support of an arbitration agreement. Deputy O'Higgins referred to the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> of some years ago and stated that it was inconclusive. That White Paper was simply an effort by the Government to influence public opinion so that action would be taken voluntarily by those who were in a position to do so.  That policy was adopted rather than having a compulsory wage freeze or a wage standstill, a prices standstill or anything else.  If the Government were wrong, I should like to hear from some spokesman of Fine Gael or Labour what they would have done.</P>

      <P>It was at that stage, without any reference to by-elections or anything else, that the Taoiseach made an appeal for a national wages agreement so that whatever increase in wages might be freely negotiated would affect all workers equally or as nearly as possible.  That was a very fair proposal, but never let it be said that the Taoiseach at that stage called for a national wage increase of 12 per cent and never let it be said that the trade unions were behindhand in upping the ante, as it were.  Let it be clearly remembered that the original trade union demand at that stage was for a 20 per cent wage increase and now we are being criticised because wages went up and prices went up.  That was precisely what the Taoiseach was saying all along, that we must not allow wages and salaries to get ahead of production, but it was the trade union movement which was fighting for an entirely unwarranted and most unjustified all-round increase of 20 per cent.</P>

    <P>It was at that stage, and a very dangerous stage it was, that the Taoiseach insisted that the two sides of industry must come together and negotiate.  The employers started from five per cent and were forced up to seven and a half per cent and eventually up to ten per cent, while the trade unions came down from 20 per cent to 17½ per cent and to 15 per cent.  It was then, when there was a five per cent differential, that negotiations broke down and it appeared that we were going to have the law of the jungle again.  However, the Taoiseach acted with resolution, brought the two sides together and virtually insisted that agreement must be reached and again warned that an unduly high rate of national wages increase was going to be extremely dangerous.  He was regarded as being prejudiced.  There was plenty of criticism from the Labour benches that the Government were trying to hold down wages but <Col N="1051" /> now they are coming into this House and saying that we let them go up too much.  You cannot have it both ways, not even if you are a Labour Deputy.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, by mutual agreement, a national wage agreement was reached.  I would agree with Deputy Corish to this extent: it was far from being a dead loss but it was infinitely preferable to this leap-frogging which would have resulted if individual unions had been competing against one another for higher and higher increases for their members.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. F. O'Higgins tried to make great play with the subject of an incomes policy and a statement during the election by the Taoiseach; but he completely misinterpreted the whole matter.  What the Taoiseach said, even according to the quotation the Deputy gave, was that complete control of income and salaries was impossible and had never been achieved except in Communist countries.  Fine Gael, in their famous statement, are dithering over whether they would like to control wages and salaries and profits.  At one time they say: &ldquo;We are going to have planning&rdquo;; the next minute they say: &ldquo;No, we must insist on the arbitration procedure,&rdquo; which they claim has been entirely due to them.  If you are going to have arbitration&mdash;and they agree it should continue, as do the Government and the Labour Party&mdash;while you have arbitration, you cannot have control.  You are leaving the door open to other factors that enter into it.  It is time Fine Gael and Labour made that perfectly clear to the public, that they are in favour of arbitration and that, if arbitration means an increase in civil servants' salaries, they are not going to criticise the Government on that account.</P>
    <P>We have never been in favour of taking that complete control over wages or prices and it is only in a period of economic difficulty that the Government have been forced to adopt the procedure set out in this motion but it should never be said that there has been a change of policy.  We have always been in favour of an incomes <Col N="1052" /> policy but not to the extent of saying: &ldquo;Your salary or wages are pegged indefinitely at that figure&rdquo;.  If that is what Fine Gael mean by economic planning and an incomes policy, let them come out in the open and say so.  If they are not prepared to say so, they should not dare to criticise the Government for adopting the policy which is now put forward.</P>
    <P>We do wish at all stages to bring public opinion with us and to have co-operation rather than compulsion.  In a time of crisis, if it should ever arise, and there is no element of crisis as yet, it might be necessary as a temporary measure to have some clamp-down like that but this is not the time to do it, and if the Opposition Parties are going to criticise us at this stage for indecision, let them state quite clearly what they would have done.  I know perfectly well that at the back of their minds they would like everybody else's salaries and wages frozen, not theirs, everybody's prices fixed, but not theirs. It is always the other fellow who is to be controlled.  But there is no such person; we are in this together, every member of the community, and what we must do at this stage is act quietly and coolly but with resolution, and that is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>That there would be criticism we anticipated from the start but if that is to come, we and the public are entitled to a far clearer indication from Fine Gael and Labour of what they would have done.  Would they have allowed wages and salaries to go up or how would they have stopped them?  Would they have allowed profits and prices to go up or how would they have stopped them?  It is very easy to say: &ldquo;We have a general policy; we are advocating this and that&rdquo; but it is only when you come down to hard facts and figures, that their policy blows wide open, and this reveals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever may be the merits or demerits of the case made by the Minister and by Members of <Col N="1054" /> the House for the establishment of a tribunal to inquire into and to fix wages and emoluments of clerical grades in State and semi-State bodies, I cannot understand why this inquiry now is confined only to the clerical grades in those bodies.  I should like the Minister to explain why it is specifically mentioned in the motion that the tribunal will be limited to inquiries into the clerical grades in the Civil Service and why, for example, it will not include administrative and executive grades also.</P>
      <P>Only in recent months by question and answer here did we discover that status increases had been granted to the higher grades in the Civil Service. Status increases carried with them for most workers, whether clerical, manual, executive or administrative, in my opinion, something that was rather obnoxious and particularly so to manual workers who believe that everybody's status was higher than theirs.  In the light of the fact that status increases were granted to civil servants without the knowledge of the House, we should now be told by the Minister why the terms of reference of the tribunal are limited to clerical grades.</P>
      <P>With the answers we got to questions about civil servants' status increases recently there was some revealing Information.  Personally, I had believed that any civil servant, whether clerical, administrative, or executive was a full-time employee of the State.  In answer to questions in the House, it was discovered that quite a number of them were drawing quite reasonable amounts as directors of State-sponsored bodies.  I think the Minister should explain now why we should confine the terms of reference of the tribunal to the clerical grades only.  I want to make it quite clear, as one who has two brothers in the Civil Service, that I am raising this matter because I believe the clerical grades are being made scapegoats here.  If the Minister will say to me that he is prepared to leave this inquiry open to all grades in the Civil Service and the State-sponsored bodies, he will find some measure of agreement with what he proposes to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil and the country will be confused by the terms of the motion which we are discussing here this evening.  They will possibly be not so confused as to what is behind the motion, the intention behind it and the effort to use this tribunal towards a particular end.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiry into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(1)  the relativities that are appropriate between the rates of remuneration payable to recruitment clerical grades in the employment of the principal State-sponsored bodies, </P>
      <P>and it goes on to name a number of State-sponsored bodies.  It appears to me immediately that if there is a case for inquiry into the relative levels of salary payable in State-sponsored bodies, it has only dawned on the Minister to have such an examination carried out at a time when the Government are seeking the co-operation of all the people, at a time when he has admitted that the Government assessment of the economic and financial situation given before the election was very wide of the mark and within a few months of a period when the Government spokesmen were intimating to everybody that this economy is a private economy and that they were not interested or in favour of such things as price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few months later, they changed their ideas to some extent and introduced a form of price control through a Bill passed through this House.  Now they say that there is a case for inquiry into the relative salaries of the clerical recruitment grades.  Is this not purely a device to interfere with the normal negotiating procedures in respect of many thousands of citizens of this country?  This motion affects not only those employed in the State and semi-State undertakings in respect of whom settlements have been made within the past 12 months.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether it <Col N="1056" /> also affects the case of those in respect of whom conciliation and arbitration machinery is now in operation.  It appears to me that such is the position.</P>
    <P>To this end, there is a statement from the Minister that the conciliation and arbitration machinery to which he and this House are parties has proved unsuitable.  To whom is it unsuitable? Is it unsuitable to the parties engaged in these proceedings?  Is it unsuitable to the clerical officers employed by the Government or to the Government themselves?  Is this machinery, established only within the past two years after a prolonged period of seeking its establishment in respect of local authority officers, now to be considered unsuitable or are the many thousands of officials affected now to be denied for some unspecified period the use of that machinery?</P>
    <P>The motion goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the employment of the principal State-sponsored bodies, including Aer Lingus Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, and to corresponding recruitment grades other than departmental grades in the civil service and the service of the local authorities. </P>
    <P>Is it proposed under this tribunal to examine the relative salary levels of recruitment grades and in the meantime to impose a standstill on existing grades, while, at the same time, departmental grades can go ahead?  Are principal officers and secretaries of Departments to be divorced from this examination?  What I would like to know is how long this operation is going to take.  It appears from the wording of the motion and the information given so far that a job evaluation is to be carried out in a large number of recruitment grades in the State, semi-State and State-sponsored bodies.  It would be interesting to know how long it would take to do a thorough job of evaluation.  How long will it take to examine carefully all aspects of the work of a clerical officer in the Civil Service and the work of a Grade A clerical officer in <Col N="1057" /> the Electricity Supply Board?  It will have to examine the respective educational requirements for recruitment, the opportunities for promotion, the individual responsibility.  If that exercise were carried out in respect of only one grade of officers in two types of employment, on the lines usually adopted for job evaluation, it would take months.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that qualified secondary and vocational teachers who are nationals of Ireland and who have had suitable teaching experience in Northern Ireland or Britain should on returning to teach here, be given credit on a basis commensurate with their services in these areas for the purpose of computing salary payable by the Department of Education, and that similar credit should be given to those who have already returned.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy P. Byrne). </P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last night, I had referred to the fact that the Minister had thought it wise that officers of his Department should go abroad and gain experience in the methods of education being pursued in other countries, the methods available for the promotion of language, the study and treatment of children, and so on.  For some time the Minister and his Department have been encouraging teachers to go abroad.  This is a clear indication that the experience so gained is a very valuable asset in the matter of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had also suggested that the Minister need have no fear that the three aims which he has set himself in encouraging Irish graduates to take service abroad will in any way upset the balance between the number of teachers going to Africa and the <Col N="1058" /> countries enumerated last night and the number going to Britain.</P>
    <P>I also suggested that the number of teachers likely to return to this country to take up service here would be rather small, that the experience the Minister has gained, short though it may be, in regard to the return of teachers from Northern Ireland does not lead one to believe that the number who would return would be in any way embarrassing. I am sure the Minister will agree that it would be considerations other than those of finance which would prompt graduates to return to this country from teaching service in England inasmuch as remuneration in all branches of the teaching profession is higher in England than it is here. One factor which might operate to induce teachers to return to this country is the desire to bring up their families in the atmosphere prevailing here.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, it is reasonable to suggest that the Minister should extend to persons returning to service here the same facilities in regard to remuneration as they would have if they had given all their service in this country.  As I have said, the number would be very small and the price we would have to pay would be comparatively small, having regard to the fact that the experience these persons would have gained abroad could be used to our advantage.  There should be no difference in treatment as between persons coming from Northern Ireland and persons coming from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter very seriously.  In accepting the motion, the Minister will be acting not only in the interests of ordinary justice but in the national interest because the advantage to be gained by employing teachers who have had experience abroad will more than compensate for the amount of money involved in recognising their services abroad for salary purposes. The fact that the Minister has recognised service in the Six Counties is an indication that he considers that that recognition is due to the persons concerned. I welcome that and hope the Minister will accept the motion in the <Col N="1059" /> spirit that such acceptance will confer a benefit on the country as well as on teachers who elect to return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief intervention in the debate for the purpose of getting clarification, if I can, on a few matters that clearly emerge.  It would appear that since this motion was put down, the Minister and his Department have to some extent acquiesced in principle to it. While they have surrendered to the views expressed in the motion on a geographical basis, I cannot understand the underlying principle expressed by the Minister in so far as the test to be applied is what is good for the educational system as a whole.  I take it the Minister means the educational system here and the advancement of education in this country generally.  If we are to receive back on a basis advantageous to them persons with experience in Northern Ireland and in the emerging countries of Africa and the South American countries named, I do not see why those with experience in Great Britain are left out.  They appear to be the only people who have been left out.  It must be clearly understood that by and large, when persons qualified to teach in a secondary school or a vocational school go to Great Britain to take up employment, most of them are largely compelled to do so by reason of circumstances obtaining at home&mdash;the fact that there are not enough places to absorb our graduates and our qualified people from technical centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should they, if they want to come back at a time which appears opportune to them&mdash;largely when a vacancy occurs at home&mdash;be restricted in any way because they work in Great Britain rather than in Northern Ireland, Africa or South America?  I cannot see why the distinction is made.  That question may be pertinently asked, having regard to the Minister's statement that the overall consideration is what is good for the educational system here.  If he means by that that people with experience gained in Northern Ireland, Africa or South America can bring back something <Col N="1060" /> good for the system here, whereas people coming back with teaching experience in Great Britain would not make a similar contribution, I should like some further clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>This question has been exciting the attention of Deputies on all sides of the House from time to time over a great number of years.  They have received representations from people in these categories who are anxious to get the appropriate increment when they return here.  Indeed, people who have already come back at sacrifices to themselves should benefit accordingly. If we are to be sincere in our approach to education in this country &mdash;this is where the Minister will have to make up his mind, as well as on other problems&mdash;we cannot afford to be seeking education on the cheap.  If people are to come back from Great Britain with the advantage of their experience there and are to be precluded from giving us the benefit of that experience because they cannot get suitable remuneration here, then I think our stated objectives with regard to education as being one of our top priorities can be assessed disadvantageously from the point of view of administration on a sincere basis.</P>
    <P>In supporting this motion, I wish to say quite clearly that I see no reason for precluding Irish people from Great Britain, while at the same time allowing people from Northern Ireland, who are teaching under the same system of education, to come back here on a more beneficial basis.  Why would it be advantageous to the general system to allow people from Northern Ireland back and keep out people with experience in Great Britain ?  It is illogical, fallacious, not founded on the principle suggested by the Minister that the overall good of the educational system here is the prime consideration.</P>
    <P>My interpretation of the position is this.  In Great Britain, there is a large number of our graduates and possibly an equally large number of our trained technical and vocational teachers.  As the advantages we seek in this motion might well attract a great number of <Col N="1061" /> them to come back, it might upset the supply and demand here and might make a considerable inroad on that part of the Exchequer available for educational purposes.  If that is the position, it should be stated.  I do not think many would come back from Britain.  Of those forced to go, many known to me have made up their minds to stay.  Emigration at the beginning was to them distasteful, but having gone there and having worked under good conditions at good remuneration and having settled down in Great Britain, they are unlikely to come back, particularly when their families are being educated under a different system and involving matters which might be different here.</P>
    <P>Younger people would come back and we should try to get them back while they are still unmarried or while they have families still young enough to start their education here.  I do not think the older people would make any great rush to come back.  If a young man or woman in Great Britain is anxious to come back, he should be given some measure of compensation commensurate with the advantages enjoyed by his colleagues who did not have to go away.  The Minister will have to give a better reason for precluding those of our people teaching in Great Britain.  It is not good enough to set up a distinction and say that allowing our teachers back from other places is consistent with the good of our educational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education have already to deal with the problem caused by a bulge in the population of young people in this country which is increasing demands for space in national schools.  We are advised by people apparently in a position to know that we can anticipate an increase in the population of this country during the next decade of something in the region of 400,000 persons.  Most of these will be young people, the children of the children born in the immediate post-war birth rate bulge.  At present we are planning our own economic and social affairs in expectation of that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> To ignore that population development in the educational field will breed disaster in educational affairs in the next two or three decades.  That is why we appeal to the Minister to remove the prohibition which now applies to Irish people teaching in Britain.  I call it a prohibition because to impose a serious loss of income on a person who returns to teach in Ireland is for all practical purposes to prohibit that person from returning.  There are difficulties than any person returning from teaching in Britain will have to overcome, independent of the salary aspect. A person who has been teaching abroad will have lost familiarity with Irish and having regard to the importance attached to proficiency in Irish, it may be difficult for a person who has been teaching in Britain to get a job here.  That will be a deterrent to some extent.</P>
    <P>However, the need for teachers in mathematics, physics and other modern scientific subjects is so great that we are unable to meet the scarcity. In Dublin at the moment, where there is, for a number of reasons, a certain concentration in educational matters on the scientific field, we are seriously short of teachers with mathematical and scientific skills.  As Deputy Byrne pointed out, about 30 per cent of our mathematic teachers have honours degrees.  The others have purely pass degrees.  That is not good enough.  We have not been giving the best to our students for a number of years.  If by the adoption of this motion he can improve things in the slightest degree, it is well worth doing even that small amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In all humility, I can say I am the possessor of honours degrees, but they are certainly not in mathematics.  I would abhor having to try to understand it, much less teach it.  That is the sorry situation we have at the moment.  We have 70 per cent of the mathematics teachers without an honours degree in mathematics. That is not a healthy situation.  On the other hand, it is reasonable to expect that among Irish teachers in Britain you may have a number with skill in mathematics who would be happy to return here.  I think we should encourage them to return by making it clear they will be at no monetary disadvantage by so doing.  We have more than one million Irish people or people of Irish descent in Britain at present. Irish people in Britain have tended to be clannish.  I suppose they will always be so.  There are quite a number of educational establishments staffed almost exclusively by Irish men and women.  One does not wish to deny the Irish in Britain the skill and knowledge these teachers can bring to them, but it is an indication of the large number of Irish people in Britain already.  It is fair to estimate that at least some of these people would return if we removed the incremental barrier we impose on them at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has over-simplified the problem.  He fears that the adoption of this motion would lead to mass emigration of teachers.  Maybe I am going further than the Minister.  The Minister said it would lead to a significant and damaging flow of teachers from the number available here.  I do not think that is so.  There is a natural reluctance on the part of most people to leave their native land.  Teachers, who are associated with it in their training and background, perhaps have an even stronger inducement to remain at home than to go.  I do not believe it will lead to the situation the Minister suspects may develop&mdash;that teachers will be unable to get appointments here unless they can show they have had teaching experience abroad. I doubt very much indeed if that is <Col N="1064" /> ever going to happen under the structure and management of our educational system.  In fact, the reverse is likely.  The advantages will still go to the people who stay at home.  I think we have nothing to fear from allowing this small share of justice to Irish teachers in Britain.</P>
    <P>Supposing the Minister's worst fears were to materialise if the purposes of the motion were implemented.  Could the Minister do anything about it?  I think he could.  He could apply the brake immediately.  He could revert to the present system.  The effect of that would be to stop immediately the flow the Minister fears.  I do not like comparing teachers with omnibuses but we are all aware how long it took the Department of Industry and Commerce to change from the rigid policy they had for years of not allowing outside tourist buses in here because of the damaging consequences for Irish transport interests and the Irish tourist trade.  At the end of a very long, dark night, they changed their mind, and since then they have been thanking the Lord for giving them the wisdom to see the light.  I believe very much the same will happen in the educational sphere.</P>
    <P>If we put an end to this unfair system, which is to our disadvantage, we will have every reason to be grateful for seeing the light and we will have in our educational system something the Minister appears to approve of&mdash;a corps of teachers with service in other educational systems.  That is something worth trying to get.  Without speaking disparagingly of the developing countries, it is fair to expect we would have more to gain from teachers who taught in Britain than from teachers who are teaching in undeveloped countries, where the educational standards are very much lower than what we have here.</P>
    <P>To develop the line taken by Deputy Lindsay, rather than fearing we will have poorer quality teaching by allowing the emigrants come home, I think the reverse will be the case.  We are likely to gain a great deal more from them than we would gain from any corps of teachers we have at the <Col N="1065" /> moment from the undeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, Deputy Byrne rightly directed attention to the obligation on countries who are members of the European Community to have a free exchange of teachers and not have any restrictive practices as far as teachers are concerned.  If the Government are serious about the ultimate intention of being associated with Europe, then we ought to put our house in order in relation to educational matters.  We should ensure now that this restrictive practice we apply is removed.  Thereby we will be conditioning ourselves for the greater educational world into which we will have to move and into which we will move, I believe, with significant advantage to ourselves.</P>
    <P>There are a number of religious orders which send a considerable supply of their members to Britain. One such order is the Irish Christian Brothers.  Is it not peculiar that such an order may send a mathematics graduate to Liverpool to teach and, if he teaches for five or ten years and then comes back, he will not be given the same remuneration as if he stayed at home?  The order is thereby the poorer.  All this shows a dual approach to the problem of education and the problem of staffing our schools.</P>
    <P>I would beg the Minister to open his mind to this matter.  I think he indicated yesterday he had a certain sympathy for the proposal but he fears the consequences of it.  I would ask him to take his courage in his hands. If, in the light of experience, he finds he is justified in his fears, he can take immediate steps to return to the present situation.  I do not think anything really significant will have been lost by the attempt, but I think a great deal can be gained.</P>

      <P>I speak on this matter as an ex-teacher who left university in 1925 and started his teaching career in Northern Ireland, ultimately coming back here under the same discipline.  Since I left University College, Galway with my degree, I have had plenty of experience in secondary and vocational <Col N="1066" /> schools.  I am now a member of an education committee and we find it very difficult to get graduates.  They are attracted elsewhere because of the high salaries.  The point I want to make is that, if we have an international exchange of teachers and no educational boundaries, the people who take advantage of the discipline afforded by other countries should not be those at just graduate level. What does the average B.A. or B.Comm. learn when he goes to England immediately after graduation? What extra will he learn there? If he goes to do a post-graduate course, he will come back with enhanced learning, but, so far as the average graduate is concerned, all we do is rob ourselves of potentially good teachers.  That is what this motion will do.  I am in sympathy with the motion, but not at the graduate level.</P>
      <P>Some speaker commented that one learns nothing in an undeveloped country.  One learns a great deal.  One smells and touches and tastes the ideas of these countries.  There are numbers of people who go voluntarily to these countries simply to know, to taste, to smell the things that are happening there, and they come back better teachers.  They bring with them the benefit of that discipline.  There is nothing new to bring back from England.  Northern Ireland is similar to ourselves.  There is that to be said for it.  They are our own people.  The Christian Brothers who teach in Manchester, in Liverpool and Glasgow are all the time under the same discipline.  They are turning out good citizens.  While I sympathise with the motion, I am in complete agreement with the Minister in his attitude, and that agreement springs from my own practical experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  Most of the arguments for and against have already been advanced. I support it having in mind primarily the urgent need there is to extend our educational facilities.  We, in the Labour Party, and I believe we have the support of all Parties in this, believe that education at all levels should be freely available to every <Col N="1067" /> child capable of following that education. We believe that every boy and girl is capable of benefiting by post-primary education of one kind or another.  In order to achieve this education for our young people, we need all the teachers we can get.  The Minister told us recently that he proposes to raise the school leaving age to 15.  We congratulate him on that. Raising the school leaving age to 15 will immediately create a greater demand not for national school teachers but for post-primary teachers.  There would be no point in raising the school leaving age to 15 if that merely resulted in forcing boys and girls to remain in the national school for another year.  Post-primary education must be readily available if they are to benefit, as we hope they will benefit, by an additional year at school.  We will need all the post-primary teachers we can get.  We will need the best teachers.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that great numbers of our graduates emigrate.  They emigrate because the starting salary here is too low.  I was rather appalled to hear the Minister argue yesterday that the passage of this motion would result in more post-primary teachers emigrating and settling abroad.  This motion is designed to remove the injustice which causes these teachers now to emigrate and settle abroad. There is no proper incentive to them to return and teach in their own country.  If a sufficient incentive is offered, these teachers will return home.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to revise his attitude and to give every incentive to our nationals who have gone abroad to teach to return to their own country and make their services available here to the community which, in the first instance, subsidised their education.  I do not blame them for not doing that at the moment.  Financial considerations preclude them from doing so.  If they are offered the incentive this Fine Gael motion offers them, then they will return.  We will need them if we intend to expand our educational facilities to the point the Minister envisages in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> I congratulate the Minister on the attitude he has taken towards education since he became Minister.  I believe he is sincere in his desire to extend our educational facilities.  Our standards are as high possibly as they are in any other country, but the extent to which our facilities cater for our children at the moment is appallingly low.  This motion is calculated to afford our teachers abroad an opportunity of returning to their own country.  We will need them if we are to make progress.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude and give this motion a trial.  I believe such a trial will prove well worth the gamble.</P>

      <P>We have had a very useful debate and it must now be quite clear to the Minister that the consensus of opinion is in favour of the motion.  I am obliged to the Minister for the detailed information he gave us yesterday in relation to the schemes of credit which operate for service in certain undeveloped countries and in Northern Ireland.  I wonder would the Minister clear up a doubt?  He said that, as far as secondary teachers coming back here are concerned, the credit is restricted to those who have worked in grammar schools in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I accept the assurance from the Minister.  Nevertheless, I am sure he will agree with me that many first-class Irish graduates worked in secondary modern schools in Britain.  The nub of the Minister's reservations about this proposal is that he is afraid that our graduates would go away and would not come back.  I want to emphasise that the inspiration for this motion on the Fine Gael side springs from direct contact with Irish teachers working in Northern Ireland and in Britain who are anxious to come back here.  The Minister, I am sure, has heard of the Tuairim organisation. This is an organisation whose membership is confined to university graduates, as far as I know, and there is a flourishing branch in London.  I have here a recent issue of their bulletin which I hope the Minister has seen. If he has not, I should be happy to make a copy of it available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The London branch of Tuairim&mdash; and there are many other branches in Britain&mdash;are concerned about this matter.  They have a committee of Irish teachers working in Britain who, if they have not already done so, are, I understand, about to make a very strong case to the Minister.  Recently they unanimously passed a motion deploring the policy of the Department of Education in regard to their members in Britain.  I am convinced that the Minister exaggerates the danger of graduates going away and not coming back, but even if the danger exists, it can be circumvented or, as Deputy Ryan has just said, the brake can be applied if the Minister finds that this is all one-way traffic.  Over and above that, the Minister must surely understand, and Deputy Lenihan must <Col N="1070" /> surely understand, that the reason these people went away in the first place was an economic one.  They went away some years ago before the Minister's predecessor decided to pay them. In their first year they go away for economic reasons and if they are paid well enough here, they will stay here and will be more than anxious to come back from Britain.</P>
    <P>At present, as I said in proposing this motion, we exploit the idealism and the dedication of the teaching profession.  Teachers in their early years are paid less than a builder's labourer.  There is parity of pay in all of the skilled trades connected with the building industry between this country and Britain.  Why should there not be parity of pay in the teaching profession?  When that state of affairs comes about, the Minister's doubts and disquiet will be resolved automatically. We are exploiting cheap labour at present as far as our young secondary teachers are concerned, and it is gravely wrong that we should continue to do so.  We are downgrading the professional status by paying them less than a builder's labourer is paid.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more to be said on the matter.  We have had a very useful debate and all of the arguments in favour of the motion have been well ventilated.  We shall be very disappointed if the Minister does not look favourably on this proposal, with whatever reservations and qualifications he may deem fit to introduce, and cover particularly, on compassionate grounds, the cases I have mentioned previously.  The 15 or 20 Irish teachers in London who constitute the Tuairim Committee of which I spoke are nearly all married persons with children.  We have a tremendous obligation to our emigrants to try to make it easy for them to return here.  On the understanding that the Minister will do what he said he would do, namely, take another look at this matter in the future, we are withdrawing this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health service is inadequate to the needs of the people, and that in particular many injustices arise in the administration of the medical card system, and calls on the Government without further delay to establish a comprehensive no means test health service with a free choice of doctor for all sections of the community. </P>
      <P>This motion stands in my name and the names of a number of Labour Party Deputies.  In moving it, I want to state that the Labour Party tabled a similar motion about three years ago which received the support of a number of Deputies who had been returned to this House as Independent Deputies. In agreeing with our motion in principle, they submitted an amendment that Dáil Éireann should agree to set up a Select Committee of the House on the health services with a view to reporting back to Dáil Éireann within six months.  That was passed by Dáil Éireann without opposition from the then Minister or his Cabinet. The Committee was set up and they found that the volume of evidence was so great&mdash;practically every organisation in the country was interested&mdash; that they had to report back to Dáil Éireann in an interim report.  They reported that they were completely unable to listen to all the evidence, never mind sift and correlate the evidence that was forthcoming, and they asked for an extension of the period in which they were compelled by regulation to report to Dáil Éireann. That was unanimously agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, it went on and on and the volume of evidence coming in was so great that the Select Committee never made a report.  The Labour Party representatives withdrew from <Col N="1072" /> the Committee because their suggested time, by which at least amendments to the Health Act, if not a new Health Act, could have been submitted, had been reached.  The Labour Party representatives consisted of Dr. Noel Browne, Deputy Mullen and myself. I believe that the Fine Gael representatives on the Committee followed our example, and that finished the Select Health Committee.</P>
    <P>I am relating this to the motion because the Committee was set up as a direct result of a similar motion by the Labour Party at that time.  We are now putting forward this motion, not with the hope that we will achieve amendments by a simple motion like this but in order to give the Minister an opportunity of making a statement about his intentions as Minister.  He has made many statements outside the House.  I remember quite well on the day his appointment was announced commenting that I was glad that a fresh view was now coming to the position.  I was glad of a new outlook on health services and I said that I believed, as I still believe, that the Minister has a fresh view and is in tune with modern needs in regard to health services.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that this motion has been tabled, to give the Minister an opportunity of stating to this House, and through the House to the whole country, what proposals there are for an improvement in the health services. It goes without saying that the health services, as framed in the 1953 Health Act, are now considered to be totally inadequate for the needs of our people.  Not only are they inadequate but the administration of the Health Act is outdated and antiquated.  Under it, a relieving officer or a home assistance officer is the beginning and end of the right of a person to secure medical services.  As the investigating officer, he has the final decision.  No matter what else may be said about the county manager having the final decision, the fact is that the county manager acts on a report of a home assistance officer who makes an investigation, which may be either adequate or inadequate, and who <Col N="1073" /> could have, and possibly sometimes had, a biased mind due to an inadequate investigation.  Once the county manager signs a refusal notice, there is no right of appeal to anyone but the same man.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to break the regulations dealing with evidence given at this Select Committee on the Health Services but anyone who served on that Committee will agree with me that practically 99 per cent of the representatives of the organisations which gave evidence, and they were varied, gave evidence that showed they were conscious of defects of varying degrees in all forms of our health services which were examined by the Committee, whether it was in regard to the lower income group, or the middle income group, or the fringe group which could be brought in and still be in the higher income group. The loudest protestations came from that section of the population who felt they were entitled to medical cards, those who would be classed in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>I have tried to summarise briefly the position and I am quite sure that the Minister has examined the evidence given and, from his own personal knowledge, will be able to agree with me that the defects I am enumerating are the most blatant ones, the ones about which the lower income group complain most.  They are but a few of the defects which I or anybody else could enumerate but time would not permit it and it would be unfair to use so much time enumerating in full all the defects the lower income group feel exist in our present health services.</P>
    <P>One grievance is in regard to how indefinite is the right to a medical card.  It is based on a means test of some sort but no definite means test is laid down.  It is simply based on an old British dispensary regulation that if you cannot afford medical services for yourself and your family by your lawful earnings, then you are entitled to a medical card.  That may not be the actual wording but it is the actual position and that is what it means That is what the 1953 Act meant and that is what the old British Dispensary Act meant the right to a dispensary <Col N="1074" /> service and it was accepted on that basis in 1953.  But there was no definite, clearcut knowledge as to who is or who is not entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>For instance, an old age pensioner who at that time received 37/6, or who earlier received a lesser amount, did not necessarily come within the scope of being able to provide for himself and his dependants, even though he qualified under the very strict means test that relates to social welfare.  It may seem amazing but it is really true because under a ministerial regulation &mdash;and unfortunately, in the 1953 Act the Minister got power to make regulations&mdash;those investigating the means were permitted to correlate the earnings of all those residing in the house or under the roof of the applicant, and should it turn out that sons or daughters or other people residing there coming within a certain relationship, had means that could be so added together as to reach a certain figure, not only did it disqualify them for medical cards in their own right but in many cases it disqualified old age pensioners for such a card.  If that be doubted, it will be my privilege to submit proof not only in respect of my own county but, I am convinced, in respect of every constituency in the country.</P>
    <P>Another great defect that was and is being felt is the variation in decisions as between one health authority and another.  You might qualify in the Tipperary health authority for a card because the county manager there or his advisers&mdash;more probably the latter&mdash;took a distinct and separate view from that taken in Waterford, or <i>vice versa.</i>  One of the most liberal health authorities, in fact, was the Waterford Health Authority.  I do not know the actual percentage of people covered by medical cards in Waterford county and city at the moment &mdash;it is one of the few combined health authorities&mdash;but at one time it was one of the leading health authorities and more liberal than a great many others.  Yet, even there, I, as a representative, have been continually pressed by letters and personal requests, and on my submissions to <Col N="1075" /> the county manager, a good number of cases that had been ruled out for medical services have been redressed, very often without any explanation of the change.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is wrong that because somebody does not get a Deputy or member of the health authority to plead his case and to put forward facts that perhaps he without a knowledge of procedure and how to state a case properly would omit, should be deprived of a service that is free by right under the 1953 Health Act.  Variation in decisions is one of the defects that are causing the canker to grow in the minds of the lower income group throughout the country.  Much of the value of the 1953 Act has been lost because the Minister was permitted to make regulations by order&mdash;in other words, to do things without reference to the Dáil&mdash;that could and did amend the Health Act or take away the value of it that was apparent in 1953. One of those regulations in which I was particularly interested is that permitting an investigating officer to lump together the total income of the family residing in one house.</P>
    <P>In 1953 when the Health Act came before the Dail, I was keenly interested in this Act which was brought in by a Fianna Fáil Government and, with the support of the Labour Party, passed through the House.  I was interested in the fact that a worker who was 16 years or over was not a dependant of the applicant father, even though he resided with him.  For a number of years after 1953 that son had, and exercised, the right to claim a medical card on his own, provided he, as an individual, was eligible within a means test of an indefinite amount never yet clearly stated but in respect of which each county apparently got some instruction from someone as to the limit to be fixed.  In my county it was estimated at that time that a single man was entitled to a medical card if his earnings were less than £5 a week.  If he had a wife, you would add £1 and for each child under 16 and not working, you added a further 10/-.  If, then, his earnings came under the limit, he was entitled to a card.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> Then there was a complete change. Fathers of households and single sons and daughters living with them were all refused medical cards, even though for a number of years they had enjoyed the privilege of being classified in the lower income group.  Because of a ministerial regulation which never came before the House&mdash;which could have been examined but no opportunity was given to discuss it&mdash; the combined earnings of the family not only succeeded in putting the sons and daughters out of benefit for medical services, that is, free dispensary services, but the fathers, the breadwinners and in some cases old age pensioners were disqualified also. I think there is a proposal in connection with the middle income group to be made in the new Bill which indicates that the Minister has seen the injustice of this.  Lest I seem prejudiced, I should say that later an allowance was made by which the first £100 of earnings of sons and daughters could be ignored.  Very often the regulations still deprive breadwinners or heads of households of the right to claim medical services.</P>
    <P>One of the main injustices, in my opinion&mdash;and this point has been and will continue to be made by various people and organisations&mdash;is the failure to have a right of appeal.  Should a person apply for a medical card and be turned down, he gets a curt note from the secretary of the health authority acting on behalf of that authority&mdash;which is really the manager because the elected members of the health authority have no power in regard to giving a medical card.  It will be and is the duty of the manager. If the manager turns you down, he does so on the advice of officials and I suggest that the only officials who make these investigations are the relieving officers or the home assistance officers, men who are unqualified on any ground other than that they are paid officials of the authority, men without any qualifications and with all the bias of small closed communities. A person can be deprived of something which this House has given to him on the advice of one of these men and he has no right of appeal to <Col N="1077" /> anybody other than the person who refuses him.  He cannot go to the courts or to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The granting of an appeal to the Minister would put an end to hasty decisions on eligibility.  I have found, in dealing with all Ministers of all Governments, that when a complaint comes to ministerial level and an investigation is ordered, the people at the lower level working for a local authority are most careful that such investigations will not show that their own investigation of any particular case had been negligent or biased.  A right of appeal to the Minister would be an invaluable safeguard of the rights of the people.  The evidence given before the Select Committee on Health Services by various organisations throughout the country went to prove that fact.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is that it was the unanimous suggestion of all who made representation before that Select Committee that there should be a choice of doctor, where such choice was available.  We heard much from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil when the 1953 Health Act was going through the House about doctor-patient relationship, of the importance of people having confidence in the medical doctor who attended them.  The phrase &ldquo;doctor-patient relationship&rdquo; is a high-sounding one.  Many of the people in the lower income group will not understand the significance of it but all of them will be able to tell you that they would prefer Dr. A. to Dr. B. or that they have no confidence in Dr. C.  If you enjoy a medical card, you will find that you will have to accept a doctor whose appointment you had nothing to do with and it does not matter whether you like him or not. It does not matter what his manner is like or whether you consider him capable of treating you or diagnosing your illness.</P>
    <P>The limit to which you are entitled under the 1953 Health Act, if you have a medical card, is the choice of one dispensary doctor.  In many parts of the country, particularly in the west of Ireland and in the more remote <Col N="1078" /> rural areas, that will mean that there is only one doctor within reasonable distance.  In most of the rural towns, however, there would be a choice between three or four doctors or, at the least, two or three doctors.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider amending the Health Act so that a choice of doctor will be given, where possible.  It can be so arranged that ultimately that choice can be extended to the wildest and most remote areas.</P>
    <P>That exhausts the main difficulties as seen through the eyes of those in the lower income groups who have the medical card but there are also those in the middle income groups, representing about 55 per cent of the population.  The lower income group represents about 30 per cent of the population and the higher income group about 15 per cent, which leaves 55 per cent for the middle income group.  That is more than half the population, whether their income be calculated on income or valuation level.  They also have a grievance. Again they object to the indiscriminate method by which their means are investigated.  They object to disclosure of their private lives, to the disclosure of what their sons and daughters give them in the privacy of their home.  Not only that, but they object to their sons and daughters being assessed to give them certain things, to an assessment, not of what they get, but what should be given to them by their sons and daughters.</P>
    <P>Evidence has been given that in certain counties if a parent has a ne'er-do-well son or daughter, the assessing officer will ignore the fact that such a child earns an income of £10 or £12 a week but does not give up anything.  That is not a general practice but views were expressed to the Select Committee by representatives of the relieving officers, who carry the main burden of the administration of the Act, that some of them took a different view of this matter from others in this question of decision and the decision in these cases is as vital to people in the middle income group as it is to those in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> Then there is the question of hospital expenses, leaving aside altogether the question of medical expenses.  I know of a case where a charge of £2.19.6d per day is being made in respect of a person whose income is assessed at over £800 a year.  The £2.19.6d. per day is for maintenance and medical attention as given by the hospital, completely exclusive of what the doctor will charge and the specialists' fees. There is no one in the middle income group as I know it who can afford to be sick and to pay £2.19.6d per day.  A person in the middle income group might be earning £15 a week and could not afford to pay for a dependant who might be sick at the rate of £2.19.6d per day.  The figure is not real or of practical application.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on raising the income limit from £800 to £1,200.  That reform was urgently needed.  It must come into force as quickly as possible.  The Labour Party will support the Minister in the amendment proposed but we feel that it is a stop-gap and that it is inadequate. If the Minister tells us that it is an interim measure and that he is tackling the essential things first, we will be happy to have his assurance that in the near future he will introduce a comprehensive amendment of the Health Act of 1953 or, alternatively, a new Health Bill.  If it is an improvement, we will support that improvement. Not only will we vote for that necessary health service in the House but we will vote the necessary money for it, provided we are satisfied that the burden will be placed on the shoulders best able to bear it.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that persons in an income group above £1,200 can afford to pay insurance contributions to cover health services.  I would like to point out that if in the first year or second year of a voluntary health insurance contract the insured person suffers an illness, it is quite possible that the Voluntary Health Insurance may decide that that person is a bad risk and cannot be insured or, alternatively, must pay a higher premium.  I submitted such a case to the Minister's predecessor.  The reply I got was that <Col N="1080" /> it was a matter for the directors of the Voluntary Health Insurance.  Only today I saw proposals from the Voluntary Health Insurance that will practically double the contributions.  They have indicated in a circular to members that payment by them in respect of patients in public wards&mdash;mark, public wards&mdash;will in future be at the rate of £15 per week.  I suggest that it would be better to scrap the Health Act and to introduce a scheme similar to the British Health Service, on a contributory basis.  There are only 15 per cent of the population in the higher income group.  If you include them, although I would make them pay for it, they will not avail of it.  It should be made a fully comprehensive service based on contributions by the people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I support the motion with enthusiasm. The motion reads that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health service is inadequate to the needs of the people and that, in particular, many injustices arise in the administration of the medical card system.&rdquo;  That, in effect, is the complaining part of the motion and those are sentiments which have been accepted by the country and by all Parties in this House for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1961 general election was fought on a number of issues but one of the principal issues was the inadequacy of and the defects in the Health Act, 1953.  The Fianna Fáil Party lost considerably in that election.  They lost about 80,000 votes.  They lost seven seats.  When the Seventeenth Dáil assembled here, one of the first critical divisions the Government elected as a result of that general election had to face was on a motion criticising the Health Act, 1953, and it would appear that the Government of the day accepted as a fact that the Health Act of 1953 was so defective that it could not be adequately amended because, instead of introducing amendments to the Health Act, 1953, they brought in <Col N="1081" /> an amendment to the motion of censure proposing the setting up of a Committee of this House to inquire into the health services and to report on them.</P>
    <P>That Committee, as Deputy Kyne has stated, was to report within six months, but at the end of six months the Committee asked the House for further time.  From that day, at the end of 1961, until this day, we have not heard from that Committee.  The Committee was used by the Government as an excuse for not introducing a proper health system.  The Minister's predecessor treated that Committee and this House with nothing short of contempt.  The Labour members were forced to resign from the Committee. Deputy T.F. O'Higgins submitted a comprehensive memorandum to the Committee in which he set out the proposals of this Party for health services and a health scheme.  The Minister's predecessor did not allow the Committee to deal with that memorandum.  He stated, outside that Committee and outside this House, I think at a public meeting, that he had no intention of entertaining Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion and he treated it as nonsense.  He did not propose any alternative to it.  The result was that the Fine Gael members also intimated that they could not be associated with the Committee any further, having regard to the way the Committee was being treated by the then Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>It seems to be common case that the present health services are very inadequate.  The most reprehensible element of the Act of 1953 is the health card.  The health card is the document which entitles the lower income group to free general medical services but I do not think any Deputy, any county manager or any responsible representative of a health authority will tell anybody when or in what circumstances a person is entitled to posses a health card.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> That it is expendient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:</P>
    <P> (1)  the relativities that are appropriate between the rates of remuneration payable to recruitment clerical grades in the employment of the principal State-sponsored bodies, including Aer Lingus Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, and to corresponding recruitment grades (other than departmental grades) in the civil service and the service of the local authorities, with due regard to the staffing structure and the circumstances of each employment and to the interests of the national economy.</P>
    <P>(2)  the absolute levels of pay for the grades mentioned that with due regard as aforesaid, are appropriate as the basis for the application of any future general increase in pay. </P>
    <P>&mdash;Minister for Finance. </P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I was dealing with some aspects of the work of the proposed tribunal from the point of view of the speed with which any tribunal could hope to evaluate in any responsible way or arrive at a conclusion as to what would be an appropriate salary scale for clerical workers in two different undertakings where there operate varying conditions of recruitment, varying salary scales, and where the work of the different clerical officers might differ in some degree.  If an examination were to take place of two such clerical officers on the basis of job evaluation in accordance with the accepted principles, it could extend over several months.  Yet we are told here that the tribunal is to examine the position as between semi-State and State-sponsored bodies and report back by 1st March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately it appears to me, particularly having heard the Minister's introductory statement, that there is no real determination to carry out any full-scale examination.  If that were to <Col N="1083" /> be done, it would not be a question of a period of less than four months. It could be counted in terms of years, not months.  Many people outside who are associated with the grades of employees concerned are very familiar with the process called job evaluation. Something very different is being attempted in this House.  As Deputy Corish has said, to arrive at a real conclusion, we must examine the record of this Government in their approach to salary and wage increases, their approach to the claims made from time to time by responsible organisations on behalf of workers, whether white-collared or manual.</P>
    <P>We do not have to go very far back to find what this Government's approach has been in this connection. The year 1959 is not so long ago and many people in the House will recall the attempt made by the Fianna Fáil Government then, under the guise of consideration for the economic position of the country, to impose a standstill on the legitimate aspirations of the workers to secure increased salary scales and wage rates in order to provide themselves with proper standards of living.  We know, because the facts are there, that the Government's attempt then ended in miserable failure.  They did not convince the people of the country that their intentions were in any way sincere.</P>
    <P>We recall that within a few months of the publication of the Government's high policy document, <i>Closing the Gap,</i> the then Minister for Finance stated he felt it was an opportune time to inject increased purchasing power into the community.  All this was within a few months of the attempted standstill on salaries and wages.  Even in the life of the present Dáil and immediately prior to this Dáil we can recall the publicised views of leading Government spokesmen that prices should find their own level, that as far as private enterprise was concerned, there should be the god of profit and nothing else. Yet, within a few months again, having denied over a number of years that they had any trust or belief in the efficacy of an attempt to control <Col N="1084" /> prices, they brought in a Prices Bill of sorts.</P>
    <P>In discussing this motion, we are entitled to ask whether it is, as it appears to be, another proposal to impose a standstill, to interfere with the normal processes of negotiation and arbitration.  In his speech the Minister complains that at some stage there have been adjustments in clerical officer rates following proceedings at conciliation and arbitration level.  The adjustments that have taken place followed very prolonged discussions and examinations of the cases made on behalf of the categories of workers concerned.  Those representing the employers at the conciliation and arbitration proceedings made every effort to resist the claims for increased salaries and when adjustments did take place, they were made only after a complete and thorough examination in each case.  Is this not the proper method of dealing with such claims?</P>
    <P>It would appear that that is not the view of the Minister for Finance at this stage, because he wants to stop that procedure at this point.  I do not know how many claims are outstanding at present, and the Minister did not give us any information in this regard.  The only information he gave us was that conciliation proceedings going on in respect of certain small sections would be allowed to continue. But what about conciliation and arbitration proceedings in the State-sponsored bodies?  Will they be allowed to continue?  The Minister did not say. He mentioned a small number of State-sponsored bodies, which, as Deputy Corish pointed out, represent only a minute percentage of the total number of State-sponsored bodies whose employees may be affected by this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the terms of the agreement reached for the ninth round wage adjustment.  He is aware that, apart from providing for an increase of 12 per cent, there was provision in a number of cases enabling conciliation and arbitration to take place in exceptional circumstances. In respect of all the cases cited by the Minister today, there is no doubt that the adjustments in wages and <Col N="1085" /> salaries over and above the 12 per cent were in accordance with that particular paragraph in the agreement.  The Minister must be aware that there are many other cases still open.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in general terms that it would be the intention of the tribunal to examine and report on the absolute levels of pay for the grades mentioned and that their findings shall apply to the application of any further general increase in pay. Does that mean that the tribunal will be asked, after a cursory look at the situation, to recommend in respect of each of these employments that there shall be a ceiling or floor at a particular point of time, irrespective of any other circumstances, and that that will be the basis for any further adjustments in salaries, such adjustments being related only to adjustments in the cost of living?  If that is the intention, the tribunal are being asked to do something that is impossible and something that will not be accepted by the clerical workers of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>In his speech to the House, the Minister went further.  Apart from imposing this on direct employees of the State, he indicated that the State-sponsored bodies, who normally have the right to fix the salary scales of their employees, will be asked to impose a standstill on their employees. It may be taken that there will go out to those who have paid reasonable salaries to their clerical staffs a request from the Minister for Finance in the following terms: &ldquo;No increase. There is a tribunal being set up which will decide the rates of the recruitment grades.  Until that tribunal meets and makes their decision, there shall be no increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Today I had an indication of the type of problem that will arise.  I met the Minister for Education this afternoon in relation to an application which is before his Department since 1961.  It concerns the salary scales of certain classes of clerical workers employed by vocational education committees and an application for the establishment of a conciliation and arbitration procedure under which <Col N="1086" /> these employees could have their cases argued and possibly settled.  I was told today that the Minister was sympathetic to the proposal but he was afraid it would be inappropriate to agree at present to the establishment of such machinery to deal with the legitimate claims of these people because of the tribunal proposed to be set up by the Minister for Finance. How many other workers in the public employment will be affected in a similar way?  These are the circumstances we have to take into consideration when discussing this motion.</P>
    <P>I was both amused and intrigued by Deputy Booth's contribution this afternoon and I am sorry he is not here.  I never listened to such piffle in all my life.  He is on record for years as being opposed to price control. He is certainly not a lover of the workers; he does not like the idea of their obtaining proper wages and salaries.  Nevertheless he wants to query every other Party in the House on their attitude.  The attitude of this Party has always been quite clear.  All down through the years, we have been agitating for some attempt at a planned economy.  Fianna Fáil are only recent coverts to this concept and to the need for endeavouring to plan the economy of the country in the interests of its development, industrially, commercially, agriculturally, and so on.  We are on record down the years as being in favour of locking the stable door before the horse bolts.  Fianna Fáil are now engaged in the fruitless exercise of locking the stable door long after the horse has disappeared.  That is what they did when they produced a form of price control machinery some few months back, a control which should have been introduced in March or April of 1964.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear at that stage, following on the negotiations at national level for an increase in wages and salaries, that that was the time to take steps to curb unjustified increases in prices and to establish machinery to ensure that, if stability were achieved, it would not be departed from and the position of the ordinary salary and wage earner and the small businessman would be <Col N="1087" /> protected.  Fianna Fáil made no attempt to do that.  They said quite clearly at the time that they did not believe in price control; they did not believe there was any possibility of controlling prices.  They believe there is only one way of controlling prices; let them rip.  We know what has happened in the field of house purchase since 1964.  Prices have ripped.</P>
    <P>In the middle of this year, Fianna Fáil suddenly woke up and decided they would have to do something. But the damage was done.  Now they are back to their old attitude: &ldquo;There are problems; we will settle the problems; the first thing we will do is try to secure that wage and salary earners do not get any increases; we will curb expenditure by doing our best to ensure that, in many cases, inadequate levels of salary and wages will be maintained and will continue to be maintained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think I have much more to add.  Had the Minister come to the House and said: &ldquo;I think the time has arrived for us to examine in a reasonable way the operations of the conciliation and arbitration tribunals over a period and get some report on those operations after a full and detailed examination.  In the meantime we do not propose to interfere with the good work some of these bodies are doing,&rdquo; he might well have got the sympathy of this House.  But that is not the Minister's attitude. Quite clearly, the sole purpose of this motion is to impose a standstill on salaries and wages of clerical staffs in State and semi-State employment and, it is hoped, on clerical staffs also in private employment, until March of next year, March of next year when we will be approaching the Budget. This is done in the hope that the benefits of the imposition of such a standstill order will flow over to the manual worker.  For these reasons and because this motion will interfere to a major extent with the operations of collective bargaining, we, on these benches, oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish has already given our viewpoint in relation to this proposed tribunal and our <Col N="1088" /> reasons for opposing the establishment of such a tribunal.  The substance of our criticism lies in the fact that we regard this measure, as well as other measures over the past few months, as piecemeal measures aimed at an incomes policy.  We believe the very essence of an incomes policy should be long-term planning over a period of years rather than panic measures to try to control wages at any particular time.  From the outset we have always had a suspicion, and the suspicion has been borne out by events over the past few months, that what Fianna Fáil mean by an incomes policy is a policy that concentrates on merely curbing wage increases.  The proposal to establish this tribunal abundantly bears out that suspicion.</P>
      <P>We have said repeatedly that we believe in an incomes policy which makes an honest attempt at controlling all forms of income within the State and ensures that incomes, all incomes, increase according to a definite plan. We do not accept an incomes policy which concentrates purely on wages, an incomes policy which is obsessed with the wage factor in our economy and excludes consideration of any other factor.</P>
      <P>We have been told by Fianna Fáil Ministers on many occasions that theirs is a pragmatic Party.  It appears to me their attitude on an incomes policy is pragmatic in the extreme because their policy changes from month to month.  A short time ago, they had not much time for price control, but, when they introduced price control machinery, we supported them because we had always supported the idea of some kind of price control. We considered the machinery overdue. We believed the time had passed in which the machinery could have been effective, but we supported its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now a measure introduced designed to control one section of wages.  It is an ill-conceived measure. What precisely is meant by saying that this tribunal will examine absolute levels of pay?  Does that mean that, having determined what an absolute level should be in this particular <Col N="1089" /> sector, and having made that determination in the short period suggested for examination by the tribunal, that decision will be binding on all future wage claims?  Surely that is what is meant by saying there will be an absolute wage?  If, at any time in the future, there is a demand for a wage increase, will not the decision of the tribunal have a bearing on the amount people can expect to get?  That is just one angle.  That is one of the reasons why we oppose this proposal.</P>
    <P>We have said repeatedly that the sphere of industrial relations is not one that is susceptible of any gimmick measures.  That is what this proposal would appear to be at this particular time.  If one could get one's timing right, see that wages went at a certain level, that prices went at a certain level and that profits went at a certain level, one could expect the co-operation of the trade unions towards a planned incomes policy.  But it is sheer hypocrisy to look for co-operation based on the kind of crazy system whereby we have a little bit of halfhearted legislation on prices one day, a little bit on wages another day.  It is futile on that basis to say to the trade unions: &ldquo;We want your help to plan incomes.  This is our incomes policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite the troubles our economy is undergoing, these measures the Government have brought in betray a lack of sincerity on their part in bringing in, or trying to bring in, some kind of planning to our economic life as it applies to all forms of incomes.  What yardstick can the Government or this tribunal bring into operation when it comes to talking about the relativity of the wages involved in this?  Have any answers been given to inquiries as to whether there will be comparability with regard to outside employment, commercial concerns and so on?  Will there be any comparability of grades within the service itself?  Any ordinary member of a trade union or anybody working for a living in a factory will tell you that this matter of job evaluation, measuring the content of a job and deciding the wages appropriate to such a job, is a very difficult task and one that, if it is to have any hope of <Col N="1090" /> success of acceptance by the people involved, must be gone into most carefully and conscientiously.  It is obvious that in the period left for this investigation, it is not possible to have the honest and painstaking examination necessary to gain the respect or the acceptance of the people involved.</P>
    <P>I accept that there has been extreme confusion in regard to the method of working of the different forms of arbitration that have been going on within the Service, but surely the remedy suggested here is, to say the least of it, careless in the face of the facts and is one that can give no hope or assurance for the future of a solution to this problem?  In Britain, there is a method whereby the Pay Research Unit makes an investigation every five years or so and compares actual gradings within the Service with outside employment. It is a regular piece of machinery that is used.  Here we think our problems can be solved by setting up a tribunal in a flurry of publicity and at a time when there is a great deal of querying in the community about the economic conditions in the country.  Against this kind of unsatisfactory background and with the short period of investigation which is possible, we set up this tribunal and expect it to be acceptable to the people involved.</P>
    <P>It shows a lack of awareness of the problems involved as they apply to these employees to go about solving them in this manner.  We can only say that in recent months, in fact, over the past two or three years, the results of Government interference in the area of industrial relations have not been too helpful to those involved.  One could, in all charity, only describe many of the interferences of the Government in this area over the past two or three years as just mindless bungling, and this latest piece of legislation becomes one to add to the list on the background of facts I have given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing my best to give them, and the Minister will have the opportunity of giving his version. This latest attempt is another instalment of Fianna Fáil pragmatic, short-term reply to a situation that we consider needs real planning and not these bungling attempts at providing an indication that this Government are trying to do anything about an incomes policy.</P>
      <P>If improvements were needed, and we accept that improvements could have been brought in in this matter of the settlement of wages in the public service, it could have been done through a rearrangement of the system of arbitration whereby the parties concerned meet.  This would have given greater hopes of success than coming in in this bureaucratic fashion and setting up a tribunal that is given impossible tasks, arduous tasks, that, in the nature of the job they are asked to do, they cannot do.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as Deputy Corish has already said here today, our Party have no alternative but to say that, looking at these facts, looking closely at the provisions for the setting up of this tribunal, it cannot have our support. It cannot have the support of a Party committed to real planning in our economy, not gimmick planning and not half measures or short-term measures.  It requires far deeper study than can be given in this instance. I have stated what the position is in Britain where there is comparability with outside employment.  That is a long-term job which this tribunal could not undertake, and that is another reason why we shall be forced to vote against this proposal of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been clearly indicated by previous speakers on the Labour benches, we are opposing this motion.  We oppose it because it is obvious that it is the thin end of the wedge and it is a prelude to a standstill order on wages and salaries, <Col N="1092" /> without any attempt being made by the Government to control the incomes of other sections of the community. We should like to know what the Minister is trying to control?  What about profits and dividends?  Do they not count?  Are they not to be controlled? Is it only the working classes who must rally round the flag?  Are measures to be introduced by the Government for other sections?  We had a very belated introduction by the Government of a measure of price control, something which for a long number of years, and even up to a few months before they introduced it, they regarded as a heresy.  The Taoiseach has stated publicly that he has no confidence in it and does not believe that it can be effective.  Is this the carrot the Government are holding out to the workers, this control of prices which they have stated time and again they do not believe in?</P>
      <P>First of all, we are starting off with the Civil Service and the semi-State bodies.  Who will be next?  Will there be just a general standstill order?  Not with our co-operation.  If there is any good in this suggestion, it is the indication that the Minister can rely on the support of the Fine Gael Party. That will be good from one aspect.  It will show the workers where their interests lie, as far as political Parties are concerned.  If there is to be a line-up between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, it could not, in my opinion, come on a better issue, or make things clearer to the workers as to where the political Parties stand, when an attack, a blatant attack, is made to try to put a standstill on their incomes without any effort to control any other section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the price control measure introduced a short time ago, provision is made that, unless reintroduced, it will expire after six months.  One wonders what is the connection between that particular clause and the fact that we are now approaching the tenth round by way of a National Wages Agreement. Is there any connection?  Is this the sweetener for the workers, that we have now introduced price control and they must restrain themselves, but no one else is asked to restrain himself? <Col N="1093" /> Does the Minister not think that if this sort of thing is necessary, it would be worthwhile or advisable to introduce an overall incomes policy?  They claim that it is not possible but six months or 12 months ago, they were claiming that price control was not possible and now they are boasting that they have introduced it and are operating it.  Will they not introduce an overall incomes policy?  We in the Labour Party will support such a measure but we definitely will not support this.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to introduce this tribunal, in view of the fact that discussions are at present going on between the FUE and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with a view to having a national agreement for the tenth round?  Are the Government of the opinion that the last national agreement did not work?  We are not of that opinion.  I think it worked very well and saved a tremendous amount of industrial disruption that could have arisen if there had been a free-for-all. Given proper terms, a national agreement could work again.  Have the Government lost faith in a national agreement and do they want free-for-alls? They mentioned that the justification for this tribunal is that there has been leap-frogging but as far as the higher grades are concerned, as far as the judiciary and the secretaries of Departments are concerned, there was no leap-frogging: they just took one long jump and ended up with a damn sight more than the man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Labour Court was already concerned that it was not empowered to deal with some unions which have come before it in regard to salary scales because the people involved allegedly were State servants in some capacity or other.  The Minister would be unwise to do anything which would undermine the integrity and responsibility of this great body which has done so much to bring industrial peace and harmony amongst workers and employers.  It has achieved <Col N="1095" /> a lot of good and now the Court are gravely perturbed as to what their future is to be.</P>

      <P>He has heard that the responsible officers of this Court commented on this type of legislation. Apart from the Labour Court, there are many joint industrial councils which have been doing great work, adhering to the principle of free negotiations, and which have brought peace, harmony and goodwill into their respective industries.  The Minister is doing no good at present in deciding to put civil servants into a tribunal of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>Obviously, any State employee is likely to be called a civil servant or semi-State employee.  The Minister may haggle with me if he likes, but they would like to think of themselves as such.  This is clearly an attempt, our Party feel, to bring in a wage freeze generally, and whatever success may attend the Minister's efforts in bringing the staffs of State bodies under this kind of tribunal, I prophesy that the Irish labour and trade union movement will never accept a wage freeze of that kind. Thank God, that body, 500,000 strong, has resisted in the past every attempt on the Minister's part to fix wages, place a standstill on them or apply a pay pause as they sometimes call it, and their resistance was successful.  It is sufficiently strong at present to resist successfully also.  Willingly to <Col N="1096" /> accept the establishment of such a tribunal and see the principle of free negotiations set aside would be to accept that we were entering into a totalitarian era where the rights of individuals and groups in our society were being challenged.</P>
      <P>Too much sacrifice has been made to win the right for Irish workers to band themselves together in appropriate organisations and thank God, these rights are adequately safeguarded under our Constitution: the right to free speech, the right to assembly and the right to band together to win their just rights.  Whatever good has come about in this country has been very largely attained by the strength and power of the Irish trade union movement. We have no fears.  We appreciate that attempts will be made here to implement anti-working class legislation, but we are confident that the movement for which we have the honour to speak has such an outstanding tradition, such great moral strength, that it will survive any attempts to deprive workers of the right to negotiate freely and come to an amicable settlement.  If there is unrest at present, if there is a depression and something of an economic crisis, it is certainly not the fault of the people the Minister now seeks to pin down.  It is obviously the responsibility of the Government and due to mismanagement of governmental affairs in recent years.</P>

      <P>This is the result of the turnover tax, of the spiralling of prices which naturally led to demands for further wage increases and the result of a general attitude of indifference to the economic situation on the part of the Government.  The Minister's Party take some credit&mdash;they certainly sought it and got it in many quarters, to my knowledge&mdash;for the 12 per cent increase in the last round of wage and salary increases and it is not good enough for Deputy Booth or anybody else to say that the Taoiseach suggested it should be less.  He did suggest it should be something like eight per cent but when the 12 per cent was eventually agreed upon, he <Col N="1097" /> took full credit for it and said on Radio Éireann that the workers had now got that increase and could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Party took credit for it all over the country and secured votes on the strength of it in two by-elections. We are pleased that price control has belatedly come but it would be far wiser for the Minister to embark on a proper incomes policy than to be fiddling with an economic crisis of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's attitude must be clear in this matter.  We are firmly opposed to interference with the fundamental rights of Irish workers to negotiate freely their conditions and salaries.  I accept the view of Deputy Booth when he said we have not got an economic crisis at present.  One could imagine such measures being introduced in an emergency situation, such as something tantamount to war. The Government Party spokesmen will say there is no economic crisis, no need for panic, and consequently the establishment of a tribunal of this kind is unjustified at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to convince workers of that class that they must pull in their belts and make some kind of national sacrifice, it must be clear that all sections of the community are doing likewise and we must have a clear incomes policy, involving not merely <Col N="1098" /> prices and salary scales in a particular category of workers such as this covers but an incomes policy covering profits, prices and then wages.  When that happy day comes, the Labour Party will be supporting the proposition but I want to make this reservation: we can see the difficulty at present of achieving an incomes policy in Great Britian, even under a Labour Government. There does seem to be some real hope of attaining such an incomes policy, in spite of the difficulties being experienced.  I personally feel that the Irish working classes, and particularly the Irish trade union movement, of necessity must look with distrust and suspicion on the invocation of any measure of this kind as an incomes policy promoted by a Government not representative of those classes.</P>

      <P>One is always a little sceptical of late conversions and it is interesting to see the Government, in their present turmoil and in this mess of their own creation, now beginning to think realistically on some of the necessities that have been obvious to any clear economic thinker for quite a period of time.  One is inclined to think that the effort enshrined in this motion is coming very late and at a time when the Minister's predecessor in office had practically thrown in his hat and subsequently thrown in his hand in amazement at the consequences of the increases which he had given and of the impact of the decision to give those increases on the general economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are facing difficulties in this country.  While I do not subscribe to the belief of Deputy Treacy that it is impossible to achieve a really good incomes policy in this country on the lines of that in Britian, we must realise that the basis of our economy is different and that the strength of our <Col N="1099" /> community and its needs are different from those of Britain.  We in Fine Gael have been preaching the necessity for an incomes policy in relation to this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this extended gamble of the Fianna Fáil Government that everything would come out right is now coming home to roost and that we have not yet got the whole story of all our difficulties here.  Over all the years I have been in this House, we have been preaching the gospel that we have to fit the practicality of our economics to the development of our agriculture in order that it would carry our main export earnings, and we have always preached that we should get rid of impractical industry and help in every possible way industry suited to our agricultural development, industry that will be supplied to a large extent from our raw materials at home.</P>
      <P>Now we are up against the difficulty of a recession in England, of over-spending on ridiculous imports, a difficulty that has been allowed by the Government to be blown up to the size it has now reached.  And it is the people who can least stand the shock, the junior type official of the State or semi-State body, not the people who got the bigger increases, who are to be pegged back now.  It is not the person who is best able to bear the impact of this short-sighted policy who is to have his earnings pegged.  That is why I am critical of this effort of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do they always want to hit the small man?  Why do they always get out after the people whose goodwill and co-operation are necessary to rescue us from this present mess?  That is why I am always suspicious when Fianna Fáil announce some new economic theory.  If the necessity is there, <Col N="1100" /> and perhaps it is, for the type of investigation envisaged by the Minister we ought to face the reality of equating the burden to the people who can best bear it.  What I am afraid of from this tribunal is that it is not the people who have £70, £80 or £100 a week who will be pegged.  These people have got generous and reasonable increases but there is a great difference between the percentage increases given to people in receipt of £80 and £90 a week and the unfortunate man who has £11, £12, £13 or £14 a week who is generally the man with a large young family to look after.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael realise that there is a necessity for a critical analysis of the present situation and a necessity to arrest the growth of impractical imports over a wide range, but it is also time the country realised that the Government must be nailed on the fact that most of our present difficulties were foreseeable and could have been checked before they reached the proportions they have reached today.  I have sympathy with the Labour point of view that is critical of this type of tribunal, and this action of the Government seems to me to be precipitate and unbalanced.  It is time the Irish people realised that this whole economic difficulty, despite Government statements that everything was going well, could have been foreseen and avoided by reasoned and sensible planning.</P>
    <P>It is not targets we want in this country.  It is integrated, responsible planning within the capacity of our economic expansion to bear that is needed and that must go back to the expansion and development of a variety of acceptable agricultural exports.  I say quite deliberately to the Minister, who has not the real responsibility for what has happened because he has taken over this office recently, that he must look back on the words of his predecessor who confessed that he was appalled and amazed at the impact on the economy of the increases in relation to the Civil Service secured as a result of certain properly conducted arbitration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> We do not want palliatives of a minor nature.  We want the Government to face up to their responsibility to get us out of the financial wilderness into which they have led us. There will have to be a global review of the economic situation.  Isolated arbitration boards will not cope with the problem.  To get the country out of its difficulties, we require increased production and increased exports.  We must cut down quickly and sensibly the flow of imports which should never have been allowed to develop.  In order that all these things can be done, it is vitally necessary to secure the goodwill of the worker in the factory or on the farm.  The co-operation of the tradesman and the labourer must be readily available if we are to tackle the housing problem.  The co-operation will not be forthcoming if the Government direct their efforts to a wage freeze or restriction on the working section of the community instead of directing them at the people best able to carry temporarily the burden of restrictions.</P>
    <P>I dislike this particular type of board and this particular type of attack because it is the thin end of the wedge in an effort to make people whose wages have not been adjusted in the manner in which senior persons' earnings have been adjusted feel that they are the victims of circumstances. The pattern of restriction must be spread over all equitably.  Until that is done there will not be the fusion of spirit and effort that is required if we are to clear the economic morass that has been created either by Government neglect or lack of thought or, as I believe, lack of capacity in the Government.  It is time the people realised that the air of prosperity, created on the basis that all would be well tomorrow, has been dissipated. The gamble has failed.  The recession and strain which our economy have to bear now are the responsibility of the Government and of nobody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that the purpose of this motion is not to establish a wages standstill, not to interfere in any way with free negotiation <Col N="1102" /> of wages and salaries and not to interfere with the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  If I may start with the first speaker, Deputy O'Higgins opened the debate and, naturally, traced the history of events which he alleged led to the introduction of this motion and, as is to be expected from a lawyer and an advocate of his ability, he highlighted the events that he thought were most favourable to his own side and glossed over any aspect of the case that might be in any way helpful to the opposing side.</P>
      <P>He referred back originally to the White Paper issued early in 1963 entitled <i>Closing the Gap.</i>  At that time the Government did foresee pressures mounting for increases in wages, increases of a size that were thought to be incompatible with the cost of living increases then incurred or with the rate of increased production and productivity in the country and the purpose of that White Paper was to counsel restraint in wage increases, to point out the difficulties that such increases would create in relation to our competitiveness, particularly in the export field, to counsel also restraint in incomes and profits of all descriptions. I want to say that specifically because there is a paragraph in that White Paper related to profits and incomes.</P>
      <P>That White Paper served a very good purpose and succeeded fairly well in holding the situation from the early months of 1963 up to the late months of that year.  There was, it is true, in the meantime, the introduction of the turnover tax which inevitably had an effect on the cost of living by reason of increases in the prices of certain commodities.  In the meantime, productivity had increased but in the meantime also, the pressures for increased incomes mounted to an even greater extent.  It was at this stage that the Government foresaw the danger of haphazard wage demands and haphazard negotiations, with the strongest unions going after the weakest quarry and thereby setting standards that perhaps could not be applied equitably over the whole field of employment in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> I do not think anybody will deny &mdash;in fact I think members of the Labour Party admitted&mdash;that this was likely to be the case in the latter end of 1963 and it was at this stage that the Taoiseach asked if the two elements in the Employer-Labour Conference could come together and work out a national wage increase that would be generally applicable.  I think Deputy Booth indicated broadly what the offer on one side was and the claim on the other.  They were pretty wide apart and, as a result, their first meeting failed to come to any agreement. In the meantime, the Government, through the Taoiseach, indicated what it was thought would be a fair increase, having regard to the increase in the cost of living and having regard to the increase in productivity achieved and likely to be achieved over the period that a national agreement would remain in force.  Even then, when the two sides came together to see if they could agree on a percentage all round increase, they failed and it was on the further exhortation of the Taoiseach that they ultimately hammered out the 12 per cent wage agreement.  Deputy O'Higgins has claimed that the Taoiseach and the Government sought credit for that 12 per cent increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he did say subsequently that, having regard to its size, we were in effect anticipating an increase in productivity yet to take place.  He expressed the opinion that the agreement would outlast this period so that the productivity increase would catch up with the wage increase.  The Labour Party, rightly so, were careful to point out that the Taoiseach did not give this 12 per cent increase&mdash;that it was a negotiated increase.</P>

He <Col N="1104" /> alleged also that in a letter I circulated to the electorate during the Cork by-election I claimed credit for the 12 per cent increase.  That is completely unfounded. I never did it.  I always upheld the point of view of the Labour Party that this was a negotiated agreement. Nevertheless, it had its effect on prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but the votes cast in the February by-elections in Cork and Kildare in 1964 were fully reflected in the general election 14 months later in both constituencies and were enhanced in Cork, and there was no 12 per cent wage increase before the general election.  Whatever price increases had taken place were already in effect.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins is not right in saying that the 12 per cent increase was solely responsible for the Fianna Fáil victory in the Cork by-election.</P>
      <P>Coming to prices and price control, we had on the Statute Book the 1958 Prices Act, and I should like to remind Labour Deputies that none of them here and none of the predecessors of their new Members raised his voice against the adequacy or inadequacy of that legislation when it was going through the House.  I read very carefully the records of that debate and nowhere could I find a protest.</P>

      <P>During my time in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I established Prices Committees under the aegis of that Act to examine the prices of certain commodities in respect of which complaints were made about increases.  In some cases, the report stated that the increases were justified having regard to increases in wages, raw materials and so forth.  The trade union movement was represented on those committees and there was no minority report.  The reports were not published but I published in each case a very broad summary of the recommendations of those committees.  Let me remind Deputies again that there was on each committee a very able representative of the trade union movement. In some cases I succeeded in holding down prices.  Therefore, it is not true to say that however effective the 1958 Act was, advantage was not taken of it.  Advantage was taken and to good effect.</P>

      <P>That would be a good idea.  I was saying before the other debate started that an incomes policy is something that must evolve. It is something for which a Government alone cannot be held responsible for formulating, and it is wrong that it should.  It is something that should come from all sides of industry, employers and other workers and other interests within the economy.  As well as all that in our context the National Industrial and Economic Council would be a body that could make a very useful contribution to the evolution of an incomes policy if such can be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the start that this motion is not intended in any way to interfere with free collective bargaining for salary increases at present.  The desire is&mdash;if I may use Deputy O'Leary's phrase, which I jotted down&mdash;to try to abolish this extreme confusion that has been created in the different arbitration schemes.  That is true.  I <Col N="1108" /> have been asked why I picked out this particular category, the recruitment grades in the Civil Service and in the related bodies, the ESB and others.  It is because it is in these grades that the greater degree of leap-frogging is taking place.</P>
    <P>To give an example, an increase was recently negotiated for the lower ESB rate.  That was specifically related by their Tribunal to the increase in the executive scale.  This, in turn, was influenced by the increase granted to clerical officers, which was related to the existing outside rates.  That is the kind of vicious circle we find ourselves in.  That is the kind of situation I hope this Tribunal will bring order to.  The intention is not to isolate these clerical grades for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They were related generally to the increases given at the lower level.  They were percentage increases.  These levels have negotiated increases by comparison with outside employment.  These increases are related to the higher up grades.  I can assure the House that the higher up grades will not get out of hand.  If there appears to be a necessity for the Tribunal to examine the relativities in these grades, that can be done, too.  In the meantime it is necessary to make a start somewhere in order to control this confusion to which Deputy O'Leary very honestly refers and which obviously exists.</P>

      <P>They were given by reference to the increases negotiated for clerical grades and so on.  In addition, there were status increases negotiated.  Unfortunately, this leap-frogging took place.  If one party gets a status increase by reference to the level of wages of another category, that status element disappears when the other group seeks to maintain the differential.  That is the kind of leap-frogging that has taken place.  I tried my best to allow each Deputy develop his argument, but apparently there is a concerted effort on the part of the Labour Party not to allow me develop mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy must allow me to reply to the points made?  I think I am being very much <i>ad rem</i> to what was debated here today.  I think Deputy O'Leary and some other Deputies made a point that there have been a lot of arbitration schemes and different arbitrators and that there has been confusion as a result.  I am suggesting it would be most desirable that we should have one form of arbitration, not necessarily one arbitrator, but an arbitration system that could come under the umbrella of an expanded Labour Court, a Labour Court with more authority, if you like, to ensure that standards and relativities would not get out of line.</P>
      <P>I was asked what the constitution of this tribunal will be.  At the moment I have not made up my mind.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, the Act under which I moved this motion provides that the Government appoint this tribunal, but I want to assure the House that there will be no attempt whatever at loading this tribunal in any way or, to use Deputy O'Higgins's word, to create a star-chamber out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in reply to Deputy Corish that I did have a meeting with the Employer-Labour Conference.  I did say to them at the time that I envisaged drawing, say, two members from the workers and two members <Col N="1111" /> from the employers' side of the Labour Court, perhaps one from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one from the Federated Union of Employers, one economist and a chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with that as clearly as I can.  Surely I should be allowed to proceed?  That deals with the personnel of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked whether evidence could be given.  Of course evidence can be <Col N="1113" /> given.  In this connection I might, perhaps, deal with the suggestion that it would be impossible for a tribunal of this nature to conduct the type of job evaluation or work study required in order to establish the relationships between the various categories of employment that will come under the purview of the tribunal.  Evidence can be given.  I know that in almost every category of employment that would be under consideration claims have come before conciliation and arbitration; the type of work done has been put forward as a reason why an increase should be given.  I suggest, therefore, that in most cases there has already been a reasonable degree of job evaluation done.  In many cases there has been a very close degree of job evaluation done and there will, therefore, be evidence available already in the hands of the types of clerical workers represented to inform reasonably fully the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I might say that the existing tribunals are constantly being asked to undertake this exercise in regard to individual employments and usually comparisons with analogous employments outside are brought in.  At present one arbitrator is expected to cope with all that in a short time.  The difference between this process and what is now being proposed is that such comparisons are made at present in the absence of representatives of the analogous bodies, representatives of either management or workers, and it will be possible in this tribunal to bring in evidence of the type of work being done by the categories of workers referred to; in other words, if a particular branch of clerical workers, who come within the ambit of this tribunal, want to refer to comparable employment outside, they can give full evidence of it.  The tribunal, if they so wish, can call evidence from these outside categories, whereas, at the present time, such evidence is given of outside employment without any reference at all to management or workers.</P>
    <P>I have been asked what is meant by absolute levels of pay for the grades mentioned.  In the first place, if the tribunal satisfactorily establishes differentials, that in itself will set levels. <Col N="1114" /> Unless there is some very significant change, it is, I think, in the interests of stability and of the economy as a whole that these levels should be regarded as norms not to be departed from in future.  The word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; is used in this sense and should be, I suggest, so interpreted.  In elaboration of this, I might say that, in the case of any percentage wage increase in the future, if the tribunal think category A should have a basic salary of £x and category B a basic salary of £y, and if £x is in excess of what category A now enjoys, any percentage in the future would be related to £x rather than to their previous salary. If £x is their present salary and the levels the tribunal suggest are something less than £x, then increases would be based on that less £x in future. That is not to say that £x or minus £x is to remain for all time.</P>

      <P>I think I have answered, or at least tried to answer as well as I could, and having regard to the interruptions, the specific questions put to me in the course of the debate.  As I said, this is one of the measures the Government have taken to deal with the present economic situation.  The Government do not intend to do more than is necessary.  It has been suggested that the measures are piecemeal but the reason they are piecemeal is that they are being introduced and put into effect according as the Government see the need for them.  There has been the need to bring some kind of reason to the type of leap-frogging that has been taking place and I suggest it is in the interest of the workers concerned themselves to ensure that any increases they get in the future will be of real value and that they will not be eroded by this winning of increases by other people in relation to what has been given to former recipients of increases, thus leading to this interminable inflationary situation that such a process can bring about.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish said that, by and large, the 12 per cent National Wage Agreement has been <Col N="1118" /> honoured and has been effective in regard to the vast majority of workers. The 12 per cent wage increase is destined to come under review during the early months of next year with the date for the new agreement being set as of first June or July.  The groups to which I have referred in this motion have received various eighth round and ninth round increases.  They have also received status awards that have been given to the various categories, except in some few categories whose cases are now before arbitration and these arbitration cases will be permitted to go ahead.  The Government will not go to conciliation on any new claims until this tribunal has reported. They have asked, and they have no means of enforcing this, other employers to defer consideration of applications for wage increases in the meantime.  If it was true, as Deputy Corish says, that the National Wage Agreement, by and large, has been honoured, as it is not due for renewal for six months and as this tribunal will be expected to report by 1st March, then no grave hardship is going to be inflicted on anybody, and in no sense can this be regarded as a standstill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment put down by Deputy Clinton and me is to widen the investigations which local authorities should make.  At the moment there is only one sure way of getting a house from a local authority, that is, to marry young, breed like rabbits, go into a place which is dangerous or insanitary, or grossly overcrowded, and then contract some highly contagious disease. Then you have a chance within the foreseeable future of being housed by the local authority.  That appalling situation arises because of the limitation we put upon the duties of public authorities to house our people and we think that the housing of our people is a much greater social obligation on people in a Christian society than the mere relief of distress which we allow to develop by our negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we seek to have consideration <Col N="1121" /> given not only to houses regarded as unfit for human habitation, not only to ascertain what overcrowding exists but also what people are paying beyond their means for housing accommodation.  At present there are several hundred families who are not on the waiting list of Dublin Corporation because they are not regarded by the chief medical officer as being in need of housing.  They are not overcrowded and not suffering from a contagious disease; they are not in a dangerous dwelling or in a dwelling unfit for human habitation; but they are in dwellings which are far beyond their capacity to pay for.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of families whose income is from £10 to £12 per week and in which there are four, five or six mouths to feed and whose rents range from £3 to £6 a week.  They cannot be housed under our existing code and cannot have any hope of being housed by Dublin Corporation for several years to come.  It is in order to ascertain their true needs for housing that we ask that it be a statutory duty on local authorities to ascertain the rents people are paying for housing accommodation and that where they have knowledge of people paying more than a certain proportion of their income, they be listed so that society can endeavour to come to their assistance. If we fail these people, we are doing serious damage to the family and to the children.</P>
    <P>There are many families in Dublin to whom essential food, medicines and clothing are not available because they are paying rents they are not in a position to pay.  It is accepted generally that even amongst well-to-do people the proportion of income paid for housing accommodation should never exceed one-quarter.  That is for people who have a large proportion of income which they can spend on luxuries and things essential to the preservation of life.  With our local authority differential rent system, we consider the maximum should be one-sixth of income.  Where we have newly-weds getting houses, people who have no dependants, we consider the maximum they should be required to pay out <Col N="1122" /> of income is one-fifth.  But allowing the most generous provision it is regarded by sociologists that the maximum people should pay for housing accommodation is one-quarter of their income.  At present we have hundreds of people in this city paying as much as half of their income for housing accommodation and these are people who, because of the large number of dependants and other obligations they have, cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we seek in our amendment that the investigation should see to what extent people are paying rents for housing accommodation which impose undue hardship on them.</P>
    <P>We also seek that the number of old persons living in accommodation or in circumstances unsuitable for elderly persons should be ascertained.  At present there are in Dublin and I am sure in other urban centres many elderly people living alone in housing accommodation which is greater than their needs and which, perhaps, is beyond their capacity to pay for, and certainly to maintain, and it is highly desirable to encourage elderly people living in such circumstances to go into smaller units of accommodation more suited to their age and physical abilities.</P>
    <P>It is true, I think, that the average house is unsuitable for people physically handicapped, and that includes old people and, as a society, we must provide an increasing number of housing units for elderly people but in order to ascertain the true need for such housing accommodation we must know not only the people who have already applied for it but also the people who could be helped and those who are occupying housing accommodation in excess of their needs and who could go into specially provided accommodation provided for older people and who could thereby contribute accommodation to provide housing for larger families.</P>
    <P>This can be done in a way which would assist elderly people.  Clearly it would be wrong to force any old person to leave the housing accommodation he is in even if it is in excess of his requirements but, again, there are <Col N="1123" /> many old people who are not on the approved list of housing applicants in Dublin because they do not fall into the categories of living in unfit, unsuitable or insanitary dwellings and as such do not become eligible under the very rigid code that has to be applied in present circumstances.  It is in order to get away from the mendicant level of housing that we seek that under this legislation in future local authorities should keep under constant examination the number of elderly people living alone in large housing accommodation or accommodation which is unsuitable and that steps should be taken to entice such people to move to housing accommodation which would be better for them in their less capable years.</P>
    <P>We also think it desirable that investigation should be made to ascertain the suitability of premises for conversion into multiple dwellings.  Again, in many large urban centres there is likely to be a large number of large houses which are under-used for housing people but many of these units of housing accommodation are not known to local authorities and are occupied by people who find it extremely difficult to pay the outgoings on them.  It could be of assistance to the occupants of those houses and certainly to the local authorities trying to meet housing demands if such houses could be turned over for coversion into dwellings so that they could house a larger number of people.  It is in order to ascertain people of that class that we seek in our amendment to have the investigation of local authorities extended into that area also.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper on housing which the Government published last year they rightly drew attention to the large number of houses which will be required to meet future obsolescence but we have not, as yet, any accurate figure of the amount of future obsolescence or the dates within which it will be necessary to replace any given number of houses.  In order to avoid in the future a continuation of the situation we now have, that people must be in obsolescent dwellings and in terrible <Col N="1124" /> living conditions before they are rehoused, we should like to see local authorities regarding it as a constant duty to ascertain future obsolescence so that new housing accommodation can be provided before the dwellings become unfit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>It is clearly desirable socially that we should have workers as close as possible to centres of employment. Apart from rents, which can impose a considerable burden on workers' families in urban centres, the cost of travelling from home to work and back again in the evenings and the cost of transporting children to and from school and in other cases can impose an immense burden on family incomes.  We think it desirable that housing should be provided near the centre of employment.  We think this is something that the Minister and others have not overlooked but it is in order to prevent any indifference in regard to these fundamental matters in future that Deputy Clinton with other members of the Fine Gael Party and myself are asking the House here to write these statutory obligations into this new Housing Bill so that these vital matters will not be left to the whim of any Minister in future.  If you do not write them in as a matter of statutory duty there is the danger that, for political purposes from time to time or if finances are restricted, Ministers may postpone their duty or may ask local authorities to postpone their duty in respect of these necessary social purposes.  That is why we seek to spell them out here while we do not in any way seek to limit the power which the Minister might have to direct local authorities to inquire into other matters in addition to those we have set out.</P>
    <P>We also ask in our amendment No. 57 that the investigation should ascertain the number of persons residing in housing accommodation provided by their employers which they will be required to vacate on the termination of their employment.  This is also a very important matter.  I am not sure of the exact number&mdash;I do not know if anybody can get it&mdash;but I think it is true that there are some hundreds of persons in Dublin who for one reason <Col N="1125" /> or other have terminated their employment in respect of which they were originally allocated the house in which they live.  Some employers are tolerant and have permitted former employees to remain in the houses which the employers gave them.  There are others not so tolerant.  This can throw on to the public housing demand people who then have to wait in line according to the number of families which may be regarded for the time being as being in greater need than they are.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, a Deputy asked the Minister for Defence if he would state the number of overholders in Army married quarters.  I do not recollect the number given in the reply but some time ago the number of overholders in Army married quarters was 94 or 96 families.  That is a colossal number. It is a terrible thought that there are as many soldiers' families seeking to get into married quarters as there are overholders who cannot get out because there is no alternative housing accommodation available for them.</P>
    <P>There are cases where a mother and children are required, on the death of the father, to vacate a house that belongs to the father's employers.  It is in order that we may know just how serious that problem is that we seek in this amendment to have an assessment made of the future housing needs of these people.  If it is known that there will be 100 such families in Dublin seeking accommodation, then the accommodation should be built to provide for them.  Frequently, at the time of greatest need and anguish, when the breadwinner dies, the family are asked to vacate the house.</P>
    <P>There is also the situation in regard to CIE houses.  In recent times, on the termination of rail services, a number of railway employees have been transferred from the country to Dublin.  At Inchicore and other places in Dublin, CIE have housing estates which are intended for their employees but because the company is acting humanely in not dispossessing widows and orphans or pensioners, railway employees transferred from the country are unable to get accommodation in CIE houses, and, as they have not got <Col N="1126" /> the necessary residential qualification in Dublin, they cannot be housed by Dublin Corporation.  The result is that there are numerous workers who have been transferred from the country paying rents in Dublin of £3, £4 and £5 a week for flats.  When serving in the country, these people may have been on wage rates that were marginally below the Dublin wage rate and, on transfer to Dublin, may get a marginal increase in their wage rate but that does not compensate them for the increase in the rent they have to pay from, say, 10/- in the country to £3, £4 or £5 a week in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We seek in these amendments to have all these circumstances within the knowledge of the local authorities so that the needs can be provided for in advance, so that people will not be required, as a matter of social housing policy, to breed like rabbits, to live in insanitary or dangerous dwellings and run the risk of contracting a highly contagious disease before they can be housed.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 59 we ask that local authorities should ascertain the future demand for housing arising from redevelopment causing displacement of persons.  Since 1960, the position has been that people can be dispossessed of housing accommodation by reason of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, where the owner of the property can show that he can benefit financially by redevelopment. There is no obligation on such property owner to provide alternative housing accommodation for people who are dispossessed for redevelopment purposes and Dublin Corporation, like other local authorities, has been faced with applications from people who are being dispossessed of accommodation and who are unable to obtain alternative accommodation except from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, such people may receive compensation which, according to the Act, shall not be less than three years' rent including rates but the maximum of such compensation awarded by the courts is, I understand, in the region of £500, an amount which is insufficient to buy even a garage for such <Col N="1127" /> people in these days.  Because of the fact that we have not ascertained the potential demand arising out of redevelopment, we have not provided for the needs of such people.</P>
    <P>It may well be that this problem could be solved more directly by an amendment of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, so as to oblige property owners to provide alternative housing accommodation rather than compensation which is related to a decontrolled rent but so long as the 1960 Act remains as it is, there is clearly a need for society to provide alternative housing accommodation for people dispossessed because of redevelopment. We believe that housing authorities, in the preparation of their reports, ought to have regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from what private property owners may do, urban authorities, under the new planning legislation, have a specific duty to consider areas of redevelopment.  We consider that they must also be conscious of the housing demands which may be created by such urban redevelopment and urban renewal.  It is for the purpose of ensuring that this matter is not overlooked that we ask that it be considered in any report that is put before the Minister.</P>
    <P>We believe that local authorities should consider housing needs arising from industrialisation.  I do not think that this is a matter which affects Dublin to the same extent as it affects areas in the country in which industries may be established and in which there is not sufficient housing accommodation available.  In the case of Dublin, there is an ample supply of labour for any industry but there have been cases where industries have been established in towns and villages for the purpose of giving local employment and because of the lack of housing accommodation elaborate transport services have had to be provided to outlying districts in order to bring workers to the factories.  In order that there may be a rational association between industrialisation and housing, consideration of this matter should be <Col N="1128" /> a statutory duty such as we have spelt out in our amendments.</P>
    <P>All these suggestions are related to the need that I mentioned at the beginning to get away from the limited housing objective that we have had. One appreciates that at present and for some time the immediate and most urgent priority must be the relief of the appalling misery in which thousands of people are forced to live today.  It is in order to prevent the possibility of future generations having to endure the same sufferings that we ask for an enlightened approach to the whole housing problem and that our future needs be ascertained in the light of the social objectives which we set out.  We should not leave this purely to ministerial whim but spell it out and put it into this Act rather than leave it to some casual action of the present Minister or his successor in the years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the complex nature of this section and the even more complex nature of the amendments, I shall try to stick to the amendments before the House.  Yesterday evening I went in detail into amendment No. 56 and there is nothing further I wish to add to what I then said.  However, I should like to say that amendment No. 57, which in some ways resembles amendment No. 56, deals with providing housing accommodation for people who must vacate their houses on termination of their employment.  That, in my opinion, is an excellent amendment.  This is a matter which has had the attention of numerous local authorities over the years and we have all had the experience of persons who, when a housing scheme is being prepared in an area, feel they are already in good housing conditions and do not need to seek rehousing from the local authority. But before the scheme is completed, those people have lost their jobs and therefore the houses, and they are perhaps the worst housed people in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel the Minister might consider making arrangements to have such people included in the two-thirds subsidy because at the present time they <Col N="1129" /> are only included in the one-third subsidy scheme and most local authorities will not be expected to offer rehousing to people in such a situation.  Still another category is closely related to that I have just referred to&mdash;people who, when getting married, are offered temporary accommodation by somebody who has a vacant house.  Even after they have got a notice to quit, such people cannot be rehoused unless the council are prepared to find two-thirds of the loan charges, because the Department will put up only one-third of the cost.  The Minister should give consideration to the possibility of including those people in the Bill.  I am sure the position in Donegal and Wicklow is the very same as it is in Meath. There are numerous cases in each area. The Minister would be well advised to have them included now because if they are not in the Bill now, they may never be included.</P>
    <P>The fact that a number of amendments are being taken together and that some of them do not refer to the section now being debated makes the matter rather complicated.  For instance, section 49 refers to redevelopment causing displacement of persons. Amendment No. 63 proposed by members of the Labour Party, deals with the provision of housing accommodation adjacent to centres of employment and for emigrants desiring to return to their native areas.  That has already been partially covered by the proposed subsection (3) of amendment No. 56. The matter of providing housing for returned emigrants is at present being dealt with by some local authorities.  I am aware that if a person lives in a local authority area, at any time the local authority may rehouse him, while in other local authority areas, unless people are in fact living in bad conditions at the time a house becomes vacant or a scheme of houses is completed, they cannot be considered for rehousing.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider dealing with this question by adding to the appropriate section the amendments suggested by the Labour Party.  I know quite well the Minister may point out that it is difficult to find housing <Col N="1130" /> accommodation for those who are living in an area and already in need. That is a valid argument but it does not answer the problem of somebody living on the borders of Kildare, or Dublin, or Meath and who, for one reason or another, has to leave the house and go to live in another county.  If that person applies for a house in the county to which he has had to go, he cannot be considered for rehousing, even though he left a house to go there.  The Minister should try to have this matter resolved so that there will be a chance of transfer from one county to another.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we have a situation where a cottage may become vacant in an area near the border of two counties but where it will not suit the people living in one county to take up residence.  Such a case is, of course, very rare but it has happened.  The neighbouring county authorities may be only too glad to avail of the the accommodation offered for some person living in their county.  There could be a reciprocal arrangement so that transfers could take place in such cases.  As the law stands, it is not permissible, and if it is done, it is without the Minister or the Department knowing anything about it.  I appeal to the Minister to pay a lot more attention to things like this and have provision made for them in the Bill because the Bill, as he himself said on Second Reading, is legislation for the future.  We will not have a housing Bill for many years in the normal course of events.  Therefore, every effort should be made to include in this Bill all the things we want done.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say he is making arrangements which will cover most of the needs dealt with in the amendments but there are a number of amendments which are not dealt with at all and the Minister must take account of them and do something to try to have them included in the present legislation.  One of the matters dealt with in the proposed new subsection (c) in amendment No. 57 is of great importance to people living in towns.  It is true that a certain type of accommodation is available for people <Col N="1131" /> in country towns.  Flats can be obtained which people earning between £8 and £12 a week may go into and be asked to pay a weekly rent of anything between £2 10s. and £4 10s.  In most cases the use of the flat is given only when there are no children.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which the Minister must take into account because there are two things wrong with it.  The first is that the person who is paying an exorbitant rent for that flat is paying more than he can afford.  The family suffer as a result of this payment.  The fact that such a rent is being paid should be accepted by the local authority as a good reason why those people should be rehoused.</P>
    <P>The second question is the question of the people who have temporary accommodation in such flat and who must give it up if there is a child in the family.  The Minister should take steps either to outlaw that sort of tenancy altogether or make it illegal for a landlord to take possession of such accommodation because there is a child in the family or, alternatively, the Minister should arrange to provide accommodation for people who find themselves in those conditions.  It is perfectly reasonable to ask that this be done, and the Minister can do it in this Bill if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that, if all these things were included, the cost to the local authority would be too great and it would be impossible for them to meet all the demands for housing.  Do not forget that less than three years ago the local authorities, whether of their own volition or on the advice of the Department, were publicly saying that the housing problem was almost solved and that we would soon reach the situation here in which no more houses would be required for a considerable period. The very people singing that chant then now find that there are more new houses needed than ever before.</P>
    <P>This question of finding houses must be faced.  There is no point in saying that the local authorities cannot meet it; they have to meet the problem.  The Department should make provision in <Col N="1132" /> this Bill so that there will be no loop-hole allowing a local authority to say: &ldquo;We are not responsible.  These people must find houses even if there is no money available in the Local Loans Fund.  They must find accommodation elsewhere; we cannot be held responsible for them.&rdquo;  The original idea that the local authority is responsible for housing people unable to house themselves should not be lost sight of; neither should the fact that housing should be the first priority with every local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of things which should not be lost sight of.  There is a duty on us to try to provide houses for ourselves and the community undertakes the obligation to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves.  I have no objection to the aims of these amendments, although I might not feel desirous of accepting them in this or any other form.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of a housing survey is directed towards ascertaining housing needs on a methodical basis.  In section 53, as it now stands, there is an obligation on local authorities to do this job.  The general principles are outlined there, admittedly in more brief form than that given by the speakers to the amendment.  These are the general principles to be taken into account:</P>
      <P> (a)  to what extent there exist in the area houses which are in any respect unfit or unsuitable for human habitation,</P>
      <P>(b)  any overcrowding existing in the area, and</P>
      <P>(c)  such other matters as the Minister may specify from time to time,  </P>
      <P>As an indication of what the Minister would specify from time to time, we can have no better proof than what the Minister has already specified.  As far back as 24th May last, a circular letter was sent to local authorities in regard to the assessment of housing needs in advance of this legislation.  In this letter I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective should be to <Col N="1133" /> ascertain, as quickly as possible, the number of dwellings likely to be required to meet the needs of&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  families and other persons living in unfit dwellings and in overcrowded conditions or likely to be displaced from areas scheduled for re-development before 1970;</P>
    <P>(b)  families or persons otherwise in need of re-housing and to make reasonable provision for</P>
    <P>(c)  continued obsolescence in the existing housing stock and</P>
    <P>(d)  population growth through new family formation, industrial or other economic growth and other similar factors.  </P>
    <P>That is a concrete example of what the Minister might ask for.  In fact, it is already being asked for.</P>
    <P>Having made the assessment, on whatever basis it may be, it will only be relevant when taken in conjunction with a building programme.  Subsection (3) of section 55 states:</P>
    <P>In preparing a building programme, a housing authority shall have regard to the following objectives:</P>
    <P> (a)  the repair, closure or demolition of houses which are unfit or unsuitable for human habitation;</P>
    <P>(b)  the elimination of overcrowding;</P>
    <P>(c)  the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons (including elderly or disabled persons) who, in the opinion of the authority, are in need of and are unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources;</P>
    <P>(d)  the provision of adequate housing accommodation to meet needs arising from the obsolescence of dwellings or the prospective increase in the population;</P>
    <P>(e)  the securing of the objectives contained in a development plan under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, for the area which comprises or includes, as the case may be, the functional area of the authority;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> (f)  the encouragement by the authority of the provision by persons of houses for owner-occupation by the owner or for letting. </P>
    <P>This should be taken in conjunction with what has been laid down in regard to the assessment of housing needs and such other matters as the Minister may specify.  I have already given an example of what the Minister may specify.  If, between now and when we come to this particular section, Deputies would consider the matter under these three headings, they will probably find there is very little which is not covered which they specifically suggest in these amendments should be covered.  The House will appreciate that, if we were to write into the legislation all the matters contained in these amendments in regard to assessment of housing needs and so on, it might impose such a task on local authorities as to make it impossible for them to complete it in the foreseeable future. We might place such encumbrances on them with the aim of getting a better job done that we might finish up by not getting the job done at all.</P>
    <P>The whole question of assessment is related to housing needs.  The need in this case covers practically everything that was mentioned by those who spoke in support of these amendments. The hard cases that have been quoted, even though they may be unique, are included in that assessment as to need.  Bearing that in mind, there should be no difficulty in arriving at a compromise.  Having regard to the circular which issued in May last and to sections 53 and 55, we should be able to cover every case to the satisfaction of both sides of the House.</P>
