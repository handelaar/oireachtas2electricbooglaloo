    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that German firms are at present circularising  young Irish women and girls with a view to persuading them to take up employment in Germany; what steps are taken by the Irish representatives in Germany to ensure the welfare of these girls when working in Germany; and whether any investigation is made to ensure that the wages and conditions offered are substantially the same as those paid to German employees of the same firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of action on the part of firms in the Federal Republic of Germany to recruit female workers in this country although the circulars referred to have not come to the notice of my Department.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, our diplomatic and consular representatives are available to Irish citizens for consultation and advice in cases of difficulty.  However, any person contemplating employment abroad should, in the normal course, insist in advance on a proper contract supplemented by full information from the prospective employer concerning such matters as tax and social security deductions, accommodation facilities and local living conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the last part of the <Col N="188" /> question, there are official regulations in the Federal Republic providing that foreign workers be given the same wage rates and conditions as German workers in similar employment.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add that the Government have no power to prevent Irish citizens from accepting employment abroad and in any case there is no evidence that working conditions in Germany are not in general up to the standards of other socially advanced countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether Irish nationals who go to Germany, or any other country, to take up employment are notified of the fact that they can enlist the aid of our representatives in these countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A notice is given to every person applying for a passport if the person is going to live in Europe. It gives a list of our diplomatic representatives and the applicants are urged to call upon our ambassadorial and consular services in case of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I furnish the Minister's Department with the circular to which I referred and the information I have as to the number of girls who have gone to Germany for this kind of employment, may I hope and expect that our ambassador will take an interest in the welfare of these girls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Each and every one that we know of going to Germany or any other country for employment is, as I have said, advised to get in touch with our diplomatic representatives abroad in case of difficulty; they are also warned that before leaving Ireland they should be fully conversant with the terms and conditions of the employment.  They are also asked, when they go to these countries and find out definitely where they are to stay, to advise our local office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in view of recent speculative press reports about the possible withdrawal of the services of the Irish contingent at present serving with the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, he has any statement to make in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish contingent serving with the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus will be maintained for the period of its commitment, that is until 26th June, 1965, when the present mandate established by the Security Council expires.</P>
      <P>A request for a continuation of the contingent would not ordinarily be expected from the Secretary-General of the United Nations unless and until the Security Council decides to extend the mandate.  If such a request should be received, the Government would take a decision in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, our troops have been in Cyprus for over 12 months and only a very few other countries have contributed contingents to the United Nations Force there.  We have urged on the Secretary-General that, if the mandate of the Force is to be prolonged beyond 26th June next, he should endeavour to broaden the base of participation by seeking contingents from other countries.  A wider participation would not only relieve those Member States which have hitherto shouldered the burden but would also have the very desirable and important effect of extending the list of countries with experience of United Nations peace-keeping operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider referring this matter to the Dáil when a decision has to be made as to whether the stay of Irish troops is to be extended over a period of 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="190" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we could get in touch with the Leaders of the Opposition Parties on the matter and see whether it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully suggest it is necessary.  The Minister will remember that the Dáil gave unanimous approval to the Government's decision to send troops to Cyprus but at the time there was no indication that the period might be prolonged.  Now it has run over 12 months and in my opinion and the opinion of my Party, it ought to be referred to the Dáil before a decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuation of the county area proposed to be taken into Cork city under the County Borough of Cork (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1965, is £152, 763 3s.</P>
      <P>The valuation of the same area (a) at the time of the sworn inquiry, from 23rd May, 1961 to 7th February, 1962, was £133,984 19s.; (b) for the financial year 1964-65 was £147,509 13s.; and (c) for the financial year 1965-66 was the aforementioned figure of £152,763 3s.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that business premises, small shops, dwellinghouses, etc., in the rural area proposed to be included in Cork city carry close on double the valuation of similar premises in the city; and if in order that the owners may be fairly treated he will order an immediate revaluation of Cork city.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. <Col N="191" /> As regards the second part of the question, the initiative in the matter of a general revaluation of a county borough area rests with the County Borough Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state in what year the city of Cork was valued for rating purposes; and if he is aware that both business premises and dwellinghouses in the urban areas in Cork county, particularly in the towns of Cobh, Fermoy, Youghal and Midleton, have a valuation per square foot which is on average double the valuation of the business premises in the principal streets of Cork city; and whether in view of the unfair burden of rates thrown on these towns and districts under the joint body known as the Cork Health Authority area he will order an immediate revaluation of Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the Deputy's question is as follows:&mdash; (1)  The city of Cork was valued in 1852 as part of the original primary valuation of the country carried out by Sir Richard Griffith; (2) I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The initiative in the matter of a general revaluation of a county borough area rests with the County Borough Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="192" /> Local Government if he is aware of the difficulties at present experienced by would-be purchasers of private dwellings in obtaining mortgage loans to enable them to purchase; and if he will take steps as a matter of urgency to overcome those difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussions with representatives of leading building societies earlier this year, I was assured that the rate of applications as well as the inflow of capital to the societies' funds was unprecedented, that most societies were lending more than last year, that they expected to continue to do so and that current applications were being dealt with normally.  Since then I have been keeping the matter under review in conjunction with general policy regarding house purchase loans by local authorities and I am having recent press reports investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that persons with an income of £1,050 per year are now in the situation that they cannot get a loan for a house from the Local Loans Fund and cannot get a loan from a building society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This I am not aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only take the Deputy's word for it until I find out what the situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that five building societies have indicated that they will not accept applications for housing loans for three months and that others have indicated that they will not advance any money for the purchase of business premises until September of 1965?  Will the Minister say what steps he proposes to take to ameliorate the position of people who wish to purchase houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the situation being as the Deputy suggests it is, although I am aware from newspaper reports that certain societies are not taking any further applications for loans until they have cleared up the present backlog of applications.  I am not aware either that this is an unusual <Col N="193" /> situation or that it is in any way startling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that several builders have suspended operations because they cannot close transactions which were entered into four, five or six months ago because the people who were able to pay the deposits at that time are now unable to obtain their money from the building societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that what the Deputy says is true.  I have seen certain reports in newspapers but until I know something more about these reports, I am not prepared to accept that the situation is as the Deputy suggests.  Neither am I prepared to accept the Deputy's further suggestion that this situation has been arising over a period of three months.  The building societies lent more money for building in the past year than they did at any other time in their history.  They advanced over £12 million in the past year.  That is far above the amount advanced in the previous year and still more than that advanced in the year 1962-63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the building societies must have advanced a great deal more money than they did previously because of the extreme inflation occurring in house property?  Even though they are advancing much more money, fewer people are able to purchase houses because of the inflated prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase from £7½ million to over £12 million can hardly be said to have been caused by an increase in the cost of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister should tell us that he does not know what the situation is.  A couple of threepenny telephone calls would get him all the information he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of a telephone call is 4d.  If the Deputy consults Deputy Ryan, he will find that according to his earlier statement, five building societies are doing one thing and a number of others doing something else to obviously there must be more than five building societies.</P>

      <P>As the person referred to in the question is in receipt of disability benefit, which is not subject to a means test, his circumstances were not investigated by my Department in the course of determining title.  He has no dependants, within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts, and is in receipt of disability benefit at the maximum weekly rate applicable to an unmarried man.  A dependant's allowance is payable in respect of a female adult relative only where the claimant is maintaining her for the purpose of looking after a dependent child or children normally residing with him.  If this claimant's sister is unable by her own industry or other lawful means to provide the necessaries of life for herself, it is open to her to apply to the local assistance officer for a home assistance allowance.

      <P>Further discussions took place late in February last between officers of my Department, officers of the British Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and officers of the Ministry of Health and Social Services of Northern Ireland on the possibility of reciprocal arrangements in regard to pensions.  Plans to act as a basis for arrangements were conditionally drawn up during these discussions and are since being studied on both sides.  Further proposals are awaited from the British side in regard to the financial and other aspects of the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to the remarks made in recent months by the Most Rev. Dr. Birch, Bishop of Ossory, regarding the fact that it is impossible for a man to rear a family on agricultural workers' wages, and suggesting that these wages be very substantially increased by means of direct State subvention; and whether he will take any steps to put such a suggestion into practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report which attributes to Most Rev. Dr. Birch a suggestion that a State grant be paid to each agricultural labourer equivalent to the present standard or minimum wage.  While I appreciate the considerations which prompted Most Rev. Dr. Birch's suggestion, I have no doubt that his proposal would be impracticable not only on the grounds of the very high cost involved but also because of the social and economic problems which would be created <i>vis-à-vis</i> farmers, farm family members and other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a substantial increase in the minimum agricultural wage coupled with a reduction of hours of work, has already been announced to take effect from the 24th May.  The Government have taken a wide variety of measures, through price support and otherwise, to increase incomes of those <Col N="200" /> engaged in agriculture, including farmers, members of their families and hired workers.  I believe that the continuation of these policies is the best way of increasing the welfare of all those working on the land.</P>

      <P>I have looked into this matter very carefully and there is really no case at all for continuing or reopening the office.  It was closed a few months ago but there are sub-offices all around it.  One is as near as 2¾ miles, another 2¼ miles, another three miles, and another four miles.  There is a bus service to Monaghan where there is a post office which transacts all post office business.  The office in Greenans at no time had a postman.  It did not sell money orders and at the time it was closed only 13 old age pensioners were going there.  The number of purely post office transactions, excluding the sale of stamps and telephone calls, was only 17 per week.  At present there is a shopkeeper licensed to sell stamps and arrangements are being made for a coin-box telephone service in a local shop.  Taking all these matters into consideration, one could not possibly consider, on grounds of economy, re-opening the office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress last night, I expressed disappointment on my own behalf and on behalf of my Party at the absence of any worthwhile gleam of hope in the Minister's speech in regard to bringing about a much-needed acceleration in the building drive and bringing some encouragement to the hundreds and thousands of families throughout the country who are living in shocking housing circumstances.  I listened carefully to the Minister's remarks.  I was appalled that there could be at this juncture such utter complacency in regard to the problem of the rehousing of our people.  In order to have some idea of the dimensions of the problem, let us consider some facts in regard to it.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's admission in this House on 2nd June last, there were 70,000 unfit dwellings in the country and 60,000 of these unfit dwellings were in rural areas.  There are, then, many thousands of people still living in shabby tenement flats for which they are charged exorbitant rents, countless thousands of people still condemned to live in hovels in insanitary conditions and conditions of gross overcrowding. Yet, there is no hope contained in the Minister's remarks that even in the foreseeable future this kind of chronic purgatory with which they have to contend will have ended.</P>
      <P>Again according to the Minister's figures, there are some 670,000 dwellings in the country as a whole.  Of that number 300,000 are over 60 years old and 160,000 are over 100 years old.  We have to contend with a waiting list in Dublin city of over 8,000 while there are 70,000 unfit dwellings in the country as a whole and an obsolescence rate of upwards of 2¼ per cent, which means that we require from 6,500 to 8,000 houses annually to contend with obsolescent housing alone.  Having regard to the fact that at the present time we are building an average of only 3,000 houses per year, one can see the colossal gap that has to be made up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1964-65, the number of houses erected by local authorities was 2,385, at a time when there are 70,000 unfit <Col N="214" /> dwellings and a waiting list in this city alone of over 8,000 persons.  One would imagine in these sad circumstances that the Minister would have taken certain positive steps to accelerate the housing drive and give all these people a chance at last of having a home of their own.</P>
    <P>There is a solution to the problem but there was no gleam of that solution in the Minister's remarks.  Questions were raised here today in regard to the difficulties facing the people in the £13 to £20 a week income bracket, who are traditional house builders. These traditional home seekers and builders in that income bracket are finding extreme difficulty today in obtaining the sites, the grants and the loans for the purpose of erecting their new homes.  These young married couples anticipating a home of their own are harassed, frustrated, disappointed and exploited today as never before in this country.</P>
    <P>The price of sites for house building has increased out of all proportion in the past 12 months.  The price has increased from £100 to £300 in rural areas.  It has increased by 300 per cent at least in the cities and towns.  There has been a colossal increase in house building profits and the cost of houses for the type of persons I have mentioned&mdash; three bedroom houses&mdash;has increased by almost £1,000 in the past 12 months.  Obviously, there is a curtailment of credit for these people. The recognised lending agencies have frozen loans.  There is evidence in this House, in this city and in this country today that loans are not being made available to these people.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances one would expect the Minister for Local Government, who is primarily responsible for the housing of our people, to put down this kind of exploitation.  There was one instance, be it said to the Minister's credit, in which he did feel disposed to act and may I say that in that regard, when he saw obvious profiteering of a serious kind which would hinder the housing drive, he did step in.  But the Minister halted very promptly and it would seem that the Minister, to all intents and purposes, <Col N="215" /> gave way to the vested interests in housing.</P>
    <P>In every progressive country this kind of rationalisation is put down.  In every progressive country where there is strict regard for the welfare of the people to whom I have referred and to the social need to rehouse people, there is restriction on the price of land, there is restriction on the kind of profits which anyone may take in the building industry.  But in this country it seems to go unbridled and there are no controls whatsoever to maintain land values and the cost of new house building at reasonable levels which the ordinary people can afford.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at his disposal very many ways and means of helping these young people who want to build houses for themselves.  Assuming that they secure sites for themselves, they are fortunate if they can meet the kind of prices being asked today and they have to contend with a great many difficulties from there on.  If their incomes exceed £832 per year they are precluded from getting the local authority grant for new house building. If their income is in excess of £1,040 per year they are precluded from getting a loan through the local authority. They are penalised for having too low an income.  At £17 a week, which is £832 a year approximately, a person is debarred from the local authority grant of £275, which is a considerable amount to a young married couple embarking for the first time on the venture of building a new house.  These grants are vital to these people.  They automatically qualify for a State grant of £275&mdash;there is no income or means test for that grant&mdash;but for the local authority grant of £275 there is this odious, archaic and outmoded means test that if the income of the applicant and his wife exceeds £832 per year they are precluded from getting that essential £275 grant towards the cost of their new home.</P>
    <P>An income of £17 or £18 a week is not regarded as high in these times. Most skilled workers, tradesmen, artisans, highly-skilled factory workers, white collar workers generally are all now in the £1,000 a year bracket, or <Col N="216" /> thereabouts.  The Minister must realise that he is depriving a vast number of people of these new housing grants by continuing to apply a figure of £832. He must also realise that the figure which I have quoted of £1,040 to which Deputy Donegan referred in a question here today is again ridiculously low in these times in order to secure a loan from the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say to me that local authorities have the right to make allowances for dependants, such as children, in order to get over the figure of £832 for grant purposes and £1,040 for loan purposes. While the Minister has, to his credit, circularised the local authorities to the effect that they could take into account dependent relatives and thereby secure the grant on a figure in excess of the figure I have mentioned, the fact is that that is not contained in the Loans and Grants Act of 1962.  Many local authorities have had senior counsel's advice on this matter, and senior counsel's advice in the matter was that there would be a grave risk attached to deviating from the Act and that if there were any deviation by way of allowances for dependent relatives provided there was likely to be the question of surcharge.  Many local authorities, on the basis of senior counsel's advice, have confined themselves, and rightly so, to the Act.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to give relief under this heading which is scourging so many thousands of couples today with young families he must amend the Loans and Grants Act, 1962, or he could very well include amending legislation in his new Housing Bill which is anxiously awaited by this House and by the country at large.  It might be said that the person with £832 per week, which is equivalent to £16 per week approximately, ought not embark upon new house building.  He would hardly be regarded as a good risk by a county manager in determining whether he should get a loan or not.  However, these people with that kind of income in the past have been used to building their own homes.  The Minister must have regard to the increased costs to which I have referred in land, house-building and the cost of living generally due to the 12 per <Col N="217" /> cent increase for wage and salary earners.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say to me, as he has in the past, that in respect of loans for new houses the local authority can borrow from another source for this purpose and so facilitate these people, or to say that these people's incomes are on such a level that they should be able to secure these loans from the recognised lending companies.  We have seen what the lending companies are doing today. They are freezing on loans to these people.  When the Minister expects these people to secure the money from these lending companies he knows that they are going to be charged an additional amount of interest over and above what they would secure that loan for through the local authority. It is unfair of any Minister for Local Government to push these people into the position of having to secure money from money lenders who are in some instances charging an exorbitant and sometimes an extortionate rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I would express the hope that the Minister will in his new Housing Bill increase the grant of £275 which has for too long been on the Statute Book in this House having regard to modern trends, prices, and the fall in the value of money.  He should also increase the grant for repairs and reconstruction. These are very valuable grants which have done much to maintain houses in decent repair and I hope the Minister will appreciate the desirability of increasing this grant.  Before I pass from the subject I would make a fervent appeal to the Minister to raise the ceiling of £832 in respect of grants to something like £1,500, as being a more practical figure in these times, and to increase the ceiling for loans from £1,040 to something nearer £2,000 in order to bring in all these people who want to avail of loans from the local authority and who do not wish to be fleeced by money lenders.</P>
    <P>The most amazing feature of the Minister's speech was in respect of his reference to the need for a rational rents policy.  The Minister talked about <Col N="218" /> the desirability of a revision upwards in rents of all houses built before 1950. He talked about the problem of providing housing accommodation for poor families at rents which they can afford and said it must be solved in the main by housing authorities adopting rational rent policies.  The Minister stated that the share of the burden which the taxpayer can assume is limited as must be the ratepayers' share in view of the increasing burden of rates all over the country.  The Minister said there were 60,000 such houses in the country today, 60,000 cottages, urban dwellings and corporation houses which were built before 1950.  One of the solutions offered by the Minister for our whole housing problem was to increase the rents of these houses and thereby, allegedly, make it possible for people to secure new houses today at rents which they could afford.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that a reasonable increase in the rental of these homes, related to the ability of the tenant to pay, would go a long way towards solving the financial problem of providing houses for poor families at rents which they can afford.  The Minister does tenants a very grave disservice by making the statement he did in this House yesterday.  In the <i>Irish Press</i>, the Government organ, the bannerline  the Minister secured this morning reads: &ldquo;Rational Rents Policy Urged.  Minister's Advice to Housing Authorities&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Very good, Sir, but the Minister is responsible for sounding this clarion call to county managers to proceed forthwith to rackrent 60,000 council tenants all over the country.  The Minister's statement was unwise, unwarranted and wholly unjustified. To me it represents an attack upon the rights of tenants of local authorities.  The statement could be fraught with very serious consequences because, if the Minister thinks for one moment that the pre-1950 tenants will suffer an attack upon their rights by way of an unjust increase in their <Col N="219" /> rents, and take that lying down, he is making a great mistake.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that increasing the rents on the pre-1950 tenants would help those in need of rehousing at the moment, especially the poorer sections of the community who cannot afford to pay the rents local authorities are obliged to charge, is founded on a false premise.  It was unfair of the Minister to make that suggestion because it involves an odious comparison between modern houses and those built before 1950.  Many of the latter are 30 to 40 years old.  They were built cheaply.  Many are now regarded as substandard.  They are primitive in comparison with modern houses. Modern houses, though one has to pay dearly for them and, in some cases, at great sacrifice, are in some degree worth the rents charged.  At least the people have decent modern homes, with bathrooms, hot water, built in presses and other amenities.  The houses built before 1950, on which the Minister now wants to increase the rents, are in the main comprised of only four walls.  They have no bathrooms or indoor toilets.  They have no built-in presses.  They have no terrazo floors, no pleasant surroundings, no concrete or tarmacadam paths.</P>
      <P>I know these houses intimately because I am a member of a housing authorities who take rents for some excessively damp and cold in winter time.  They are regarded by many of the Minister's own colleagues as substandard. Rather than increase the rents, I have always felt that local authorities who take rents for some of these houses should be ashamed of themselves.  They are not worth the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest, as the Minister has suggested, that the rents of these houses have not been increased since they were fixed many years ago. Rent, inclusive of rates, has increased by at least 200 per cent.  I would go further and say that the people who have paid rents for these houses for 30 or 40 years have actually paid for the houses two and three times over.  To suggest now that the solution to the housing problem is to increase the rents of pre-1950 tenants, and <Col N="220" /> everything in the garden will be lovely, is an admission in my opinion, of both hopelessness and helplessness on the part of the Minister and his Department. It offers no solution to the gigantic problem with which we have to contend.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the sentiments expressed by Deputy Tully yesterday on behalf of the Labour Party; we deplore this statement by the Minister, this intimation to housing authorities and county managers that the time is now ripe for them to extract an increase in rent from 60,000 pre-1950 local authority tenants throughout the country, to extract a number of undetermined extra shillings per week from these people on the erroneous assumption that that will bring about a decrease in rents in relation to those going into new houses today.  I wonder what grounds the Minister has for thinking that, if these rents are increased, that will automatically bring down the rents on new houses.  I have had experience of rents being increased on the understanding that the extra money garnered would be ploughed back into the houses by way of repairs and improvements.  The revenue amounted to £1,000 per year but I saw no evidence of any kind of that money being ploughed back into the maintenance and repair of the properties concerned.</P>
    <P>If these rents are increased what will happen is that the extra revenue realised will go into the coffers of the local authority and be utilised for services such as lighting, sanitation, roads, health, and so on.  It may well be used, as would be the aim of most local authorities, to reduce rates.  The resultant situation will be that the poor will be asked to subsidise the rich.  I can see no justification for any increase in the rents of the pre-1950 tenants and I can see no evidence that any such increase could have any effect in reducing the rents for those who are at present unable to meet them.  If this advice by the Minister is pursued, it will cause a great deal of anxiety, unrest, indignation and organised opposition by tenant associations.  The Labour members, both in this House and in every local council, will oppose this measure and see to it that the rights <Col N="221" /> of pre-1950 tenants are respected and that there is not imposed on them an unfair rent which cannot be justified on moral or financial grounds.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is genuinely concerned about the inability of people to take houses because of the rents that have to be charged, there are obvious ways of dealing with that problem.  The Minister has power to increase the housing subsidy and make aid available to local authorities by other means.  But, obviously, he is seeking to pass the buck back to the local authorities and evade his responsibility in the matter.  It is his function to see to it that houses are built and that the incomes of the tenants are such that they can pay the rent charged. It is an indictment of our governmental system, and indeed of our society at large, that we are building houses today but the standard of living of our people is so low that they cannot pay the kind of rent being charged.</P>
    <P>The new Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy P. Brennan, has just come in. I wish to extend to him my good wishes for his success in this very important Department.  The reason people cannot afford to pay the rents they are charged today is the exorbitant interest rates charged for the money which must be borrowed.  Every £1,000 a local authority borrows for house building over a period of 30 or 40 years, has to be paid back two and a half times.  We are suffering an element of usury and extortion in respect of the financing of housing in this country. I deplore the complacency of the Minister and his Department.  In other progressive countries they have resolved the housing problem by making available cheap money&mdash;money at reduced rates of interest&mdash;to the local authorities and to the building agencies for the rehousing of their people.  If the Minister cannot see his way to increase subsidies, why not make the money available, not at seven and a half per cent, but at three per cent or even four per cent?  In that way we could reduce rents at once.  Why have we to tolerate for so long this extortion being perpetrated on our people which has caused so much misery in <Col N="222" /> so many homes throughout the country?  Again, I must deplore this attempt by the Minister to pass the responsibility back to the local authorities and outrage 60,000 tenants by this unfair and unwarranted attack on their rights and the threat of increased rents.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain aspects of the Minister's speech enthusiastically, especially the proposals for site acquisition by agreement.  The Minister has now recognised the wisdom of leaving to local authorities that which they can effectively do themselves.  The exasperating policy of submitting almost every proposal to the Minister's Department, which has caused so much annoyance, would seem to be on the way out.  An official could hardly write a letter without its requiring the sanction of the Minister.  It had to be submitted to Dublin, and delay and exasperation resulted.  It is good to see the Minister at last showing a sense of trust in the members and officials of local authorities and allowing them to do that which they can competently do.</P>
    <P>It would now seem that, if there is agreement in respect of site acquisition, the proposals need not be submitted to the Department.  That is a welcome change.  I hope that in a short time we will have more co-operation and help from the Department, that we will have the guidance of the housing manual to which the Minister referred for the layout of schemes and the design of houses, so that at last there will be a speeding up of housing generally. Much of the red tape and green tape we have had to contend with will have been swept away and we will have made some progress.</P>
    <P>The very name of the Department, the Department of Local Government, of necessity implies decentralisation and the delegation of duties.  The Minister is the Minister for Local Government and not the Minister for central Government. The Labour Party want to see more powers being handed back to members of local authorities.  We want to see them do that which they can competently and energetically do.  In that regard we think it desirable that there should be another look at the County Management Act and a curtailment <Col N="223" /> of the powers vested in county managers.  These powers might have been appropriate many years ago when this State was emerging out of years of thralldom and when we carried over many unsavoury practices from life under a foreign regime.</P>
    <P>Now that we have long since passed that adolescent stage and have entered into an era of adult responsibility it is time that the vast powers reposed in county managers should to some extent be shed and conferred once again on the members of the local authorities.  There are many enterprising and dedicated young men who want to take part in public life, to give their services to their local community, but they are deterred from doing so by reason of the fact that it has gone abroad that members of local authorities no longer have any powers and that all the worthwhile power is vested in the county manager.  The young man today who enters public life full of enthusiasm to improve the lot of his community will be quickly frustrated when he finds that all his proposals and all his views are futile because what he advocates is an executive function of the county manager.</P>

      <P>I think I have said enough on the subject to catch the ear <Col N="224" /> of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I want now to advert to the question of the vesting of cottages and houses and to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department what I consider to be an anomaly in this regard. The Minister expressed concern that more people in urban areas were not vesting their houses and becoming owners of their property.  I find that quite a substantial number of council tenants do show an inclination to vest their cottages.  Some do it voluntarily and others, I regret to say, do it under a form of compulsion in as much as where repairs are concerned priority is given to those who have vested and in exasperation, having waited for years for repairs to be carried out, one is compelled to vest in order to have a job done.  Many people whom I know have, largely, become unwilling owners of property in this way.  I believe in the diffusion of private property; it is very laudable that people should own their own homes and I fully approve of it.  For a county council tenant to vest it is a very simple transaction and rightly so.  There are no legal fees, no great documentation involved and no anxiety for the applicant.  There is also the fundamental right to appeal to the Minister if one is dissatisfied with any repairs carried out.  That applies to a householder under a local authority in the rural areas but let us look at the situation in an urban area, or in one of the corporation boroughs.  Here it is no simple transaction to vest your house.  There are substantial legal fees involved of approximately £25.  I understand also that the tenant does not have the right to repairs to the house that his county council tenant colleague enjoys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are anomalies which should be rectified.  If it is a simple transaction to vest county council cottages, I know of no good reason why the same procedure should not be applied to the corporation or urban dweller.  If we can get rid of the question of legal fees&mdash; I know that there are plenty of legal men present who can speak on this and I do not claim to represent them&mdash;we would see many more people becoming owners of their own houses.  It is only right also that the corporation tenant or the urban council tenant should <Col N="225" /> have the same right to repairs and the same appeal to the Minister as the county council tenant enjoys.</P>
    <P>On the question of vesting repairs for cottages I want to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Department the alarming state of affairs whereby last year there were 853 appeals to the Minister's Department against the kind of repairs which were carried out.  Dissatisfaction was expressed by 853 tenants and the Minister determined these appeals and extra works were prescribed in 692 cases.  In other words, in only 161 out of 853 cases was it determined that the work had been properly carried out.  That is an extremely high percentage and it raises a question regarding the kind of work carried out.  It also raises a question in regard to the overseers or supervisors who approved this work as being satisfactory.  The engineers who approved of the work in the first instance and submitted that the work was satisfactory did not do themselves or their profession a very good service, in my opinion.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that ways and means are devised to ensure that proper repair work is done in the first instance and thus obviate the whole question of having to instruct the county council to go back and carry out additional work.</P>
    <P>I want to say how much we regret the absence of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not hope to get any political kudos by referring to the absence of this very desirable scheme. I only hope that the Minister responsible for dropping this very laudable scheme in a fit of pique might once again, in a calmer and more logical atmosphere, look at it again and see whether or not it should be restored. It was invaluable to every local authority. In 1955 the Government spent £300,000 on local authorities under this Act; in 1956 they spent £749,000; in 1957 they spent £602,000.  In the constituency which I represent, it meant for our people an average of £17,000 a year.  That was a lot of money.  Much good work was done in the way of drainage of rivers, the building of bridges, repairs to roads and footpaths, <Col N="226" /> and the provision of amenities generally for our people which we could not afford to provide out of the rates.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that it was a very great slander on the integrity of so many engineers and county council officials all over the country to allege that when this Act was in operation the money was squandered.  The money was not squandered and it is unfair to perpetuate this slander.  The money provided valuable employment for many hundreds of workers in all our counties.  It provided work at a time of the year when other work had run out.  I suggest to the new Parliamentary Secretary, who is uncontaminated with the strife of other times, that he should have another look at the desirability of restoring this very desirable scheme that has done so much good work already and that can do so much good work in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the grants for the repair and reconstruction of houses.  The stipulation that the applicant for such a grant must have the permission of the owner has led to difficulties.  I always understood that the tenant of a house was entitled to the grant but it seems that in many cases memoranda are despatched from the Department asking the tenants to get the permission of the owner.  In many cases the owner cannot be found and in many other cases the owner is unwilling to allow the tenant to proceed with the repairs.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position.  If the tenant is entitled to the grant he should not have to get the owner's permission and if the owner's permission is necessary and if he is unwilling to co-operate, the Department should permit the tenant to proceed with the work on his own.</P>
    <P>The greatest difficulty I find with regard to these grants for repairs and reconstruction is in respect of business premises.  It is not fair that people who have business premises or public houses on the side of the road and who are paying high rates should be debarred from these grants in respect of that part of the premises used for <Col N="227" /> business purposes.  These people are ratepayers in their own right and, unlike our farmer friends, any improvement they carry out on their premises is quickly followed by a revaluation of the property and upward movement in the rates.  The man who originally drafted this legislation must have been temperate in the extreme because he actually stipulated that publicans should be precluded from obtaining the grants.</P>
    <P>This is most unfair.  These business people are finding it very difficult to compete against the supermarkets.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at the situation and see if he can apply the grants to the business community the same as they are applied to other sections of the community. There is no reason why these grants should not apply to the average publican or grocer.</P>
    <P>It is foolish for anyone to say that these grants are being given free, gratis and for nothing.  In such cases revaluation of the property follows at once and we have found to our surprise and horror that valuations have increased out of all proportion as a result of these repair and reconstruction grants being availed of.  I have seen council property revalued and increased from £4 10s. to £8, almost double.  I do not know how such action can be justified.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the condition of road workers under the local authorities and to express the hope that the Minister will provide greater continuity of employment for these people having regard to the fact that they come under superannuation and in order to qualify for that superannuation they must have 200 days work in the year.  Every local authority should provide that 200 days in order to enable their workers to qualify for superannuation.  It should not be outside the bounds of possibility to do this and so to build up a permanent labour force for the local authority. It is desirable to ensure that when the road workers reach 65 years of age they should have qualified for a pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> There is another aspect of this Superannuation Act which I should like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Where men are obliged to opt out of the provisions of the Act and to withdraw their money, the tendency is to dismiss them ignominiously and to ensure that they will never again be employed by the county council.  Where there is a good and cogent reason for men taking this action&mdash;it may be extreme financial difficulty, unemployment over a long period, or ignorance&mdash;that regulation would seem to be unduly severe and harsh.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter and to provide that where there is a good and cogent reason for the withdrawal of the money from the fund, the man should not be debarred from again being employed by the council.  I do not represent the man who acts in this way in full realisation of what he is doing but I do make an appeal on behalf of those who, through accident or misfortune, were forced to take out their money.  It is wrong that they should be proscribed from ever again getting a job with the local authority.</P>
    <P>When the Planning Bill was going through this House, I supported many features of it.  I believe in the zoning of our cities and towns and in the provision of industrial, residential and recreation areas in them.  We must make every effort to remove the bottlenecks, the sources of congestion, the eyesores and the ugliness which were a feature of many of our cities, towns and villages in the past.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of the Planning Acts, I ask the Minister and his Department to admonish town and city planners to have respect for and safeguard things that are precious in the way of historic buildings and holy places.  It is regrettable that planners, in their anxiety for progress, are inclined to sweep away before the bulldozer many places and objects of very great historic importance.  I want these places preserved.  This is an ancient land; we have a grand and proud tradition to uphold.  We have an obligation to safeguard and maintain these places of cultural or historic importance. <Col N="229" /> Already, by reason of this planning, we have had town walls, old gates, castles, churches and even graveyards in this city violated in a sacrilegious way in the interests of planning and progress. We do not want progress at any price: we must have respect for our cultural heritage.  The tourist of the future will not want to see a modern city with boulevards and glasshouses rising to the sky and such artificial orderliness as one sees in other modern cities: he wants to see something of our nationhood, of our storied and honoured past.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to issue an order to restrain planners and to ensure that they will have respect for these places.</P>
    <P>Even houses in our towns and cities which saw the birth of people who won renown for themselves and their country&mdash;some won world renown in the arts or literature or in the Church or in our own War of Independence&mdash; have been swept aside and left in rubble and dust, again in the interests of progress.  I am all for orderliness and planning but as regards things to which we should hold fast and which have a place of endearment in the hearts and minds of all Irishmen, the Minister should see that that which is historical, cultural, artistic, or part of the ancient heritage of this country is retained.  As Davis said: &ldquo;This country of ours is no mere landmark thrown up by some recent caprice of nature: it is an ancient land honoured in the archives of civilisation, or transcending antiquity, for its piety, its valour and its suffering.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Department of Local Government is perhaps the Department that has the closest association with the lives of our people. One of the problems facing us today is the ever-increasing rates burden. I am a member of two local authorities. I have given this matter very serious consideration and I have been dealing with people in the lower middle class who are buying their own homes. They have to meet substantial repayments on them; they are trying to rear families and meet rate bills.  This is a difficult stage for them as young people rearing families and they find <Col N="230" /> it hard to meet the rates burden.</P>
      <P>This is a national problem and I only refer to the matter because it is part and parcel of the Department. It is a matter I should like to have investigated in the near future by a commission.  I admit the high rates are justified; indeed, I am only voicing the opinion of a number of people I have met and this is their general view.  That is the problem but it is not a matter either for the Minister alone or for the Government alone. It must be seriously considered and we shall have to face the question of whether it is easier for the people to pay increased taxation through the national purse or to pay rates of £60, £70 or £80 per year in two or three moieties.  Notwithstanding the increase in prosperity in the past three years or so, the difficulty of paying big amounts of money in rates two or three times a year presents a problem for many people, especially retired people and those on fixed incomes or pensions and who are buying their own homes.</P>
      <P>The time is very soon coming when a choice must be made between paying rates as at present and paying a proportion by way of increased taxation. We must see which course is best: whether the Dáil should increase taxation and relieve rates in which case the people might say: &ldquo;We do not feel it so much if we have to pay an extra 1d or 2d on some commodity but we feel it hard to find so much money for rates.&rdquo;  The terms of reference in this matter should only be whether the rates should be relieved from the national purse.  Somebody must pay and nobody can pay but the ratepayers either by rates or from national taxation.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has given me the opportunity of mentioning this as it concerns all our people but I shall leave the subject now and on some other occasion I hope we shall have a further discussion on it.</P>

    <P>I listened to Deputy Treacy on the other side of the House deploring that more had not been done in regard to housing.  I like to look forward but sometimes one is forced in this House <Col N="231" /> to go back a few years.  The whole housing machinery was really destroyed in 1956 and 1957 and it did take a few years to restore the prosperity of the nation.  We were possibly at our lowest point economically, which affected housing, sewerage, water schemes, roads and everything else.  From the opposite side of the House, I heard Deputy P. O'Donnell, as Minister for Local Government, introducing legislation to deprive certain categories of persons of loans.

In my constituency of County Dublin, there were over 1,000 houses left unfinished.  There were no loans available for them.</P>

      <P>That was the position. As soon as we were back here in 1957, I, representing County Dublin, as I do now, had to meet deputations of builders.  They asked me could we <Col N="232" /> not raise any money to pay the SDA loans, to pay reconstruction grants, to pay the ordinary grants.  The then Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government met a deputation and within a few months, a certain amount of money came to hand to relieve the shocking position that existed.  Notwithstanding all that, the people who are talking now about housing are the very people who were in office themselves and destroyed, in my estimation, the greatest machinery of all time for house building.  We lost some of our great craftsmen at that time who never returned.  Some of our best craftsmen went to the United States, Canada, and England and settled down.</P>

      <P>The whole housing situation was at a low ebb.  It had to be built up again and it did take time to build up the personnel in the various housing departments.  I am talking about the Corporation and Dublin County Council.  Now the position is so bad that the Minister has had to intervene in order to come to the relief of Dublin Corporation. He had to start a housing scheme in Ballymun for 3,120 houses.  There was not enough machinery there to enable the ordinary traditional methods to be used for building the houses that the people required.</P>
      <P>Like the Deputies on the other side of the House, I am anxious that everybody should be housed.  It is more essential to build houses than to build hospitals.  If a person has a good house something can be done for him.  It is of no use to treat a person in hospital and then send him back to a bad house.  We are all anxious to see that more and more houses will be built. Dublin Corporation have a greater programme of house building than they ever had.  There is a scheme for the building of 3,120 in Ballymun and approximately 2,000 by the traditional method under the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation.  That is no mean achievement considering that we were faced with the position that hundreds of houses were falling down. While we were receiving a deputation in Dublin Corporation from a very well-known society representing that there should be no interference with a certain type of Georgian mansions in Dublin, similar houses were falling down in other parts of the city.  We must be realistic.  I admit that another thing happened.  At one time there were over 1,800 houses idle in Dublin Corporation.</P>

There was money available during our time to carry on with building.  There is more money being put into housing in Dublin Corporation this year than ever there was before.

      <P>When we took over, there were no tradesmen there. There were over 1,000 houses left unfinished in County Dublin.  We could not get loans for them.  Then Deputy Ryan and his colleagues ask what have we done for housing, why did we not succeed in doing more than that. The Chairman of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation is a very decent man.  He is Deputy Denis Larkin.  He was chairman at that time.  He was not going to stand by and say: &ldquo;Why would we not go ahead and build more houses?&rdquo; We had so many houses as a result of this bad period after the days of the inter-Party Government that we found ourselves in the position that we did not know what was going to happen next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, of course, due to the prosperity of the country, the people started to come back in their hundreds. Deputy Ryan knows very well that <Col N="235" /> people have come to him and to me.

      <P>You can bring a horse to the water, I suppose, but you cannot make him drink.  The Minister had to intervene in order to build the houses for Dublin Corporation and inside a year he succeeded in doing a very good job.  The position in County Dublin in regard to housing was that a scheme was submitted to the then Minister for Local Government in March, 1956, for 88 houses at Lucan. An inspector was sent from the Department of Local Government and eventually it was decided that only 44 houses were required.  Everything was done to cut down on the number of houses to be built.  There was no money to acquire land.  A number of engineers and architects had left the building section of the Dublin County Council at that time.  Then Deputy Ryan will say that everything in the garden was lovely during that period.  If everything in the garden was lovely during that period, Deputy Ryan would be over here where I am now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is choosey about his company but we will not hold that against him.  As a result of the prosperity of the nation, hundreds of families have come back <Col N="236" /> to Ireland and we have now in County Dublin a programme for the building of thousands of houses, and quite a number of other schemes are under way.  We are also trying to acquire land in the county for people who are anxious to build their own homes.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of people in the city and county of Dublin are anxious to build their own houses, provided they can get sites.  The problem of acquiring sites is a very great problem in this area.  The small builder who was one time the backbone of housing for middle-class people will be crushed out in a few years time.  He built good houses at a reasonable price. The greater the number building houses, the keener the prices.  It is almost impossible for the small builder to purchase land today.  In my constituency a price of £1,500 or £1,600 per acre is being paid for undeveloped sites and land is going for up to £3,000 an acre, provided it is near the ordinary services.  However, what can we do about it if we are to allow the law of supply and demand to operate? We must consider first the prosperity of the nation, and the money is there due again to the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government since 1957, a policy which is reaping a very good reward for our people now.</P>
      <P>Purchasing a house is a very serious problem for middle-class people today under an SDA loan.  A house which could be purchased for £2,000 12 or 14 years ago is now going for over £3,000.  That is again due to the value of land.  Even Dublin Corporation had to pay almost £1,500 for a site at Ballymun, land which, I suppose, could have been purchased for about £300 two years before.  That shows the trend of events in regard to land values in County Dublin.</P>

      <P>Prosperity under the Fianna Fáil Government.  I am delighted the Deputy interrupted me to enable me to peg that home properly.  The Minister for Local Government gave out more money last year for SDA loans.  The money <Col N="237" /> has to be found some place.  We in the city and county of Dublin have got more than our share of the cake. The housing scheme in Ballymun will cost the ratepayers and the Department of Local Government approximately £10 million.  Other housing schemes will cost at least another £5 million, and the recent schemes in County Dublin, I suppose, £500,000.  Piped water schemes for the county of Dublin are costing between £3 million and £3½ million.  That is no mean achievement for the Minister for Local Government in one part of the area for which I am responsible.  Part of my constituency is in the city of Dublin and the remainder of it is in County Dublin.  The big problem the Minister has to face is how to get the money to service all these schemes.</P>
      <P>I was on the other side of the House when I remember our road grants being cut by £2 million and we had prairie roads leading from the city of Dublin.  Dublin County Council were controlled by Fine Gael and Labour, and Dublin Corporation were controlled equally by all sections.  In Dublin County Council I pointed out the shocking condition of the roads leading from Dublin.  Other counties like Kildare and Meath built better roads.  When County Dublin was controlled by the inter-Party group, they neglected the roads.  During the last two years, we have made a good effort to improve our roads in County Dublin, and the Minister for Local Government is urging that the programme be completed in the shortest time possible. Anybody leaving Dublin then on a fine day in the summertime, if he wanted to travel on any of the main roads, might take an hour to cover about ten miles in a motor car.  It might take an hour to travel seven miles.  That is the position as a result of the shortsighted policy of the people in Opposition, Labour and Fine Gael, when they allowed the Dublin County Council to lapse into the state it did.</P>

      <P>That is a superfluous question.  I must revert now to the housing position.  I am very anxious that people should purchase their own homes.  Out of 5,205 tenants in County Dublin, 4,218 have purchased their own homes and another 146 are awaiting vesting.  There is a problem under the Dublin Corporation. We have 38,000 ordinary tenants. Deputy Ryan will correct me if I am wrong.  About 5,000 approximately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is no more than 1,000 wrong this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;approximately&rdquo;. If we could encourage the 38,000 or 39,000 to purchase their own homes, we would first require legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No legislation is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation will have to make a recommendation.  I had a motion down on a few occasions and we were told that, when the tenants were circularised,  the response was very poor. They were not anxious to buy their own houses.  The only way in which they might be encouraged to buy would be if they found their rents going up year after year.  Now I always resist increasing rents because I believe an agreement, once entered into, should be honoured.  I regard an agreement as sacred.  We shall have to go into the matter of encouraging these tenants to buy at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all understood that, once section 35 of the Town Planning Act came into operation, we would have no further trouble with unfinished estates. Unfortunately, that has not been the evolution.  Unfinished estates are still a headache and the law agent has <Col N="239" /> picked out four specific cases to be tested in the courts before we go any further.  This is a slow and cumbersome process.  In County Dublin there are estates in which the roads and footpaths have not been finished.  Dublin Councy Council will not take them over unless they are constructed to their specifications.  Mary's Park in Crumlin has been there now for 14 years without a road being swept.  The tenants are paying increased rates. Their ground rent is about £15.  We also have the Wainsfort and Manor Estates equally unfinished.  I shall not bore the House mentioning the others but these are two specific estates in which we have been particularly interested recently.  Their unfinished condition constitutes a problem.</P>
    <P>Some time ago legislation was passed enabling us to take over <i>culs-de-sac</i> and maintain them.  We are now in the position that we are allowed to spend only £2,000 per year taking over these <i>culs-de-sac.</i> At that rate of progress we shall all be as old as Methusaleh before we catch up on the backlog.  This problem also arises in other countries.  I appeal to the Minister to give increased grants to local authorities to enable them to take over these lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i> and maintain them.  People living in them have to walk through pools of water in winter to reach their homes and these people pay rates in the same way as those who enjoy all the amenities on the main or second-class road.  These laneways are a problem and something will have to be done about them.  We have succeeded in taking over a certain number under rural improvements schemes.</P>
    <P>In view of the demand for houses at present, the Government will have to consider seriously the question of raising the ceiling for SDA loans. That is a problem we will have to solve.</P>
    <P>Another problem that is proving a headache for the city and county of Dublin is the itinerant problem.  The Minister has appointed a body to advise him on this, but I can advise him from 20 years' experience that there is no use putting an itinerants' <Col N="240" /> camp beside a residential area.  The people will object to it and have a right to do so.  There should be no itinerants' camp within a mile or a mile and a half of a residential area. I am a member of a society which have housed itinerants in certain housing estates.  I will not name them because Deputy Ryan might say I was trying to put them in his place.  We have had to take quite a number of them out of that estate again.  We cannot do anything with the present generation.  If we can succeed in putting them into camps and educating the second generation, it is the only chance we have. Even today I got complaints about the damage itinerants had done in parts of my constituency, how impudent they had been and how they had terrorised certain families in that district. To deal with this problem, we will have to be cruel to be kind.  Even if we had to double up on social welfare payments to get them off the road, I would be all for it.</P>

      <P>Go out to the camp opposite Cherry Orchard Hospital and ask the opinion of the people living 20 yards from it.  Those people, who bought their houses for £3,000 or £4,000, are entitled to protection. As far as I can see, the itinerants are the only people who have protection.  They can do what they like and get away with it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's comment is beneath contempt.  People are trying to run out of Palmerstown <Col N="241" /> because of the way they are surrounded by itinerants and the persecution they suffer.  A committee of Dublin County Council and the Corporation have been trying to get sites. Even if we have to buy certain farms at a price and have to put in sewerage and water, we should do so in order to put these people into camps where they will not annoy anybody.  A man who has paid £3,000 for his house is entitled to protection.  Perhaps his wife has planted roses in the garden.  There is no protection if the itinerants' horses eat them at night.  That position should be ended.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy said we should have cheap money.  If there was a way of getting cheap money, I am surprised Deputy Corish did not get it from 1955 to 1957.</P>

      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act scheme started in the middle of the stream and stopped in the middle of the stream because no money was allocated <Col N="242" /> to continue it.  The only way to do this is by arterial drainage.  We shall deal with that on another day, at another time with another Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the amenity grants the Minister introduced during the past two years availed of to a greater extent by local authorities.  I know our priority is housing, water, sewerage and roads, but our amenity scheme should keep pace with the times.  I have travelled abroad a lot during the past few years and I have seen up-to-date swimming pools built in popular areas to the advantage of the people.  I am very disappointed that even my own two local authorities have not availed of the amenity grants offered by the Minister to deal with this problem.  I should like to take this opportunity again of saying how much we appreciated the schemes in regard to parks, playing fields and swimming pools.  These are very essential amenities and we have to move with the times.  It is a disgrace that in Dublin we have only one swimming pool, that is, the one at Tara Street.  The other swimming pool is a private enterprise run by a very well known firm.  We have a scheme under consideration at present but we should be more up and coming in regard to these ventures, and if the Minister could send a directive to the local authorities, we will support him.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the work he is doing and I will now give Deputy Ryan the opportunity to speak and he will agree with everything I have said this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always enjoy listening to my old friend, Deputy Burke, and I am always saddened when he leaves because he never wants to know what we are going to say about him. Of course it is out of order to deal with Deputy Burke but it is always instructive and entertaining to listen to him.  This portrayal of everything being right at the moment and of everything being wrong when we were in power is interesting, apart from the way Deputy Burke puts it across.  I do not think everything is right at the moment, nor that everything was right when we were in power.  All administrations <Col N="243" /> try to do their best.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Burke had remained, I was going to suggest that he might go to Griffith Barracks where 40 families are housed because there are no houses elsewhere for them in Dublin.  Husbands get in to see their wives and families once a day and that lovely paternal countenance and the benign atmosphere he uses so well around his constituency for political purposes could well be used by Deputy Burke in Griffith Barracks where these little children and these mothers would be pleased to see one of their Deputies calling on them.  The husbands get in only once a day but I am sure that Deputy Burke with his influence would be able to get in to see them two or three times a day.  They would be greatly entertained by him.</P>
      <P>Things, therefore, are not right now all the way just as we would not like to say that things were completely right during our term of office. Another point about Deputy Burke is that he is the most respectable and nicest looking man you ever saw at a funeral.  It was the same in my constituency. I hope he went to the funerals of these unfortunate people whose houses fell down on them and that he exerted his paternal influence. When I said that itinerants had not got a vote, it evoked the response from the Deputy that my remark was beneath contempt.  I do not know of any Deputy who is more interested in votes than my very good friend Deputy Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that housing is something that has not been one of the greatest successes of this administration, an administration which has been in power since 1957.  In the towns of Dundalk and Drogheda, I could point to a dozen cases in each town not of people living in one room with their families&mdash;and there are very bad cases of families with three or four children sleeping in the same room&mdash;but of boys and girls who were married and had to go back to their respective families because they could not get even one room.  If this is the position in Griffith Barracks and in Dundalk <Col N="244" /> and Drogheda, are we satisfied with the housing situation?</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that there should be a detailed survey, that there should be forecasts of the housing needs in various areas.  Nothing could be more necessary and nothing could come later because this was necessary right from the 1950s, and these are the people who from 1957 had the opportunity of doing something and have not done it.  Is it not obvious that in a place like Drogheda or Dundalk or in Dublin city a forecast of the number of the houses necessary is related more to the number of marriages in the churches of each town each year?  In relation to Connemara, if you take the number of marriages there and the number of people who are going to live there, the situation would not be nearly the same as for these other places I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>If I wished to go into figures, or wanted to be extremely detailed, I could, with statistics, prove what Deputy Ryan said, and I am sure he can prove it when he comes to speak, that we in our last year of office built three times the number of local authority houses that the present administration built in the years since. Somebody may say that there were variations over the years but that is the figure.  This administration did not seek to forecast the needs in particular periods and as I say, there is now a dire need for houses because there are boys and girls, who after they have been married, have had to return to their respective families.  There are a dozen cases of this in each of the two principal towns in my constituency, not to mention the rural areas.  That is a condemnation of this administration and a complete negation of the suggestion made by Deputy Burke that everything is right.  Nothing is right as far as housing is concerned.  Fianna Fáil have been in office since 1957 and that is long enough to mean that it is their bun and they can eat it.  We may as well face the fact that we are in a dreadful position.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> because in it, not so many years ago, it was said that housing <Col N="245" /> was a social investment and that social investment must be reduced.  Let us consider that statement and let us consider whether this was deliberate or negligent.  In my view, it was a little of both.  It meant that in the country and industrial areas the housing needs have been completely neglected.  The position is one which if it had been related to the ballot boxes would have resulted in a different situation.  Unhappily, it was not but there is no point in going into that.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play in his speech on being balanced in relation to rates and rents and on how much assistance we can give to housing. While he was extremely careful in his language, it portrayed to me in relation to the Government's decision in that White Paper, that he is still a complete conservative and that the Fianna Fáil Cabinet are still in that position.  I want to say that it is not a fair political suggestion to say that if there are to be more houses, rates must rise out of all proportion.  This is not so.  A matter which the Minister did not mention in relation to the average rent, but which is outside the scope of his Department, and which to a very great degree affects the rates, is that 50 per cent of health service charges are levied on the rates. In my constituency the health service rate falling on Dundalk Urban Council from the Louth County Council is 24/7d. in the £.  In addition, the position is that 100 per cent of every £ of home assistance a woman gets in any part of the country, comes from the rates. From this you will see that there are many more ways of choking a cat than with butter.  When the Minister says that the extra expenditure and the extra costs are related to housing, his argument is not valid.  If his counterpart in the Department of Health were to remove these charges from the rates, then there would be plenty of money for housing.</P>
    <P>This House must realise that as far as subventions from the rates for housing are concerned, all that is required from any local authority is a reasonable contribution.  That phrase &ldquo;reasonable contribution&rdquo; is enshrined in the legislation and in the circulars <Col N="246" /> sent by the Department of Local Government to the local authorities.  A reasonable contribution has been defined at about 2/6d. a week on the rents for some years past and now, when houses have become more expensive in the past year or so, at 3/6d. a week or, at the maximum, 4/- a week. That is not a great amount when one considers that the new house is going to be rated and that the amount paid in rates will probably be much more than the amount paid by the local authority as a reasonable contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his extremely conservative speech, suggests that the rents of pre-1950 houses should be increased because he wants to see poor people who are getting houses now get them at a cheaper rate.  I do not think that the people who have lived in Pearse Square in Drogheda for the past 20 or 30 years and who have, over that time, enjoyed a rent of 8/9 or 9/3 per week, should now have their rents increased, perhaps up to a £1 a week for the reason that when these people got their houses, the husband was probably earning £2 or £2 10s. a week and found it very difficult to pay the 8/9 or 9/3.  Another reason is that these people are not now enjoying as good a house as they would have if they were now given a new Corporation house.</P>
    <P>For years the Department have been in favour of differential rents.  I also am in favour of differential rents.  If four or five people in a house are earning, it is only right that they should pay the economic rent of that house, but it is also right that if an unfortunate man with four or five children is unemployed, he should pay the rates on the house and very little more. That is social justice in relation to our rate charges.  But if you put a man into a house for 30 years and charge him a certain rent and in those years that man has painted and repaired that house and probably made additions to it and you then double or treble the rent, you are not being fair. That is not only undesirable but politically impossible.  The Minister will never see it attempted by any local authority under his administration and <Col N="247" /> it would be a dreadful thing if he were to use the non-acceptance of his viewpoint by the local authority as an excuse to lessen the amount of help he gives towards the building of houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not, within almost a decade, increased the maximum amount which he gives in respect of a new house, the loan charges which he meets to the extent of two-thirds.  As far as I know, the maximum he gives is £1,450.  When we could build a house for £1,450, it meant that two-thirds of the loan charges came from central funds.  I am now informed that that figure is £1,650.  I was a few years behind the times.  We know that we cannot build houses for that amount now.  New houses are costing from £2,500 to £3,000 each to build. The full cost of the extra loan charges on the difference between £1,650 and £2,500 or £3,000 must now fall on the ratepayers and the rent payers.  That is the reason for the higher deposits. It has nothing to do with the old houses or the new houses.  It means that the central administration has decided to give lesser subsidies for house building.</P>
    <P>Much play was made recently by the Minister with regard to system building.  All the advice I can give on that is that he has done a good thing in bringing it in.  System building will be faster but it will not be cheaper. It may even be dearer.  One reason why we need this system building is that if we get the houses built more quickly, we will get the rents in more quickly.  System building may even be dearer and if it is, the figure of £1,650, which is the figure on which the Government will pay two-thirds of the loan charges over a period of 35 years, is not nearly sufficient.</P>
    <P>When we come to the white collar worker who is building his own house, about whom Deputy Treacy was most explicit, it is not factual today to say that you will not give such a person access to the Local Loans Fund for more than £1,050.  It has been stated here, and has not been refuted, that the building societies are no longer giving loans.  I could give instances of <Col N="248" /> where the most drastic steps had to be taken and the money practically produced out of the hat at short notice in order that the building contractors would not have to take the men and machinery off the site.  At this moment nobody knows whether the loans are going to be available.  I have put down a notice of motion for the next meeting of Drogheda Corporation asking that we take power to borrow money from the insurance companies. This will mean higher interest and shorter terms but I have no other answer to our present problem.</P>
    <P>This has been done by the Government who hammered us when there was a world credit squeeze in 1956 and 1957, by the Government who said then the county councils could not pay their bills.  This is the Government who made a dreadful attack on us for our work in housing.  None of what they said is true.  The Minister for Local Government was foremost in leading that attack and he is now responsible for the present situation which we deplore and which we will do everything in our power to bring to an end.  But that was not done by us.  Perhaps that was bad politics but if so, it is certainly good statesmanship and that is the way we shall behave, whether it gains or loses us votes.  I can prove&mdash;I am not producing names but I can give them to anybody interested&mdash;that in my constituency there is a speculative builder who because loans were not available from the usual sources, would have to leave the building site if we did not have five citizens who put their hands in their pockets and produced the ready cash to keep him there.  Nobody knows whether money will be forthcoming to finance loans so that these decent citizens will have their money refunded.  Fianna Fáil may accept that this is true.  We on this side will do everything we can to help the situation but it is only right, when we are facing a Government who said that building is a social investment and must be reduced, that we should point out their sins, not by excess but by omission.  That we intend to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy raised, and Deputy <Col N="249" /> Burke also referred to, the matter of the supplementary grant.  I shall give the Minister fair play in regard to it.  I think Tipperary County Council are far too fond of their law agent.  What Deputy Treacy says is true, that £832 is enshrined in a section of the 1932 Act but there is a circular from the Minister saying that local authorities may interpret this section generously as far as people with families are concerned.  We in Drogheda Corporation and in Louth County Council have interpreted it generously and we have decided to allow a supplementary grant to anybody who has children. We allow him an extra £50 grant in respect of each child.</P>
    <P>When I put that motion down, the county manager sent me an opinion of the late Richard McGonigal given to Dublin Corporation.  I went to the local authority with this opinion and, as against it, I said that I felt as an ordinary layman that the Minister's circular was quite sufficient, for the very good reason that the auditor who would decide whether there should be a surcharge or not would be the Local Government auditor.  That opinion prevailed and I think we can cast aside the opinion given to Dublin Corporation. It is wise, I think, to approach this matter until the new Housing Bill becomes law, on the basis that you can be generous in regard to supplementary grants when you come to consider the level on which these are to be granted.</P>

      <P>Our county manager has accepted our decision as against the opinion of Mr. McGonigal and we are at the moment paying these extra supplementary grants.  I think any county manager in Ireland should sensibly approach the matter.  The Minister sent out the circular and when questioned subsequently, he stood by it in this House.  That is good enough for me and it was good enough for our county manager, and it should be good enough for any other local authority. I agree we are awaiting a new Housing Bill, but, again, if the Minister says by circular that he wants you to treat certain people in this way at this stage, presumably he is going to implement his views in the new Bill and bring in a new figure.  I think the approach that we made to it was the most sensible. The county manager could, in fact, have refused to accept our decision but I think the situation was well met there and I thing Deputy Treacy should perhaps have another go at getting his local authority&mdash;I am making a Fianna Fáil speech now&mdash;and his county manager to accept the circular of the Minister in regard to the supplementary grants.  I do not mind making a Fianna Fáil speech if I succeed in getting extra grants for a few young married people.</P>

      <P>Yes, but we are waiting for a new Housing Bill for a long time.  No doubt it will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say something about a matter which was part of the restrictive Fianna Fáil approach to housing when they came to office in 1957. There is a section in the old 1931 Act, section 19, and under it, if a house is adjudged fit for reconstruction, the landlord can be requested to reconstruct it.  If he does not do it, the local authority can do it and, having produced a bill of costs for the operation, they can seek to recover the money from the landlord.  Failing that they can seek an instalment order against him and if they still cannot get it from him, they can seek to get it from the <Col N="251" /> tenant.  This was in line with the restrictive policy, and the excuse made for it was that if it operated, the existing stock of houses would be preserved. In fact what happened&mdash;and I have personally examined cases of this kind in at least three counties; not many of them but I have seen them&mdash;is that many houses which by modern standards were not fit for reconstruction were by virtue of this section adjudged fit and were reconstructed and money was ill-spent on them.  In my constituency a very big ratepayer who is trying to meet his expenses and pay his bills is at present in the position in which he may find himself in the High Court with a bill for reconstruction as a result of this section.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the fact that I opposed that policy.  I believe it was a bad decision of the Fianna Fáil administration and I believe it had bad results.  At present I believe there is a silent instruction to drop it like a hot potato.  Even though I have no evidence that it is being implemented now, I should be glad if the Minister would indicate that he has dropped this mistake of his like a hot potato and that we shall not have section 19 again implemented.</P>
    <P>The small farm grants are a good step forward and I welcome them. Under this legislation there is another provision whereby not only will a small farmer in a rural area get this extra £150 grant, if he is building a new house, from the Government and an extra £150 from his local authority if it is generous, but also a person who has been adjudged as eligible for rehousing by the local authority in the area will get it.  In other words, if a man is eligible for a cottage in Louth rural area, he will get the extra grant from the Government and also in our case from Louth County Council.  One result of this I find has been that everybody has become rather sticky about passing people as eligible for a cottage because there is the view that if he is a man who is going to get a cottage, you will be giving him £150 of State funds and another £150 from local authority funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> I think the Minister might issue instructions to have this speeded up. It is a good measure which will benefit people all over the country.  It should be extended to urban areas.  It is a question whether you are giving any money away because if you are eventually going to rehouse a worker in an urban area and if instead you give him £300&mdash;£150 from the State and £150 from the local authority&mdash; I do not think you are giving him anything more than if you rehouse him in a Corporation house.  I believe this should be extended to urban areas and I am making that representation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want now to mention something on which the Minister and I are at one, that is, the provision of swimming pools.  We are all aware of the number of children and adults who are drowned every year.  It is absolutely necessary that our young people should be taught how to swim.  I have found extreme difficulty in selling this idea to members of my local authorities. I think the Minister has found the same sort of difficulty.  I have tried to sell the Minister's policy on this to members but have not succeeded in many cases.  I shall continue to try until I succeed.</P>
    <P>The main objection seems to be that if we cannot build houses, we cannot have a swimming pool, that a swimming pool is a luxury and houses are a necessity.  The simple answer is that State grants are available for swimming pools and for housing.  These two things are separate and distinct and are in two separate financial pockets. In the case of a swimming pool, the profits, if any, and the subvention towards expenses that can be charged for admission fall to the local authority. At present there is no experience to show whether or not in an industrial area a heated indoor swimming pool available every day of the year will or will not pay for itself.  Remember, we will get 50 per cent of the loan charges over 35 years for a swimming pool and the swimming pool itself would represent a capital asset which will be appreciating every year as money becomes less valuable, a capital asset for which we pay in respect of <Col N="253" /> one-half and get a full period of time to pay.</P>
    <P>This swimming pool idea is a good one.  It is one of the Minister's best acts since he came into power.  I would suggest that in the case even of a worker who is living within two or three miles of the sea, who works from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. taking into consideration the hazard of the day when it is raining and the day when the tide is out and the evening when he has to do overtime or his wife may have to go shopping, the number of occasions on which he can go to the beach and try to teach his children to swim is very small, whereas, if there were a heated indoor swimming pool provided in centres where the volume of population would seem to indicate that it would pay or, at least, pay for itself, then there would be available at all times this amenity with swimming instructors and everything else, which would mean that our young people would know how to swim.  If a Gallup poll were taken, I wonder how many Members of this House could swim the length of the House and save themselves, if that were necessary.  I venture to say the number would be very much smaller than one would expect.  Yet, we are people with higher incomes than the average.</P>

      <P>There would be a great number of by-elections.  With all due respect, it would not be the Minister's fault if there were by-elections because the subvention towards swimming pools under his administration is fair and good.  I want to appeal to everyone here to accept this concept that swimming pools should be provided, and good swimming pools, and try to bring that home to the local authorities and try to sell the idea to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us face it, the colleges are now providing swimming pools for what are really the privileged boys who go there. We find 200 or 300 privileged boys who can go to college.  I was one myself and in the college I attended, Castle- knock, I had the benefit of a swimming <Col N="254" /> instructor and a swimming pool.  That is longer ago than I like to think about. It was when I was 15&mdash;23 or 24 years ago.  At that time I had the benefit of a swimming instructor and a swimming pool.  In towns of 5,000 to 8,000, how many children of ordinary working men have the benefits of a swimming instructor or a swimming pool?  We have heard Deputy Burke mention the fact that in this city there are Tara Street baths and private swimming pool run by Messrs Guinness.  In this matter we have lagged behind.</P>
    <P>Apart from the consideration of safety in the water, swimming is a healthy sport that can be availed of every day of the year.  It is something that should be available.  It should be our proud prerogative to provide swimming pools.  Relative to the amount of good it could do and the number of people it would serve, the cost would be very little.  We are inclined to be frightened by the figures of cost and to forget the other figures&mdash;the number of children and adults in an industrial centre or area of large population who could be served by a swimming pool, who could become swimmers, who would not, in ordinary circumstances, drown stupidly&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;a few yards from shore. I would make an appeal for a swimming pool in every town in Ireland regardless of expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am now about to make a suggestion which may or may not be novel but which I believe to be a wise suggestion. All towns of 10,000 population or over should be removed completely from county managers' spheres of influence.  The town clerk of such a town should be well fitted to look after all the matters relative to the town itself within that town and should have power to make the individual decisions the county manager at present makes.  Under our existing local authority system, situations would develop because of the fact that while the town itself would be looking after the roads and housing, health and other matters might be under a larger body such as the county council.  I would have no objection to the county manager looking after health, to health being <Col N="255" /> outside the jurisdiction of the town clerk, but in a town of 10,000 or over, the town clerk is either an exceptionally experienced senior man who has reached that stage in the Civil Service and is not desirous of proceeding further or he is an exceptionally brilliant young man who is ambitious enough to try to proceed further.  I believe that within our local authority service there are men filling positions in towns of 10,000 or over&mdash;whichever category they fall into&mdash;who are fully capable of discharging all the duties of the county manager.</P>
    <P>This would mean, in its impact on the town itself, all the individual decisions of these men would be related to the fact that they live in the town, that they are dealing constantly with the members of the corporation or urban council, that they have a very intimate knowledge of the town and would be elevating themselves into a position of authority which would give them the responsibility for higher office or they could stay where they were and continue their term of office giving good service.</P>
    <P>This is something that would make a great difference.  It would give a status to the towns where it was put into operation.  I would love to see Drogheda and Dundalk as far as town matters are concerned removed completely from the sphere of the county manager.  That is no reflection on the county manager.  I think I paid tribute to him already today.  It would make for more town pride and civic effort and would mean that something that has been an entity, not for generations but for centuries, would continue to be an entity.</P>
    <P>I would say, again, that the great failure of this Administration has been in housing.  I tried to show that this is a matter of policy and that I cannot understand public reaction to this policy not being translated into the ballot boxes some time ago.  I suppose I leave myself open to derision at this stage but no derision seems to be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>As a new Member of the House, whose first contribution <Col N="256" /> to a debate this is, I shall be very brief. Most of the points arising out of this Estimate have already been discussed at length by other speakers. Nevertheless, in view of the major social problem which housing represents in our community, and indeed in view of the vital role which it plays in the field of preventive medicine, something of which we hear a lot today, I feel it my duty to refer to a few matters on the Estimate.</P>
      <P>My impression is that since 1956 the most we can be said to have done in regard to local authority housing is to prevent our housing position from worsening.  I choose 1956 because that is the year in which I first became acquainted with the housing necessities of the people of what was then known as South Cork.  It is my belief that for each scheme of local authority housing for which applicants are invited today, there are just as many deserving applicants now as there were in the year 1956.  For each rural cottage which becomes vacant, there are just as many deserving applicants for that cottage as there were in 1956.  I conclude, therefore, that there are just as many disappointed applicants today as there were then.  These are my personal observations.</P>
      <P>When one takes into account, on the one hand, the slow rate at which our housing programme has progressed and, on the other hand, the large number of families which have come into formation over those years and the rate at which our old houses, particularly in towns and villages, have been deteriorating&mdash;to such an extent that no engineer will now sanction these houses for reconstruction grants&mdash;I think my observations are justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's plan for solving our housing problem as laid before the House yesterday is by no means ambitious. Nevertheless, I am glad to note that at last he has realised that a major breakthrough must be made in his Department, that radical changes must be brought about, if the housing problem is ever to be solved.  I am very glad he has decided finally to transfer to the local authorities the responsibility <Col N="257" /> for selection of sites for local authority house building.  I am glad to note&mdash;and I hope he really means this and that it is something he will carry out in the very near future&mdash;that he envisages a further curtailment of red tape in regard to local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to ask the local authorities in the near future for an assessment of their housing needs.  I would suggest to him that with this added information at his disposal, he should go a step further and allocate grants to local authorities on the same basis as road grants are allocated, that he allocate them in bulk and leave it to the local authorities and to their very efficient staff to spend that money to the best of their ability, to get the best value they can for that money.</P>
    <P>Heretofore a great deal of time was wasted by the local authorities sending tenders for house building to the Department.  The Department considered very frequently that these tenders were too high.  These were the lowest tenders the local authority could obtain; yet the Department considered they were too high and sent them back to the local authority.  That authority had to advertise again for tenders and in the interim period, prices had risen so much, costs of material had risen so much, that the tenders they then received were higher than the original ones.</P>
    <P>Speaking of rising costs brings me to the matter of the estimates on which the Department of Local Government inspectors base grants for reconstruction work.  I know from personal experience that one can have an estimate presented to one by a local contractor for, we will say, £700, and that the Department of Local Government inspector comes along and estimates that work at something like £450 or £500.  I am not blaming the Department's  inspector for that.  I know he is tied by certain prescribed scales of cost in operation in the Department. The Minister admitted in his speech yesterday that the Department in fact have no method of measuring rising costs for building and reconstruction work.  I hope this is something he will <Col N="258" /> rectify very soon, that he will bring estimates into line with the real cost of reconstruction work today.</P>
    <P>I would suggest further that he allocate an inspector to each area, that he allocate him to a particular address at which those people who are applying for grants can contact him personally. This would speed up matters a lot.  That, coupled with the fact that grants would be brought into line with actual costs, would alleviate much of the hardship imposed on these people who are trying to improve their own homes today.</P>
    <P>The question of the repair of local authority houses and rural cottages prior to vesting these houses in tenants is another matter requiring attention. These people have 30 days in which to appeal against repairs if they feel the repairs being carried out are not adequate. A period of 30 days is too short.  Very many defects do not make themselves obvious within that period and it should be extended to, say, three months.  Furthermore, the Department should be a little more lenient with these people.  They should not tie them particularly to the list of defects which appears on the appeal form.  It should be at the discretion of the inspectors to list any defects or faults they have in mind and have these matters seen to.</P>
    <P>The question of speed limits is one to which many Deputies have referred. I wish to refer to the approach road to Cork via Douglas.  This is a road on which I travel very frequently. Each time I enter the 30-mile zone, I reduce my speed to 30 miles per hour and I become conscious of a stream of impatient travellers behind me waiting for the oncoming traffic to clear so that they can pass out.  It is the duty of another Department to enforce these regulations but my point is that these regulations are not realistic.  Many of these 30-mile limits are out too far.  The limits should be graduated, beginning with 40 and the 30-mile zone further in.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the efforts he has made to solve the itinerants problem and on the efforts he intends to make to reduce the number of deaths from road <Col N="259" /> accidents and from drowning.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say this to him: right through his brief yesterday there appeared to be a tendency to blame local authorities unjustly, to blame them for something over which they have no control.  When the Minister gives more autonomy to local authorities, as I hope he envisages in the near future, he will be justified in blaming them.  He has asked for more co-operation from local authorities but I would suggest that the Minister himself set the standard for co-operation. Only very recently Cork County Council had occasion to ask the Minister to receive a deputation in connection with the proposed extension of the Cork borough boundary.  In spite of repeated applications, telephone calls, and so on, the Minister has persisted in refusing to receive a deputation.  The only deputation he would receive was a joint one, consisting of members of Cork Corporation and members of Cork County Council to discuss the compensation to be made to Cork County Council in the event of this going through.</P>
    <P>We all know that if Cork County Council were to be adequately compensated for this extension, the city would not, in fact, benefit at all from it and it is quite possible that no such extension was applied for in the first place.  I can assure the Minister of every co-operation from the local authority of which I am a member in any progressive scheme he envisages for the future&mdash;I do not think, however, he will have our approval for the revised system&mdash;and I hope the same co-operation will be forthcoming from the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were it not for the fact that one of the newspapers yesterday classified me as one of the &ldquo;old hands&rdquo; in the House, I would have regarded myself as a comparative junior, but, in whatever category I may be, may I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Mrs. Desmond on a very fine maiden speech?  She spoke from an obvious fund of knowledge and experience, with sincerity and conviction, and we wish her well in <Col N="260" /> her future here in this House.  Listening to her, one could not but recall that her late husband, held in high esteem by us, never spoke in this House except with the same fund of knowledge, conviction and sincerity.  It is very pleasant to have that type of contribution made here.</P>
      <P>The question of housing very rightly looms large in this debate.  The lack of housing is one of the most grievous evils in our society.  I recall words which were welcomed some few years ago; it was said that every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity and to the means necessary and suitable for the proper development of life.  Those are primarily food, clothing and housing.  Our society has long accepted the obligation to provide food and clothing.  Where the State is wanting in the provision of these things, private charity steps in. It is appalling that we, as a society, have not yet properly recognised the fundamental obligation to provide proper housing for every citizen.  This nation, led as it has been by Fianna Fáil for the past seven years, has forgotten the fundamenal obligation to provide housing for all our citizens, with the result that we have the appalling human misery which is daily increasing in our midst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words I have quoted are the words of good Pope John who underlined, in <i>Pacem in Terris</i>, the obligation that lies on society to provide housing for its citizens. The tragic thing is that this nation, led by a Government who have neglected housing, failed as a society the tens of thousands of miserable husbands, wives and children without homes today because the Fianna Fáil Government failed to build for them. The reason that Government are now back there, smug and indifferent, is that the majority of our people are apparently comfortably housed and could not care less about the tens of thousands awaiting houses.  We now have with us the vagabonds' night shelter in Griffith Barracks, housing young families, not families that are destitute, not impossible families, not families that are handicapped for lack of resources from making a reasonable <Col N="261" /> contribution to housing accommodation but families which are there because the Fianna Fáil Party have made the people of Ireland indifferent to the social and moral obligation on society to provide people with houses.</P>
    <P>What has happened in Griffith Barracks? We have spent on that abominable institution £20,000 in maintaining over 30 families.  We have spent that for nothing except the imposition of human misery.  That £20,000 would have built more than ten houses if those houses had been built at the time they should have been built at half the cost at which they can now be built. What do the families in this abominable institution get there?  What is being provided there for this £20,000? Accommodation for the mothers and children, with a prohibition on the presence of the husbands and fathers except during the hours of 6.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. and, as a special concession, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  But they may not use the lavatories in this institution because they are not regarded as having either the need or the right to answer the calls of nature.</P>
    <P>That is what is being provided in this city for families, the fathers of which are employed.  That is what is being provided for families prepared to pay the same as anyone else for a home, if they can get it.  Every time there is a protest from the fathers or mothers, every time they act as their natural impulses compel them to act, every time they cry out for some help, the rumour is put abroad: we are told these are impossible families, people who will not help themselves.  These are people who are there because the housing output of Dublin Corporation was cut from 1,600 per year to 270 houses per year.  These people are there not because of any dangerous buildings situation.  There have never been fewer than 3,500 families on the waiting list in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, in his usual complacent way&mdash;entertaining enough but not very helpful towards a proper outlook on policy or conscientious approach&mdash;says that at one time there were 1,800 houses vacant in the Dublin <Col N="262" /> Corporation housing estates in one year.  That is quite true.  That happened under a Fianna Fáil administration. That happened when Fianna Fáil had been nearly three years in office. It was then the figure grew to 1,800 vacancies.  Notwithstanding that there were never fewer than 3,500 applicants for these vacancies and, instead of building houses in anticipation of the need, instead of taking the steps that should have been taken over the years to replace the dangerous buildings in the city, the housing output was cut from 1,600 houses, when we were in office, to 1,000 the following year, to 800 the year after that, to 700 the next year, to 500 the next, and then to 270.</P>
    <P>These are the realities.  There are in our midst the smug, complacent and indifferent, who have not had to suffer the misery of homelessness or overcrowding, who say that, when we were in office, there was not enough money to buy a bag of cement.  If the nation had to go into financial difficulties to meet human and moral obligations, then it is infinitely preferable that we should take that risk rather than tolerate the human misery that has existed now for the past seven or eight years.  We make no apology for doing what we did.  We were not prepared to tolerate the misery that exists today.  We devoted one-third of our annual resources towards housing our people.  We do not deny that there were sections in our community who felt we were overdoing it, that we were doing too much good, that there was not sufficient profit to be made out of it.  That was the criticism of those whose god is money.  Those were the people who complained too much was being spent on social investment. Today, when only one-sixth of our annual resources is being spent on social investment, we hear no crib about it.</P>
    <P>Again, we are having credit tied up. Again, people cannot get money for houses.  At a time of dear money, of scarce money, of profiteering in property, of an understaffed building industry, we have the Minister coming in here accompanied by his minions making pious promises about what <Col N="263" /> they are going to do in the future. They have been tested over the past seven years and they have failed.  The tragedy is that this nation have failed the needy because they have not rejected from office those who have ignored the needy in such an appalling way.</P>
    <P>In this Fianna Fáil ghetto in Griffith Barracks we still have some 30 families, many of which are not going to get out of that den for the next couple of years because they have not got the number of children necessary to qualify them.  When we say there are 10,000 applicants for Corporation houses, we are told there are only 5,000 of those qualified.  Many of those in Griffith Barracks would not qualify. Why are their numbers not within the qualifying figure?  Because the husbands and wives cannot live together. If the rest of the world knew the Fianna Fáil method for birth control, there would not be a need for all the solutions suggested elsewhere.  It is to keep the husband and wife living apart. If any politician protests about it, he is told he is unscrupulous.  If the husband and wife protest about it, they say they are difficult and should not be listened to.  That is the kind of appalling mockery of Government we have had over the past seven years.</P>
    <P>These figures either mean something or not.  There are some members of the Corporation Housing Committee, some of them now no longer with us&mdash;some people saw through it at last&mdash;who have said and will say that the situation in Dublin was dictated by the circumstances there and nothing else.  I ask them to wake up and look at the figures and not be like Deputy Burke, who has been making the same trite speech for seven years and has never stayed to listen to the real story.  One hesitates to accuse him of culpably lying&mdash;in any event Parliamentary rules do not permit it&mdash;but when you have a person, year in and year out, making the same trite speech about housing and pretending the housing rot existed in 1956 and 1957 and all has been well since, it is time to cry halt to that kind of hypocrisy.  Either we as <Col N="264" /> a society concern ourselves with housing our people or let the present mess continue, where office and luxury building takes precedence over the housing of the people.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in the country like?  Does it bear any relation to the situation in Dublin?  In Dublin housing output reduced from 1,600 to 270.  Output of similar local authority houses in rural areas was cut down from 4,700 to 1,600.  You have the same reduction.  You have a two-thirds cut in the number of local authority houses built today in any city or any town.  Compare it with any rural area and you have the same degree of butchery of local authority housing output throughout the length and breadth of the land.  You have the whole social investment of this country halved in a matter of a few years.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that has continued over the past seven years under the Fianna Fáil Party.  This was the direct step they took to cut down on social investment.  The indirect step they took was to leave housing grants, loans and subsidies, and all the other techniques available to encourage housing, at the same level as they stood in 1948.  In 1948 this country had barely begun to experience post-war inflation.  We were then at a stage when the prices of houses and other things were dictated by the standstill in costs that had operated over the previous seven or eight years.  At that time certain figures were set for grants, loans and subsidies.  Instead of increasing those to meet the increases in costs and the devaluation in money, Fianna Fáil left them at that figure and did not move them at all.  That was another way of discouraging people from buying their own houses or taking steps to get speculative builders to build houses to answer a possible need.</P>
    <P>In case anybody doubts whether or not the Fianna Fáil Government were right to cut down local authority housing, I would ask them to look at the total housing output.  They will find that, while the Fianna Fáil Government through the various machinations a Minister may use to control local bodies were cutting down on the number <Col N="265" /> of local authority houses being built, and successfully cut that down by two-thirds, the number of private houses being built remained more or less constant.  That indicated there was still a demand for houses, that there was a constant demand there.  Are we to understand that the economy has been so disorganised under Fianna Fáil that there has been only one-third the need for local authority houses but that the well-to-do people have continued building houses at the same rate as before?</P>
    <P>Again, we have another test to see what is the truth in this matter.  I would ask Deputies and the public to test any remarks in relation to housing by looking at the figures and not by listening to the Fianna Fáil record of the past seven years, comparing a myth of difficulties in 1956 with a haven of blessings in 1965.  In Dublin city instead of 3,500 people on the waiting list, who would have been housed within two and a half years if the Fine Gael housing programme had continued, there are now 10,000 families on the waiting list.  In the whole country there are some 60,000 dwellings which the Minister, on his own conservative assessment in the White Paper last year, says need replacement. Notwithstanding that fact and notwithstanding that 10,000 families in Dublin urgently need houses, we had the impossible situation in which the number of houses was deliberately cut down and remained at that low figure until four innocent people had to die in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Some people think it is unfair of us to make any reference to the old houses which collapsed in Dublin.  We are not supposed to mention it.  Every time Fine Gael have a crack at Fianna Fáil it is rude.  We should not be disturbing the Members opposite.  We would not have to do it if they had any conscience at all.  We remind the people of this unfortunate incident, not because we put all the blame on the Government for it, but because they were not in the least disturbed about the housing situation until two old people died at Bolton Street and two children died at Fenian Street.  Suddenly they started talking about the <Col N="266" /> crash housing drive they were going to launch.  That was two years ago and we are still waiting for any crash except the crash of old houses.</P>
    <P>We still have not got the so-called crash housing drive but we have cocktail parties, receptions, Ministerial openings, Ministerial banquets, press conferences and ballyhoo of one kind or another in connection with the housing project at Ballymun.  We are told that this is going to be an everlasting monument to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Neil Blaney.  Fianna Fáil canvassers went around before the election telling people that they were going to be housed before the end of the year because of the &ldquo;Blaney housing programme&rdquo;. It shows that some people know no shame at all.</P>
    <P>In Ballymun, housing units are to be erected and we are told it will take four years to erect them.  The number to be erected in the four years will be the equivalent of what was being built in any two years when Fine Gael were in Government.  These are the realities of the situation.  There would be no need for all this nonsense, or for the bringing in of consortiums&mdash; whatever they may be&mdash;for the building of houses if the rate of building had been kept at the rate of 1,600 per year.  Because that was not done, we are in the appalling situation in which we have to take desperate remedies. One hopes that all will go well with this project and that it will be finished in the promised time.  We have yet to see whether that will be so.</P>
    <P>Nobody yet knows, and as far as we know nobody has bothered to assess, what rents are to be paid for these pieces of living accommodation in Ballymun.  It is time the people were told precisely what they are to be charged.  This housing accommodation is to be of an unorthodox type, without the ordinary fireplaces or other amenities to which generations of our people have become accustomed. It is about time the Government who have already led Dublin Corporation to accept this programme carrot-like in a desperate situation, told the 3,000 odd people who will have to live in this accommodation what precisely they will have to pay <Col N="267" /> for this peculiar type of accommodation. If they do not do that soon, they will not be keeping faith with the people.</P>
    <P>The housing situation we have at present is attributable in the main to three causes.  One is the deliberate cutting down of houses built since 1957 to which I have referred; the second is the neglect by local authorities of their duties to deal with decaying property; and the third is the removal of rent restriction by Fianna Fáil in 1960. There are many families in this city at the moment who are saving themselves from the misery of the Fianna Fáil ghetto in Griffith Barracks only because they are paying rents of £4, £5 or £6 a week out of incomes which are only twice the amount they are paying.  They are paying half their incomes to provide the necessary housing accommodation for their families. Because they are paying these rents for two rooms, or two rooms and a kitchenette, or perhaps three rooms, they will not be considered by Dublin Corporation for houses.  They are disqualified because under the existing terms of reference, they are not eligible.  Therefore children are going without the necessary medical attention, the necessary clothing or other necessary amenities which in our standard of living should be available to them.</P>
    <P>There is no counting the number of families in such a situation.  There is no effort on the part of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, or Fianna Fáil councillors to count those people; they do not want them on their consciences, or whatever little conscience they may have after they have blunted them as Deputy Burke and his colleagues have done so successfully over the years.  I do not think that the Fianna Fáil crash programme &mdash;whatever it is crashing into I do not know&mdash;is going to deal with this problem. They say in the latest White Paper that the housing needs are 12,000 to 14,000 per annum.  As their contribution towards this, they are producing at the moment 2,359 houses. We have a long way to go before this programme crashes into whatever it is <Col N="268" /> supposed to crash.  We are only producing one-sixth of the number of houses they say is necessary.  This is the great new social revolution, the social programme about which the Taoiseach spoke in Tullamore.  I wonder what is necessary to disturb Fianna Fáil?  I suppose a defeat would, but the people have not yet given them that defeat.  It may well be that the Fine Gael Party may in the future as in the past correct the Fianna Fáil Party.  If they had not corrected them so often they might not be in office to-day. These things are above Party loyalties.  These are needs concerning human beings and we do not like to trifle with human happiness or suffering and we only hope that we may bring Fianna Fáil to some realisation of their obligations in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>There have been two White Papers on housing since the War.  One was published in 1948 and the extraordinary thing is that it was not until 1964 that there was another housing White Paper. In the interval, in 1958, the Fianna Fáil Party produced a White Paper which was called a programme of expansion, no less.  In this programme they promised a contraction in social investment because they said the need for housing would soon be overtaken. Those were the words printed in black and white on the first page of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> They said the need for houses would soon be overtaken and accordingly there would be a decline in social investment in accordance with that belief.  Whether it was a Party belief or something they accepted from their advisers in the Civil Service, we do not know, but they adopted it and propounded it as their own policy and they deliberately set about doing something which, to give them their due, they did entirely successfully&mdash;they cut down the number of houses built not alone in Dublin but throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that although they were so convinced about housing needs in 1958 as to announce they were going to cut down the number of houses being built, in 1960, <Col N="269" /> as a result of persistent questions and criticism from the Fine Gael benches, the Minister decided to set on foot a housing survey.  One would have thought that before cutting down on housing the Government would have carried out a survey.  Two years later the Minister announced that the survey had not yet been completed.  I wonder what kind of inspectors we have in the Department or what kind of incompetence is being tolerated in the Custom House or at local level that it takes five years, half a decade, to carry out a housing survey of the country.</P>
    <P>We were warned in the figures set out that they are probably on the conservative side.  These figures show that 160,000 houses are already over 100 years of age.  Apparently no steps have been taken to ascertain whether or not these houses are structurally sound. There has been a scare in Dublin, but throughout the remainder of the country, no proper steps have been taken to ensure that the type of tragedy we experienced in Dublin will not be experienced there.  That is why we in Fine Gael say we are not at all satisfied with the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>We feel that the realistic figure of our housing needs is probably in the region of 16,000 to 18,000 a year.  It is certainly 4,000 more than the Government have in mind, that is, if you are concerned with human beings and are convinced that it is wrong to compel people to live in the miserable hovels in which they are now living.  If you are indifferent, then it does not matter to you if they have to go on so living there for another ten or 20 years as long as you can remain in Government. Whether the present Government discharge their obligations or not, we will have to wait and see, but what they have done in the past seven or eight years gives us no hope that they will now do what is necessary.</P>
    <P>I had a question on the Order Paper today regarding the availability of loans from building societies.  The Minister, in an extremely guarded reply, told me that six months ago he made inquiries and found that the position was not too bad but that he had been keeping the matter under <Col N="270" /> review since and that he is now investigating certain press reports.  The inference is that the Minister would not be bothered to investigate these reports if I had not put down the question. That shows the value of parliamentary questions.  But the press reports come after an event and the event that has been happening for the past few months is that several building societies have been slowing down the issue of loans.  It now takes much longer to get approval in principle for the granting of a loan and it is now rare to get the amount of loan for which a person applies.  Where they were formerly granting 90 or 95 per cent of the value of the house, they are now cutting it down to 70 or 75 per cent and therefore making it impossible for people to purchase their houses.  The remaining 25 per cent, due to the inflation which has taken place, is putting out of the reach of people with average incomes any chance of buying an average house.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues in Fianna Fáil went to the most unconscionable lengths in 1956 and 1957 to embarrass the then Fine Gael Minister for Local Government when there were restrictions on credit.  We in Fine Gael are concerned with human beings and not with partisan gain but when we see before us a Minister for Local Government who is quite casual about the restrictions on credit, when we see him denying that there is a restriction on credit, then we say that there is an obligation on us which we will discharge to challenge him and his colleagues in the Government on their indifference, an obligation to see that radical steps are taken in time to prevent a worsening of the situation.</P>
    <P>At the present time several builders have suspended operations because they are unable to obtain additional credit from the banks.  Most builders have to obtain short-term credit from the banks in the course of their house building operations and they repay the banks as soon as the purchasers of their houses pay over the money.  If the purchasers cannot get their money from the building societies and the insurance companies, they cannot pay <Col N="271" /> the builders and the builders cannot pay the banks.  The Minister does not have to rely on the slow process of Custom House inquiry or local authority inquiry to find out this.  There are plenty of solicitors and auctioneers in the Fianna Fáil Party or supporting it, and a few phone calls to these people will confirm the truth of what I say, that there has been a dangerous slowing down of the whole machinery of house purchase in the past few months and that the situation is getting worse and worse.</P>
    <P>I am told by a person in close association with banking interests that a certain amount of money drifted out of this country recently in pursuit of the hot rates of interest in operation in Britain.  If this is so, then firm steps should be taken to stop it and any money available in this country should be invested in the Irish people and in building houses for them.  We in Fine Gael believe that social investment in housing is part of and is essential to our economic expansion and that we cannot have economic expansion unless we have expansion in social investment. The two go together.</P>
    <P>The effort of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government to run the national motor car on two wheels around all corners is resulting in very dangerous driving.  Unless steps are immediately taken to put four wheels under the car and to provide the famous fifth wheel to guide it, there will be a serious crash.  That is the reason there is a grave necessity to jog the Government out of their Micawber-like attitude of believing that something will turn up in the nick of time to save them.  That smug indifference will not save the Irish people from the grave difficulties facing them at the moment and which will come to a crisis unless something is done immediately.</P>
    <P>It is commonplace that when credit restrictions operate, the building industry is the first to suffer.  The building industry in this country is already suffering, and if the Government do not take radical steps immediately, and we will not attack them for any reasonable steps they may take, the whole national machinery will foul <Col N="272" /> up.  The Government need not say then that we did not warn them and warn them in plenty of time.</P>
    <P>It is some time since the question of the provision of drainage for South-West Dublin was raised in this House. When it was raised, we appreciated that it was associated with the future of the Grand Canal.  I should like the Minister to tell the House the present position regarding additional drainage for South-West Dublin and the future of the Grand Canal.  On 6th May, 1964, the Minister told us that the Grand Canal drainage project had been referred back to Dublin Corporation for investigation.  When the matter was first raised with Dublin Corporation, some of us were the subject of vehement attacks from the Establishment in the Corporation and from those who support the Establishment. The most vicious attacks were made on people for having the audacity to suggest that something should be done about it.  We have been given every reason to fear official and administrative decision.  Some years ago there was a great deal of public interest&mdash; in fact, last year&mdash;in the question of whether or not the ESB should be permitted to demolish some fine specimens of Irish 18th century architecture. Instead of doing a manly thing about it, the Minister waited for the summer recess and when Deputies were enjoying a hard-earned rest, he made the decision to allow the ESB to go ahead with their plans.</P>
    <P>The question of the Grand Canal has fallen into the limbo of apparently forgotten things, things that some people would like to be forgotten.  There was on the Order Paper of the 17th Dáil a resolution relating to this matter and I have no doubt the proposers will retable it.  I am surprised that on a matter of such great importance we have not yet heard a word from these extraordinary institutions in recent times and I should be glad if the Minister would refer to the matter when replying as many people are interested in it.</P>
    <P>On the question of houses which become vacant, there is considerable and justifiable annoyance on the part of many of the 10,000 families seeking housing accommodation at the delay <Col N="273" /> which occurs in the reletting of vacant Corporation houses.  I have raised this matter in the Corporation and here and, apparently, it is not sufficient just to raise it with the Minister. Just as on other occasions, it must reach a crescendo of protest before there is an improvement in the situation. Some years ago such a crescendo did occur when a resolution was tabled and passed at the appropriate meeting of the City Council.  Once again when there is such an appalling and desperate need to provide housing in the shortest possible time, it is unpardonable to leave any unit of housing accommodation vacant for any more than the minimum time. Whatever it may cost to redecorate or repair these houses or even if they are never redecorated or repaired, they should be relet immediately they become vacant.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that part of the difficulty arises out of the long delays which are imposed on the Corporation in obtaining legal possession of some of these houses but it occurs to me that in this matter the Minister should consider if some steps could be taken to alleviate these delays in future and to empower local authorities to obtain immediate possession without having to resort to long processes which in the wisdom of the lawyers might need to exist for private housing but which I think are unnecessary in the case of local authorities. Certainly it would probably assist anything up to 50 or 100 families in being housed anything from two to three months earlier than they can be at present.  That amount of happiness which could be brought about and that reduction in unnecessary administration which could be caused would be a very great advantage.</P>
    <P>The problem of polluted rivers is one which concerns fishing and other interests and nature lovers but in large urban areas such as Dublin it has become an acute problem.  There is one such river and no matter how much one complains about it, it seems next to impossible to get the powers that be to do anything about it.  I have raised it <Col N="274" /> before here and I am doing so again now.  I am referring to the Camac River which must be one of the most foul-smelling, unpleasant-looking and repulsive streams passing through any town or city.  Some effective steps should be taken to cover in this stream once and for all.  Part of the problem, we are told, arises out of the fact that it is used for industrial purposes.  One does not wish to curtail industrial processes but the division of responsibility which would seem to be occurring in relation to this river, part of which is in the urban area and part in the county, causes great difficulty.  I should like to see the Minister taking his part in an effort to expedite the necessary covering-in of this stream.</P>
    <P>I am glad that at long, long last we are given some reason to hope from the Minister's statement that we shall have an improvement in the motor vehicle licensing system.  It is unbelievable that it has taken so long to get the powers that be to move in the simple matter of introducing a licensing system which would allow people to license their cars at any time of the year for a period of 12 months.  It is unbelievable that it has taken well- nigh 40 years, I think, since it was first proposed on this side that this should be done.  You can license your dog for a year at any time during the year, your radio, your television and, I suppose, your gun&mdash;I do not know, not being a supporter of these cruel sports&mdash;and you can take out these and many other licences but it has taken the Department of Finance, the Department of Local Government and the other fine administrative authorities that we are supposed to respect and not to criticise, years to decide to adopt a system here that has been generally adopted, the system of annual licensing of motor cars.  Thank God, after all this time, that reasonable proposal is to be adopted, or so we are assured, within the next 12 months.  Perhaps we shall get a free licence to celebrate but I think that would be too much to expect.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of local government which needs to be mentioned here.  Just as in the case of the annual licensing of motor vehicles which has been brought up for the <Col N="275" /> past 40 years and which has finally brought about the necessary reform, so also I am again raising the question of the ESB furniture, as the former Deputy Anthony Barry called it, the perpendicular ugliness that is unnecessarily foisted on our citizens.  I was glad to see a photograph recently in the Press and to find that some enterprising local development body or tourise association were arranging with the ESB for the removal of an ESB pole which was spoiling the main street of the town.  It really amazes me that in the older parts of Dublin and the older suburbs you have not got this succession of ESB wooden poles, with horizontal lines flowing from one to another.  If you move out from the centre of Dublin as far as Sundrive Road, you do not find that, but from there on as far as Tallaght, there is that succession of wooden poles.  You could take several other arterial routes out of Dublin city and in the older parts of the city, you do not find this, but in the modern parts, in the modern age when the ESB took over the electrification of the city, you have all this unnecessary ugliness foisted on the citizens.</P>
    <P>This is not a new problem.  In a famous Act which has been quoted and referred to a great deal over the past year or so, the Dublin Corporation Act, 1890, the Act which was invoked to deal with the so-called emergency of dangerous buildings, our grandfathers and great-grandfathers in their wisdom gave powers to the Dublin Corporation to prevent the destruction of amenities and the appearance of this city by the erection of perpendicular poles and horizontal lines but it appears that the later ESB Acts deprived the Corporation of any powers they had in that connection for the protection of the city.  The way in which many of our schemes are being developed is unpardonable.  Great care and attention are given to the lay-out of housing schemes.  Beautiful roads are laid; magnificent grass margins are then put down and each detail of perspective and each detail of height and breadth and length are carefully gone into to <Col N="276" /> provide a most attractive appearance to the eye.  If one sees architects' models of the proposed schemes, they all look magnificent.  As soon as they are put down, the only thing that offends is the long miserable succession of ESB poles and horizontal wires on one side and on the other side, the equally dreary march of Department of Posts and Telegraphs poles and the adjoining lines.</P>
    <P>A great deal of consideration is now being given, certainly more than ever before, to having municipal and local authority development of housing estates, the preparation of sites for housing and the laying down of roads and other amenities.  If this is to be done, and there is a great deal to be said for it, I would earnestly appeal to the Department of Local Government to see to it that these services are all put underground.  I do not believe it will cost any more to service them later on because they are underground.  It might, indeed, cost a great deal less. But, in relation to the total cost of housing and other projects at the present time, the installation of the services underground at the time the estates are being built and developed would be negligible and would certainly add greatly to the amenity value.</P>
    <P>This is real town planning, worth-while town planning, easy town planning. It is the kind of thing that can be done without having to pay millions and millions in compensation. These are the things that would make our cities and suburbs more pleasant. I would earnestly hope that the simple step of digging one trench and putting all services into that trench would be adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference in his introductory statement to tenant purchase schemes for local authority tenants and in the White Paper on housing published last year we were told that 80 per cent of rural occupiers of local authority houses are buying out their houses.  The Minister has expressed annoyance and disappointment that so few of the cities have a tenant purchase scheme for their tenants but it is quite clear that the real reason for this is that successive Ministers for Local Government here have refused <Col N="277" /> to continue payment of the interest subsidy on urban houses.  It is extraordinary. In fact, there is a statutory obligation on rural local authorities to have a tenant purchase scheme.  There is no such statutory obligation on urban authorities to have such a scheme and any time Dublin Corporation have sought Minister approval for a tenant purchase scheme the Minister has indicated that his approval would be forthcoming only if he were to be permitted to withdraw the housing subsidy.  In effect, that was a negative to the Corporation proposal because to withdraw the housing subsidy would make the cost of any tenant purchase scheme so unattractive that tenants would not avail of it.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there are some 45,000 families in Corporation houses.  I am using a round figure.  That is a vast estate and it brings with it all the human problems that are bound to arise where you have such a vast estate being administered by an administrative monster on one side and on the other, you have that administration being experienced by individuals and human beings with all the domestic variations that can occur within so many families.  The relationship between the Corporation and their tenants is not an entirely happy one and it could not be.  I do not believe that it would be possible to establish the correct friendly relationship between a landlord of 45,000 tenants and any individual tenant and the multitude of human problems that are bound to exist among such a vast number of people cannot be appreciated by or allowed for in the day to day operations of the officials who administer such a vast estate.</P>
    <P>The officials who administer this vast estate are human beings.  They are extremely charitable.  I know from personal knowledge of them that they are very fine individuals.  But, where you administer such a vast estate, you have to apply hard and fast rules and that has created all kinds of problems and situations in this huge housing estate.  This could be to a great extent relieved if ownership of a large proportion of these houses could pass out of <Col N="278" /> the hands of the impersonal monster of the Corporation into the hands of individual tenants themselves.</P>
    <P>At the present time the contribution which the State pays towards these houses is substantial and it would, if continued, make it possible for Dublin Corporation and other urban authorities to institute an acceptable scheme of tenant purchase.  I strongly press upon the Minister that he would introduce such a scheme or allow such a scheme to be introduced at an early date by continuing payment of the necessary subsidies.</P>
    <P>This, again, is a matter which has had the consideration of the Dáil. Before the dissolution of the Dáil, we had a motion on the Order Paper calling for the continuance of these housing subsidies and we will have to think about it again, unless the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking that he will see to it that these subsidies continue to be paid.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that it will not cost the State any more to continue to pay these subsidies.  In fact, if a tenant scheme is introduced and the State continues to pay the subsidies, the day will come when the former tenant will become owner of the house and the subsidy will cease.  So, in the long run, it will be to the nation's and the city's advantage and we believe that there will always be a sufficient pool of rented accommodation available to cater for the needs of people who wish to rent houses rather than buy them. Because we are convinced that it would answer many human problems and would create a better feeling of citizenship amongst the people concerned, we recommend this scheme to the Minister. Again, we do not recommend anything revolutionary or anything that is not respectable.</P>
    <P>I quoted earlier one Papal Encyclical by Pope John.  I may be forgiven if I make reference to another.  Where, in <i>Mater et Magistra</i>, he referred to the right to private property, he said:</P>
    <P>Now, if ever, is the time to insist on a more widespread distribution of property, in view of the rapid economic development of an increasing number of States.  It will <Col N="279" /> not be difficult for the body politic, by the adoption of various techniques of proved efficiency, to pursue an economic and sound policy which facilitates the widest possible distribution of private property in terms of durable consumer goods, houses, lands, tools and equipment (in the case of craftsmen and owners of family farms), the shares in medium and large business concerns. This policy is in fact being pursued with considerable success by several of the socially and economically advanced nations. </P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are pressing that we would take a step which is being carried out successfully by several of the socially and economically advanced nations.  We in Fine Gael are asking for a wider distribution of houses which, we are told by such a good authority as Pope John, follows as of right on the right to private property. There is no excuse in this day and age for continuing to deny that right to almost half of the families in Dublin and other urban areas.  On that account we think it would be a great step forward in our social and economic planning if we were to have a wider distribution of house ownership. We have acknowledged already long since the wisdom of house ownership in our Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, in the various housing subsidies and housing grants we give to people who are directly buying their own property.  Here we have an opportunity to take a similar step forward in relation to a large section of our community.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not yet taken the necessary steps under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, to have vehicles, particularly buses and other heavy vehicles tested for air pollution.  This is a serious and a growing problem. I am not going to pronounce on any matter on which a medical man might more properly comment but I think I can safely say that there are indications that cancer may be attributable to air pollution.  Certain surveys carried out in England and in America indicate that cancer occurs more frequently <Col N="280" /> in urban areas and I understand the greater the pollution of the air the greater is the incidence of cancer.</P>
    <P>One of the most considerable causes of air pollution is undoubtedly the diesel bus.  It is disgraceful that CIE have failed to tackle this problem.  One can go through other cities in the world without finding the discharge of filthy smoke that is expelled from buses here, clearly because the Government or the local authority in these areas do not allow such buses to be out on the street.  CIE have failed to deal with this problem.  These people may think this is a trivial matter which should not be raised in a national Parliament.  I make no apology for doing it here and elsewhere. It is utterly deplorable that a national concern with the resources of CIE continues to pollute indiscriminately the cities of this country and the sooner the Minister steps in to put an end to this the better.  It is common knowledge that heavy trucks and, indeed, motor cars are equally bad, and every day that continues is a blemish on the people who have power to stop this unnecessary pollution occurring.  It imposes a fraction of a penny a day on anybody to have proper equipment and, in fact, all the experts will tell you it will even save money because less fuel is consumed.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Michael O'Higgins last night complaining about the continuous white lines and the necessity to cross these white lines when cars are parked along narrow roads reminded me of a church in the suburbs of Dublin, between Church- town and Dundrum, outside of which church is a very narrow road and two very sharp bends.  During Divine Service in this church on Sunday mornings and other days of the week cars are parked bumper to bumper and any person wishing to traverse this road must either wait for the conclusion of the service, which might be an hour or more, in order to have these vehicles move along to permit him to stay on the right side of the white line, or else he must cross the white line and in doing so break the law and, I suppose, <Col N="281" /> in the event of a collision the person would find himself entirely in the wrong for crossing the white line.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to persecute the churchgoers of this particular church but I just quoted this as an instance of regular parking which obliges thousands of people to break the law. If there is an obligation on a person not to cross a continuous white line, an obligation lies on the Minister to see to it that parking does not occur along such a stretch of road which obliges people to break the law in order to pass along that road.  I have seen this type of thing occurring on many roads.  I am not aware that there is a regulation prohibiting the parking of such cars but steps should be taken by the Minister to make the necessary regulations to prevent that kind of thing happening.</P>
    <P>There is another scourge afflicting our towns and cities which must be tackled in a more practical and deliberate way than it has been up to now. I refer to the menace of the dumping of disused or unusable motor cars. I would have no difficulty in naming 12 roadways in my own constituency where such cars have been parked for several months past.  Other councillors and myself have brought this to the notice of Dublin Corporation and these obstacles have also been brought to the notice of the Garda Síochána but it takes several months to have them removed.  These are serious traffic hazards in many cases and they are unsightly, but in addition to their being traffic hazards and unsightly they are invitations to danger for children and the most shocking injuries have been caused to children through playing around these abandoned cars.  I understand that the Corporation of Bristol tackled this problem within the past few years by purchasing gear for the demolition of these cars for converting them into scrap metal and that they have since, within a matter of three years or so, recovered the total capital cost of the equipment they purchased in the sale of the scrap which they were able to produce and sell.  I should like to see the Minister for Local Government and local authorities, certainly in the <Col N="282" /> larger areas, adopting a similar scheme.</P>
    <P>We have at present on the outskirts of the city a number of graveyards for disused vehicles.  These are very unsightly and the danger is that in time land that could be used for building or agriculture will be covered with derelict cars.  As the number of motor cars increases on the roads so the number of abandoned vehicles will increase and quite clearly some steps will have to be taken now to cope with that situation. The ordinary municipal and local authority dumps are not suitable for these derelicts.  It would, I think, be well worthwhile making inquiries in Bristol to discover how that municipal authority were able to devise this plan and how it has worked.  It would, in principle, seem to be the kind of thing that should commend itself.  The Bristol Corporation are now making a substantial profit out of their operations and thereby making a contribution towards the relief of rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, I must complain about the inadequacy of the warning notices in relation to road repairs as well as the variation in the type of notices used.  On main roads, one meets signs warning that road works are in progress.  One travels many miles without coming across any such works.  At some subsequent point, one meets a similar sign, assumes it carries the same weight as the earlier one, and suddenly finds oneself landed into an extremely extensive area in which road works are actually in operation, without any really proper warning at all.  Again, one will meet a sign which says &ldquo;Dead Slow: Single Lane Traffic&rdquo;.  That is followed by the finest stretch of road capable of taking four or five lanes of traffic.  Before the journey ends, one meets a similar warning. Once more one assumes it has the same impact as the earlier one and suddenly one finds oneself in almost serious difficulty with single lane traffic and no really adequate warning at all.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for those who permit such inadequate marking and such variations in marking.  That would not be tolerated on any railway and, if an accident occurred because of inadequate <Col N="283" /> warning, those responsible would either be dismissed or fined.  The consequences would be extremely serious for anyone responsible for puting  up improper notices.  If necessary, there should be roving inspectors to ensure that there are proper, uniform notices, which mean what they say and are wholly applicable to the circumstances about which they purport to give warning.</P>
    <P>Again, in cities and towns, traffic has very often to be diverted when road repairs are being carried out. Instead of diverting that traffic at a sensible point, perhaps a long distance back, it is diverted as closely as possible to where the repairs are being carried out, with the result that the traffic is tangled in a horrible mess in all kinds of alleyways and laneways that were never intended to take such traffic.  The Department and the local authorities should get together to work out a proper system of notices to ensure adequate signposting of our roads and to ensure also that the responsible engineers give proper warning according to a uniform standard.  Where the engineers fail to do that, they should be personally accountable for any damage that may result because of their neglect.</P>
    <P>The present chaos cannot be tolerated any longer.  In Northern Ireland and in Britain, the police go around with a warning kit which enables them to divert traffic, as and when occasion necessitates.  This may be a matter for the Minister for Justice, perhaps; unfortunately it is one of those problems in which a number of Ministers have partial responsibility and it is difficult therefore to pinpoint the ultimate responsibility. As part of the campaign for road safety, I would ask the Minister for Local Government to ensure that proper road marking is put into operation without delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement said a number of new main roads will be provided, together with an improvement in existing arterial roads. In future, I suggest the Minister make it obligatory to provide footpaths for <Col N="284" /> pedestrians on all main roads.  The number of pedestrians and cyclists mown down by motorists at night time makes sad reading.  In many cases the unfortunate motorists cannot be blamed and many of these tragic accidents are inevitable.  The Minister made a regulation some time ago obliging pedestrians to walk on the right hand side of rural roadways.  I doubt if there is a member of this House who has not seen time out of number since this regulation was made pedestrians breaking the regulation.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that footpaths should be provided to give some protection to pedestrians.  If a large lump of metal is hurtling along a road at 70 mph vying with pedestrians for the same space, there are bound to be serious accidents.  The only way of avoiding them is by providing footpaths for pedestrians.  There are areas in our cities and towns in which footpaths are not as necessary as they are along country roads.  As we improve the roads and as traffic inevitably moves faster over them, it will become more and more necessary to provide some protection for pedestrians.  I think the provision of footpaths would add only a very small cost to the existing bill for roads.  From the point of view of the safety of human beings, it would be a worth-while investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very properly concerned for the appearance of our cities and towns.  There is one little matter in this city which Dublin Corporation are not prepared to put right and I appeal to the Minister to intervene. Every spring the Corporation spend a good deal of the ratepayers' money painting black and white traffic bollards.  If the weather is inclement, within a matter of weeks, these become spattered with mud.  The Corporation will take no steps to clean them.  The number of times these would have to be washed would probably not exceed more than a dozen, even in such busy places as O'Connell Street, College Green and Dame Street.</P>
    <P>On 5th April I had a letter from the Corporation telling me there are over 300 bollards and, if weekly washing <Col N="285" /> were undertaken, the cost would amount to several thousand pounds per annum and there is no provision in the estimates for such washing.  I was not asking the Corporation to wash 300 bollards every week.  It is not necessary to wash them every week.  It is not necessary to paint 300 bollards black and white every spring.  If they were washed down, there would be no need to do it.  It seems to me perfectly daft to go around painting these every spring and then allowing them to become covered with mud, so that for 11 months of the year, you cannot see the black and white stripes, and then wash off the mud in the following spring and put on new black and white stripes.  These are not necessary at all because the old ones are preserved by the coat of protective mud thrown over them within a couple of weeks of their being put there.  This again is a small matter, but I have not been able to persuade the high and mighty Dublin Corporation to do anything about it.  I would hope they might suffer a little embarrassment by seeing it raised in the House and that there might be some improvement in that connection.</P>
    <P>Within the past few days, the Minister addressed a letter to Dublin Corporation about the cattle markets. A proposal has been made that Dublin Corporation exercise the powers conferred on them by the Dublin Corporation (Markets) Act, 1899, and erect auction marts.  That would appear perfectly reasonable for the Corporation to do.  But in the same Act, passed in the days of Victoria, there is a provision that a number of firms would not be permitted to conduct auction marts when the Corporation would itself erect a mart.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act states:</P>
    <P>For ten years after the passing of this Act and afterwards until the Corporation shall have provided a suitable auction mart for the sale of store cattle the persons named in the Second Schedule hereto their executors administrators and assigns shall be entitled respectively to hold on their premises mentioned in the Second Schedule respectively the <Col N="286" /> sales of the classes of live stock and animals specified in the third column of the said schedule.</P>
    <P>In effect, what has happened is this. Since 1899 the Dublin Corporation did not put up an auction mart. Since then a number of reputable firms have conducted auction marts. They have invested their own money in auction marts.  They have answered the need of the people wishing to sell cattle over these years.  That they have answered this need is proven by the fact that the drift has been from the old type of cattle sale in the Dublin Corporation market to these private firms that have provided the auction mart.</P>
    <P>The business carried on by these people is a perfectly legitimate business. Nobody can say otherwise.  It has brought a great service to the people of Dublin and to the people who come there for the sale of cattle. It has now been suggested that Dublin Corporation should not permit these people to continue if the Corporation builds their own auction mart, that they should avail of the powers given to them by Victoria's Parliament to put out of business the legitimate traders who have answered the needs of the cattle trade and the people of Dublin for threequarters of a century.  This is an intolerable suggestion. I am appalled to think that such a suggestion should be made.</P>
    <P>Against that, it is argued that it is open to the people who have had auction marts in the past to come to the Corporation auction mart and trade there, the same as anybody else. I do not think that answers the case. That is like saying to a draper in this city: &ldquo;You must close your drapery shop.  We will not allow you to operate any more in your own drapery shop.  Instead, you must come down to the Daisy Market and sell your clothes there.&rdquo;  To suggest that that would not be unfair is, I think, to make a ridiculous suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Corporation are losing money on the existing cattle market.  Quite clearly, it would be entirely wrong for the Corporation to continue to tolerate that loss.  I suppose the Corporation as such to-day in the twentieth <Col N="287" /> century have no real obligation to provide facilities for the sale of cattle at all.  I imagine the obligation arose out of a form of town planning in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries when steps had to be taken to stop every farmer coming in from the country and dumping his pile of hay or leaving his cattle at any old point of the city, thereby causing all kinds of obstruction, nuisance and offence. Steps had to be taken in those days to restrict the market to particular areas.  The result was that originally you had Smithfield as the market for cattle, horses and hay, and other parts of the city designated for farm produce and fish.</P>
    <P>To-day, if the Corporation closed their markets altogether, the sales of cattle would probably be successfully carried out by private interests.  The Corporation now have sufficient powers in the various Planning Acts to control where those sales would take place, the type of building that would be there and the various facilities that would be provided for bringing cattle to these salesyards.  But the Corporation appreciate they have an obligation, which must be discharged fairly to the salesmasters who have operated for generations in the existing Corporation market.  We feel the needs of those people could best be answered by the provision within the Corporation market of an auction mart to meet the needs of the farming community&mdash;which appears at present to have an inclination to prefer that type of trade&mdash;and, at the same time, to conduct on the Corporation property the type of cattle sales the Corporation have facilitated over the years.  All this can be done if an amendment is made to the Dublin Corporation (Markets) Act, 1899.</P>
    <P>I think that amendment is called for.  I should be glad to think that the Minister would see his way to make the necessary amendment in that legislation. Plain justice&mdash;something often hard to get&mdash;demands no less than that.  I do not think it requires any more either.  The fair thing to do is to see to it that a legitimate trade, developed over the years because of <Col N="288" /> the failure of the public authority to build an auction mart, will be permitted to continue in the future.</P>
    <P>I notice there is another section in the 1899 Act which permits other people to continue in perpetuity selling horses, mules, asses and other animals of that kind.  Both of these sections have been trying to make some in- the people mentioned in the Schedule have been carrying on these sales.&rdquo;  I have been trying to make some inquiries into the reason for the difference between the treatment given to the cattle men and that given to the horse dealers.  It seems the horse dealer was in operation from time immemorial, whereas cattle sales by auction were in operation from only four or five years immediately before the Act.  Probably in 1899 the legislators thought they had been doing it for so long that they should be permitted to continue indefinitely.  They would not suffer great hardship if they were closed down within ten years, and if they were given adequate warning. It could be done without any injustice whatsoever to people who have traded in the Dublin Corporation mart for many years.</P>
    <P>By building an auction mart, they will be providing facilities for those people, and for those salesmasters.  It seems to me that Dublin Corporation would be entitled to see to it that Corporation property was not used to the detriment of the Corporation auction mart.  At present the Corporation give a facility to one at least of the private interests who use Corporation property for the passage of animals into the yards of the private interests.</P>
    <P>I know this matter has been under discussion for a number of years past. In fact, I do not think the interests of any of the parties involved are being served by further procrastination, and it would be of great assistance to the Corporation in their deliberations if the necessary legislation were introduced without further ado.  Justice and equity require an amendment of the 1899 Act, and the sooner that amendment is introduce the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> In dealing with local government, and the jungle of local government law, one could take two years.  I do not intend to proceed on that path, because if I started, the Government might be out of office before I finished.  I should like to impress upon the Minister the urgency of several matters which I mentioned.  I hope that in the matter of housing we will get something more than empty promises, something more than cocktail parties, something more than press conferences, something which will produce homes for our people in the shortest possible time.  I hope that immediate steps will be taken to ensure that whatever else may have to wait because of a shortage of money, the provision of homes for our fathers and mothers and children will not have to wait.  That is a most fundamental matter.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with the words I quoted at the outset.  It has been acknowledged that it is society's obligation to provide food and clothing, but we have not yet convinced all our people that housing must similarly be provided.  Unless we do that and, if necessary, sacrifice ourselves in doing it, we will never solve the housing problem in our time.  As none of us has too long to spend in this world, and as our children must grow up in a very short space of years, we cannot delay for a single hour in the provision of housing for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to be very brief.  I intended to comment on one or two points only but I find it necessary now to add a little more to what I had intended to say.  I am conscious of the fact that improvements are necessary in this Department and all other Departments and I believe that in time I may be able to make some contribution to alleviating some of the problems which are causing concern.  Blameplacing  is not the answer, but constructive planning, and a vigorous approach to the problems that exist.  The Minister has injected a vigorous and new approach into the many outstanding problems which has brought great relief to many in the not too distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it necessary to say a little <Col N="290" /> more than I had intended because of the fact that Deputy Ryan accused Fianna Fáil of everything from birth control to creating itinerants.  He spoke at length of the housing problem, the problem in relation to dangerous buildings, the creation of itinerants, the condition of Griffith Barracks, and he shed crocodile tears for the unfortunate people removed from condemned houses, for the unfortunate people in Griffith Barracks, and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When that matter was discussed by Dublin Corporation, when members of the Corporation were conscious of the problem that existed and had sympathy and support for the people who were being dispossessed, and for the people who lost their lives, not on one single occasion did Deputy Ryan attend a meeting of the Housing Committee or offer one single suggestion, during that critical period. On this occasion, as on every other occasion concerning Dublin Corporation, he is now critical of what was done.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Ryan tonight, one would think he was not a member of Dublin Corporation.  Members of the Corporation have collective responsibility on many matters&mdash;on matters of housing, and many other matters to which he referred tonight.  During those discussions the Chairman and other members of the Housing Committee devoted many hours to discussions, trying to alleviate the distress which was caused by that situation. They offered remedies.  Perhaps they were not all excellent remedies, but after painstaking efforts, some remedies were brought to fruition.  On many occasions Deputy Ryan has come to the Corporation and made a scene, making the same irresponsible statements as he made here today, some of them completely erroneous.</P>
    <P>I would say that in his Party there are loyal members of Dublin Corporation who atended the Housing Committee meetings and who were a party to the decisions arrived at which Deputy Ryan condemned here today.  He has condemned the actions of Dublin Corporation on many occasions.  In his approach to other <Col N="291" /> activities of that body of which he is a member he has been guilty of a grave breach of ethics in referring to a matter which is under discussion at the moment, in relation to which no decision has been arrived at and on which I would not attempt to forecast a decision.  If he thinks that by his attitude here today he will colour the minds of some of our members, he is mistaken.  The members will be guided by justice and by a determined effort to do what is proper and right.</P>
    <P>To get back to the housing situation, we are well aware in the constituency which I represent and in Dublin Corporation that for quite a considerable period many houses were vacant or pinned up at considerable expense to the ratepayer because of the large amount of damage done.  As a result, the housing programme of Dublin Corporation was slowed down.  The fact that there was no demand for houses was due to the policy and the period of inactivity of the previous inter-Party Government.  We are well aware of the situation in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are responsible members of Dublin Corporation.  The Chairman of the Housing Committee, Deputy Larkin, did a remarkable job along with other members.  It is a reflection on Deputy Ryan and his members to condemn the only action that could be taken in certain circumstances, when he never on one single occasion attended a meeting during the housing crisis.  As a matter of fact, it is at Housing Committee meetings one can put forward suggestions. Even if one is not a member of the Housing Committee one can put forward suggestions that may bring relief to those in distress.  Only on one occasion since he became a member did Deputy Ryan attend a meeting of the Corporation.  For the record, that was in 1961.  Hearing him speaking here today, one would think that he was the only person interested in the distressed people of Dublin.  I have an interest in them.  I attended the meetings at a loss of time to myself and when it affected my own pocket.  But <Col N="292" /> Deputy Ryan, a full-time politician with plenty of time, indicated that he could not attend because meetings were at times unsuitable to him.  He could not attend to the needs of his constituents.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan spoke about the fact that we tried to enforce birth control because people were put into Griffith Barracks.  He referred to Griffith Barracks in many terms&mdash;in fact, calling it a night shelter.  I agree Griffith Barracks is not suitable and that some steps should be taken to remedy the situation.  I have made my presence felt in Dublin Corporation and in the Dublin Health Authority in relation to Griffith Barracks.  It was on my suggestion that the Dublin Health Authority visited Griffith Barracks and will in future visit it.  The irresponsible conduct here today is just what we expect in Dublin Corporation. Deputy Ryan indicated that we do not want to have the people on the waiting list on our conscience.  He is probably aware that at the moment a proposal of mine to introduce a new system for the <Col N="293" /> allocation of houses on a points basis is under examination.  I believe the allocation system in operation at the moment by Dublin Corporation does not afford justice to many of the people on the list.  For that reason, I put down a motion many months ago in the hope that justice will be done and that the defects which are there will be remedied.  So far, it has not come before the Housing Committee but I am sure it will in due course.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his efforts in stimulating interest in and in bringing the Ballymun scheme into operation.  It was the Minister, and he alone, who brought this about.  When it was first mentioned to Dublin Corporation we were told there was no water and that the other services were not available.  The Minister said: &ldquo;We will find them&rdquo;, and he found them.  The 3,000 people who will be accommodated there can thank the Minister for Local Government, for it was due to his foresight and assistance that the scheme can go ahead.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to ask the Minister to consider, if not on this Estimate then on another one.  It is the question of the subsidy for the overhaul of the married quarters.  These people who have served the nation honourably in arms over a period of 30 years find, on discharge from the Army, difficulty in procuring accommodation.  As you are aware, many of those men move around the country from one town to another, ending up in Dublin and finding it difficult to obtain accommodation because of our low priority rating in view of the low subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Ryan on the question of the south city sewerage scheme.  There is no doubt that the whole south city area which is tied up at the moment will be tied up more in future unless this scheme is proceeded with.  Efforts have been made to deal with this matter and I would ask the Minister to ensure that there will be no undue hold up in his Department in regard to any reasonable scheme put forward to bring about <Col N="294" /> a situation of further development in the south city area.</P>
    <P>In connection with swimming pools there are one or two matters I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  One is that swimming pools can no longer be regarded as an amenity in a particular area but rather an essential service.  It is necessary for the local authorities to avail of the generous grants already made available by the Minister.  It is callous neglect of duty by the local authorities to fail to implement these schemes and not measure up to their responsibilities in providing swimming pools.  I am glad to know the Minister has under consideration a pool suitable for requirements at a very low charge.  We hope in the near future that the now famous Crumlin Pool, which we have been promised over the years, and which has been kicked from the City Hall to the Custom House and back again, will at least get under way.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is no undue delay in his Department in respect of any of the matters that may arise in connection with this work which would impede its completion.</P>
    <P>I hope the local authorities will in future take greater heed of the Minister's suggestion that the provision of this pool should be proceeded with and developed.  The children in the outer perimeter areas of Dublin, Ballyfermot, Drimnagh, Walkinstown an Bluebell, are swimming in quarries and disused canals.  They are also swimming in rat-infested cesspools.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago I had a motion before Dublin Corporation asking that a comprehensive survey be made of the city's need for swimming pools.  I asked that this be done in order that Dublin Corporation would be in a position to prepare a programme for execution over a period of four years.  That survey is at present under consideration and I hope something will come of it and that my contribution will make it possible to have swimming pools at an early date in the majority of city areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, in connection <Col N="295" /> with pollution, that the rat-infested river, described as the Camac, has been under review and is the subject of discussion in view of the fact that the Potez factory at Baldonnel want to empty waste into it.  There is no fish whatever in this river.  The only things there are a few pinkeens above Baldonnel and if this very fine factory at Baldonnel is to be sacrificed for those few pinkeens, it is a sorry state for the country.  I hope this factory, which is situated on the border of my constituency, will open soon, unlike that other factory at Inchicore which was so ruthlessly destroyed a few years ago.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if it is in his power, to ensure that a comprehensive survey is made of the Camac and that something is done in order to cover this open pool. I am sure if there is any insistence that it is a danger to public health, as it is, although the city medical officer has indicated there is no pollution, something will be done.  I know private residents on the border of the Camac have had the water tested and it has been stated that it is highly polluted.  The foul-smelling water in this rat-infested river is a source of severe danger to foodstuffs in houses on its banks, particularly during the warm summer weather.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that polluted rivers, such as the Camac, are brought into some sort of respectable condition.</P>
    <P>I said I did not intend to say very much.  I was probably carried away by the nonsense of the previous speaker.  I should like to say in conclusion that the most important thing is the housing of our people.  I am quite sure that, with the Minister's aid, the housing programme can go ahead with greater speed than before.  I might indicate that the Ballymun scheme is in addition to the normal Corporation programme which has been stepped up considerably at the moment and will be stepped up further in the future.  If the labour force can be recruited, it will stimulate further this housing programme.</P>

      <P>I have been a member of this House for approximately <Col N="296" /> four months and it is about time I stood up to say a few words, particularly on this Estimate.  Listening to the previous speaker, one would think this Estimate has nothing to do with any part of the country except Dublin city.  You must realise that we are alive in the west of Ireland, in the south, in the north and in all parts of the 26 counties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling criticised Deputy Ryan for not attending the Housing Committee meetings. I am not very familiar with Housing Committee meetings or anything like that, but I would like to inform the Deputy that Deputy Ryan is not a member of that particular Committee. During the first part of his speech, the Deputy criticised Deputy Ryan for what he had said.  I consider Deputy Ryan covered this Estimate very well indeed and at great length.  He said himself he would like to speak on it for two years.  I do not intend to speak on it for two years&mdash;&mdash;two minutes would be much nearer to it.</P>
      <P>This Estimate relates to housing, town planning, county and main roads, road traffic and the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I propose to say a few words on each of these matters.  With regard to housing, there is a great delay in the payment of grants.  This in turn entails a delay for the people who want to build houses.  It entails a delay for them in applying to the county council for a supplementary grant.  Most of the builders' providers have to borrow money from the banks and with the present delay, they have to pay interest on it.  In my home town of Dunmore, the business people are giving materials on credit to farmers and workers to build houses, for reconstruction grants and to repair their homes.  The shopkeepers have to pay interest on these loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of materials for building houses is going up and interest has to be paid by those people.  They have to wait so long for the grants in the meantime that whatever benefit they give them is swallowed up by the interest they have to pay.  I would <Col N="297" /> urge on the Minister to speed up the allocation of those grants.  It seems to be the general practice that whatever grants one is entitled to, one is always cut on the amount.  One never gets what one is entitled to.  The idea is to cut you down as low as possible and, not alone that, but people have to wait eight, nine, ten or 12 months, and even 18 months, for what they are justly entitled to.  I would ask the Minister to look into this problem and to try to get his Department to speed up the payment of those grants. This matter needs complete reorganisation  and I doubt if we can have it under the present administration.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about this Town Planning Act.  There is a lot of red tape regarding where you can build a house, whether you will be permitted to build a house here or there.  I know you cannot let a man build his house in front of another man's house, too near a public road or in any place that would affect the widening of roads, nor can you allow it to be built in a place where it would be an eyesore to the general public.  It almost takes as long to get the Town Planning authorities to give permission to build as it does to get the grant from the Department of Local Government.  The Minister should also look into this problem and try to speed it up.  There are many people in my county who are looking for those grants and they find they have to wait six months for permission to build.  There is too much red tape attached to it.  I would urge the Minister to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>On the subject of county and main roads, much good work has been done to bring our main roads up to the required standard.  Undoubtedly a lot of good work has been done but the House must realise that there are a lot of dust tracks yet, particularly in the west of Ireland.  The people there deserve a tarred road, the same as their town cousins.  It is time more money was allocated to the tarring of those country roads.  It would certainly be a good idea.  If, in the middle of the summer a car passes you at 20, 30 or <Col N="298" /> 40 miles per hour on one of those dust tracks, then, for 10 minutes afterwards, you breathe nothing but dust.  I urge the Minister to spend more money in this connection.  It is a real necessity. It is the natural right of the people who have to use those roads and who have to put up with this dust.  In the long run, it would cost a lot less.  Passing along any of those roads today, or any day, you can see a man with a shovel.  It is a full-time job for him to shovel a bit of sand just here and there.  It would be much more beneficial to the users of those roads if they were tarred and, as I say, it would cost much less in the long run.</P>
    <P>Road traffic has been dealt with at length by Deputy Ryan.  I want to refer to the 30 miles per hour speed limit signs.  In the first place, I do not think these signs should be so far away from the main towns.  In some cases they are almost two miles outside the towns and in other cases a mile. In the case of some towns, they are quite near.  I fully agree with the idea of having a 30 miles per hour speed limit in Dublin but, for the ghost towns between here and the west of Ireland, it is a great waste of time to have a 30 miles per hour speed limit: you could have a 40 miles per hour speed limit for them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there are too many signs in the country.  I do not know whether these signs were erected by private contract or by the county councils in co-operation with the Department of Local Government but if it was done by private contract then it was a damn good job and a great source of revenue to some individual or some bunch of individuals.  One of these 30 miles per hour signs is quite sufficient for any town, if it is a 30 miles per hour sign that you are having and, for most towns, 40 miles per hour is quite sufficient.</P>
    <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act, established in 1948, continued in operation from 1948 to 1957.  In this and in previous Estimates of this Government, no money has been laid out for works under that Act.  Such works are most essential, particularly in the west.  Consider our drainage <Col N="299" /> position there.  We have one main scheme&mdash;and a member from the Government side of the House was not responsible for the scheme I am talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act links drainage and land reclamation.  There must be some link between these two and it existed between 1948 and 1957.  There was not the drainage previous to 1948. Fortunately, we had an inter-Party Government for six or seven years or I am quite sure that in the west of Ireland we would never have seen any arterial drainage.  I should like the Minister to consider putting some money aside for works under this important Act.  It is very necessary for the link between arterial drainage and land reclamation.</P>
      <P>A lot of land was reclaimed but, because it is impossible to get money for the link between the two, the reclaimed land is going back to its previous state and the reclamation was, therefore, a waste of time.  The Minister should wake up to the fact that this House must look outside Dublin and, for him, outside Donegal and must look at the rest of the country as well. I hope that, in the few short words I have uttered here this evening, I have contributed something to this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to commend the Minister on cutting some of the red tape which has been such a source of annoyance and, indeed, strangulation in respect of the efforts of local authorities, particularly in my county of Kerry, to improve our housing position and to speed up our housing drive.  If I have any further comment to make it is that I should much prefer to see a lot more of the red tape done away with.  However, I am sure that the Minister in his wisdom and as he sees fit will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county, the provision of extra housing is a terrible source of worry to our council.  We are making every <Col N="300" /> effort to try to meet the needs of our people.  We require practically 1,000 rural houses to meet the demand our people have imposed on us.</P>
    <P>I listened to the speeches of previous Deputies and particularly to the remarks of Deputy Ryan.  I do not know the merits or demerits of the position relating to Dublin Corporation but I clearly remember that from 1957 until 1959, or so, tenants could not be found for houses built in Dublin.  Indeed, in my own county, there was a reluctance on the part of our people to accept houses, which at that time were available for 10/- or 12/- a week, as they saw no hope of finding money to pay for them.  The very fact that today we have reached the stage that a colossal number of people are looking for houses and are prepared to pay £1 per week, between rent and rates, although some of them are very poor, is an indication of the progress made under the efforts of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan's remarks would indicate that he is completely dissatisfied with the result of the voice of the people.  Surely a result given so clearly should be sufficient to enable him to realise that the people know where they can best be served.  Deputy Ryan suggested that it was rather the better-off people who put Fianna Fáil back in Government.  It has always been established that it is the poorer people throughout the country who elect the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed it was the poorer people in my part of the country who elected us.</P>
    <P>We face a very great task in meeting the demands for housing and it is our duty on all sides of the House to try to find ways and means of satisfying this demand.  In my county we are troubled with a shortage of building experts to carry out our programme.  Our aim in rural housing is to build 300 houses a year.  We have brought back many of our people from England and hope that many more will be induced to return in the next few years to help us build for the Kerry of today as well as the Kerry of the future.</P>
    <P>When criticism is correctly levelled, it can be very useful, but senseless <Col N="301" /> criticism is a waste of time and injures rather than helps our efforts. I would ask the Minister, if he has time, to try to get around to the different local authorities and impress on their staffs the necessity to speed up housing output.  A lot of the weight could be taken from the housing demand if we were prepared to accommodate our older people in smaller houses.  Many old age pensioners need re-housing and a very simple structure comprising a kitchen and two rooms would do.  However, the Department still insist on a five- roomed house and local authorities can produce only so many of those each year.  If we were permitted to build a smaller type house that would last out the remaining years of the old people living in them, we would be better able to satisfy the general demand for houses.  I suggest that if the Minister had consultations with the local authorities, many of the difficulties imposed on us by the Department could be resolved at local level.</P>
    <P>I go on from housing to roads.  There is need for examination of the existing departmental regulations governing local authorities.  In Kerry the county road grant was reduced last year and there has been a further reduction this year, though 40 per cent of our roads still need dust-free surfaces and strengthening.  Many of our farmers in backward areas, particularly our mountain farmers, are hindered in their efforts to achieve greater production because they cannot get lime or fertilisers over those roads.</P>
    <P>In Kerry we believe in a slowing down of the level of grants for arterial and main roads.  We submit that the existing level is sufficient.  However, the Department have imposed on the local authority the requirement that most of the tourist grant should be spent on main roads to the detriment of county and other smaller roads.  I would remind the Minister that tourists go into the most remote corners of Kerry and the wear and tear by cars and caravans on minor and county roads has been throwing a heavier burden on us.  This year in Kerry we <Col N="302" /> were faced with a rate of £4 in the £. We had to impose an extra charge of 1s. 6d. in the £ in order to provide £26,000 to do something with our back roads.</P>
    <P>I seriously ask the Minister to go thoroughly into this question which is of such importance to us in Kerry.  All the efforts of our engineers are being channelled into the improvement and construction of main roads while our backward areas are being neglected.  I suggest we should be permitted to devote a high proportion of our tourist grant to what I would call our dust tracks.</P>
    <P>Another great headache and worry to the local authorities in Kerry is the upward spiral of our rates.  Our rates are practically £4 in the £ this year and this cannot be allowed to go further. I do not know what steps can be taken to bring about rates stabilisation but something must be done.  Otherwise production efforts in the county will be brought to a halt.  We cannot allow the rate to go beyond £4 in the £ because as it is, many of our people, particularly in the small towns are already hard hit.  Small shopkeepers whose income does not exceed £4 or £5 a week have valuations of £10, £12 and £15 and have to pay rates of up to £60 a year.  They have to do without the necessaries of life.  Apart from this, they are badly affected by the growth of multiple shops and street traders.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done to ease their burden.  In addition, many of our old age pensioners living in cottages which carry rates have to meet burdens of up to £26 a year. I know many of them in my town, some single pensioners and some couples, who have to meet this crushing burden.  I have succeeded in some cases in getting complete abolition of rates demands by the county manager, who is empowered to do this, but many old people will not accept it. They believe they have an obligation to pay it.  They know their time in this world is very limited and in some cases I have found them reluctant to accept a clearance of rates because they think it will be against them in the next world.  Some legitimate relief <Col N="303" /> should be given.  The farming community have been getting reliefs but unfortunately our poorer people in towns, and particularly small business people, get no relief.  They have to pay up and they benefit very little, if at all, from the grants and assistance schemes available to the community in general.  It is time there was some adjustment, some relief of this crushing burden.</P>
    <P>I pass on to water and sewerage schemes which in my county are going ahead very rapidly.  A big proportion of our rural community are now supplied with piped water and during the next few years the great bulk of them will have it.  There is only one grievance I have in this respect.  I would ask the Minister to take up with the local authorities the existing system whereby these schemes always seem to begin in the month of April, with the result that when the tourist season arrives whole tourist areas are dug up.  I cannot understand why these schemes could not be started in October or November so that the areas would be ready to receive the tourists in the spring and summer.  I had a case in Killorglin where we had the necessary approval in July last but yet work did not start on the scheme until just a week ago.  We have tourists with caravans trying to pass through sections of streets which are rendered too narrow to enable them to get through.  Hold-ups result and there are long delays for traffic and particularly for business people who have lorries held for long periods. This is something that should be gone into at Department level and some adjustment brought about.</P>
    <P>A closer look at the town planning system which now operates is very necessary.  In my county people have to apply for permission to erect a wall around a house.  Some simple system should be devised in cases like this. Many farmers who wish to build out- offices do not know where they stand. They send in the necessary application and there is undue delay at the local authority office in informing them whether or not they are subject to town planning.  It should now be possible to <Col N="304" /> devise a system which would ease the delay and make the position clearer and simpler.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister once again to consider providing a smaller type of house, a simpler and cheaper type of house, for our old age pensioners, of whom there are many in Kerry.  In former times, they were able to get wheaten straw or oaten straw for thatching their houses but with the advent of the combine, which breaks up the straw, they cannot get the necessary thatch for their houses, which then fall into decay and in many cases we find that rain pours through the roofs.  The provision of a simpler type of house would be of immense help and would reduce our demand in Kerry for the better type of house.  I think it is a great sign of the times that people are able, in rural areas, to face up to rentals of £1 a week.</P>
    <P>All sides of this House should get their shoulders to the wheel in getting the necessary effort going to produce the greatest number of houses possible. Criticism in its own way is very useful as long as it is constructive criticism but a lot of the criticism flung across the floor of this House serves no purpose and discourages many of the efforts of our people to bring about the better Ireland we all hope to see in the years left to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first points I want to mention is in connection with housing.  The previous speaker mentioned that this country should be made a better place and I feel that one essential that must be tackled by the Department of Local Government is to see that people are properly housed.  This is something on which the Government have fallen down.  The housing drive over the past few years has not been anything like what it should have been. I know that in my own county and in the town of Carlow, there are people living in conditions which would be a disgrace in any country.  During recent weeks, I have seen one urban council house in which 14 people were living, a father and mother and their children, and another husband and wife and their child.  This is something which should not be tolerated in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that young married couples who go to urban council houses may find after a period that the people with whom they are staying need the rooms they occupy. I have come across cases where people who had to get out of such houses had nowhere to go but into houses which had actually been condemned.  I understand that the position is that these people can be rehoused but the council are not entitled to a full subsidy in such cases.  There should be no necessity for that, and the housing drive by the Department should be much greater than it has been.</P>
    <P>In regard to swimming pools, I am all in favour of any developments that take place in this respect.  Any financial assistance given by the Department in connection with the erection of swimming pools will be money well spent and it would be money which no taxpayer would begrudge.  The training of young people in the art of swimming is essential to-day particularly for the poorer sections of the community, the young children who are not in a position to get away for a summer holiday, who have never seen the seaside and for whom it is not safe to swim in our rivers or pools. If the provision of money by the Department was responsible for the building of a pool that would save even one person from drowning, it would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>In regard to town planning, I am afraid that under the Act there will be undue delays, especially in the case of farmers.  I fully realise that it is necessary that unsightly buildings should not be built in the countryside. In the past fortnight, I came across the case of a farmer who wanted to build a hay-barn for silage and because that barn was over 21 feet high, he had to seek town planning permission.  Now he has to wait for a month from the date of putting the notice in the newspaper and I do not know how long he will have to wait after that.  I expect it will depend on the number of applications.</P>
    <P>This barn was some distance from the road and was at the back of a number of buildings.  I am not blaming <Col N="306" /> the local body for the position&mdash;they are acting in accordance with the regulations&mdash;but the Department should not tie the local council or the local town planning officer with red tape.  The barn in question was about 22½ feet high and that man will now be held up.  This is the month of April and the month he has to wait will bring him to the end of May and by the time he can start building, it will be June so that it will be really no advantage to him at all this year. I mention that to draw the Minister's attention to a point that is of interest and that may arise again and surely will arise again amongst the farmers.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned speed limits.  In certain cases the speed limit signs of 30 miles per hour are placed too far outside the towns.  It is essential to have speed limits but the signs are sited too far out.  Wherever they are, they should be strictly enforced. That may be more a matter for the Department of Justice but it is my belief that the speed limits are not being observed in many areas.  The Minister has mentioned that he hopes to examine further possibilities under the Road Traffic Act with regard to drunken driving.  I do not think I could agree more with anybody on anything than in this regard.  It is something that we cannot be too strict about and I hope the Minister will see that the law is strictly enforced in this respect.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of the previous Dáil, the Department brought in a scale of charges for the display of goods, the erection of weighing machines and so on.  In doing that, the Department were finding another way of putting their hands deeper into the pockets of the taxpayers.  This is a new type of taxation and one that is most unjust and unfair.  If a person wishes to display his goods outside his shop or to put a weighing machine outside it, he has to pay for the use of the footpath for which both he and everybody else are already paying rates.  This is something which should be reconsidered by the Department.</P>
    <P>While not finding fault with the officials of the Department, from whom I have always received the utmost <Col N="307" /> courtesy and help, I feel that there must be some way of avoiding the undue delay that takes place in the payment of grants for reconstruction and other matters.  I have known of cases where people were left waiting for these grants for quite a long time.  Many of the people who do these jobs are small contractors who have to seek credit from the suppliers and both contractors and suppliers are anxious to get their money.  There should be some examination of the procedure so that these people will not be left waiting unduly long.  The delay is an embarrassment to the person in receipt of the grant and it is also an embarrassment to the contractors, especially the smaller ones.</P>
    <P>These are some points to which I wish to draw the attention of the House and I will conclude by saying that I have always received the utmost help and courtesy from the Minister and the officials of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate but I have been induced to do so by some of the speeches made.  The road grants are being increased to all the county councils but there may be a case made in relation to the spending of those grants as to whether more should be spent on the county roads and less on the main roads.  I think that more should be spent on county roads.  I realise that with the traffic of today and with the number of cars, lorries and tractors, you must have heavy trunk roads to take them but a little more attention should be given to our county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a county engineer and staff second to none in our county and I would not like to hear them attacked in this House while they are not present to defend themselves.  They are doing a good job of allocating the money as best they can.  I would suggest that the Minister and his Department should carry out an investigation, in conjunction with the county engineer and his staff, especially in the western counties, into the condition of roads built originally on boggy lands which are sinking from year to year <Col N="308" /> and so becoming most uneven and bumpy for travelling.  Perhaps instead of widening the roads, they could allocate some of the money to making them more even and easier for traffic. That would be a good job of work.</P>
    <P>A Deputy from the Opposition benches made mention of dust-free roads.  Rome was not built in a day but it is the policy of our engineer and his staff to have all the roads under his jurisdiction dust-free within a couple of years.  If he can manage to do that, he will be doing good work.  Perhaps he might have had them free from dust by the end of this year, were it not for the fact that during the past few years he was engaged in taking over roads which were never under his jurisdiction before.  It is good to see so many roads being taken over year by year.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of housing grants.  I think we must all agree that housing grants have been increased by the present Government to the tune of approximately £300 for the fully serviced house.  I welcome that grant and regard it as a decent amount.  I know that there is a difference between that grant and the Gaeltacht grant, but probably a case can be made for that. I can recall the Coalition period of 1955, 1956 and 1957 when no supplementary grants were paid at all.  There was a complete shut-down and everybody realises the then Minister for Finance had given instructions to the effect that there was no money there.  I think any fair-minded Deputy who was a member of a local authority must admit that at least 60 per cent of all his correspondence at that time related to questions as to why local authorities were not paying their grants.  The local authorities get their grants from the Local Loans Fund and when they did not get the money, they could not pay it out.  They were not paid until the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, came back to power and gave them the green light to go ahead and pay the grants.  These grants were paid up to date without a hitch.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly on a matter which I am about to mention and which is really the reason I got up to speak.  The Minister and his chief <Col N="309" /> officials should call together all the county engineers, and especially those in rural Ireland, for a conference.  At present certain delay is taking place in regard to town planning, a great deal of which could be avoided.  For instance, in the case of islands off the coast, I think it ridiculous to ask any applicant building a new house to submit a plan and a site plan in order to comply with the regulations.  On the original form, an applicant for a grant had to state how far back his house was from the centre of the main road.  I think that is sufficient in any townland or village that is between two and nine miles off the main road or the county road, with nothing leading to them except the stopping road into the village or townland. In such cases, if the Minister and his officials brought the county engineers together and gave instructions, it would be sufficient for the applicant to apply to the local authority who would then get the local engineer to call on the applicant.  The engineer should be able to say: &ldquo;You can go ahead; you are not obstructing anybody. You are far enough from the main road and I am giving you permission to proceed.&rdquo;  That action should be taken immediately.</P>
    <P>Only a few days ago we had a discussion in our local authority along lines of this kind and the county manager fairly quickly told us it was a matter for the Minister to deal with. That is why I am now appealing to the Minister and asking him to organise such a conference as I have suggested. Some of these houses are being built where only an aeroplane overhead will ever see them unless you drive right up to them.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Governey, I feel that speed limit signs in certain cases are too far out from towns.  I do not fully agree with him that they should be taken to places nearer the towns and cities because I believe that what is done in one town should be done all over.  Passing through different towns, one sees in some cases the first speed limit sign says 40 m.p.h. and about a mile nearer the town, the limit is reduced to 30 m.p.h.  I think the limit should be broken down.  If the Department <Col N="310" /> want to have the limit so many miles outside towns and cities, they can break it down, especially where there are open roads, so as not to have it at 30 m.p.h. all the way.</P>
    <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to call a meeting of the county engineers and solve this problem of town planning in rural areas which, as I have indicated, involves a good deal of work and inconvenience which seem completely unnecessary.  I do not know if there has been the holdup in the payment of grants that some Deputies mentioned.  I go through my constituency perhaps more often than anybody else and so far I have not found anybody complaing of long delays or about that kind of holdup in grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Geoghegan has chosen to leave the House because I have a few points I should like him to admit or deny. This Estimate, to say the least of it, is disappointing.  Increased grants are required to meet the increased costs brought about by the rising cost of living and by the rising cost of labour which is part of the spiral created by Fianna Fáil.  It is an extremely disappointing Estimate.  It is very interesting to see that the Fianna Fáil Government cannot provide this much-needed money; they would almost go so far as to say they have not got it, but tomorrow morning if they wanted a jet plane costing millions, they would have it at the flick of a finger.  They have found £3 million to buy a shipping line to bring away our emigrants. Of course we have no money to give the people who may be inclined or encouraged to stay at home.  As far as I can see, the Government live for the image they create here and abroad. All they want is prestige with nothing behind it; they produce a smokescreen to hide the actual facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate holds out little hope for the 250 applicants I know in my city who are on the housing list of Galway Corporation.  Deputy Geoghegan is very complacent about the housing situation but I have been in touch with it since 1950 when I first went on our local body, and I challenge contradiction <Col N="311" /> by the Minister or Deputy Geoghegan when I say that in 1957 we put up a better front than the Government as regards housing our people in Galway.  I challenge them to say what they built in Galway City since 1957.  They built 64 houses.  Of course, they told us we were wasting the nation's money when we built 284 houses in the three previous years.  Is that not a proud record for Fianna Fáil and their Ministers?  Deputy Geoghegan seems to be very complacent about it.</P>
    <P>There is money for luxury hotels. That is all right.  In my view, that is a matter that should be left to private enterprise.  Coming from a major tourist centre, I can say that we can be proud of the efforts of private enterprise in Galway.  We are not looking for Intercontinentals.  There are more people coming to our towns than are coming to those places where there are Intercontinental Hotels.  The people who come to Galway come back again and they get a fair deal.  This matter should be left to private enterprise.  If the Fianna Fáil attitude is otherwise, then I say, God help the poor.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate there is little encouragement and little hope for the young couples who wish to have a stake in the country, who wish to build their own homes.  The Minister admitted here today that there is a credit squeeze.  There is a credit squeeze in respect of loans.  That in itself is a shattering blow to the young couples who hope to settle down here and build their own homes.</P>
    <P>The proposal of the Minister to increase house rents is a return to the rack rent.  People who have paid a reasonable rent, which included repayment of the loan, are now to have the rents increased by Ministerial order. Does the Minister think that that proposal will get a good reception down the country either from the people or their representatives?  In other words, the Minister wants people who have lived in their homes all their lives to pay through the nose for his failure to build in the past.  He wants to squeeze the money out of these <Col N="312" /> unfortunates.  Rack renting has failed in the past and I can assure the Minister that it will fail in the future.</P>
    <P>I am again disappointed that the Minister has not made a special grant available for the type of person who cannot pay even the minimum rent demanded for houses that have been built in recent years.  I know dozens of people who are unable to pay the minimum rent or even half the minimum rent demanded for houses on schemes that have been built in Galway in the past.  The only hope for these people is the county home.  The Minister should reconsider this matter having this section of the community in mind.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in respect of which special grants should be made available.  In a developing city like Galway, where the rates have reached the point where the people just cannot meet them, there is great need for drainage, sewerage and the opening up of virgin land so as to facilitate people wishing to build their own homes.  The Minister should take steps to develop such areas. Public representatives cannot allow the amount of money that would be required to be spent unless very special assistance is given.  The local authority has very heavy commitments, many of which have been handed to it by various Departments.  There is a definite case for assistance in this regard. It would help to provide cheaper building sites.  The Minister should take that into consideration because that in itself would alleviate many of the housing problems existing in Galway.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the clamping down on loans for young people. The heavy hand of those responsible for town planning is also felt.  I agree that a certain amount of town planning is necessary but it can go too far. Too far east is west.  In some cases there is no encouragement for young people to build their own homes.  If the State is to take over everything, then God help us.</P>
    <P>The Minister should review the question of town planning.  There are certain irritating features.  The idea <Col N="313" /> behind town planning is that buildings that do not look well should not be erected along a main road.  It is ridiculous that clauses should be invoked in relation to, say a house that is on the back of a mountain where a road will never be built.  Some of the engineers do not know where some of these places are.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a general election. The number of people whose names were struck off the voters' list is amazing.  There would be some excuse in the case of a man who had changed residence.  It is a strange thing that in my electoral area many names of my supporters disappeared from the list.  These were cases of men who had been voting for about 40 years and who never left their residences.  For no apparent reason, their names were struck off.  It is a matter that I am beginning to think requires further investigation.</P>
    <P>It was amazing to see the number of gangers and home assistance officers, who were very active all around that period, who got off for the day.  I know 15 of them were not paid.  I made that inquiry.  They were not out for me.  The set-up is such that we will have an investigation when the time comes.  These gentlemen had better watch the jobs they are being paid to do.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned the question of building.  I am disappointed by the inactivity of the National Building Agency in relation to Galway city. It should come in there and, where the local authority cannot make the necessary provision, do something for, say, young Gardaí and civil servants who need help in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to speed limits. We in Galway County Council recommended to the Minister some 12 months ago adjustments in the speed limits, especially on the Galway- Oranmore side of Galway city.  It is about time the Minister attended to these requests.  It is ridiculous the speed at which people are asked to go on a wide open road.  It is only asking people to break the law.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the Planning <Col N="314" /> Act.  The Minister has foisted the cost of this plan on our rates, which are high enough already.  Public men have to try to defend these rates.  I do not feel like defending some of the imposts which the Minister has foisted on us.  I have heard it said that my town is to be a model town. Is the Minister going to pay for that? We have model ratepayers and they should get first consideration.  If the Minister wants to call the tune, he should pay the piper.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said it is the duty of local authorities to house people out of unfit dwellings.  As I said, his record was not so good over the past few years as far as Galway city is concerned.  I should like to remind the Minister of the war cry in 1957: Let us get cracking.  As soon as they were in office, they forgot that.  If the Minister does not make up his leeway in regard to housing, the people will get cracking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan referred a moment ago to dust-free roads.  What we need most of all is muck-free roads. Our first duty should be to look after the interests of those in backward areas.  The condition of the roads along which some people are expected to live is a disgrace, and these people are expected to pay the rates like everybody else.  It is impossible for a priest, a doctor, a veterinary surgeon, a nurse or a hearse to travel on some of these roads.  It is scandalous the way people have to be carried over to the ambulance in the middle of the night where a cow would not travel.  These people are forgotten.  It is left to the Board of Works, and the problem is so big for them that they will never reach it. Some of the moneys should be diverted from our main roads and given for the improvement of conditions in remote areas.</P>
    <P>On the question of decentralisation, I cannot see why at least sections of some Departments should not be transferred to different parts of the country. There is hardly a Deputy who does not receive requests from parents who have daughters working, say, clerk- typists here in Dublin, to have them transferred home or nearer home.  It is very hard for young girls living in <Col N="315" /> Dublin to meet the high costs here and it would help a lot if they were able to live at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to relax the credit squeeze that has been put on people to prevent them building their own homes.  There was an outcry from Fianna Fáil in the past about a credit squeeze, but they are very silent tonight. I should like the Minister to do something to help especially the young people to build their own homes, give them something to live for in this country.  Let the Minister get cracking on that problem and meet their needs.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of talk in this debate about shortage of housing, and so on, but it must be realised that for the first time in 100 years, in 1964, the population of Ireland increased.  It means that the younger people of Ireland are staying at home now, that they see a future in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why so many people are building their own houses.  I must compliment the Minister on the grants that have been brought in in the past few years.  In my own constituency a great deal of private building is going on as a result of the grants that have been given.  People prefer to build their own house because they can have it built to their own specifications.  If they wait for a local authority, they must take whatever house is provided for them.  By the time the local authority dispose of all the details, the best part of two years has elapsed before the house is built; then each house and each plan is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see more encouragement given in respect of private building. One way of encouraging private building would be to increase the SDA loan to 95 per cent.  With the increased building costs, this would go a long way towards helping people to build their own houses.  It was commendable for the Minister to increase the grants for farmers.  It meant that anybody <Col N="316" /> who was considered eligible for a house in a local authority could get this increased grant of £400.  In most cases the county councils gave increased grants as well.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, the Department could help, I think, by making a greater variety of plans available.  The plans now available have been in existence for a number of years.  In the light of modern developments, more up-to-date plans should be produced. If architects devised fresh plans, people would be very ready to avail of them. Variety is the spice of life and more varied plans would, therefore, have a greater appeal.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in regard to housing is the acquisition of sites.  Kildare County Council must be complimented on their foresight in that regard. In Newbridge, Kildare and Monasterevan, sites are available for private building, sites with water and sewerage laid on and properly constructed roads.  However, people are experiencing difficulty in getting sites in other areas.  Farmers are reluctant to sell sites because there is some difficulty about sub-division.  I can find no solution to the problem but the Department may be able to find one.  I know one man who tried over a distance of ten miles to get a site for a house but he was turned down by every farmer he approached.  Perhaps the Land Commission could be prevailed upon to provide sites.  That was done some years ago but the practice seems to have been dropped.  A revival of that practice might be one method of helping people out.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is providing £380,000 more for water and sewerage. That bears out what I said at the outset, that there are more people with better incomes.  More people are availing of the grants and that connotes a better standard of living.  That is something we all welcome.  Public representatives are very well aware of the situation because they are being constantly asked for help when people are making applications or want some assistance.  It is a welcome trend and I believe it will continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Recently I came across a case in which a farmer was turned down for the increased grant because he lived in a village.  Half the people in this village are farmers and the only road to their farms is the actual village street.  This man knocked down his old house and built a new one.  Being under £25 valuation, he expected a grant of £450.  To his dismay, he got only £300, on the ground that he was not living in a rural area, that he was living in a town.  His case is on appeal. This man makes his living by farming just as 50 per cent of the other people in the village do.  What I fear is that this crux may arise in quite a number of villages.  People should be encouraged to avail of every facility they can when they are building their own houses and they should not be penalised because they happen to live in a village or a small town.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the regulations to see if he can do anything to bring these people within the ambit of the increased grants.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, most of the work has been done, though there are still some roads which need attention. I hope the Minister will be able to increase the grants for these.  Road improvement benefits not only the tourist but also our own people.  They are the biggest road users we have. Roads provide good employment during the summer months in repair and maintenance.</P>
    <P>A problem has arisen in County Meath in relation to a road along the bank of the Royal Canal.  There is some legal difficulty because of some provision in an Act passed when the canal was first constructed.  A stretch of road along the canal can be taken over if there are three houses on it. Trouble has arisen over this particular stretch I am interested in.  CIE cannot give permission to have this stretch taken over.  There may be other stretches in relation to which a similar position arises.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter to find if there is some solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister, according to his statement, intends to review the Town Planning Act.  There is a great deal of <Col N="318" /> work still to be done on this Act and a good deal still remains to be learned about it.  I have noticed an increase in the number of appeals against refusal of permission since the Act came into operation.  For some of them it is a question of getting to know the working of the Planning Act.</P>
    <P>To recap, I should like to see a greater variety of house plans made available.  I welcome the Minister's announcement of the facility to take out a 12 months' driving licence at any time.  We know the queues there are at the motor taxation offices in the first fortnight of January.  That innovation will save a good deal of time and trouble.  I should like to see the SDA loan limit increased and the more easy provision of sites for houses.</P>

      <P>One of the greatest false economies in the last two Fianna Fáil Governments was the abolition of the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  Local Government has become completely bogged down over the past seven or eight years through the lack of a Parliamentary Secretary. I am glad the Government have now rectified the position and appointed a Parliamentary Secretary.  I should like to pay tribute here to the Parliamentary Secretaries who served me when I was Minister for Local Government in the persons of the late Deputy Bill Davin and, later, Deputy Dan Spring.  I placed the detailed work of the Department as far as housing was concerned completely in their hands.  I was very pleased indeed by the manner in which they carried out their duties.  I have no doubt that the present Parliamentary Secretary will be of considerable assistance to the Minister and that we will be able to get out of this rut which Local Government has got into in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very much like old times tonight to hear Deputy Dowling talking about Dublin Corporation housing and all the hours they spend discussing this serious problem.  I heard that many times in this House from ex-Deputy Briscoe, ex-Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Larkin.  They talk and <Col N="319" /> talk in this Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation about what they are planning but very little is done. I was glad to hear Deputy Dowling say that in the days of the inter-Party Government, there was no demand for houses, that there were houses then with the shutters up and unoccupied. That is a different story from that which Fianna Fáil Deputies have been telling us&mdash;and Ministers, too&mdash;for the past number of years: that we did not build sufficient houses.</P>
    <P>Here Deputy Dowling, who was on the Housing Committee, tells us we had so many houses that we could not have them all occupied.  The simple reason was that the people were employed down the country.  As a result of the policy of Fianna Fáil, work ceased in rural Ireland.  These men moved across the water and their wives and families came to Dublin and occupied these houses.  There has been such an exodus from the country into the city that we have not got sufficient houses for them.  It is refreshing to hear the truth from Deputy Dowling at long last.  He speaks here from the Fianna Fáil benches as a member of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation when he tells us we had too many houses in the days of the inter-Party Government and not, as Fianna Fáil speakers have been telling us, that we stopped building houses and that that is what led to a shortage.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused to hear such praise given to this Ballymun project. In my last year as Minister in 1956/57, I had the privilege of being invited by the French Government to France to see what they had done for housing there.  I brought with me two officials from the Department.  When I came back, I suggested that the solution to the housing problem in Dublin was multi-storey flats.  I left that on record. I had the opportunity of visiting various housing projects throughout France and saw the advantages of these multi-storey flats.  I suggested them to Dublin Corporation but they would not hear tell of them at the time.  I was told that for many reasons Dublin city <Col N="320" /> did not lend itself to multi-storey flats. I remember saying that, if we had built multi-storey flats in the centre of the city instead of building houses out in places on the perimeter of the city such as Ballyfermot, this traffic congestion would have been avoided, people would have been able to live near their employment and there would be no necessity to transport them&mdash;at great cost to themselves&mdash;in and out of the city every day.</P>
    <P>Of course, my advice would not be accepted.  We went out of office.  The advice we tendered to Dublin Corporation was completely ignored.  It was only last year that the present Minister wakened up to the fact that multi-storey flats were one of the solutions to the housing problem.  I am only sorry that these flats are being built out on the perimeter of the city.  From that perimeter we must transport workers back into the city.</P>

      <P>And, what is more, at vast cost to the Corporation, because some solution must be found for this traffic congestion in the centre of the city.  If the derelict sites in the city centre had been utilised and built on over the past seven or eight years, there would be no necessity for this shortage of houses today and we would not have created this traffic congestion which now necessitates all these one- way streets.  It is rather late in the day the Minister and Dublin Corporation have wakened up to the solution of the problem.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I must complain about the delay in sanctioning housing projects by the Minister.  It is customary when you are speaking from the Government benches to refer to this delay and blame it on the Department and on the officials.  I do not think that is right.  The Minister must accept blame for any delays in the Custom House.  He is the person solely responsible.  I am certain no section of any Department is responsible for these delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to quote an example.  In my <Col N="321" /> own constituency one of the towns crying out for houses is the town of Killybegs. It is a progressive fishing port. Since post-war days, many young men are finding employment in the fishing industry, which has been expanded. These young men are anxious to marry and procure homes for themselves.  The local authority, Donegal County Council, have found considerable difficulty in procuring sites for houses for these young fishermen.  I suggested at a meeting of Donegal County Council some time ago that multi-storey flats should be built in Killybegs, but that was not acceptable to the majority of the members.  After considerable difficulty, searching and inspection, in September, 1963, sites were procured for houses in the town of Killybegs. A provisional agreement was entered into for the purchase of the sites, and the price was fixed, on 6th September, 1963.  The Minister was asked to sanction the purchase of those sites.  The purchase price was nominal, a sum of approximately £500, but those sites would have gone a long way towards relieving the demand for housing for the young fishermen in the locality.</P>
    <P>As I said, on 6th September, 1963, formal application was made for sanction, and five different letters were written to the Minister reminding him, requesting him, begging him, to sanction the purchase of the sites.  It was not until July, 1964, some ten months afterwards, that sanction was given. In the meantime what had happened? The price of the sites in the locality had gone up, and the vendors refused to sell.  Here we are held up again since July last with no sites available for purchase.  If the Minister had done his duty, he would have sanctioned the purchase within three, four, or five weeks.  Donegal County Council would have purchased the sites in Killybegs and we would have those houses built, and those fishermen housed today.  We are as far back now as we were in September, 1963 and have now to start all over again seeking sites or else seeking compulsory purchase orders. All that will take time, when it could have been done by the Minister giving sanction early on.</P>
    <P>No local authority blindly buys sites, <Col N="322" /> or enters into provisional agreements, without first having them examined by their experts: their health experts, their medical experts and their engineering staffs.  It is only when those examinations have been made and all the requirements of the various subsections and sections have been complied with, that a provisional agreement is entered into.  Only then is sanction sought from the Minister.  Surely it should not be necessary for the Department of Local Government again to go through all the inspections that have been gone through by the local authority.  That is one of the things about which we complain bitterly.  I sincerely hope that the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary will assist in speeding up sanction for the procurement of sites for house building by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the scheme known as the SI housing scheme throughout rural Ireland.  This is a scheme whereby local authorities are enabled to build specific instance houses for individuals in rural Ireland, serviced and unserviced cottages.  This is a simple matter. The individual procures a site, or takes the option on a site, and offers it to the local authority at a nominal figure.  In theory, the local authority sanction the site or otherwise.  If they sanction it, they build a house for the individual.  In practice what occurs?  It is exactly three years from the date on which the individual makes application for a specific instance house to be built before a stone is put upon a stone for that house.  Between passing the buck from the local authority to the Minister and back, three years expire before a stone is put upon a stone.</P>
    <P>Surely there is no necessity for duplication of inspection in the building of houses costing £1,400, £1,500 or £1,600.  I should like to know what is the expense to the local authority and to the Department of all these inspections. When we add on the fees of the engineer or the architect who finalises the plan for the house, I am certain that the amount is a very high percentage of the cost.  If the local authority are satisfied that the site is a suitable site, surely it should be no concern of <Col N="323" /> the Department to inspect it again.  I suggest to the Minister that he should fix a ceiling for the price, either serviced or unserviced, and leave it to the local authority to acquire it and get on with the job.  In that way we would get the houses built and make a success of the scheme which is lying in abeyance for a considerable time.  We in Donegal have a backlog of 600 or 700 houses and there is no hope of having them built unless there is a speeding up in the Department.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Crinion who paid tribute to the Minister for increasing grants to individuals who wished to build their own homes.  In 1948 the grant for a private house built by an individual was £275.  The generous increase to which Deputy Crinion referred is £25.  The maximum is now £300.  If you invest the sum of £1 by joining a utility society you get an extra £10 and you save £9 on the transaction.  I cannot understand the reason for that because it is purely a nominal matter of paying £1 to become a member of a utility society. However, the generous increase to which Deputy Crinion referred is an increase of £25 over the period from 1948 to 1965.  That is not a generous grant and it should be &ldquo;upped&rdquo; and the Minister should take steps to &ldquo;up&rdquo; it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan referred to the delay in paying grants.  I can say this without fear of contradiction.  No three weeks pass that I do not write to the Custom House to know what is the delay in paying a reconstruction grant or a new house grant to some individual. To be fair to the officials, when you address a letter to them in the Custom House, they promptly deal with it.  I have no hesitation in saying that no head of a section is to blame for the delays.  In the Custom House they are bogged down with work and all this checking and re-checking is the cause of the delays.  There should be no necessity for a Deputy to make representations for the payment of a reconstruction or a new house grant.</P>
    <P>There is also a system whereby portion of the grant is retained for a <Col N="324" /> period of six, eight or ten months after the applicant has gone into occupation of the house.  The Minister is aware that the applicant cannot apply for a supplementary housing grant until he has received the final instalment of the Local Government grant.  Therefore he is held up and debarred from receiving the supplementary grant until he has been in occupation of the house for six or eight months.  That man usually procures the raw materials for building the house on credit.  A shopkeeper supplies him with the raw materials on credit, or he has the alternative of borrowing the money for the raw materials from the bank.  If he has to pay interest to the bank that can be a fair sum, and if the shopkeeper gives him credit, the shopkeeper loses more on the credit transaction than his profit on the raw materials.  That is something the Minister should look into very carefully.</P>
    <P>Town planning causes delays also in the building of houses.  I believe a colossus is being created under the Town Planning Act which will strangle the whole building industry.  A person who wishes to build a house now has to put a notice in the paper: &ldquo; Ba mhaith liomsa, Padraig Ó Domhnaill, teach úr a thogáil.&rdquo;  Very few people read these notices and those who do read them do not know what they are about.  He must then wait for four weeks.  He then writes in and sends three copies of the plan of the house, plus the site plan.  The ordinary individual cannot draw up these plans so an architect must be employed.  He must then wait until the plan has been sanctioned by the local authority. The local authority have not got officials to send out to examine each individual plan and each site so it takes a considerable time, with the result that on a general average, it is two or three months from the time he inserts the advertisement until he receives sanction and approval of the plan.  That delay is far too long.  One must budget for the weather and for the season of the year and a delay such as that in the building of a private house is far too great.  That is a separate section from the building section.  The planning authority holds <Col N="325" /> up the commencement of building in addition to all the other delays to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>On the question of planning, one of the things I object to&mdash;and I have already said it in this House&mdash;is the hidden taxation contained in the regulations under the Town Planning Act. There is the regulation under which, if one has a petrol pump, one has to pay £6, £7 or £8 a year.  The Minister said in the course of the election campaign that he was going to reduce this annual licence to one-half in rural Ireland.  I do not recollect seeing any regulation under which it is reduced, but I believe the Minister has already made such an Order and I welcome it. As a result of criticism we have made in this House, that serious imposition has been halved.</P>
    <P>I referred to pumps, fencing, water tanks and signs on hotels.  I know in the town of Letterkenny in the past fortnight in the case of people who had a sign outside their door, be it to advertise Bovril, good steaks or good drinks, a licence fee was demanded from them.  That is a form of indirect taxation which is bad.  It should be done by way of provision in an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have another look at this matter of roads and see whether it would be more economic and beneficial to have our roads reconstructed or made by independent contractors.  In the Six Counties and in Britain, where they have considerable experience in this field, they find it much more economic and more efficient to employ independent contractors to repair, reconstruct and realign roads.  That is something which should be looked into.  There should be a greater allocation for the improvement of our county roads.  We still have far too many miles of dust roads in the country and a greater effort should be made to reduce the mileage of these roads and increase the mileage of our dust-free roads each year.</P>
    <P>On the question of road safety, we have heard much from the Minister and from a number of other speakers about this question of the danger to pedestrians in built up areas.  I wonder <Col N="326" /> has the Minister considered building overhead pedestrain crossings.  It might be a solution.  It is one which the Minister should have a look at.  It would speed up traffic in the centre of the city and would be a protection for pedestrians.  There would be no traffic jams, no delay for pedestrians and it might be a cheap method of relieving congestion in the city.  I do not think we would require a lot of them but it is something which should be looked into.  It might justify its examination.</P>
    <P>Enough has been said about the erection of road sings and the unsuitability of the siting of some of these signs.  I do not want to reiterate all that has been said on this matter and I think the Minister will sympathetically bear with most of the Deputies who have spoken on it.  Most of them have spoken from local knowledge and have cited various instances in their constituencies of very bad siting of these signs.</P>
    <P>With a flourish of trumpets a few years ago, we introduced the Coast Protection Act.  We thought a considerable amount of good would be done in various parts of the country but, so far as I know, with the exception of Wexford, no coast erosion scheme which has been submitted to the Minister has been put into operation. In my county I know a number of schemes have been submitted and it was only the other day, after a period of six or eight months, we received the green light to prepare another scheme on a particular project and resubmit it to the Department for examination. If we are to settle this problem of coast erosion properly, the only thing to do is to give a sum to the local authority and say: &ldquo;Look, here is your money; that is the amount we consider would be necessary to do the particular job; get on with the job.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I misinterpreted what the Chair said, but I fully agree with what I thought the Chair said.  One of the responsibilities of local authorities is the provision of courthouses and this is a responsibility which has been sadly neglected.  I do not blame the local authorities because the grants made available are insufficient to encourage local authorities to tackle the serious problem of putting the courthouses in order.  I speak from experience.  Judges are only human beings, and if a judge becomes irritated and annoyed, one cannot expect the same dispensing of justice that one can expect in normal circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that our judges are sitting and endeavouring to administer justice in courthouses which would not be tolerated in any other country.  The other day I was in the town of Drogheda and there was a discussion as to whether the courthouse there should be reconstructed or a new one built, but the judge, I understand, has refused to sit in the present building.  The same happens in my own county in Letterkenny. We had difficulty in procuring a reasonable sitting of the court on account of the condition of the courthouse. A courthouse is for the benefit of the country.  Judges do not sit for the benefit of lawyers, solicitors or barristers; they sit to administer justice to Seán Citizen, to everyone, and it is essential that these men be given an opportunity to do so in comfort, not alone for themselves but for the public who have to use these courthouses. I should be glad if the Minister would ensure that local authorities are <Col N="328" /> adequately compensated for any expenditure incurred by them in this connection.</P>

      <P>Quite possibly, it may be more a matter for the Minister for Finance, but, in dealing with the Department of Local Government, we are dealing also with the activities of local authorities.  In those circumstances, what I have said would be relevant to the Estimate.</P>
      <P>Again we have heard in this House many things about the rates and their increasing burden.  I know it is not the duty of the Minister to deal with the principal cause of the increase in the rates, namely, the health charges.  The Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Health and with the Government, generally, must tackle this question of the rates.  The sooner they do this the better.</P>
      <P>I shall refrain from discussing the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act because it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government to enforce it.  The Minister told us some time ago that he proposes to introduce amending legislation and I should like him to examine carefully section 49 of the Act which deals with drunken driving.  As the law stands at the moment, it is farcical that a young garda, just out of the Depot and who, prior to his entry into the Gardaí was just out of secondary school, can go into the court and tell the Justice that in his opinion a man was incapable of exercising due control over his motor car due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter I should like to refer to&mdash; derelict sites.  We all agree that derelict sites are an eyesore in towns and villages throughout the country.  Did we ever examine the question of the ownership of these derelict sites? Ownership of most of the derelict sites throughout the country is vested either in the local authorities or in the Office of Public Works.  I refer particularly to old coastguard stations and barracks burned down during the troubled times. No effort whatever has been made by the local authorities to exercise the powers conferred on them under the Derelict Sites Act.  Until they do that and insist on the letter of the law being literally carried out these derelict sites will remain.  Much more attention should be paid to the demolition of these derelict sites.</P>
      <P>We often hear complaints from tourists about the height of our hedges and no effort is made to cut them down and give the tourists an opportunity of seeing our countryside.  Let me give an example of how absurd and Irish we are.  CIE have provided tourist buses to bring American and other visitors on sighteeing tours.  Instead of getting the Department of Local Government to have the hedges cut down, CIE have bought higher buses with higher floors to enable the tourists to see over the hedges.  The whole thing is ridiculous, stupid and absurd and I would urgently ask the Minister to appeal to local authorities to exercise the powers conferred on them under the Act I have referred to and have all the hedges cut down.  During the winter months when there is not much farm work to be done, cutting down those hedges would provide a reasonable amount of employment for the farm labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I wish to refer to is the Local Authorities (Works) Act introduced in 1948.  This is an Act under which minor drainage schemes <Col N="330" /> could be carried out by local authorities. The Board of Works had nothing to do with this.  It was the local authorities who promoted the scheme and a global figure was fixed by the Minister for Finance for these local authorities.  That Act gave a considerable amount of employment and did a considerable amount of good because it enabled farmers to take advantage of the land reclamation scheme for the drainage of their land.  It enabled small and large arterial drainage schemes to be carried out.  It did a considerable amount of good.  The Act is still on the Statute Book.  It is still an Act of the Oireachtas.  It has never been repealed and all that is required is to vote moneys from the Department of Local Government to local authorities to enable them to continue the good work which was begun by the first inter-Party Government in 1948 and carried on under the second one to 1957.</P>
    <P>This Act was acclaimed by Fianna Fáil while in Opposition.  The principal complaint made by them then was that the Government of the day did not allocate or vote sufficient money for this work.  During the course of the by-election in Roscommon I visited some small towns where small rivers could have been drained, ought to have been drained and should have been drained under the Local Authorities (Works) Act had the moneys been made available.  I know that Deputy Gibbons, the new Parliamentary Secretary, will be very hard-working and I hope he will impress on the Minister the absolute and urgent necessity for the allocation of money under this Act to enable the good work, which was suspended in 1957, to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise I shall not delay the House very long.  I always like the opportunity of speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and especially this year because it contains many new provisions.  Before I get down to it, I want to express my satisfaction with the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  It is nice to know that <Col N="331" /> the activities of the Minister's office have so increased as to warrant this appointment.  This will not slow matters up because the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to ensure that the business of the Department is done expeditiously.</P>
      <P>This increase in the activities of the Department of Local Government is largely attributable to the healthy state of our economy.  That is not being contested, indeed, on any side and, of course, one is immediately aware of the interest of all sections of the House and of all sections of the country to be up and doing and to get things going.  It falls heavily on the shoulders of the Minister for Local Government to ensure that plans are made and put into operation and that our heritage from the past will not be an impeding factor in the future.  If he does not do the job well and ensure that these impediments are not again built into our infra-structure, we shall again pay the price.</P>
      <P>There was criticism here this evening of the Town and Regional Planning Act.  It is natural that, in some cases, people would find it annoying and a nuisance but it would be most difficult for any Minister to exclude any section of the country.  Indeed, were he to consider it, I think it would take him a long time before he could come to a decision as to what to exclude. Therefore, whether or not we like it, for the future we must put up with these regulations as they apply to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy P. O'Donnell, one would think he would have some regard for the years when he was Minister for Local Government.  He is a solicitor by profession and was Minister for many years.  Those of us who can recollect his years in office must wonder now how he can come in here and naively suggest that regulations can be run through when he himself made regulations to cover up a scarcity in the economy, which was the reason the Coalition Government went out of office in 1957.  It was surprising to hear him naively suggest that this <Col N="332" /> or that should be done.  I well recall, during his period of ministry, despite the best advice that could be given to him, that he himself either could not make up his mind on what he wanted to do or could not give a lead to his officers but, whatever the reason, to my mind his years in office were ineffective and indeed brought a lot of stagnation, if not a full halt to any plans that might be envisaged in the Department.  I am fully satisfied in my mind that it took quite some years after the change of Government to get a new frame of mind into the Department of Local Government and I am now satisfied that our present Minister has indeed brought into that office a new sense of enthusiasm, planning and progress, as is evidenced in every field. Long may it continue.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made of the Ballymun scheme.  I heard a Deputy say that having paid a visit to France, he returned and suggested that Dublin Corporation ought to build multi-storey flats.  In the course of the past 3½ years during which I have been a member of this House, I heard from none other than the former Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dillon, that the situation should be a nice centre of semi-detached homes with adequate land around them rather than these rabbit hutches of multi-storey flats.  It is nice to see that such critics, too, can change with the times and that they will change to meet present-day needs.</P>
    <P>The planning and action taken to alleviate the housing problem in Dublin and the forthright action taken by the Minister in acquiring that site, and in having it planned quickly and in engaging a contractor to put the scheme into operation are all indicative of the type of planning and action we can expect in the future.  It is a very large scheme of over 3,000 houses and flats, costing about £10 million.  In other countries, this may not appear to be a lot of money but by Irish standards it represents a fairly hefty undertaking.  The Minister must be complimented on his initiative in going into that undertaking with confidence and enthusiasm and in bringing it to reality so quickly.  I hope nothing will slow up its ultimate completion. <Col N="333" /> Deputy Coogan, criticising, as is his wont, suggested that there is a credit squeeze in relation to housing loans.  I have not found in Ireland or in Dublin that there is a credit squeeze on loans.  As was pointed out at Question Time to-day, there is a delay with the building societies owing to the enormous number of applications they are receiving.  First of all, this is indicative of the conditions of the day we live in.  It is indicative that we live in a buoyant economy, when people are changing houses and building new houses.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age of a rising standard of living which is bringing with it an improvement in design, lay-out and planning.  The new homes going up all over the country are of a much better standard and design than heretofore.  It follows, therefore, that there must be a demand for considerably increased sums of money by way of loans and that results in increased demands for money.  It is a delightful thing to note that, during the past few years, our building societies have been lending money invested with them by Irish savers and that such Irish investments have helped our housing programme.  This is a far cry from 1956 and 1957 when the then Government could not find the money from the Central Fund and the building societies had not the money to lend. It is a welcome change from the economy we had then to the economy we have to-day.</P>
    <P>It is true that our increased standard of housing has called for an increased amount of loan.  The Minister might well re-examine the standard of loan and the standard of applicants' income today and see if he can activate the issue of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to a larger degree than at present.  I think the improved standard in building has been brought about by the easy borrowing of money from the building societies.  The level of valuation and income for loans under the SDA has been a limiting factor in the houses financed under the Acts which also brings a limiting factor in the planning and design of homes.</P>
    <P>The result of the re-appraisal of the <Col N="334" /> whole housing situation in the country is known to the Minister.  I would ask him to see if some alteration cannot be brought about in respect of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I know he has in mind system building and more economical methods of building. I know that the building trade as a whole are examining these matters with interest and hope but, despite that, I would ask the Minister to bear my remarks in mind.</P>
    <P>Once again it was pathetic to hear Deputy O'Donnell say that the increased demand for homes in Dublin has been caused by the influx of rural people into Dublin.  I shall never apologise in this House for the influx of people from rural Ireland into Dublin.  If this is the type of social activity being created by the new type of economy we enjoy, it is one that deserves credit rather than discredit.  It should not be made an excuse to decry us.  I am glad it is coming from the other side rather than from ours.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of the great industrial activity going on around Dublin, of the increased job opportunities, and if these are causing a strain on our housing accommodation in Dublin, it may very well be a good thing.  It is one of the reasons the Minister is taking this extra interest in the situation in Dublin and is responsible for this excellent contribution in Ballymun.  The Minister has told us of the plans he has for the alleviation of this position as soon as may be.  It cannot be done as early or as quickly as we should like.</P>
    <P>A large factor in this situation is that the building trade in Ireland was never so busy.  There is a shortage of craftsmen of every category.  No matter how many schemes the Minister may permit out to tender, we cannot build the houses unless we have the contractors and the staffs.  I am tempted to suggest that it might be wiser if we were to ease up a little at the moment so that we could expect to get competitive tenders which would not be the position if there was a glut of business on the market.  Such a glut would have only one result, to shove up prices in the industry and create inflation.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's primary concerns <Col N="335" /> is to ensure that building costs do not rise abnormally as would happen if there was a glut of work.  We must ensure that we maintain our house building programmes at good competitive prices so that the people who eventually go into those houses will find themselves paying reasonable rents rather than inflated rents brought about by an abnormal glut of work throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a further recommendation to the effect that there is a case for local authorities to re-examine the rents set and fixed many years ago, particularly before 1950.  Those who would criticise such a recommendation have little regard for young couples going into new homes.  We all know there are people living in houses at rents of 5/- set years ago.  Those who criticise the Minister's recommendation in this respect do not seem to have any regard to the plight of young people living and working in the city who now have to find rents of 55/- or £3 a week. If we are to have a fair society, there is a case for every local authority to examine the rent position with realism rather than have the situation maintained where many people enjoy the conditions they were lucky to get into 40 years ago at the expense of others who must pay very high rents.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of delays in payments of housing grants.  Let me say on behalf of the people in Sligo and Leitrim that any time I wrote to the Department about delays, I found they were caused either because the applicant had not complied with the regulations or alternatively because difficulties were found in other directions. Where the inspector had given a clear certificate, there were no difficulties, good, bad or indifferent.  Deputy Coogan criticised the inactivity of the National Building Agency.  All I can say is I wish Deputy Coogan had taken the trouble to find out why the agency was created and the functions it fulfils.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to hold up the House any longer after I have dealt with one or two other points.  Our <Col N="336" /> arterial water supply schemes deserve praise and all I want to say on the question is by way of urging the Minister to expedite these schemes so that every rural house will have a piped water supply as quickly as possible. The legislation providing for such water supplies was the best received I have come across.  It is even more popular than rural electrification.  It was initiated by the Minister.  I know the cost of providing such water supplies will be heavy but the cost of every worthwhile measure was always heavy and will always be heavy but permanent supplies of good, clear drinking water to every home are invaluable.</P>
    <P>It is appreciated that the completion of all these water supplies will take some time.  I know that local authorities are being impeded to some degree by lack of engineers but these are the times we live in.  These are times of get-up-and-go.  One of the reasons for delays, as I have mentioned, is lack of trained skilled engineers to carry out the preliminary work.  It is the position in which we find ourselves in this 18th Dáil.  I am satisfied that progress will be continued by this Government, by this Department, during their next five years of office.</P>
    <P>One other matter I should like to refer to relates to roads.  The scheme for the building and maintenance of arterial roads is criticised from time to time.  The scheme was introduced in order to develop a new road infra-structure to meet the demands of modern motoring and above all, to provide us with a system of roads to meet modern trends.  However, to concentrate on our main roads to the exclusion of all others would be a retrograde step.  Progress made on the construction of dust-free roads is satisfactory but greater progress must be made as quickly as possible.  I realise that everything cannot be done at once. It will be appreciated that progress in road making has been remarkable but it has taken 40 years to achieve it. We can expect similar progress in the course of the coming 40 years so that there will not be even a dusty lane in the country by then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> There has been great criticism of tardiness in completing work on <i>cul- de-sac</i> roads in certain areas.  The condition of such roads is being aggravated by the use of tractors and cars on them.  They were never designed for cars or tractors, and at the moment they are being merely maintained until such time as the local authorities can <Col N="338" /> convert them into dust-free, blacktopped roads.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29th April, 1965.</P>
