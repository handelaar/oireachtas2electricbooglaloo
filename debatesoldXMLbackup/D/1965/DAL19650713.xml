      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Question Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is public concern in this matter.  I have frequent consultations with the boards of all the State-sponsored companies under my control and I am satisfied that the moneys allocated for promotional purposes are being spent by them to the best advantage.  All these bodies are conscious of the need for maximum economy consistent with the proper fulfilment of their statutory functions.</P>
      <P>The chief promotional body is Bord Fáilte whose powers derive from section 5 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952 and section 6 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1955.  Details of the amounts involved in the various payments made by the Board are not available in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are once again going into the question of the possibility of utilising the coal in the Leinster coalfield for electricity generating purposes.  The prospects do not appear very satisfactory, but in any event it takes five years to construct a power station from the time the decision is made to build it and so it could not affect the problem of doing the best we can to provide an outlet for the anthracite deposits in the Leinster coalfield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the immediate prospects that concern us; even the prospect of utilisation in five years' time would be welcome.  One must look ahead.  I know we cannot build a power station overnight, but even if it is not to happen for five years, the Minister should now be asking the ESB to plan for this power station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>An investigation is already under way into the possibility of using anthracite duff as a basis for smokeless fuel.  The investigation is still proceeding.  I might mention that, while a final result will not be available for some time, the indications are that it is unlikely that such a venture would be a profitable undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what reports the Deputy has in mind.  As I <Col N="1007" /> have already announced, arrangements have been made which should have the effect of reducing anthracite imports during the next 12 months.  In the meantime, a thorough survey of the trends and prospects regarding Irish anthracite is being commissioned by my Department with a view to ascertaining future marketing trends and safeguarding as far as possible the future of Irish coal mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unfortunate position that this is a question that concerns two Ministers.  I addressed this question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He knows the reports that I asked for because, in replying to the debate on his Estimate, he said that there were other problems on which he was not yet in a position to speak as he was awaiting some reports.  It was to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I addressed the question and I am awaiting information from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have been collaborating on this matter in so far as it concerns our two Departments. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has, as his own particular problem, the question of the Castlecomer collieries.  I have obtained the services of a firm of consultants and they have been appointed to examine the whole question of the marketing and sale of Irish anthracite, and of that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is aware.  The decision to do that was made only recently and some time must elapse before there is any result. We had to obtain the consent and permission of the Irish coal merchants and also of the Irish anthracite producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to go ahead with the marketing examination is one in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I concur and we are proceeding with the thorough examination of this most complicated problem, which involves the substitution of anthracite for other forms of heat.  We are seeing what we can do to preserve the anthracite industry in the best way <Col N="1008" /> possible.  In the meantime, we have asked for a voluntary reduction in the imports of English anthracite which should help the sale of Irish anthracite to a great extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his long reply but, as I have said, I addressed the question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He stated in his reply that he was waiting for some reports and that in the meantime he was not in a position to make a statement.  We are now about to go into a long recess for three or four months and I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has got the report or reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the very serious shortage of turf briquettes; if this position is likely to improve; and what steps, if any, are being taken to improve the availability of briquettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that in recent years the supply of turf briquettes has not met the demand even though there has been some increase in supply to the home market.</P>
      <P>Any further increase in supplies would require more manufacturing capacity and a further briquette factory is included in the Board's expansion plans.  It will, however, be at least 1968 before this factory could be brought into production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would not wish to express a view on the possibility of a devaluation of sterling, I can say that, in such <Col N="1009" /> an event, it would be necessary, having regard to the economic circumstances of this country, to continue to maintain the existing statutory position under which the Irish pound has a parity relationship with sterling.  The bulk of our trade and commerce, which is with Britain, would thus be unaffected and the competitiveness of our exports to non-devaluing countries would be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if it would be possible to take any steps which would either offset or minimise the economic effects on this country in advance of a possible decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The families accommodated by the Dublin Health Authority in Griffith Barracks are considered for re-housing on the basis of <Col N="1017" /> the general housing priorities at present observed by Dublin Corporation as and when vacancies occur.  I understand that on this basis 22 such families have been re-housed in the period since it was first used for the purpose.  The priorities have been decided by Dublin Corporation and are not matters in which I can interfere.  As I indicated in a reply on this subject last week, the expanded rate of completions in the corporation's schemes, and the progress being achieved on the Ballymun project should ensure an early and material improvement in the general housing position in the city.</P>

      <P>The claim for old age pension in this case was originally refused by the local old age pension committee on the grounds that the claimant's means exceeded the statutory limit for pension.  A letter from the claimant's solicitor was treated as an appeal which, following inquiries was decided by an appeals officer on 26th June.  He <Col N="1026" /> granted full pension as from the date of claim, and all pension due to date has been paid.</P>
      <P>The claimant's solicitor was informed on 12th May that a decision on the appeal was deferred pending the result of certain inquiries and that he would be duly notified of the result.  There was nothing further that could use fully be added in reply to the letters to which the Deputy refers, which were acknowledged, and they were associated with the appeal file.  A reply regarding the decision on the appeal was issued to the solicitor on 6th instant.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the question does not arise.</P>

These applications have been very carefully examined in my Department in consultation with other Departments concerned and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In the case of the applications from three of these professional bodies, Orders have been made granting &ldquo;excepted body&rdquo; status.  The other applications are still under consideration.</P>

      <P>The volume of business at Shannon Airport Post Office in 1964-65 was: (a) stamp sales, £57,000 (b) telegrams, £3,700 (c) other services, £97,000 (excluding telephone account payments).</P>
      <P>The office is open for 24 hours a day and staff charges etc. are therefore higher than usual.  Economies can be achieved only by reducing the facilities available to airline passengers and other users of the office.  The considerations involved in any such step are under examination in consultation with the Department of Transport and Power who repay to my Department the exceptional additional operating costs.  For 1964-65 these costs are calculated at £16,641. 11s. 6d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Standing Order 30 of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business be amended by the deletion of &ldquo;4 o'clock p.m.&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;11 o'clock a.m.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment to Standing Order 30 proposed in this motion was recommended to the Dáil by the Commitee on Procedure and Privileges in the Report circulated last week.</P>
      <P>The Standing Order provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions must be in writing, and must reach the clerk not later than <Col N="1064" /> 4 o'clock p.m. on the third day preceding that on which they are to be asked, not reckoning a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday.</P>
    <P>The application of the five-day week to Government Departments has had the effect of reducing the time available for preparing replies to questions. For example, questions may now be handed in at Leinster House shortly before 4 p.m. on a Friday for answer on the following Wednesday but as Saturday is no longer a working day in Government Departments, work on preparing the replies may not start until Monday.  Clearly in these circumstances the time is too short to enable Departments to prepare replies. The proposal is that the period be extended by requiring that questions be handed in by 11 a.m. on the day prescribed instead of 4 p.m.  I recommend it to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 28 so as to enable the Minister for Justice to order an extradition case to be heard outside Dublin.  The section as it stood was unduly restricting in that an extradition case could only be held outside Dublin in the event of the ill health of the person apprehended.  It would be better to enable the Minister for Justice to order the extradition case to be heard wherever it is stated <Col N="1065" /> on the order in any particular case.

      <P>These amendments were suggested to the Seanad in order to emphasise that only a warrant that was issued by a judicial authority in Britain or Northern Ireland, will be enforced here.  I agree with the suggestion that as the Bill stood judicial authority was not spelt out.  A situation could arise where warrants could be issued by other than judicial authorities.  I suggest that it should be made plain on the fact of the warrant that it was issued by a judicial authority.  I agree with the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment of section 47.  It is on the same lines as another amendment to which I agreed in the Dáil on the suggestion of Deputy Dillon&mdash;that we should not deem a person in the custody of a foreign police force to be in lawful custody.  Deputy Dillon suggested it in respect of persons in the course of transit through this State. In this context it refers to the police force to whom a prisoner would be handed over.  We should not deem such custody to be lawful custody in our jurisdiction.  This amendment is consequential on the amendment suggested by Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment to section 48 which I tabled on Committee Stage, arising out of a suggestion made on the Second Stage reading, in the Seanad.  The point was made that the person on being brought before the District Court should be informed of his or her rights under the Act and under the Constitution to go by way of statutory application for a declaration that the offence is an exempted offence, or to apply under the <i>habeas corpus</i> provision in the Constitution. This section as amended now spells out that the district justice before whom an apprehended person is brought must inform the person as to his or her rights both statutory and constitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in the first instance, he has his legal rights.  He may have recourse to the High Court in the event of the district justice not informing him of his rights.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is very little of practical use that could be done if the person is outside the jurisdiction.  There is very little we <Col N="1067" /> could do to protect a person's right if he is out of the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position of a person who under our jurisdiction is entitled to the protection of our laws and finds himself illegally extradited? We all know that at present the police cannot go and take a man by the scruff of the neck and pitch him across the Border&mdash;or they ought not &mdash;or into a boat and transfer him outside our jurisdiction.  They must come before our courts and establish that they are acting under warrant and satisfy the court that the process of extradition conforms to our law.  It is only when all these things have been done that our police may lawfully surrender to the custody of an alien Government any person within our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Now we have provided that our police cannot lawfully do this unless the person concerned was brought before a district justice and his extradition order having been made, he is warned formally &ldquo;and you are now entitled to remain here for 15 days&rdquo; and secondly, &ldquo;I direct your attention to your constitutional rights under article 44 (2) of the Constitution&rdquo;.  Suppose the police&mdash;the district justice having omitted to discharge this statutory duty&mdash;removed the man from the custody of the courts to the custody of an alien Government, what is the position?  Has the man a right of action against our Government for improper extradition?  He must have a right of action against somebody. Mark you, the introduction of this statutory warning very seriously complicates the processes of extradition because it does appear that unless this statutory requirement is carried out the courts cannot surrender the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is overstating the case.  The actual words making it incumbent on the district justice to make the person aware of his position were inserted by me at the request of Senators and are in ease of the apprehended person. Any rights that person may have, are matters which he can pursue in the <Col N="1068" /> courts.  The fact that he was illegally ordered to be extradited would be a very sound reason, in my view, for his release.  It is in the section by implication as it stands that the district justice should inform him of his rights. We have to take it on faith that the courts will observe the legal processes properly and the person would secure his release if these were not observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has done this fully in ease of the person, but suppose a person is apprehended on foot of a British warrant and is brought before a district justice, an order is made and these statutory requirements are not complied with and the person to be extradited &ldquo;sings dumb&rdquo; until the proceedings in the district court have ended, what is going to happen then?  Can he go to the High Court to have the extradition order negatived on the grounds that the statutory requirements of making a valid order have not been carried out?  Also, if he should successfully do so is he not thereafter completely protected from extradition in respect of that particular offence or warrant?  Mark you, some district justices do remarkable things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not demur from that suggestion.  In answer to the Deputy's point, first of all, the person has his basic <i>habeas corpus</i> rights so that he or she may go to the High Court.  There is also a statutory right under section 50, arising out of any order the district court may make. That largely meets the point the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the order is bad in regard to the statutory conditions and the man &ldquo;sings dumb&rdquo; and on the following day applies to the High Court to have the extradition order quashed on the grounds that the statutory requirements have not been carried out in that this warning was not given, is that man not entitled to have that order quashed and is he not immune thereafter from extradition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speculating now on hypothetical circumstances. I would envisage that if such a matter <Col N="1069" /> arose, as the Deputy suggests, that the High Court would then declare the particular proceedings to have been invalid and would refer the matter back to the district court for compliance with the statutory requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £29,500 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that it has been agreed that both this Estimate and the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1965 should be discussed together.  The arrangement for the joint discussion on the Bill and on the Estimate is a sensible one because, although the Prices Bill is only one of the measures envisaged by the Government to rectify the present adverse economic trends, it would be desirable, in support of the Government's decision to present it to the Dáil, to give the general review on the state of the national economy which it has become the normal practice to give on the Taoiseach's Estimate and which, of course, on this occasion must be concerned with the situation which is now developing and the measures the Government have taken or propose to adopt in regard to it.  The Bill is the only one of the measures contemplated by the Government at this time which require legislative action.  It had necessarily to be introduced to the Dáil in advance of the general review of policy statement which I propose to make this afternoon and may, for this reason, have received more attention than it might otherwise have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> The price situation is, in the Government's view, a symptom of our economic difficulties and not the cause of them.  The economic difficulties which the country now faces are due to a combination of circumstances, some internal and some arising out of the prevailing international situation. There is not very much we can do about the external circumstances but we can expect to influence internal developments.  It is important that we should all look at the facts of the situation calmly and objectively, not to apportion blame or criticism or to engage in useless bemoaning or futile hand-wringing exercises but to promote understanding of it and of its implications for the future of the country, to encourage clear decisions about it and the acceptance of the steps for which it calls by all the organised elements of our community who can, by their attitudes and policies, contribute to its rectification.</P>
    <P>In the examination or discussion of our situation, it is as important to avoid exaggerating the difficulties and dangers which are now presenting themselves as it is not to minimise them.  It would be wrong to describe this situation as a recession or a crisis or in any similar terms with a panic connotation.  There has been no cessation of the nation's economic progress, much less a slipping backward. National production is still rising although the present rate of growth is less than it was in 1964, is less than was envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and is less than is necessary to maintain our present living standards.  The need is to take action to prevent it from slowing down any further and to avoid action which could have the opposite effect.  This is what I propose to deal with, together with the measures that might then be taken to help the national rate of economic development to start speeding up again.</P>
    <P>It is to be assumed that everybody will agree that timely action should be taken to check the undesirable economic trends which are now appearing and to get national progress resumed at the programmed rate and will understand the need and justification <Col N="1073" /> for special measures now to ensure that there will not be a serious recession either later in this year or ever.  I would regard it as a crisis if total national production and total employment started to decline again. It is conceivable that this deterioration in our national circumstances could take place if we failed now to adopt effective measures to prevent it and, if it should happen, the process of recovery on this occasion would be slower and less certain than it was before.</P>
    <P>It is in accord with the general philosophy of the Government that we should, even in this situation, endeavour to rely in the main on the voluntary co-operation of all the elements of the national community in putting it right and only to a minimum degree to resort to restrictive measures devised and applied by the Government.  There is nothing in the situation as yet which need force us to think in terms of departing from the normal democratic methods of organising and regulating national progress, the methods upon which we have relied heretofore and which, by and large, have worked well enough.</P>
    <P>Nobody ever seriously challenges the desirability or the effectiveness of these methods of fulfilling national aims and Government policy when things are going well.  The real test of these methods and of individual and sectional loyalty to them comes when things are not going so well and when restraints are called for.  I do not believe it is possible for the Government alone to succeed in what has now to be done without a great deal of wholehearted and unreserved co-operation from all sections.  It would certainly be impossible if any important organised element of the community should decide, for selfish sectional reasons, to act contrary to national needs or try to defeat the effectiveness of the measures which the Government consider to be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is our intention, however, to remain in control of the position.  It would be a serious dereliction of our duty as a Government if we failed for any reason, to do what is required. It is our intention, moreover, that the <Col N="1074" /> measures upon which we may decide either now, for immediate application, or later, will be the minimum for which the situation calls at any particular time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, we have decided to rectify the adverse economic trends which are developing, and which I shall endeavour to describe and explain in due course, on the basis of doing only the minimum we think is necessary, recognising <Col N="1075" /> that this involves a risk that we may not do enough, that we have underestimated the forces at work or the international complications that may arise for us and leave us in a position that later on we may have to decide that more extensive measures may be necessary.  We consider, moreover, that in the measures we take now and in our presentation of this situation to the Dáil and the public, it is essential we should sustain confidence in the country's capacity to overcome these difficulties, in its capacity to resume the rate of development envisaged and set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Of this I personally have no doubts whatever, subject only to the condition of widespread and general co-operation in making these measures effective.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be said in this debate, in or out of the Dáil, in explanation of the situation to the people of the country should be so phrased that this need to sustain our present national confidence in the certainty of the country's continued development is constantly kept in mind.  The examination of the visible, outward features of our economic situation may not disclose all the causes which are operating to produce them but it is by means of the rectification of these obvious features, which can be seen in published statistics and reports made available by the Government to the House, that we shall know we are also dealing with the underlying causes and getting the results we need.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies who have been studying the documentation presented to them are already fairly well aware of the situation which has developed and of the reason for the Government's concern about it.  The outward and visible signs of the present economic situation and the difficulties which it presents to us can, I think, be briefly summarised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, there has been a substantial rise in imports at the same time as a serious fall in exports and a consequent widening of the trade gap and in our external payments deficit.  Even if the situation does not get any worse <Col N="1076" /> than it is now, there seems likely to be in this year a situation in which the external payments deficit will be not less than £50 million, and it may be higher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>God bless us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, there has been a reduction in the net capital inflow on which we have relied in recent years to bridge the gap in our external payments, and this reduction in the capital inflow has contributed to the contraction of the country's external reserves.  Thirdly, there has been a slowing down of the rate of growth of industrial production and of exports.  There has been an acceleration of the rate of increase in personal expenditure on day-to-day consumption. There has been an undesirable rise in the consumer price index number. There are also current wage demands which threaten the disruption of existing agreements and raise the danger of further increases in costs and prices, a contraction of employment, a further diminution of exports and of increased imports of consumer goods.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal briefly with each of these aspects of our problem.  They are well known to all Deputies, at least to Deputies who have been doing their homework, but it is desirable to present the economic picture as a whole, even if only in outline.  On the question of our external trade in commodities, in the first five months of this year, the value of our imports rose by £16.2 million, or by 11 per cent, over imports in the corresponding period of 1964. The value of our exports was £9.1 million, or ten per cent less than in the corresponding period of last year, and during this period of 1965 our exports amounted to less than half of the value of our imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The import excess widened by £25½ million.  Last year, the deficit on visible trade, which was £125.4 million was offset by invisible receipts, as they are called, mostly tourist earnings, amounting to £94 million, leaving a net deficit in the country's total external payments on current account of £31.4 million.  Assuming <Col N="1077" /> there is no further worsening of our situation in the second half of this year&mdash;I must say quite frankly this is by no means certain&mdash;and assuming also a rise in our net invisible receipts this year of about £7 million&mdash;this can be presented only as an estimate but it is a well-informed estimate&mdash;our external deficit will, as I have said, be not less than £50 million and this may prove to be an optimistic forecast. There are indications that the trade gap could widen further before the position is rectified.</P>
    <P>Subject to the restraints which may be applied, imports seem likely to continue to increase faster in the second half of this year than in 1964 while exports may not show much if any improvement in the second half of this year over the corresponding period of last year.  It is expected the decline in our cattle exports will be arrested but the total exports of cattle during the coming six months are unlikely to exceed those of the second half of last year.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing feature of the expansion of imports is the undesirable increase in imports of consumer goods ready for use.  In the March quarter, the higher imports of consumption goods accounted for £2.1 million out of a total increase in imports in that period of £5.7 million.  The cost of consumption goods imported in the March quarter of this year as compared with 1964 and 1963 was as follows: in 1963, these imports amounted to £15.5 million; in 1964, to £17.1 million and, this year, to £19.2 million.  Practically the whole of this increase of consumption goods related to goods other than food, drink and tobacco.</P>
    <P>The relation between the value of these imports of consumption goods and of all imports during the March quarter worked out at 19.5 per cent in 1964 and 20.5 per cent in 1965.  In particular, imports of motor cars showed an exceptional rise of 30 per cent or £1.4 million in value in the first four months of this year as compared with last year.  Of course, capital equipment imports also showed an increase.  In the first six months, however, <Col N="1078" /> there were some exceptional imports in this category, including aeroplanes, amounting in value to £5½ million.</P>
    <P>As regards our exports, the chief factor bringing about the decline in their total value was the reduction in the exports of live cattle notwithstanding very favourable market conditions in Britain and in Europe.  The main reason for this was the shortage of marketable cattle following the record exports of 1964 and the continuing build-up of breeding herds under the stimulus of the heifer subsidy scheme. The decline in our cattle exports will be temporary and the expectation is that the price will hold.  The numbers of young cattle are up very substantially. Total stocks of cattle are expected to be about 250,000 head higher at the end of this year as compared with the end of 1964.  Exports should begin to recover later in the year with a significant recovery next year.  The expectation is that receipts from cattle exports will be £4 million down this year and will rise by about £7 million next year as compared with this year. Notwithstanding this situation regarding live cattle exports, it is expected that agricultural exports as a whole in this year will not fall below the total of last year.</P>
    <P>The growth of industrial exports has halted and this is attributable to the effect of the British surcharge, to the economic conditions now prevailing in Britain and to the loss of competitiveness in some industries due to rising costs.  It is understandable, I suppose, that an industrial firm finding export business harder to get and less profitable than heretofore should be content to hold its export trade at its previous level, maintaining its trade contacts and the previous level of business with its customers but not striving as it might in more favourable circumstances to expand its trade at the rate of previous years.  This factor makes all the more commendable the efforts of some firms which during this period have increased their total exports and are still increasing them.</P>
    <P>Export business is less profitable now because of higher costs at home <Col N="1079" /> and because of the British import charge.  This is the very time, however, when we should be pressing vigorously for increased export trade in manufactured goods to keep our total external trade in closer balance.</P>
    <P>We cannot attribute any part of our difficulty to a deterioration in the terms of trade.  The rise in export prices as compared with import prices, even if it is likely to be more modest than in 1964, will still be, it seems likely, in our favour.</P>
    <P>Last year and in earlier years our external payments deficit was financed to a large extent by a capital inflow and the net external reserves of our banking system rose last year by £5.2 million as they also rose in 1963 and 1962.  This widening of our trade gap has taken place at a time when this capital inflow is already slackening. Our estimate is that it may run this year at a level of about £25 million as compared with £36 million in 1964.</P>
    <P>The impact of the higher trade deficit in this year has, therefore, fallen on the external reserves of the banking system and on Government funds and by mid-May these external reserves of ours had shown a fall of £33.5 million as compared with an increase at the same time last year.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the growth of internal expenditure upon day-to-day consumption to which I have referred, and some other factors, the very factors which have pushed up our import figures and contributed significantly to our trade deficit, have also brought about a contraction of internal savings.</P>
    <P>Industrial production rose in the first quarter of this year by 4.1 per cent as compared with 11 per cent in the first quarter of last year.  In some earlier years we would have presented this statistic of industrial growth, a 4.1 per cent increase in industrial output, with some satisfaction.  It is, however, well below our present needs and well below what has been achieved in more recent years.  This decline in the rate of growth is attributable to the stagnation of industrial exports because in the circumstances <Col N="1080" /> of this country increases in industrial production must in the main be for export markets.  This year, indeed, the home market demand has remained buoyant and is the main reason why industrial output has risen notwithstanding that there has been no corresponding expansion in industrial exports.</P>
    <P>The position, of course, is not uniform for all industries.  This overall industrial output figure is greatly influenced by the substantial increases which are recorded in the output of cement and other building materials reflecting the high level of activity in the building trade.</P>
    <P>The rise in employment in industry has also slowed down, the increase being approximately 2,000 in the first quarter of this year as compared with an increase of 7,700 in the corresponding quarter of 1964.  Last year there was a marked improvement in productivity, that is to say, in the value of output per worker employed, which helped to offset the effect of production costs of the higher wages paid under the ninth round National Wage Agreement.</P>
    <P>If, given stability on the wages front, this improvement in productivity had been maintained this year, our position would cause much less concern. However, this rate of improvement was not maintained in the earlier months of this year, Between March, 1964, and March, 1965, wages rose by 4.1 per cent but productivity increased by only 3.6 per cent, so that production costs are still rising and are affecting prices.  A further rise in wages now would probably not only put thousands of workers out of their employment but would be fully reflected in an equivalent rise in prices.</P>
    <P>Last year unit labour costs in this country rose by between five and six per cent.  This is a far higher rise than, as far as I can discover, was recorded in any other country.  In Britain unit labour costs rose by less than three per cent and in France and the United States unit labour costs actually fell.  In Britain their current balance of payments problem is <Col N="1081" /> attributable in some measure to this rise in their unit labour costs.  This unfavourable trend in the competitiveness of Irish industry has contributed to the limitation of our export expansion at a time when difficulties in the British and other markets required that it should be moving in the opposite direction, striving to increase competitiveness as well as to maintain the volume of our exports.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, production increased in volume in 1964 by four per cent, including changes in cattle numbers. A further rise in production is expected this year.  The number of cows and heifers-in-calf are up by 115,000 and 37,000, respectively, and milk deliveries to creameries are up by 12½ per cent in the first months of 1965.  Given a favourable harvest crop production should also be higher than in 1964.</P>
    <P>All the information available and all the indications emphasise that there has been a rise in expenditure on personal consumption goods at a substantially higher rate than in 1964.  The retail sales index number for the first four months of this year was 10 per cent higher than in 1964, and allowing for price changes there is evidence that the volume of personal consumption has risen by about four per cent.  This is greater than the current rate of growth of national production in real terms which is unlikely to be expanding at a higher rate than three per cent.  The nation as a whole is consuming more without producing more in corresponding degree, and this is the basic explanation of our rising external deficit and contracting external reserves.</P>
    <P>An example of this rise in consumption expenditure is the sale of motor cars to which I have already referred. For the first four months of 1965 these were, respectively, 30 per cent, 39 per cent, 15 per cent and 17 per cent above last year's figures.  Imports of motor aggregates for assembly here during the period were higher by 30 per cent. In the January-May period of this year turnover tax receipts were up by 14.3 per cent on the same months of <Col N="1082" /> 1964.  Customs and excise tax receipts for beer, spirits and oil were increased, respectively, by 19.9 per cent, 18.8 per cent, and 17.7 per cent, while customs receipts from tobacco were up by 15.8 per cent.  The volume of hire purchase debt which rose by 20 per cent in 1964 is believed, although exact figures are not yet available, to have increased sharply in the first quarter of this year, which is no doubt attributable in large measure to these higher motor car sales I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>Bank lending in the form of bills, loans and advances within the State rose by £23 millions in the first five months of this year as compared with an increase of £10 millions in the same period of 1964, although it is to be known that this greater volume of lending has been largely in the Government sector.  Bank deposits are tending to decline due to the contraction of the capital inflow and this affects the ability of the banking system to keep on expanding credit at the rate recorded earlier in this year.  Because of the rise in consumption expenditure to which I referred and some other factors, including, of course, the building up of cattle stocks in agriculture, the trend in internal savings has been unsatisfactory.  There have been appreciable reductions in the rate of growth of small savings, in subscriptions to prize bonds and in the amount of exchequer bills outstanding with the public.</P>
    <P>The significance of this trend has to be judged against the background of the situation in which, because of the falling off of the external capital inflow, reliance must be placed to a greater extent on internal resources for the financing of national development. Nevertheless there was in the first quarter of this year a rise of nine per cent in the volume of capital formation attributable in large measure to increased expenditure on housing.  The number of new houses built in the first four months of 1965 was 1,000 higher than in the same period of 1964 and double the average number for the two previous years, 1962 and 1963.</P>
    <P>The National Wage Agreement which was concluded in January 1964, <Col N="1083" /> has still a year to run.  It was hoped that rising output, and rising productivity, would over the full period of the agreement offset its effect upon costs and prices and that the agreement would ensure stability of labour costs for its duration.  It has not, as Deputies know, fully worked out as was hoped. Over the whole sector of employment the level of earned income has risen by more than the 12 per cent contemplated in the agreement and, while it must be conceded that the agreement has been generally respected over a very large segment of industrial employment, it is being threatened by claims of one kind or another in particular sectors.</P>
    <P>A number of factors, mostly internal, have caused price levels to continue to rise.  Between November, 1964, and May, 1965, the overall increase was three per cent.  This threatens our capacity to balance our trade deficit and to get production and employment moving upward again.  It should be clear to everyone that, in the light of the difficulties which have emerged and their effect upon our rate of economic expansion, a further rise in prices due to any cause within our control could very well put the country out of industrial export business, pull down employment in a catastrophic manner and produce the economic crisis we are now seeking to prevent.</P>
    <P>The most important of the factors of external origin affecting our situation is the British import surcharge and the shortage of international capital, which is putting a brake on development even in the strongest countries.  There are, too, difficulties arising from deficiencies in the world's payment mechanisms.  Deputies will have noted that in the past couple of days there was a proposal by the United States of America for a world conference on the lines of Bretton Woods to consider the revision and improvement of existing monetary arrangements.  It is likely, however, that some considerable time will elapse before this conference can be organised, even assuming that there is general international agreement that it should take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> It is right, I think, to point out that Ireland is not alone in experiencing problems at this time and I refer to this international situation not to encourage any complacency about our position but rather to emphasise its seriousness and the possibility of it becoming even more serious because the international background does not encourage any expectation of easy or early relief for any of our problems. Indeed, it is not unlikely that the efforts of other Governments to cope with their corresponding problems arising at this time may add further to ours, rather than relieve them, both in regard to access to capital resources and in securing the expansion we need in export trade.  Because of our close trading relationship with Britain the position in that country is, of course, of very great significance to us.  It also holds out little prospect of an early elimination of the import surcharge.</P>
    <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently estimated that Britain's balance of payment will be in equilibrium by the second half of 1966.  It is to be expected certainly that the surcharge will disappear by then, but it may be retained until then at the ten per cent rate, or lower.  Although the deterioration in our balance of payments is due in large measure to temporary factors there is on that account no justification for expecting the national economy to right itself. The rectification of our position and the improvement of our future development prospects is something that must be contrived by the joint efforts of the Government, the Dáil and the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The steady growth of employment, the steady improvement of the living standards of our people, which it is our common desire to bring about, can only be assured if they are based on expanding resources generated by competitive production, supplementing the productive use of external capital within the limits upon which it can reliably be dependent.  So that continual expansion may be safeguarded there is need to take action to keep the situation under control by moderating the growth of Government expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by encouraging the diversion of resources from consumption to saving and by discouraging any further general increase in money incomes of any kind until this period of difficulty has been passed.</P>
      <P>The basic aim of financial and economic policy is now, as it must always be, to keep productive activity at the highest possible level consistent with the competitive level of prices and costs and a reasonable degree of external balance.  Excessive pressure of demand can in any circumstances bring about an inflation of prices and costs, the reduction of exports and the stimulation of imports.  These are the precise dangers which are now confronting us and we need not, therefore, have much difficulty in recognising the cause of our problems.</P>
      <P>Measures have already been taken in this year, of which some Deputies were disposed to be critical, in the credit field to curb the adverse movement in the balance of payments, to limit the increase in consumption expenditure and to ensure that productive purposes receive priority in the allocation of our resources.  Further measures to the same end are now required.  These may mean the acceptance for the time being of a slower rate of economic growth than was projected in the Second Programme in the hope that, when current difficulties have been overcome, the higher rate can be resumed.  Subject to maintaining the highest possible level of productive economic activity, as I have said, the purpose of all the measures we apply must be directed to improving the trade balance and to the easing of demands on the available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are maintaining a continuing, a very careful and very detailed analysis of trends and developments so that further steps may be taken in time, if they should be required.  This may necessitate the reassembly of the Dáil during the period of the Recess.  We are in a position in which the Government's capital programme requires very careful management.  We are confident that Government expenditure <Col N="1086" /> on capital account can be maintained at the levels envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> It has tended to run beyond its limits and I confess that the Government were not unduly concerned heretofore about this tendency, but it it very obvious now that our original decisions were realistic and that capital outlay beyond that envisaged in the Second Programme cannot be financed in the circumstances now prevailing.</P>
    <P>Within the limits of the estimates in the Second Development Programme, the level of State capital investment can be maintained at a level well beyond anything previously attempted here.  It is obviously commonsense in this situation to give a very definite priority to capital projects of a directly productive character and to put back until later projects, however desirable we might otherwise consider them to be, that do not come within this definition.  This has always been our policy but the classification of productive projects may need to be tightened up.  In so far as the building and construction industries are concerned, the intention of stabilising output at a sustainable level and examining the best methods of protecting the industry against the undue fluctuation of output has already been announced.</P>
    <P>The Building Advisory Council has, I understand, now completed a report on the present and prospective future level of building activities but the Government have not yet had the opportunity of considering this report.  The Government must also take a very firm stand against any further rise, in the present conditions, in the current non-capital public expenditure so as not to increase the deficit in the Budget and to avoid further price-raising taxation.  As in the area of capital investment, this will involve putting back until later many improvements of the public services with which we would much prefer to be able to proceed quickly.</P>
    <P>The encouragement of savings so that capital to maintain the country's development progress will be available <Col N="1087" /> is now an even more important aspect of policy than previously.  For this purpose, as well as to check the rise in credit for less essential purposes, it was decided that the interest rates on Irish bank deposits and advances should not be reduced recently when the British bank rate was brought down.  On previous occasions, as Deputies know, the Irish bank rates followed changes in Britain more or less automatically. We do not consider, however, that the raising of the deposit interest rates by the savings banks or by the commercial banks would result in a sufficient increase in savings to justify the heavy cost it would involve.  The Minister for Finance, has, however, in the Finance Bill still before the Dáil, proposed the doubling of the tax free allowances on interest on bank deposits.  An intensification of the national savings campaign will be undertaken with emphasis not only on the personal benefits of saving but the national need it will help to serve at this time.</P>
    <P>The Government have been giving most careful consideration to the possibility of doing something to restrict the rise in imports and to the best method to adopt to this end.  We are importing more than we can afford at this present time and we have to do something about it.  We have examined the categories of goods which are showing the largest growth of imports in this year and the import pattern generally.  We have, however, rejected the idea of levies or quantitative regulation. We see no permanent remedy of our economic situation in an intensification of protection; on the contrary, and notwithstanding the rise in imports, we can see advantages in resuming soon our movement in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The courses for which we think the present situation calls are a curtailment of bank credit facilities for unnecessary imports and the regulation of hire purchase facilities for certain classes of goods.  We recognise that the application of an effective limitation of bank credit for unnecessary or avoidable imports will offer some practical difficulties but we propose to ask the Central Bank to discuss with <Col N="1088" /> the commercial banks the extent to which restrictions of this kind can be made effective and to arrange accordingly.</P>
    <P>As regards restraint on the rate of expansion and the very exceptional growth in this year of hire purchase debt, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is making an order under the Hire Purchase Act of 1960 prescribing minimum deposits and maximum repayment periods for motor cars, motor cycles and scooters, for autocycles, radios, television sets and some items of household electrical appliances, other than cookers.  In the case of motor cars, motor cycles and scooters, the minimum deposit will be 25 per cent; in the case of other commodities, the minimum deposit will be 15 per cent.  The repayment period will be three years in all instances.</P>
    <P>The hope is that these regulations will encourage people to save a little more to meet the higher deposit requirements or to avoid other unnecessary expenditure before committing themselves to the hire purchase of these goods.  Incidentally, I may say that the deposit and repayment conditions which will henceforth operate here in respect of these goods so long as these restrictions apply are the same as those which have been operating in Great Britain for quite a time past.  These hire purchase restrictions will apply to transactions financed by State-sponsored bodies as well as those financed by other firms and it is intended that all State-sponsored bodies will be requested to conform to Government policy in discouraging the too-rapid expansion of the financing of the purchase or the hiring of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have heard, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers to inform them about the national economic situation and these meetings are continuing.  The purpose of these meetings is not so much to tell these bodies what we think the situation requires of them as to give them all the information which they may need to decide for themselves <Col N="1089" /> how best they can contribute to the improvement of this difficult national situation.  Particularly in regard to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions we expect that their anxiety about the possible consequences of the situation on the level and stability of employment and on the future living standards of the workers is not less than ours and that they will give the fullest and most careful consideration to the obligations which it imposes on them.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances now prevailing, the preservation of employment is clearly entitled to priority over the improvement of wage levels.  It is of critical importance to the future progress of the country, to the maintenance of employment and to the protection of the standard of living of our workers that there should not be any further general inflation of personal incomes of any kind until the external payments deficit is reduced to manageable proportions and until production is again moving up at the necessary rate on the basis of competitive costs.  I could not put this any more strongly.  It is essential that all of us, Government, Deputies, trade union leaders and everybody try by every means to spread understanding of how serious this situation can become, of the serious threat to the competitiveness of the national economy, to the country's financial solvency and the protection of employment and economic growth.  These are the dangers inherent in any further inflation at this time of wages, salaries and personal incomes.  I want to emphasise the need for a period of consolidation until the present exceptional difficulties are surmounted.  In view of the national agreement of last year on wages and salaries this is not asking workers to make any sacrifices.</P>
    <P>Unless we have a general understanding of the situation, the danger of destructive consequences to the jobs of many workers, perhaps of many thousands of workers, cannot be underestimated.  This is a situation of which we have had some experience and recollection.  The conditions which began to develop ten years ago and which many people still at work can <Col N="1090" /> remember can help to guide us at this time.  We recognise that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have no executive function and cannot control directly the actions of individual unions but we believe that they have powerful influence with all trade union executives and that, in a situation like this, their advice will be taken.  In any case, it is our duty as a Government, in the light of our understanding of the situation, to use whatever means of communication with the public are open to us to see that understanding of this national problem is disseminated as widely as possible in the hope and expectation that this will obviate the necessity for any other course.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council will be discussing a report on the economic situation and prospects during the present week.  Their views have, as we know, very great weight with the Government, with the trade unions and the employers' organisations and will help to promote the wider public understanding which is essential.  I am aware that the National Farmers Association have expressed dissatisfaction that they were not included in these discussions.  There are of course regular and frequent discussions with the NFA on all aspects of agriculture and it will be obvious from these general observations I am making that the discussions which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is now engaged in have a limited context and are related to the functions of his Department and to the non-agricultural sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Prices Bill which will be moved after my Estimate is the only measure of direct control which the Government regard as essential at this time. Its introduction is intended to be not merely the conferring of additional powers on the Government but also an indication of the seriousness with which the Government view the entire price situation in its implications for the competitiveness of our national economy and the security of our living standards.  The intention of the Government is that the powers conferred by the new measure will be used whenever any increase in price from any <Col N="1091" /> cause, which has any significance in relation to the cost of living index number, is threatened.  The intention will be to control first and investigate later, and not to allow any increase during the process of investigation.  No increase in price will be sanctioned where the justification offered is a cause within the control of the industry itself or indeed, for any cause other than an unavoidable rise in the price of purchased materials or where its purpose is to increase margins earned on production, distribution and retail sale.  Furthermore, in the case of prices which have already been increased and where there is any reason to think that the increase requires investigation, this will be undertaken, with the intention of bringing about a reduction of price by Government order where this is found to be justified and practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputies are well aware of my views upon the effectiveness and desirability of maintaining any general system of official price control in circumstances other than those of actual scarcity.  I want to emphasise that the difficulties of operating an effective system of price regulation and control in a free competitive society except in the case of a very limited number of commodities which are normally sold in uniform standard qualities such as flour, bread, sugar and butter have not been diminished in the least by our present economic difficulties, but it will be the intention of the Government to make this system of control work as well as possible for the time being.  The Prices (Amendment) Bill provides for a permanent change in our prices legislation but the powers it confers on the Government will be put into cold storage again as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The Bill will insert provisions in the 1958 Act to enable the Government when they consider that there are conditions in the national economy which make it necessary to take official action to maintain stable prices and to empower the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do the things set out in the context of the Bill.  The <Col N="1092" /> Minister wishes to be able to use the machinery of the Prices Advisory Body for which there is provision in the original Act, or to constitute another prices advisory body or bodies and to enable this to be done, two amendments to the Bill will be circulated to be moved on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government have been considering this situation from the viewpoint that the only effective and permanent solution is to bring about a further and continuing expansion of exports.  It will be the work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture to discuss every possibility of that kind with the representatives of every economic interest, to pursue vigorously every suggestion that could open up new markets or increase existing export possibilities in every market.</P>
    <P>Apart from these detailed measures, the Government have decided that industries with export possibilities in Britain which are deterred from making or are unable to make full use of them by reason of the British import surcharge should be given further encouragement and help to expand trade in that market.  To this end, it had been decided to increase the present market development grants for the benefit of firms which increase their exports to Britain in the second half of this year over the level of their exports in the second half of 1964.  At present these market development grants are at the rate of 40 per cent of the amount paid by way of the British temporary charge on imports or at the rate of 50 per cent in a few exceptional cases.  In the case of a firm which increases its total exports during the next six months by any amount up to ten per cent over the 1964 level, the additional grant in respect of the whole of its exports to Britain will be such as will bring the grant provided up to 55 per cent of the cost of the British surcharge.  In the case of a firm which increases its exports by more than ten per cent, the additional grant will be 25 per cent, bringing the grant in respect of its total exports to Britain up to 65 per cent.  In the few exceptional <Col N="1093" /> cases where the present grant is 50 per cent, the new rates in the circumstances I have indicated will be 65 per cent and 75 per cent; and these new grants are effective as from now.</P>
    <P>We can and will use our external reserves in a reasonable way to reduce the impact on the country's economy of the position arising at this time.  I have explained that there already has been considerable use of these external reserves and a further reduction of them is probably unavoidable unless the trade deficit takes a speedy and unlikely turn for the better.  The Central Bank will continue, as the lender of last resort, to supply sterling reserves to the commercial banks to maintain both private and public credit needs.  We are considering the practicability and desirability of easing our present difficulties by borrowing abroad.  All the evidence so far available to us makes it clear that foreign borrowing is not likely to be practicable on a scale which would make a significant difference to our present circumstances either on a continuing basis or at a cost which would make it other than very unattractive.  However, inquiries as to its possibilities are being continued.  But, as of now, it seems we will have to solve our problems and organise our future development relying in the main, if not entirely, on our own resources.  This situation emphasises in a very special way the relevance of the Buy Irish campaign to our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that at my meeting with the British Prime Minister in London last November it was arranged that officials should examine the possibilities of improving the permanent trading relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom. Detailed discussions between the officials of both Governments have been taking place and a fair amount of progress has been made.  Discussions between Ministers have now been arranged and are expected to take place in London during this month.  I intend myself to lead the Irish delegation.  If a satisfactory permanent agreement on the lines now under discussion can be completed, it <Col N="1094" /> would have an important bearing on the country's economic situation and would contribute to its improvement both in the short and long term.</P>
    <P>To summarise therefore the immediate measures the Government consider applicable to this economic situation, they are: first, the reorganisation of the Government's capital programme for this year to keep the total outlay on capital account within the forecast in the Second Economic Development Programme.  Secondly, the restriction of current Government expenditure financed from tax revenue so as to avoid any danger of further taxation increases which could affect prices.  Thirdly, measures to ensure that bank loans and advances are confined as far as possible to mainly productive purposes.  Fourthly, further encouragement of internal savings including a tax inducement.  Fifthly, the limitation of avoidable imports by means of credit and hire purchase restrictions.  Sixthly, the avoidance of further increases of personal incomes of all kinds, in which the Government hope to have the co-operation of all the vocational interests concerned. Seventhly, price control operated so as to limit increases, if any, to unavoidable changes in costs of imported materials, and so as to bring down prices which are found on inquiry to be reasonably capable of reduction. Eightly, the fullest investigation of all export market possibilities for agricultural and industrial products and the provision of higher market development grants to encourage and assist industrial firms to expand the level of their exports.  Ninthly, as far as lies within our power, to bring to a speedy and successful conclusion the trade negotiations with Britain now in progress. Tenthly, a further examination of the feasibility and desirability of external borrowing.  Finally, the intensification of the Buy Irish campaign which is now being organised.</P>
    <P>The Government hope these measures, and the climate of public opinion they may evoke, will prove sufficient to prevent any further and serious deterioration in the position and will lead eventually to its improvement. But if this should not prove to <Col N="1095" /> be so, then their intensification and extension will have to be considered. I know the normal healthy and patriotic reaction of every citizen, when he learns the country is in difficulty, will be to ask how he can help. The answer in one respect is very clear. It is to avoid purchasing any imported goods at this time which can either be supplied from home sources or which can be done without either altogether or for the time being.  In another respect it would be to avoid any action affecting production costs and business margins which could cause prices to rise and so reduce our prospects of getting out of these difficulties by an expansion of export trade.  In a third respect it would be to accept, each in his own personal occupation, the need for improving the competitiveness of the national economy, as a whole and in each of its parts, by increasing output.  In this regard the obligation on business managements to set the right example is of predominant importance.</P>
    <P>The country must earn more by producing more to maintain its present living standards.  The amount by which our present output falls short of our present requirements is the external trade deficit as now recorded.  If we fail in this, the signs of falling living standards will be first seen in rising unemployment.  Until we succeed in it, we cannot bring about the further improvement of these standards that we desire.  This is elementary economic as well as elementary common sense.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that at this time the country should be deprived of the normal means of communication with the public by reason of the non-publication of the Dublin daily newspapers following on a strike of printers in support of a wage demand.  While every other channel of communication will be fully used to get the necessary information over to the public, there is sure to be some inadequacy in this situation which will add to our difficulties in dealing with the position.  I hope therefore that all Deputies, irrespective of Party, will consider it their duty to explain the facts and to outline <Col N="1096" /> and explain the actions the Government have decided, and which I have announced, to the people of their own constituencies and to other wider audiences if they can reach them.</P>

      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The House has listened to a very sombre account from the Taoiseach of the state of the national economy. I have no doubt that, from the analysis which he has given and the gravity of the manner in which he has expressed it, Deputies will appreciate the seriousness of the economic position.  So far as this Party are concerned, we have always refrained from exploiting a serious economic position for Party purposes.  However different the treatment we received in other circumstances may have been, we will continue to exercise the same restraint in the national interest.</P>
      <P>It is important, in considering the present problems which have arisen and which are, in the main, due to internal factors, to realise that the present difficulty over the rise in prices is, in the main, due to, and directly traceable to, the introduction of the turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax was introduced by the Government at that-time on the basis that the traditional sources of revenue, tobacco, beer, spirits and petrol, could not yield adequate increased revenue to pay for the expanding Government expenditure.  A strong case was argued to this effect. We opposed the tax on the ground that it applied to a whole range of commodities not hitherto subject to tax, in particular, food, clothes, shoes, fuel and medicines.  However, the tax was put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the tax was introduced, repeated requests were made to the Government for information as to what additional margins traders, either individually or in group organisations representing different trades, were <Col N="1097" /> entitled to put on.  No answer was given.  In fact, repeated efforts were made to create the impression that the tax would apply only in some cases and, where it did apply, 2½ per cent was all that would be imposed.  It was obvious in a short time that the tax operated at a much higher level.  In fact, in the short space of a few months, the tax, coupled with the price changes to a very considerable extent generated by the tax but, in any event consequential on the tax, in particular, and certain other factors as well, resulted in price increases ranging from three per cent to seven per cent, depending on circumstances, on the commodities and on individual traders and shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>This was followed in a short time by a widespread and justified demand for wage and salary adjustments and negotiations were opened by employers' representatives and the trade unions.  These negotiations were proceeding, and it is a well known fact that agreement was in the process of being reached, when, for the first time in the history of wage and salary adjustments and negotiations in this country, the Government directly intervened. Subsequently, a wage adjustment known as the ninth round and amounting to 12 per cent was granted. I said later in the Dáil, and others have also expressed the view, that, although elsewhere other Governments have intervened on an agreed basis and a well-defined and an orderly system has been laid down, in this case the Government&mdash;and this has to be said&mdash;intervened for political purposes in what could not be regarded as an orderly or an agreed arrangement.</P>

      <P>This haphazard intervention took place on the eve, as Deputies will recollect, of two by-elections. It may well be that the cost of winning those by-elections has not yet been fully assessed and the bill is now only being paid.  Unfortunately it is not Fianna Fáil alone who have to pay it.  It is the country which has to <Col N="1098" /> pay it.  The combined effect of the steep rise in prices due to the turnover tax and the consequential rise in the consumer price index has produced a most dramatic rise in the cost of living.  The latest figures which were published, and which were given in a reply I received to a Parliamentary Question addressed to the Taoiseach, indicate that the changes in the prices of items entering into the Consumer Price Index for the period mid-May, 1964, until mid-May, 1965, emphasise and underline the problem which has affected a great many householders, certainly those on anything like either average or less than average incomes. Of course, what it has meant for those below those levels requires no remarks to indicate the gravity of the situation.</P>
      <P>The price of beef has increased by 14.5 per cent, and mutton by ten per cent.  Other articles included in the food section of the Consumer Price Index reveal equally staggering increases. Potatoes have increased by 89 per cent.  That, to some extent, may be seasonal.  Eggs have increased by 11.6 per cent.  When one examines the clothing position, one finds increases ranging from five per cent in respect of men's clothes, with a three per cent increase in a man's overcoat; increases of seven per cent in boy's suits and five per cent in overcoats.  Women's clothes have increased by anything ranging from 3½ per cent down and similar increases have taken place in the case of children's clothes.  Other goods and services, such as Post Office and telephone charges have increased by 17 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. Education costs have increased by almost 16 per cent.  Rents and rates of rented dwellings have increased by over five per cent and the rates on owner-occupied dwellings have increased by nine per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from these very remarkable figures that there has been a substantial rise in internal price levels.  This rise in prices has particularly affected those living on fixed incomes who received no compensation to offset increases in prices&mdash; pensioners, retired personnel, the self-employed, small shopkeepers and <Col N="1099" /> traders, and those living on invested savings.  Undoubtedly, some of those who received wage and salary advances at the time were under the impression that those wage and salary advances compensated them.  Taking the figure of 12 per cent and comparing it with the announced figure of 2½ per cent, it appeared for a short time, and in the short term, that the balance of advantage lay with those who got wage and salary advances, and on that basis they expressed their views in the bye-elections.  Time has passed and the accumulation of figures has now had its full effect on prices as reflected in the Consumer Price Index.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax was introduced because, the Government vehemently asserted, the traditional sources of revenue were incapable of providing adequate increased revenue and some other means of financing the State's expenditure programme had to be found.  In the short space of a few months the 1964 Budget was introduced, and in that Budget additional taxation of £5 million was placed on beer, tobacco, spirits, and petrol, not to mention an additional £2 million in respect of Post Office charges. Again, in the recent Budget additional taxation of £5.55 million was imposed on cigarettes, petrol, spirits, beer and wine.  Since the introduction of the turnover tax&mdash;within six months of its introduction in 1964, and this year within 18 months of its introduction &mdash;additional taxation to the tune of £10½ million has been imposed on the traditional sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>This surely demonstrates the lack of a well thought out policy, carefully planned for economic and social development.  It indicates the inability of the Government to decide what is the correct approach.  It reflects an internal reversal of Government opinion within the short space of less than a year in the first instance, and again in the present year, by the addition of further heavy taxation on the traditional sources of revenue which the Government vehemently asserted were not capable of bearing any further taxation.</P>
    <P>So far as the analysis which the <Col N="1100" /> Taoiseach has given of the problems which affect the country is concerned, no one will either seriously dispute or contradict the facts.  In general, those facts were already well known, and all that has occurred here today is that the Taoiseach has brought some of the figures up to date.  Internally the country has suffered from rising prices, industrial unrest, and a slowing down of the rate of growth of production and employment.  In that connection it is well to reflect on the comment made in Economic Statistics issued prior to the Budget of 1965.  Having referred to the Consumer Price Index changes in the period 1964 compared with 1957 there is the comment:</P>
    <P>Thus the price changes in this country over the period have not been caused by rises in the prices of imports but by internal factors.</P>
    <P>The significance of that comment is that on a previous occasion, when we had balance of payments difficulties and when the adverse trade balance got seriously out of line, the situation was contributed to, in the main, by rising import prices as the aftermath of the Suez crisis, or earlier on at the time of the Korean War when import costs rose steeply.  That was spread not merely over petrol and oil but over the whole range of commodities affected.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the Government have the advantage of a situation in which the import price level has, in the main, been reasonably stable and the price increases have not been caused, as the Economic Statistics publication says at page 16:</P>
    <P>...by rises in the prices of imports but by internal factors.</P>
    <P>The figures indicate that the Consumer Price Index which was 141.8 in February, 1965, has risen still further to 144.3.</P>
    <P>It is true that this country is not unique in suffering from rises in prices, but the price rise here as compared with other countries&mdash;and particularly as compared with some of our competitors&mdash;is quite remarkable.  We have been consistently advocating that to <Col N="1101" /> meet this situation not only is it necessary to have the co-operation, as the Taoiseach requested, of all sections, both in the Dáil and from representatives of employers and trade unions, but also that people should be able to understand what they are being asked to co-operate in.  Our case has been that it is essential for this country to have a policy for prices and incomes.</P>

      <P>We have never considered&mdash;and we do not now suggest&mdash; that the implementation of such a policy is either easy or simple.  If it were the Government would have adopted it long ago.  What we do say is that if such a policy does not succeed to the extent we would all hope for or to the extent of the most optimistic anticipation, at any rate an attempt would have been made to secure the combined efforts of all concerned.</P>
      <P>A great deal of study, discussion and, indeed, negotiation have gone into this problem in other countries and, in particular, in countries that are, like ourselves, members of OECD.  It is true that until quite recently no comparable effort in that sphere was made in Britain.  It is equally true that great difficulties have attended the implementation or operation of such a policy in Britain.  It is worth noting that it is surely a mistake for this country always to take the worst out of British precedents, and not to try to take some of their advantages.  We have seen recently considerable chunks being taken out of the present British Finance Bill and without much adaptation, and it has been sought to impose them on our circumstances which are very different from those of Britain.  In many respects the two systems are in no way at all comparable. It is not for us to comment on whether the British system is good or bad, but it is a system which is unsuited to, and not in the best interests of, our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of these European countries, very great discussion, and a considerable amount of negotiation, <Col N="1102" /> have taken place between representatives of employers' organisations, representatives of trade unions, and the Government, in order to achieve an arrangement on prices and incomes. An exhaustive report on this matter was prepared by the OECD which adverted to the circumstances in a number of countries.  In some countries the view was expressed, and indeed in one report reference was made to the fact, that in this country it ought to be relatively easy to evolve a policy for prices and incomes because of the size of our economy.  Reference was made to the success which had attended efforts made in other countries, notably, Sweden and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Finally, in this report, which was presented by the Working Party, one important conclusion was arrived at. On page 47, on the policies for price and stability, it said:</P>
    <P>It follows that in our kind of society a successful incomes policy must derive its ultimate sanction from the understanding and co-operation of all those concerned. This does not mean that the Government has a purely passive role to play.  It must formulate its policy clearly and be prepared to defend it against criticism.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that have arisen here in the wage discussion is the fact that one criterion appears to be laid down for certain types or categories of workers or employees, and another for others.</P>
    <P>While it is conceded that the National Wage Agreement has another year to run, the position has been jeopardised by the large number of what are described as status increase applications which have been made and which, while justified on the grounds of particular interests, appeared to pay no attention or give any consideration to the problems of the lower-paid workers and in particular to those in the manual sector. I think we are entitled to ask during this discussion what has caused the present crisis.  It is true imports have risen, exports have not kept pace and price rises have occurred because of, in the main, the turnover tax and the <Col N="1103" /> rise consequential on it.  But, in addition to that, what influence has the State exerted to ensure that a similar pattern of wage and salary adjustments applies right across the board? The position is that the status increases that have in the main been granted have applied in the State sector.  This has naturally led to widespread dissatisfaction among other categories in the community.</P>
    <P>I believe it is unreasonable to expect, and unrealistic to imagine, that those on the lower scale, either manual workers or those on the lower range of wage rates, are prepared to postpone their application for wage and salary adjustments when they see others in the higher echelons getting status increases.  These particular niceties have very little relevance to a man on a fixed salary and income who finds that his wage packet goes a shorter distance each week and each month because of the rise in prices. One of the equally extraordinary effects of increases in cost, originally attributable to the effect of the turnover tax which has snowballed to such a considerable extent that we now have this unrest in many levels of the community, is the extent to which these rises have had reactions on the budgets of local authorities, health authorities and other bodies.</P>
    <P>Recently the Voluntary Health Insurance Board circularised its members. In that circular, a figure was used to emphasise in a very dramatic, and indeed stark, fashion this effect which has been mainly contributed to by the turnover tax and the consequential rise in prices.  The Board set out that since 1962 the maintenance charge for a paying patient in a public ward has increased from six guineas to £17 10s. per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is almost three times the original figure in the short space of three years.  In other words, consequential on the changes I have mentioned, this situation has developed in respect of those who are covered by the voluntary health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no wonder, in the light of the <Col N="1104" /> situation emphasised by these figures, that other sections of the community &mdash;medical card holders and all those affected by illness in one form or another&mdash;have been clamouring for an improvement in the health services. These figures indicate the extent of the problem to which we directed attention during the course of the election campaign and which the Minister for Health has now indicated he is having examined in order to see what improvements are possible.  Certainly the figure I mentioned emphasises the increase in cost in respect of a public ward&mdash;not for a private patient but for a patient in a public ward.  That indicates the effect of the increase in price of medicines and other costs which all individuals in the community who have the misfortune to suffer from ill-health or who need hospital treatment for one reason or another are obliged to meet. For those who have the advantage of participating in the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, some coverage will be provided.  In regard to others, the cost obligation falls either on themselves or their family, although in certain cases it is offset by medical cards.</P>
    <P>We have consistently expressed the view that the proposal to operate price control in a free economy and in the absence of war-time conditions has only a very limited effect.  The Taoiseach referred to that in the course of his remarks today.  It would be over-optimistic, I think, to expect any serious reduction in prices; but we do say that the real defect when the turnover tax was introduced was the fact that some form of price control was not then introduced, and that the Government allowed a free-for-all to operate.  Not merely have they allowed that situation to develop but the chief Government spokesman, the Minister for Finance, at the time, repeated in debates on the turnover tax and in subsequent Budget debates, that it was a matter for individual traders and that no margin would be specifically laid down, that there would be no headline or directive to individual traders or to the community as a whole as to what price increases might be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The result of this has been that there have been price increases ranging from three per cent to seven per cent.  While we say that price control in a free and open economy such as this cannot be effective in the way in which it might be in war time, we do say that traders and trading organisations should have the obligation and onus to notify price increases.  This should be done in the way it is done in a number of continental countries.  Indeed, a better way might well be to have some statutory authority to look after this matter. The appropriate Minister, or the statutory prices body should have the right to get from an individual or an organisation seeking a price increase, a justification for that price increase.  If a price increase is justified, the onus is on those making the increase to give publicity to the facts.  What precludes any confidence in the Government's approach to this problem is the fact that interventions by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government in regard to prices have been haphazard, have been on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and have been in cases in which there appeared to be very little justification for intervention.</P>
    <P>For instance, people found it difficult to understand why the Government intervened with a great hullabaloo when the petrol companies increased the price of petrol by 1d. a gallon but then there was not a word about it when the Government put 3d. a gallon on petrol.  That seems to show a lack of appreciation of the difficulties and problems which exist and a lack of any consistent approach to the problem of price control.  We believe that if price increases were notified, and if, as part of the whole policy for prices and incomes, the Government decide to intervene, they should intervene on an agreed, accepted and understood basis and not in the manner in which they have intervened in the case of the ninth round increases.</P>
    <P>This was a haphazard intervention and followed&mdash;and this is important&mdash; the Government's approach to this problem in earlier cases.  When the Government commented on the seventh round, it had this effect, that <Col N="1106" /> many trade unions and other organisations doubted the economic judgement or commonsense of the Government. However, because of the Government's intervention in the ninth round, they hoped that a change of attitude had been adopted and that there was a prospect of an improved approach. As a result of that Government intervention, the pattern in the Civil Service, in the local authorities and in State bodies, has been that there have been the substantial wage and salary adjustments of the sort I mentioned earlier.  Naturally those on the lower scales, such as manual workers, are restive when they hear of status and other adjustments being applied.  In many cases these adjustments have had a considerable element of retrospection.</P>
    <P>No one wishes to refuse to grant wage or salary adjustments but there should be a uniform pattern, having the same level and applicable throughout the whole economy, both in the State sector and in the private sector. It may well be that part of the problem has been caused by the multiplicity of conciliation and arbitration bodies that exist to deal with this problem.  It may well be that the time has arrived when consideration should be given to having a single arbitration system.  In any event, any system that would avoid competing claims as between one section and another, and avoid comparisons being made as between one category of State or semi-State employees and another, without due regard being made to the long-term needs of the community, would be welcome.</P>
    <P>We believe that the proper method is to approach the whole problem on the lines of a national policy for prices and income.  The Government appear to have some reluctance to do this but by implication they are engaged in some sort of discussions, on an ill-defined and apparently ill-laid down procedure, in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and perhaps other Ministers, in regard to State bodies, are approaching employers' organisations, on the one hand, and trade unions, on the other.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the problem which has arisen in regard to our trade <Col N="1107" /> returns.  The recent trade figures which have already been referred to this evening and which are up to 31st May, show that in the first five months, we imported goods to the value of £81½ million compared with £55.9 million in the previous year.  This indicates an adverse trade balance of £25½ million.  According to the Taoiseach's estimate for the current year, the full import excess may amount to £50 million, or even more.  The Government now propose certain restrictions on bank credit and on hire purchase. During the course of the general election, we advocated, on a reasonable and informed basis and after very full consideration, what we considered should be the appropriate role of the Central Bank.  Of course, certain Government spokesmen tried to create the impression that we had some ulterior motive in that approach. The change of events since the election indicates the wisdom of some sound approach on those lines.  The position that has arisen is that the commercial banks over-extended credit in the past 12 or 18 months, and indeed over-extended it in many cases for highly speculative operations, to some extent merely for stock exchange investments.  If the Central Bank did its job properly, this would not have happened.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Taoiseach announce this afternoon that the Central Bank is now in close consultation with the commercial banks.  It would appear, though, from a number of recent announcements, that it is on a day-to-day basis rather than on a firm basis which would ensure that some of the worst results of what has happened might be avoided.  The Central Bank is now doing what we suggested should have been done.  It may be that in some respects it has been done too late and on what can only be described as a day-to-day basis, although, in a matter of that sort, one realises that frequent and very often day-to-day consultation is necessary.  However, I use that description to indicate the lack of a well thought out policy and a planned approach to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> It is important to realise that up to very recently the Government regarded the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; as a word to be avoided.  Great emphasis was placed on the fact that their policy was laid down in a programme.  Personally, I could never see much difference between a plan and a programme, except that the Government wanted to create the impression that we were trying to plan everyone or plan their lives.  It is of considerable significance that the latest report of the National Industrial Economic Council is headed &ldquo;Report on Economic Planning&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; is used on a number of occasions during the course of that report and, with one possible exception previously, I think it is the first time that word has been used.</P>
    <P>One of the total failures in respect of the whole national economy has been the failure to regulate building. So far as the building industry is concerned, the National Building Advisory Council has been dormant.  It was set up with a great flourish a couple of years ago and the present Minister for Health presided over it.  Subsequently, it sent out a very complicated questionnaire to the building industry. That may have been the cause of the delay in getting a reply.  I understand from the Taoiseach that certain action will now be taken.</P>
    <P>One of the facts that emerge from the present restriction on credit is that while, as the Taoiseach mentioned and as the figures indicate, actual bank advances show an increase, as compared with this time last year, present housing costs are substantially higher than last year.  In some cases, they are up almost by one-third.  This increase in costs and in the prices of building means that substantially more money will be necessary to maintain existing output in the building industry, not to mention the expansion which it was hoped would be possible.  This restriction has in particular hit the private sector and it is the private sector that is responsible for the biggest end of the building and construction industry. Irrespective of what arguments have been adduced here, or what statements have been made, there is at the present moment what amounts to a virtual <Col N="1109" /> shutdown on loan applications by individuals who wish to get loans for house purchase.</P>
    <P>People are being diverted from building societies to the county council. The Dublin County Council area, including Dún Laoghaire, is responsible for about one-sixth of total house building in the private sector in this country.  There has been a restriction on certain aspects of county council activities up to recently by virtue of the restriction on the income level, the restriction on the ground price level and a variety of other restrictions.  At the present moment, there is a virtual shut-down on private loan applications, both by the building societies and by the county councils.  There ought to be some co-ordination and in this regard the Department of Finance and the other Departments concerned ought to co-ordinate the arrangements so as to ensure that the rate of building is allowed to continue.  Furthermore, people should be notified in advance of what they may expect and we should not have the situation which has occurred in which people had loan applications in, had agreements made with builders, had planned on the basis of a loan being granted and sanction forthcoming, only to find now that because of the situation which has developed, they are not able to proceed with it.  In fact, emphasis on this situation has been laid by this report of the National Industrial Economic Council where it urges that, in the public sector, all Departments of the Public Service and State enterprises must play their full part in the plan and that, if necessary, policies and administrative machinery must be realigned to this end.  There is ample room for co-ordination and unity of action in that regard.</P>
    <P>A position that has operated here for a very considerable time and, indeed, operated in Britain, is a recurrent situation in which stop-go policies operate and they have manifested themselves in our economy.  They were reflected in the past couple of years by unlimited credits from banks and finance institutions for highly <Col N="1110" /> speculative operations.  These have now been replaced by a widespread direction to bank managers to curtail their overdraft arrangements and indeed, in certain cases, there has been a refusal of private accommodation for productive investment in agriculture, industry and housing.  This certainly warrants the attention of the Government who appear to be entirely too complacent about the effects of credit restriction and the resultant consequences of such restriction on the economy, employment, production and exports.</P>
    <P>The House was glad to learn that the Government have decided to provide further incentives for export.  It is indeed not without interest to note that the incentives are entirely to be related to the British market.  We believe the incentives provided by the Finance Act, 1956, and which have often been described as the biggest technical factor in the rise in exports, led to considerable expansion and in fact resulted in the first major breakthrough so far as exports are concerned.  However, in view of the present situation, something further is wanted.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that it was this Party who first introduced the Capital Budget.  Some comment was made at the time: indeed, it was criticised.  It is now recognised as an essential part of our economic arrangements and our economic plan.  The serious position that has now developed is that while, up to recently, economic development proceeded on the basis of a certain rate of growth, the economic growth was not accompanied by anything like a comparable increase in employment and there was no stability in prices.  In order to be successful, an economic plan should achieve all three.  It is true that, in the early years of the First Programme, the existence of slack in the economy for productive capacity and in external demand permitted a certain success so far as the economy expanded but there was only a very relative success in respect of the increase in employment and stability of prices.  In recent years, what economic growth there has been was achieved at the expense of a comparable <Col N="1111" /> increase in employment and the position about prices has already been adverted to.</P>
    <P>We believe the Government have moved too late on the new arrangement for manpower and that real economic planning not merely means planning in the sense of a current or capital Budget but that it ought to be also a manpower policy&mdash;that the Government should forthwith initiate the fullest possible discussions with all sections in the community, the employers and the trade unions.  We believe that the haphazard approach which has characterised the Government's attitude in recent months is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The Government must realise that an incomes policy is necessary and that some arrangement should be worked out through which the co-operation and collaboration of the various sections in the community should be forthcoming and will be if they understand the consequences of the serious position outlined here this evening by the Taoiseach which emphasises the extraordinary failure of Government policy in recent weeks and months.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will recall that during the recent general election the Government had a slogan &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo;.  One now wonders where to and what for.  Price increases in recent months, the adverse trade balance, confusion in the building and construction industry, the drop in industrial production, the decline in exports, the serious situation in respect of the balance of payments, all indicate that the Government were either aware of the problem earlier and failed to disclose the facts to the country or were unaware of it and, consequently, incapable of taking effective action.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, in the course of discussions here on a number of major matters, we have indicated our grave concern at the effects of such measures on the national economy, particularly effects which, so far as one can read into the provisions of the Finance Bill, will not help the problems or fulfil the needs the Taoiseach adverted to here this afternoon.  One of the <Col N="1112" /> significant developments in recent months has been that the inflow of capital which has helped us to maintain our economy in recent years has not merely halted but that the trend is the other way.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Central Bank in one of its publications referred to the liquidity ratio.  A ratio of 30 per cent was regarded as the proper, sound basis but it was also indicated that it might fluctuate between 27 per cent and 33 per cent.  I understand that the recent figure has dropped to 19 per cent which, for this country, is an all-time low level and certainly emphasises the gravity of the situation. In the light of the fact that capital inflow has halted, that, in fact, the trend is the other way, surely it is unwise to discourage, as we propose to do in the Finance Bill, the advent to this country of persons of financial standing &mdash; to be blunt, people of wealth&mdash;people who bring wealth to the country to invest.</P>
    <P>Some invest in industry, some in land and other property, others in art treasures.  This is a benefit which this country did not have previously. It is not taking anything out of the pockets of anyone in the country and, provided there is no unjustified tax evasion, surely it is in the interests of the national economy to attract to this country people of wealth, leaving aside the people of technical know-how&mdash;people with financial resources which they are prepared to invest here.  Surely we should alter our tax structure in the matter of, say, death duties to attract people in that category, particularly in a situation in which we want additional capital and resources and not to employ or operate a tax system which will deter them or, worse still, cause some of those who have come here to transfer their domicile elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Surely there is a conflict between the Government's approach to this matter and the statements made this afternoon by the Taoiseach, the emphasis he laid on the serious situation that has arisen over our sterling resources and the consequent reaction of that on our whole economy.  Surely we should <Col N="1113" /> change our attitude and not merely operate what is a pale imitation of certain provisions in the British Finance Bill, now going through the House of Commons, which may well be suitable for their conditions but certainly have no relation to economic conditions here.</P>
    <P>During this Dáil session we have considered, besides the Finance Bill, the very important and intricate provisions of the Succession Bill.  That Bill, as originally introduced, would have had most undesirable consequences. It has been improved to a considerable extent by the amendments made and because of speeches during the Second and Committee Stages.  As a result of the remarks made by my colleagues and their detailed knowledge of it, the Bill has been improved with advantage to the nation generally.  Similarly, in the Finance Bill, I have noticed some improvements by way of amendments on Report Stage.  The changes have been made entirely as a result of close study and of tireless opposition to the parts of the legislation which we considered unsuitable or unnecessary for the country.  In both the Succession Bill and the Finance Bill, and, indeed, earlier on the Land Bill, Fine Gael alone provided the knowledge, the study, the analysis and the appreciation of the undesirable consequences that would have followed if the measures had been enacted in their original form.</P>
    <P>This is work of an important kind in the national interest which removes the debates from the sphere of merely political argument and emphasises the need for the constructive criticism we are making in the nation's interests. That contribution is being made on a very low budget as far as the provision of facilities for a secretariat and research for the Opposition are concerned. It is essential in a modern democracy if Parliament and parliamentary institutions are to function efficiently, to have the necessary facilities.  I have no doubt that we can give the same contribution in Government as we have given in Opposition and we await the call of the bugle when it blows.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's speech today certainly could not give any solace to Members of the House or to those in the country who will have an opportunity of hearing or reading what he said.  It is true that he gave us the bare, naked statistical facts which one cannot contradict.  He did not lay particular blame on people or sections for the difficulties we now find ourselves in.  He must take a share of the blame himself.  The Government have to take a big share of the blame. All these things have been contributing factors: the introduction of the turnover tax, the more than complacent attitude of the Government with regard to prices and their general attitude with regard to industry.</P>
      <P>I hate repeating myself.  I have on many occasions given credit to this Government for being generous in the assistance offered to industry but I and my Party have also said that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that necessary changes will be effected, not merely expected to be effected simply by saying that they will give this sort of assistance or that sort of assistance.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us what has been the response of Irish industry to the assistance that was offered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to subsidise industry in order to minimise the effect of the 15 per cent surcharge.</P>
      <P>When we were expecting to become a member of the European Economic Community, again, the Government announced certain forms of financial assistance by way of loan to industry in order that it might equip itself for free trade or, shall we say now, freer trade.  I do not think there was a very big response by Irish industry to what was done by way of legislation and what was offered by way of financial incentive.  The Government will have to get the idea out of their heads that an indication as to what industry should do is sufficient.  The Government must take a more active part in the development of industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has listed the difficulties <Col N="1115" /> in which we find ourselves at the present time: the balance of payments problem which has been known to us for a long time; the fall in industrial exports; and the recent fall in cattle exports.  All these symptoms have been apparent for a long time. Unemployment now runs at the same rate as last year, as the year before and the year before that.  There has been no improvement in the unemployment situation.  Again, as the Taoiseach has admitted here today, we have not maintained the rate of growth in industrial employment.  There is a reduction in net capital inflow and, again, of course we have the difficulty&mdash;what part of the difficulty it is, I do not know; it has not been defined&mdash;of the 15 per cent, now the reduced percentage, British surcharge. I do not know; I may be rather simple. The Taoiseach made a few speeches here in recent times.  He made one on 17th February.  If the House will bear with me, I will quote from Volume 214, column 586 of the Official Report, where the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>...I want to put the background of what has been achieved since the programme on economic expansion was initiated and the general outlook in the economic field for the coming year.  The country's economic progress is continuing.  Our national production in 1964 exceeded that of 1963 by 4.3 per cent in real terms.  This was in accord with our programmed rate of growth. Our agricultural output was up by between two and three per cent. The prospects for 1965, looking at them from this point of time, are that these rates of growth will be maintained in this year.  Our national income rose last year by £84 million or by 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Now, it is true that a large part of that growth in the national income was attributable to the higher rates of remuneration which became operative last year.  The position in this regard, so far as 1965 is concerned, is that the growth of national income in real terms will probably continue at about the same rate but what it may represent in <Col N="1116" /> money terms is almost impossible to predict at this stage.</P>
    <P>He then went on to demonstrate to us that the agricultural industry was in a healthy condition.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The retail traders, who feared the impact of the turnover tax on the volume of their business, are no doubt pleased that their experience has been otherwise.</P>
    <P>This was an optimistic speech.  This was a speech that forecast more progress in the year 1965.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, at columns 408-9, Volume 214, also made an optimistic speech.  This day two months ago the Budget was introduced and the Taoiseach said at column 1322, Volume 215:</P>
      <P>The forecasts for this year set out in the documents which have been made available to Deputies show continuous progress but, again, it must be emphasised that these are forecasts, not promises.  The Government will do all that is possible to make these forecasts come true but we will need the help of every organised element in our community and particularly the avoidance of courses which could operate to defeat us.  Given this help and given this co-operation, I hope that next year it will be possible for us to record another significant advance on every front of the national endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the change in the past two months.  The Taoiseach was optimistic in February.  I will not be as ungenerous as to say it was before a by-election.  It just happened to be the Vote on Account.  His Minister for Justice was optimistic in the same month.  This day two months ago, when the Budget was introduced, there was no real indication that after two months we would have what could be described as something like an emergency.  Let us not call it a crisis.  The Taoiseach had a duty to make the sort of speech he made today when he was talking on the <Col N="1117" /> Budget because the signs were there then on 13th May of this year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was pretty clever in his speech in that he did not apportion blame but there was an innuendo to the effect that there was something wrong with the productivity of the Irish worker.  He said that the increase in the productivity of the Irish worker was the smallest increase of practically any country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to unit labour costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Taoiseach also used a phrase that I just could not catch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said productivity, which had risen very satisfactorily last year, has fallen back again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  Can the Taoiseach say why that should happen?  Is there something wrong with the Irish worker?  Is it his fault? Did he decide that he was not going to work harder this year, that he could not produce more?  Many people are under the impression that productivity is the sole responsibility of the worker. It cannot be too often emphasised that the major responsibility is on industry, represented by management.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also talked about restraint in personal incomes.  I will talk about that later when I come on to the Prices Bill.  People are under a wrong impression and have an exaggerated notion as to what Irish workers have at the present time in terms of wages.  The average earnings &mdash;I use the word &ldquo;earnings&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;of an Irish worker, that is, excluding agriculture, are £13 10s. 0d. per week.  His average wage is £11 per week.  Of course, that can vary from £7 to £21 per week.  His average earnings are £13 10s. 0d. per week and this is money he gets by reason of the fact that he works over his stipulated hours per week, whether they are 42 hours or 45 hours.  I do not think an average wage of £11 a week could be regarded as exorbitant, especially when one has regard to the swift increase in the cost of living in the past 12 or 14 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> The Taoiseach talked about other measures he contemplated introducing. That was at the beginning of his speech.  He then went on to state what the Government had in mind to do. Again this is the sort of speech we should have had on the Budget.  The capital programme is to be reduced. There is to be a restriction on Government spending and an encouragement of savings.  There is to be a restriction on imports, and personal incomes, by some method or another, are to be restrained.  There is to be price control as outlined in this Bill. There are to be extra funds for export market research.  Then the Taoiseach has told us there are to be negotiations for a new trade agreement with Britain and, of course, there is the Buy Irish campaign.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of these things require legislation.  The Taoiseach did say it might be necessary to recall the Dáil during the recess to introduce and pass legislation in order to do certain things.  I would regard that as somewhat of an emergency.  I would not go so far as to say it was a crisis but it is peculiar that in what we expect to be the last week of this Dáil session, there should be this major speech by the Taoiseach.  I do not know when the Taoiseach decided to make this speech, but in all fairness to the House and particularly to those who wanted to speak, he should have issued a White Paper, or at least circulated his speech, 75 per cent of which he read.  It is not fair for the Taoiseach to come into the House in the last week of this session and present the Dáil and the country with the sort of situation he has described.</P>
    <P>I talked about the Government's responsibility in industry, and Deputy Cosgrave has referred to a report issued by the National Industrial Economic Council.  There seems to be a competition in planning in recent years.  We in the Labour Party make no secret of the fact that we have recommended economic planning over the years.  I should like to congratulate whoever produced this book and to say it goes a long way to meet our idea of planning because the First and Second Economic Expansion Programmes, <Col N="1119" /> as has been pointed out in this booklet, were a lot of words, merely setting the targets.  If the proposals in this booklet&mdash;I am sure the Taoiseach has read it &mdash; are implemented, it will go a tremendous way to solve even our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asks for co-operation and of course he can get assurances of co-operation by pious resolutions.  I say to him on behalf of the Labour Party that in order to get the country out of the dilemma it is in, we are prepared to co-operate.  I am sure the Fine Gael Party will do the same thing.  I am sure the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Employers' Federation, Muintir na Tíre, the National Farmers' Association, and other such bodies, are prepared to do the same thing.  However, pious resolutions are no good.  The National Industrial Economic Council have set out the methods by which we can have co-operation. Their very first sentence is one that should help us all and should help the Government and the Taoiseach in particular:</P>
    <P>If management and workers are not fully aware of the nature, aims and methods of economic planning effective action will not be taken to achieve the growth targets of the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach might know what the aims, methods and targets of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> are.  Deputy Cosgrave and all of us in the House might know them but until we get down to floor level, we will not make any advance.  The man working in the factory or in any business or industry and whose main interest is getting his £10, £11, £12 or £13 per week would be prepared to co-operate with management but management will not allow him to co-operate.  A contributory cause of any industrial unrest we have had in this country, not this year or last year but down through the years, is that workers and management meet one another only when there is going to be a row about wages, conditions of employment or hours of employment. From experience, I know that no boss would tolerate any suggestion from a <Col N="1120" /> worker.  Until the Government can help in that direction I do not think we can maintain the rate of growth we have had over the past few years or achieve the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>This excellent booklet describes how those objectives can be achieved and states why it should be done.  There are certain agencies in this State: the Irish Management Institute, the advisory service of the National Productivity Committee and other such bodies which are not used half enough.  I described the experience I had in my own constituency in the past six or seven months where the Irish Management Institute invited the workers through their trade unions and the employers through their association to a one-day seminar.  It did not start off so well because again there was the old antagonism between the boss and the worker, but by the time the afternoon came, each had a better appreciation of the other's problems.</P>
    <P>Workers are a vital part of any industry, but as long as they are used as robots, the best cannot be got out of them.  It is not sufficient in manual employment to use the hands of the worker.  He thinks as well about what he is doing and he may be able to suggest different methods in order to ensure that there will be greater production at a smaller cost.  However, most of what I have been saying is said in a much better manner in this report on economic planning by the National Industrial Economic Council. I put it to the Taoiseach that he should ensure that every single suggestion in this report is implemented because it is only by treating the worker and management as equal partners, not necessarily in regard to incomes, that we can achieve our objectives as far as industrial production is concerned.</P>
    <P>This booklet also deals with the responsibility of those who make decisions and set targets.  Governments in particular are too much inclined to say what should be done, without taking the necessary means to have it <Col N="1121" /> done.  That was my original criticism of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, that while it described the aims and said what the targets were, there were no suggestions in that document as to how they could be attained.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in the course of his speech today said that rising prices were a symptom, not a cause of our present difficulties&mdash;they were a contributory cause.  I do not think the dramatic rise in prices over the past 18 months can be played down as a symptom of our difficulties, and not their cause.  The House must acknowledge the concern of the Labour Party about prices over recent years, and particularly during the past 18 months. During the past 18 months, the new Minister for Industry and Commerce will remember how he was questioned since he became Minister and how his colleague, Deputy Lynch, was questioned about prices and how we tried to induce the Government to use even what they described as the limited machinery that was available to them.  We were sneered at and told it was not possible.  That was subscribed to by Fine Gael who said they did not believe in price control except in an emergency.  I presume when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael say we should have price control, it is an emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was coupled with something else.  During the past 18 months, it must have been abundantly clear to the Government that public feeling was high in regard to prices. Yet they did not appear to be concerned or to take any positive steps to halt, where they could, the increases in prices.  It is true that some items were investigated by the Prices Advisory Body, such commodities, important in themselves, as soaps, jams, and tinned foods.  The Government used the power they had to investigate and to prevent an increase in the price of bread and flour.  They prevented also, after an inquiry, an <Col N="1122" /> increase in the price of sugar.  The Taoiseach had merely to open his mouth at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis and the petrol companies decided they would not increase the price of petrol, which showed it could be done and which showed also that the Government were in favour of price control to some degree.  One of the criticisms, a legitimate criticism, of the Government was that they did not even attempt to create an atmosphere which would ensure that there would be no undue price increases.  They did not attempt to create a price consciousness, so much so that, as Deputy Cosgrave said, there has been a free-for-all over the past 18 months and people were encouraged in that free-for-all by the various statements made by Ministers of the Government.</P>
      <P>When the turnover tax was introduced, we were, of course, told that competition would ensure that price increases would not become excessive. This was the stock reply every time we raised this question.  One Minister&mdash;he was Minister for Justice at the time; he is now Minister for Agriculture&mdash; was so foolish as to say that, as a result of the introduction of the turnover tax, and the competition that would result, prices would be reduced. He was altogether wrong in that.  It was, of course, inevitable that price would increase following the introduction of the turnover tax and, in view of the fact that this tax was a budgetary proposal and was given the force of law, there was, I suppose, justification in a trader seeking to compensate himself for a tax he would have to collect and pass on to the Minister for Finance.  Being human &mdash; perhaps that is a bit too complimentary&mdash;they naturally put on a little extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual, too, after a wage round for prices to go up to compensate those who have to meet the increased wages.  Again, advantage was taken of that situation as it was taken in regard to other taxes, and particularly the turnover tax, to put on exorbitant increases.  This was generally recognised by everybody and it must have been recognised by the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Once again, they <Col N="1123" /> decided to let things go along and &ldquo;competition will ensure prices will not increase unduly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our concern today is not a newfound concern.  Just before the operation of the turnover tax, the late Deputy Norton on 23rd October, 1963, queried the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to possibly unjustified price increases following the introduction of the turnover tax.  The Minister replied&mdash;this may have been the first time &mdash;&ldquo;that competition would guard against that.&rdquo;  We were concerned once more in the month of December, 1963.  Deputy Kyne, on behalf of the Labour Party, moved this motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, in view of the many recent increases in the prices of essential foodstuffs and services, and in view of the fact that no satisfactory explanation of the necessity for such rises in prices is available either to Dáil Éireann or to the general public, the Government should without delay set up, under the Prices Act, 1958, machinery for the public investigation and, where necessary, control, of any such increases in the prices of essential goods and services.</P>
    <P>This motion was accepted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Surely, when he accepted a motion like that, he must have had in mind the fact that he was going to-take some action.  We had assurances by him at that time that there would be investigation.  He said he would be ruthless in that investigation and, if he found anybody increasing prices unduly or without justification, there would be prosecutions.  I wonder were there any prosecutions in the past 18 months?</P>
    <P>He also said he would make an order for the display of prices in relation to certain commodities in accordance with the power he has under the Prices Act of 1958.  He said&mdash;this is his phrase&mdash;he would not hesitate to take action.  He took very little action in the past 18 months.  He seems to have been operating in accordance <Col N="1124" /> with Government policy.  He talked about restrictive practices and collective price fixing.  Of course, this is the usual method of fixing prices, contrary to what the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Industry and Commerce believed&mdash;that competition would keep prices at a proper level or, perhaps, bring them down.  Certain traders do not operate like that; they collect together in the cities, provincial towns and villages and decide what the prices will be of this, that or the other commodity.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, over the past 18 months, the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not find one single case in which a trader, or traders, could be accused of collective price fixing.  Under the Prices Advisory Body, very few commodities were investigated.  In any case, even though the Minister accepted that motion, little or nothing was done as far as price control and the powers he had under the 1958 Act were concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government were warned by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in May, 1964.  The Congress called for effective machinery for price control. The Minister replied in volume 210, column 302 of the Official Report of 2nd June, 1964:</P>
    <P>... free competition provides the most effective means of controlling prices and ... statutory price control is effective and practicable only in times of commodity scarcity, or when rationing is in operation.</P>
    <P>On 27th May, 1964, at column 227 of volume 210 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach refused to state what Government policy was in regard to price control.  In the meantime prices continued, and are still continuing, to rise and, as described by the Taoiseach, the Consumer Price Index rose from 164 in mid-November, 1963, to 180 in mid-May, 1965.  There was an increase of 16 points, or ten per cent.  The Budget increases of this year will, I am told, mean an increase of 11 per cent since mid-November, 1963.</P>
    <P>The National Wage Agreement has <Col N="1125" /> been mentioned in this debate.  It was mentioned in the Taoiseach's speech today as it has been mentioned in many Ministerial speeches since the Agreement was entered into in January, 1964.  The Government have not been very consistent about this.  I read a speech delivered recently by the Minister for Health in which he bemoaned the fact that more than eight or nine per cent was given in the ninth round.  The Taoiseach, at least, was fairly clear when he spoke on 12th February, 1964, at column 862 of volume 207 of the Official Report.  He said eight to nine per cent would be enough but the balance of four per cent was &ldquo;worth paying for the sake of a national agreement&rdquo;, assuming, he said, that the four per cent growth rate in national resources would be reached.  Now, the four per cent growth rate has been reached and has been maintained since the National Wage Agreement.  Last year, it was 4.3 per cent.  The Taoiseach has also said that the growth rate would be maintained this year.  I shall not hold him responsible if it is not maintained. If things have happened since he made that statement, that is a different matter, but, in any case, on these two occasions he painted a very optimistic picture.  From what he said, it is apparent that the National Wage Agreement, which gave workers and salary earners an increase of 12 per cent, was fully justified.</P>
    <P>Industrial production in 1964 was up by 6½ per cent.  For the first quarter of this year, it was up by four per cent.  What will happen for the rest of the year is anybody's guess.  According to the Taoiseach, it will not increase for the remainder of the year.  The 12 per cent increase is blamed by public representatives, but not in public because workers have votes.  There is, too, a tremendous amount of criticism by unthinking and ignorant people to the effect that prices have gone up because workers got an increase.  That, of course, is a gross exaggeration.  We are the first to concede that the increase certainly has a bearing on the cost of living but let it be said here once more that it is responsible <Col N="1126" /> for between 25 and 30 per cent of the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>This important thing should be mentioned also, when people talk about productivity in industry.  There have been no increases in wages since the National Wage Agreement in manufacturing industries; there has been no change of hours and no change of conditions.  People are inclined to be stampeded when there is a strike and when they look in retrospect over the year, even the threat of a strike stands out in their minds more or less as a strike that actually happened.  I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of the last two strikes.  As far as the building strike is concerned it did not, as far as the building trade union movement was concerned, break the agreement. That was a demand for improved working hours and the employers knew about this before the actual agreement was made.  That reservation was made when the National Wage Agreement was being put before the Irish trade unions for ratification.</P>
    <P>People should appreciate the terms of the National Wage Agreement.  One of them was to the effect that in special cases wages could be reviewed and again, without mentioning any particular industries, I do not think it would be unreasonable for either side to expect that where a wage was unduly depressed, even within that period, the workers concerned would seek to improve their conditions.  I do not think it was expected that workers who, say, had £9, a week when this agreement was entered into would continue at £9, plus 12 per cent. These are status increases for lowly-paid workers and I think employers' organisations knew that this class of demand would be made even though the National Wage Agreement was in operation for that period.</P>
    <P>In any case, I think Deputy Cosgrave was right when he was talking about the status increases given by the Government. I do not know what the justification is.  The Minister for Justice at one time tried to justify an increase to judges on the plea that it was a <Col N="1127" /> status increase.  What it has meant in the Civil Service I do not know.  I do not say the Taoiseach is overpaid or underpaid.  Probably, with the recent increase, it is not such a bad salary. I shall not comment on the amount of work he has to do for it.  But the public are disturbed by reason of the huge&mdash;what appear to be huge&mdash; salaries certain of the civil servants have and I assume that in the past 12 or 18 months, increases have been given to people who have been described in recent newspaper issues as being in a very high income bracket, even within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The National Wage Agreement was made in good faith and on the assumption that there would be stability in prices for the 2½ years duration of the agreement.  It was a voluntary agreement, a voluntary wage restraint by the workers in consultation and agreement with the employers but it was not unreasonable for them to assume that steps would be taken, if not by those people who control prices, by the Government, to ensure stability of prices.</P>
    <P>Let me quote the Taoiseach as reported in volume 206, column 1216 of the Official Report.  He said, speaking of both parties to the agreement, that he found&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>...genuine concern in both parties to the agreement to fix the level of increases in this ninth round at a point which would bring the maximum benefit to workers in the form of improvement of their real earnings, in stability of prices, in the growth of employment and in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Of course that has not happened.  I know many people tend to exaggerate the increase in prices.  You meet people in the shopping centres who will tell you that the cost of living has gone up 50 per cent.  They believe it because so many things have gone up.  They have an exaggerated impression that prices have gone up by much more than is actually the case.  In any case, prices did not remain stable and that is the reason for the feeling of unrest there is among people at the present time.  Workers got 12 per cent; the cost <Col N="1128" /> of living has gone up by about 11 per cent and that is a big bite into the 12 per cent.  Again, on the understanding that this is to last for another 12 months, I think it would not be an unreasonable forecast to say that the cost of living will go up again and again and again until the tenth round is put into operation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should have an idea of the mind of the trade union movement in regard to the National Wage Agreement.  This was the first, let us say, experiment, and it worked reasonably well.  Where it did not work, these cases were absolutely exaggerated.  The Taoiseach himself, or Deputy Cosgrave, conceded today that by and large the National Wage Agreement was successful but there may be a different temper in the minds of the unions and their members when they contemplate another wage agreement. There will have to be some clause, some qualification in regard to prices. There is no doubt in my mind in that regard.  They will be reluctant to enter into a wage agreement where there is no firm assurance that prices will be controlled in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>There is no point in repeating what Deputy Cosgrave said and the figures and statistics he gave.  He described the increases of 40 per cent in clothing and six per cent in housing and the increases in drink and tobacco.  All these items have gone up and that affects ordinary people very considerably from day to day and week to week.  Therefore, this action by the Government is long overdue.  The Government have said what is being done.  I should like to know if it is intended to go back to, or over, any period and investigate prices that have been increased and which, in our opinion, have not been justifiably increased.</P>
    <P>I do not know in any piece of legislation, or in the Interpretation Act of, I think, 1937, of a definition of contract of service.  We want to know where we are going.  It is not defined in this Bill.  I do not see it clearly defined in the Social Welfare Act but everybody assumed it to mean wage or salary employment.  It is, however, defined, I found, after a long search, in <Col N="1129" /> a leaflet issued by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. Contract of service is pretty clearly defined there and to my mind, it means employment for wage or salary at hourly, weekly or monthly rates but I should like to settle in the minds of members of the Labour Party that it means in fact what I have just said&mdash; and that it is not, let us say, a wages standstill order.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach who was Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1958 introduced the Prices Bill which subsequently became an Act which he said would be pigeonholed until needed.  It was pigeonholed for a very long time.  Are we to assume that this piece of legislation will get the same treatment?  I assume from the remarks of the Taoiseach that it will not.  Perhaps he would also tell us if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not sufficient powers under the 1956 Act.  I think he has pretty extensive powers.  There were certain exclusions which, understandably, could be controlled only in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and, I think, some other Minister also.  Probably the machinery was too slow.  I was encouraged by the remark of the Taoiseach that it was intended to freeze prices, pending investigation, even though it is only permissive.  I think he should make a firmer declaration than he made to that effect.  If it is considered that the price of an article is excessive, the price should be immediately frozen at what it was on a certain date before the increase.</P>
    <P>I know that the Government must take the first step and make an Order to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to act.  I do not know if this is a cumbersome method or not.  I assume that in present circumstances there will be an all-embracing Order giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce all the powers he needs to investigate a case within the terms of this Act. Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce will, if he speaks on this measure, spell out the terms of it and say what exactly the various sections mean.  There is provision here <Col N="1130" /> to inquire into a service or services. Would the Minister for Industry and Commerce let us know whether these include hotel charges, haircuts, doctors' fees and so on?  We would like an example or definition of service or services.  The Taoiseach also mentioned that the Minister will have power to inquire into service work or works.  We would like a breakdown of that, and to have examples, and also with regard to the processes mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power to requisition information, records and documents. He will have to have this power if he is to make full inquiry into the prices of various commodities but we would like to know what kind of machinery he proposes.  I am not at all enthusiastic about the secret machinery which operates in the Department. The public will have to be assured that something is being done.  The Government will have to have public confidence in these investigations, no matter what the outcome of them may be, no matter whether there is a reduction in price or not.  Perhaps the Minister will also say if the prices advisory committees are now defunct and if these investigations will be carried out by officers of his Department.</P>
    <P>We believe that one of the important things in this whole business is that there should be a public inquiry and that there should be a report to the public on the findings of such inquiry.  The very inclusion of a suggestion of that kind in the Bill would be a deterrent to unscrupulous people and would prevent them from increasing prices unduly.  After all, wages and salaries are negotiated in public in the Labour Court.  The worker has to give evidence to show why he should get increased wages and in present circumstances, if somebody proposes to increase the price of a commodity, he should be required to justify that increase in public.</P>
    <P>Somebody may get up here and say that a Labour Court decision is not final, but, for the information of those who do not know a lot about it, it should be made clear that over 80 per <Col N="1131" /> cent of the Labour Court's recommendations are accepted by the workers and the employers.  That is a pretty high percentage and it shows that even though the Labour Court has no power to impose a decision, there is that great respect for the recommendations of the Labour Court.  The main point I wish to make is that if workers have to go to the Labour Court and justify their case for an increase and if employers have to go there and justify their reasons for a refusal, it is not unreasonable that those who seek an increase in prices should be required to go before a public tribunal and that the Minister should have the power and should be willing to make the report of that tribunal available to the public.</P>
    <P>I trust that the power in the Bill to freeze prices will be operated with respect to all price increases.  There should be an obligation on people to justify increases in prices and services. Perhaps the Minister will describe the internal machinery that will ensure that price increases will be known by his Department in the shortest possible time.  People can get away with the loot for months and months because others are too lazy to report it to anybody. Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when questions have been put down by Deputies asking about increases in prices, say, in the price of soap, says that he has got no complaint about the matter.  He has given that reply on several occasions. If he has no effective machinery to recognise price increases within a reasonable time, there should be an obligation on retailers and manufacturers to notify to him their intention to increase prices.</P>
    <P>We believe that the period of six months mentioned in the Bill is too short.  That may be a note of optimism on our part in regard to this whole business.  If the Government make an order which is to remain for six months empowering the Minister to inquire into the price of certain commodities, a period of a month or perhaps two months will have elapsed before that inquiry is completed so that if he makes an order, then it falls <Col N="1132" /> within the next four months.  The Minister could operate much better if the Government's order was for a period of 12 months and if the Minister had power to impose his own order for a period of 12 months.  If the Government had power to make an order for 12 months, it would give the Minister a longer period in which to operate it.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill empowering the Minister to ensure that weights will be specified so that price increases will not be disguised by a decrease in weight.  Would the Minister consider taking power to ensure that if a price increase is refused, the quality of the product will not suffer? I think it important that the Minister should specially consider that quality will be covered in the Bill.  I would also ask him to tell us if the exemptions in the 1958 Act with regard to transport, provision of water supplies and other matters will apply to Part III of this Bill.  We support the Bill and trust that it will be operated effectively and speedily and we are encouraged by the assurance of the Taoiseach that prices will be frozen before an investigation begins.</P>

      <P>This Bill which we are discussing in conjunction with the Estimate for the office of the Taoiseach must be considered not only in the light of its being a Bill to limit prices but also in the light of its being an instrument of wage restraint and price restraint.  It is worth while observing that the first announcement of the Bill was followed by a meeting between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This indicates that it is also sought to make the Bill an instrument of wage restraint.  In this I may be right or wrong but we have to look at this legislation in that context. There is no other way I can look at it. You cannot look at it otherwise, when you remember that in 1963 the Government circulated the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap.</i> If the Minister wants quotations from that publication, they are easily given.  There was also the desideratum that there would be no <Col N="1133" /> increase in prices and wages.  We saw what happened afterwards.  I propose to deal with this later.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated to us the figures in relation to the excess of imports over exports.  While he gave them in some detail, if one looks at the actual figures for the various months they indicate a dreadful trend. In 1964 the January import excess was £10.9 million.  In 1965 we were better, £9.98 million.  In February, where the import excess in 1964 was £8.7 million, this year it was £15.08 million.  You might not have minded that except this is the month in which you start to get the winter-fed cattle out to Britain, where they are kept in yards for a short time and then let out.  In March, 1964, the import excess was £12.33 million and in March this year it was £18.12 million.  In April, 1964, it was £14.32 million and in April this year it was £20.48 million.  In May last year, when the first of the grass-fed cattle were again moving out, it was £9.7 million and in May this year it was £17.84 million.  I am aware that, because of the good cattle prices at the &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; as we call it, in 1964 there were heavier sellings.</P>
      <P>The position is extremely serious and one in which nobody can be complacent.  It can be laid entirely at the Government's door.  Can one imagine a Government who in 1963 indicated this sort of situation in a lesser way and circulated a White Paper saying we must not increase wages and prices but, when there were two by-elections, intervened in the negotiations, produced a 12 per cent wage increase and won the two by-elections, now finding themselves&mdash; when the slight regulation they suggested in 1963 might have done the trick, where employment which had been buoyant so far would have continued and emigration would have decreased&mdash;with what was a molehill in 1963 becoming a mountain of their own making, a man-made financial mountain of trouble made by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House are right to criticise as volubly and as strongly as we can.  I remember in <Col N="1134" /> 1955 and 1956, when as a young Deputy I sat on the benches opposite, this sort of situation presenting itself. As Deputy Cosgrave said, we do not believe in hindering the national advancement for political purposes. On that occasion the walls of this House were nearly torn down by the Party now sitting in Government saying everything that happened was our fault.  What was the difference between 1955, 1956 and 1957 and now?  I want to quote from the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> of June, 1965, at page 5:</P>
    <P>Last year the terms of trade moved strongly in favour of Ireland. If they had not done so, the deficit</P>
    <P>&mdash;they are referring to the balance of payments deficit&mdash;</P>
    <P>would have been even more serious. It is obvious that the condition of the balance of payments provides no grounds for complacency.  At the same time, the very strong position of the country in regard to external assets may allow the deficit to be tolerated temporarily.</P>
    <P>If we must say something for the Government, let us say they are not tolerating it without trying to do something about it, even at this late hour.  But the difference between our situation then and their situation now, and the reason why we can validly say that the fault is all theirs, is quite simply that on that occasion the terms of trade were viciously against us and on this occasion the terms of trade are most satisfactory for them.</P>
    <P>Remember, on that occasion you had the then Deputy Childers, now Minister for Transport and Power, who was extremely keen to become Minister for Agriculture, coming in asking at times as many as ten questions a day about cattle prices.  As cattle prices went down and down&mdash; something over which we had no control but which was related to cattle prices in Britain&mdash;Deputy Childers kept asking these questions, depressing the price of cattle at fairs, caring not about the farmers or the national economy, but only for the job he wanted and eventually did not get. <Col N="1135" /> That is the sort of thing we had to put up with.  If in our contributions we are certain we will not in any way hinder the national development and effort, at the same time we will take the opportunity to rub the noses of those who rubbed our noses in the same sort of mess, which is of their making in this instance but in our case was of entirely different making.</P>
    <P>It is entirely impossible to control prices in times of inflation.  I have fairly good support for making that statement.  The support I have for that opinion is the Taoiseach, who spoke so volubly today about the Prices Bill. As Minister for Industry and Commerce, he introduced in 1957 the Bill which became in 1958 the principal Act.  I should like to quote from what he said on that occasion at column 119 of volume 164 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It is now certainly more generally realised, if not universally realised, that profits, whether the profits taken by manufacturers, importers or wholesale and retail distributors, are a very small part of prices and that systems of controlling profits have very little effect against powerful inflationary forces.  Deputies will be aware that I have been trying to get my view regarding the ineffectiveness of price controls in inflationary conditions understood generally and have been trying to destroy any lingering illusion that may be left that any system of control can prevent prices going up when costs are going up.  As I have now to come to the Dáil to recommend the enactment of this Prices Bill I want to make it clear that I have no desire, by advocating it to the House, to help in keeping alive any illusion that it is possible to devise a system of control which will prevent prices rising when costs are rising.</P>
    <P>He said a lot of other things in relation to profits.  He indicated that, in his view, profits in industry were, in fact, to provide the capital for expansion and were largely too low.  The best way of controlling profits was by competition. <Col N="1136" /> I do not know where we have gone since 1958.  I do not understand how somebody who took this line in 1958, when producing a very restricted Bill, one which related to the Suez crisis and to monopoly and cartel situations, can come in now and produce this instrument as a means of getting out of trouble he himself, and nobody else, created for political purposes.  If the terms of trade were against him, he could come into this House and say, without the slightest fear of opposition or contradiction, that we were in a national crisis that had been brought about by the world situation, that everything we had to sell went up in value last year and everything we had to buy either held its price or reduced by a minimal margin. It is the responsibility of the Government to do something in a situation like this, and if they do not do their job, they must take the blame for it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, in relation to the wage agreement negotiations in which the Taoiseach interfered, to note the eventual result as far as the worker was concerned.  It is also no harm to think what the position of an Opposition Deputy is when the Taoiseach, who is so politically unscrupulous, goes to a group of employers and trade union officials and says &ldquo;Settle&rdquo;. They, in the goodness of their heart, agree to settle.  The Taoiseach then goes to the by-elections.  Opposition Deputies when they go to by-elections cannot talk about wage increases.  They are a good thing at that time.</P>
    <P>We, on this side, feel, as was indicated by Deputy Cosgrave, that not only should there be a wages policy but there should be a prices policy and an incomes policy.  Even though you cannot get all the way with this, you can get a certain distance. Every step forward is a step in the right direction.  What were the results of this wage agreement for the wage earners?  Incidentally, I read the whole of this magazine on my way back from Limerick the other day where the Taoiseach and many others went for the opening of the new factories at Shannon.  The <i>Irish Banking Review</i> of June, 1965, tells us on page 4:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> In 1964 the average level of weekly earnings of industrial workers was about 12½ per cent higher than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>We know what caused that.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>When earnings are related to prices, it would appear that real earnings rose by 3.9 per cent, a rate roughly comparable with the growth of the national income.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sicken everybody with statistics.  Therefore, as they have been quoted before, I shall not quote them again.  We all know since the first day of 1965 what has been the increase in the Consumer Price Index.  This has been quoted across the House by Deputy Cosgrave and also by Deputy Corish and we all know that that 3.9 per cent has gone on the wind and that in fact if the employer's and employees' representatives at that time, in the ordinary way of negotiation, had not had two by-elections thrust upon them, this wage agreement would have been hammered out into something far more constructive.  An increase would have been given which would not have affected prices.  If it had affected prices, the period of the bargain could have been of short duration, and as the prices corrected themselves over a short period, this would have resulted in a real increase in wages for the workers.</P>
    <P>Will anybody here, whether an employee, an employer, a farmer, or a professional man disagree with me when I say that a worker with £10 or £11 per week and three or four children is in fact in dire need?  He is in worse condition now than he was before the ninth round, the 12 per cent increase.  That is bad particularly at a time when the terms of trade had gone in our favour.  It is a situation for which the blame must be apportioned to somebody.  As Deputy Corish has said, the trade unions have kept their word.  I do not blame the people who find themselves codded for political purposes in trying to correct that situation. I find no blame at all in my heart for those people who have tried to correct the situation but I find <Col N="1138" /> blame for those who manipulated it, in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, and many other progressive Parties all over Europe, have been activated by the success of France, as far as economic planning is concerned, over the past 20 years.  I am aware France got a huge injection of money from the World Bank, but it was wisely used.  I also know they changed their Governments in France as often as they raised their hat to a lady before de Gaulle succeeded in forming a Government.  They succeeded in expanding economically; yet here, after so many years of seeking, we find the nearest we have got to economic planning is a first booklet, largely written by the Secretary of the Department of Finance, who is extremely sound.  This is as far from fulminating as I am from flying to the moon.</P>
    <P>Mind you, the first thoughts with regard to economic planning came from Deputy Corish today, when he said that the next time the trade unions seek to make a wage agreement, they will want to talk about prices.  If they want to do that, they will also have to talk about incomes as well.  All this means that this problem will be talked about by people in a serious-minded way and it will be more difficult for anybody to do the sort of thing that was done before and which has caused the mess in which the Government have landed us.</P>
    <P>A Prices Bill on its own, without this wide approach to planning, prices and production, is of no value at all. I know it is quite impossible to produce the right price for every commodity. You have to take into account the services provided with the article, where it is sold, if the woman buying it takes her own basket with her, pays for it at the cash register and takes it away with her, whether the article is delivered to her door by a van, or whether it is sold in the area of production.  When you enter the food and drink trades, you come up against all sorts of services which are involved in those trades.  You find such a wide area of difference in the services that the Minister, as his predecessor was <Col N="1139" /> before him, is landed with something that will be put on the shelf.  It is a sort of holy bible to take down and read when you are feeling morose as the Taoiseach was today.  That is the way I feel about this.</P>
    <P>I am certain you cannot get the right price for any commodity, with a certain few exceptions.  We may, however, have a few sacrifices on the altar.  I remember the Minister for Finance, in his reply to the Budget speech, indicating that the price of whiskey had gone up by 4d. per glass in the past few years but that there was twice that increase by the trade. That is true, but it is also true that the then Minister for Justice increased the hours of service by 16 hours a week.  If you take an eight hour day, it means that one-third the entire staff would have to be provided maybe to sell more whiskey, maybe not.  Those are two little arithmetical sums that should agitate the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he wants to control the price of that commodity.  There are so many other examples that one could give and so many different situations that this Bill is just what the 1958 Act was.</P>
    <P>The Bill is something that has been produced to salve the Government's conscience before the people.  Mind you, it is a very good thing for them there are no newspapers.  If newspapers were available at the present time, the whole duplicity of the political situation would be exposed.  The Minister for Finance, the other day, in reply to me, when I asked if this was going to slow down the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> indicated that this Government last year spent approximately £10 million more than the figure indicated as capital expansion in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Every one of us here is fully aware of this phenomenon of Governments and county councils spending far more money than they get to spend.  This is not an unsophisticated Assembly and we all know why, but this has nothing to do with worthwhile expansion in the private enterprise spheres.</P>
    <P>We also know there are many items <Col N="1140" /> of below-the-line expenditure by the Government on the capital side that cannot be regarded as capital which will bring in returns in more jobs, in better profits, and in an expansion of the industrial, commercial and agricultural economy.  There are certain things which the Government must do. For instance, one instance of below-the-line expenditure on capital which it was right to put into the Capital Budget was the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  This cost £20 million over the past three or four years and its purpose is to ensure that our cattle still have access to the British market. It is right that people should pay for that over the next 20 or 30 years, but that does not mean that any farmer will get an extra £10.  He will get the same price he would have got if bovine tuberculosis had not exploded into those proportions.  That is something you cannot validly talk about as expanding the economy or making more jobs for the people.</P>
    <P>That is not really the point I wanted to make on the reply given to me by the Minister for Finance last week.  The point is that he did not answer the question.  We must not worry about Government expenditure when we have commercial expansion, expansion by private enterprise operators, expansion by public companies, by private companies, and by family concerns and farms, and the other places we all know so well.  That is the sort of expansion that gets us jobs but it is not an answer for the Minister for Finance to tell me the Government spent £10 million more on capital last year.  That may be true; I am sure it is true; but it is not an answer to this question about expansion.</P>
    <P>When the Minister gave me that answer, I think his desire was more or less to blame the industrialists, the traders, and the free enterprise people, because they had not expanded as much as the Government.  We got our answer today when the Taoiseach indicated that the banks had lent more this year than last, and he had to add the fact that the extra lending was to Government borrowing.  What does this mean?  It means that the cake <Col N="1141" /> from which these people who are the backbone of the community get their slice is smaller.  If the cake is smaller, their slice is still smaller.  In fact, if the Government take a larger slice of a smaller cake, it means there is even less for them.  This means that expansion in commerce, in industry and in farming has been, and will continue to be restricted.</P>
    <P>This is a deflationary period in the Irish economy.  It is a period in which we may expect to have less expansion than before.  The reason the Minister did not answer my question was that this will have an effect on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> There is no doubt that if the capital is not available to create the opportunity for new jobs, to produce goods for export, to fertilise the land so that it can be handled in a more constructive way, there must be a slowing down in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and it is no answer to say the Government spent £10 million more.</P>
    <P>There is also in this legislation before us today a flavour of people charging too much.  I remember the Minister for Finance at the time of the introduction of the turnover tax telling us that no trader was made to charge 2½ per cent on any commodity, that he could make his own price, that his duty to the Government was to pay the Revenue Commissioners 2½ per cent on all retail sales, with certain exceptions.  This meant that if he liked, he could charge nothing on a bottle of stout and everything on a bottle of beer, that he could charge nothing on a pound of butter and everything on a loaf of bread.  It was a free-for-all constructed by the Government, and publicly stated by the Minister for Finance to be a free-for-all.  Two years later, we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming in here in the position of a price fixer.  The suggestion was that prices did not matter, that we were on the up and up, that we were in an expanding economy and did not need to worry about lack of capital, that we did not need to worry about the balance of payments and that we were exceeding the targets set <Col N="1142" /> in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>&ldquo;She stoops to conquer,&rdquo; but Fianna Fáil in intervening in a wage agreement stooped pretty low.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of not reducing the interest rate.  I feel very strongly that not reducing the interest rate of the commercial banks to the ordinary businessman, to the ordinary industrialist and those who have to use commercial bank overdrafts to finance their business, is a public disgrace.  The Government have a preferential rate. They are like parish priests: they have a preferential rate, which is less than the rate paid by the ordinary operator. Why in the name of policy should a man who employs one man, five, ten, 50 or 100 men have to pay an extra one per cent for his overdraft accommodation?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that Britain was wrong in reducing this overdraft rate, because that indicated things were not so bad.  I think Britain was right to do so.  There is no point in belabouring people in the name of policy; there is no point in charging people more than you should in the name of policy.  The banks will play ball with the Government entirely and absolutely and I think the Government were wrong in not reducing the overdraft rate to the ordinary businessman or industrialist.  This can be laid, too, straight at the Taoiseach's door.  It is a disgrace that the ordinary businessman should have to pay too much for his overdraft.</P>
    <P>The next question is whether or not we have a real scarcity of capital.  One of the measures indicated by the Taoiseach today to cure this situation is that there is to be no over-expenditure on the capital side by the Government this year.  I do not know what that means.  I hope adequate provision was made for housing.  Housing takes a long time to culminate.  You may find that a scheme of housing takes three or four years on the draught board before it is finally built.  If local authority housing schemes have to wait until the following year because <Col N="1143" /> of a Government decision, we will have gross unemployment in certain areas, and a slowing down in housing. If we have a slowing down in housing, we will have more people in Griffith Barracks&mdash;more wives and families whose husbands are allowed to visit for one hour a day&mdash;and more people in Drogheda and Dundalk living four or five in a room.</P>
    <P>The people who are being rehoused in this city today are living five in a room.  I do not think members of Dublin Corporation will contradict that statement because two members told me that on the way back from Limerick the other day.  If we are to have a restriction of capital for this purpose, we will have a situation which will be so bad that, in my opinion, it will create an absolute furore.  It is interesting to note that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have introduced the Prices Bill today had it not been taken with the Taoiseach's Estimate.  The Minister last week did not know when I asked him whether prices were fair, excessive or insufficient. He assured me he did not know.</P>

      <P>This is a Wild West show.  The Taoiseach has assured us today that he will control first and investigate later.  He is like the gentleman in &ldquo;Have Gun Will Travel&rdquo;: he will shoot first and ask questions afterwards. Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce is seeking power to inquire, but the Taoiseach has indicated today that he will control first and investigate after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My belief is that anything that is reduced in price by control will, after investigation, be left at the lower <Col N="1144" /> price.  The Taoiseach has stated today, and there is no use in the Minister for Industry and Commerce being quizzical about it, that he will control first and investigate later.  It is a Wild West show.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass and I will take each other on on Committee Stage.  The situation is that the Taoiseach will control first.  He says if there are any prices that have been increased he will control at a lower price now and the job of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the instruction of the Government will then be to investigate.  My view is that any control put on will never be taken off.  I know the Taoiseach and how his mind works.  The Taoiseach will take a few examples and will control the prices.  Then he will take the Bill, just as in 1958, put in on the shelf and have everybody quivering in case there will be any other price controls by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he would retrospectively control.  That means that what I have said is correct.  He will fix a price at a lower level than that at which it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but not arbitrarily.  After investigation, there will be retrospection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Taoiseach said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he estimated that the balance of payments deficit this year might be in the order of £50 million or more.  It might interest the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach to know that it is over £50 million as it stands at <Col N="1145" /> the moment.  I am fully aware that the tourist season has only started and during July, August and September, there will be considerable invisible exports; but, at the same time, I cannot see how this will balance up to produce the sort of figure the Taoiseach has intimated.  Out of all this comes the fact that the position is just as bad as the Taoiseach says and it is of his own making.</P>
    <P>Is it then the remedy of the Government to put a curb on economic activity, on industrial activity and to slow down everything, while at the same time saying that things are not being slowed down?  If this is what is to be done, as surely as night follows day, there will be unemployment and emigration.  Things that are damped down in this fashion find it difficult to reactivate themselves.  The question is what have we done about it.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week as this situation became daily more evident what new steps he had in mind for the propagation of industry here.  He said that no new steps were in mind.  I am aware that grants and loans are available and that there is freedom from income tax for new exports.  I am also aware there is a ten per cent levy by Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take a too morose view of this, but, notwithstanding all that is said about them, when these levies are imposed, they very rarely are removed.  They are removed in name, because instead of them a tariff is placed.  We did that ourselves.  We put levies on in 1956-57.  We were succeeded by a Fianna Fáil Government. Fianna Fáil removed at least 90 per cent of them and replaced them by customs tariffs.  That is a situation which could arise with Britain.  It is one which would be a horror.  I can think of industries in this city which would be seriously affected.  Take the case of Guinness stout, for instance. Why should Guinness be brewed in Dublin under a levy of ten per cent, when it can be brewed as easily in Park Royal in London?</P>
    <P>We have to face this problem.  No new steps are indicated except one in relation to these levies, with a minor <Col N="1146" /> one indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce today to help industry to expand.  I would have thought that, if this crisis were as bad as it is, not only would there have been the restrictive measures, which have to be taken in certain instances, but there would have been at the same time a superhuman effort to produce new measures which would have compensated for further restriction and would have given industrialists the opportunity to employ more people.</P>
    <P>We did this in 1956 when things were bad.  We introduced for the first time freedom from income tax on export profits.  The Minister for Finance corrected me across the House a month ago when he said it was not true.  I have looked it up since and I admit he had a minor point in that it had been available for industrial exports from undeveloped areas.  They were minor at that time, but the first general freedom from income tax for new exports was given by us in a time of crisis.  It was voted against by Fianna Fáil as a measure that would not succeed.  But it is the one thing that is now keeping industry in this country on its feet.  It has attracted industrialists to this country. If you attract them to this country because they will get freedom from income tax for five or ten years rather than because they will get a very large grant and a large loan, they cannot shut up shop and go away because they come here on the incentive which is based on production within the country.  When we were faced with a crisis like this we also introduced for the first time grants for new building generally under the Industrial Grants Act 1956.  Again, Fianna Fáil voted against it.  When they got into power, however, they expanded it because they saw the number of applications for new factories.  I would have thought there would have been enough spark and enough soul left in the Fianna Fáil Party to do something major to make a breakthrough.  Are they really going to get down to the job and ask: &ldquo;Well, are we going forward, or backwards or are we going to stay where we are?&rdquo; Of course, <Col N="1147" /> their great selling line in elections is that they are the Party of stability. As far as I can see, they are no longer the Party of stability, they are the Party of immobility.  They cannot be moved forward, backwards or sideways, from the Taoiseach down to the newest member on the back bench.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what the National Industrial Economic Council have to say about our industrial employment. I quote from page 5, paragraph 2, of the booklet &ldquo;Comments on Department of Finance Review of Economic Progress in 1964 and Prospects for 1965&rdquo; issued last month:</P>
    <P>Total employment, however, does not seem to be rising at the rate envisaged in the second programme, mainly because of a more rapid decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture and a slower increase in employment in the services sector. The slower rate of increase in employment is not the result of a general labour shortage (though local shortages of particular skills are occurring); unemployment remains high and annual emigration has recently been about 25,000.</P>
    <P>They speak there of employment not rising in the services sector.  Let me look again at the figures for employment in the transportable goods industries sector which, again, was the subject of question by me to the Minister last week.  He must be getting a little bit fed up with me but as long as that does not become personal we will be happy.  The Minister agreed with me that, whereas for the first quarter of 1964 there had been an increase of 7.7 thousand in the numbers engaged in the transportable goods industries, in the same period this year the increase had been down to 2.2 thousand.  If you want further evidence of this&mdash;I do not want to be quoting statistics all night&mdash;the production of goods in that sector, which is the main sector, was down during the first quarter.  The Minister could say that the 10 per cent levy had something to do with this and I would agree with him but it had not got everything to do with it.  Apart from any balance of payments difficulties, apart from <Col N="1148" /> any price difficulties, and apart from any of the things we are talking about, we are slowing down.</P>
    <P>The rate of industrial growth which was meant to take up the slack in farm employment is not staying at the rate at which it would need to stay.  We do not need the Taoiseach or any politician to tell us this.  The National Industrial Economic Council are removed from any Party or policy and in paragraph 2 of their report they tell us that we are not doing well enough.  Mark you, the time you get to know a man is when he is in a tight corner.  It is well known that when you get a man, a company or a football team in a tight corner, then if there is good stuff in that man, in the company or in the football team out it comes and if not, they will go down.  Nothing has been produced today by the Government or the Taoiseach which will do anything for the country.  This is merely a stop-gap measure to get the unions to agree to wage restraint because we are going to have price control.  This is the man who in 1958 said it was not possible when he was introducing the principal Act.  Maybe he can sell that one; maybe he can sell refrigerators to the Eskimos.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I should like to join issue with the Taoiseach.  He says that the nation is consuming more without producing more to pay for it.  That is the sort of dictum you could expect from a Prime Minister in an economy where a lot of people owned Rolls Royces and ate caviare, but it is not the sort of statement you would expect in a country like this.  I do not believe that the people are eating too well, living too well, or consuming too much.  I do not think that the people are working too little.  Anywhere I go I see everybody working extremely hard because prices and the cost of living have risen to the extent that if we desire to maintain our standard of living we must work hard.  If the Government had faced up to the situation, it would be possible for the people who are working so hard to consume as much as they are consuming, to have as much as they have and to have as much fun and games as they desire and <Col N="1149" /> not have this economic crisis.  The people did not create it.  The people are working as hard as they know how. I know of no man in any good expanding business who is not working harder now than he did some years ago.  Yet the Taoiseach comes along and takes the restrictive, morose line that people are eating and consuming too much and driving too many large cars.  The people are not doing these things; they are working harder than they ever did and the only snag is that because of Government policy they are not getting paid enough in real money.</P>
    <P>There is something in what Deputy Corish said in relation to the matter of expecting a working man to impose wage restraint on himself when there is evidence of a considerable increase in emoluments for people in higher spheres.  I do not go for the reasoning that we should make every man a labourer; I do not go for the idea that if you give each labourer an increase of £1 a week you should give the county manager an increase of £1 a week also.  That is wrong.  There must be a grading of increases but the setup in the Civil Service and in local authorities at present has meant that there have been status increases which are quite extraordinary.  I want to be measured in the language I use and the most measured language I can use is to say that I find them quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Again, in the June issue of <i>The Irish Banking Review</i> you will find what amounts the Government had to disburse as a result of the ninth round.  I quote from page 5 of that journal:</P>
    <P>As a result of the Ninth Round and other pay adjustments, the remuneration in Government current expenditure rose from £55 million in 1963-64 to £71 million last year.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a lot of money.  I do not employ the figure of £16 million just because it sounds a big figure.  I am using it because, as I say, we are not an unsophisticated society and I am using it in the context of the <Col N="1150" /> sort of money the Government have to spend.  I think that it is too much. I do not think you can sell the idea of wage restraint to a small farmer in my constituency or to a fellow working on a farm or in an industry when these fantastic increases have been given over the past two years. Perhaps there is arbitration machinery and all sorts of methods of doing the job but I am not interested in that.  It is only right to say that the increases which we as members of local authorities have seen and the increses which we have seen, as members of the Dáil, in various documents, in relation to higher civil servants, prompted a question by Deputy Dick Barry a few weeks ago, the answer to which brought a reaction of horror all over the country.  It was felt that the Government were feathering their own nests and leaving the rest of the country to go to blazes.  We may as well face the fact that things have gone too far.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the question of borrowing from abroad.  France has a huge economy.  It went to the World Bank.  I have always felt that if you can operate money for any purpose at the proper rate of interest and employ it properly, you will make more money with it.  If you employ it improperly, you go broke. Sometimes, whether you employ it properly or improperly you go broke just the same.  Countries do not do it that way.  Countries do not have to indulge in the sort of risky operation a commercial operator might have to indulge in.  If there is money available from the World Bank, I think there is a case for this country so long as there is an economic plan to see that it is properly applied.</P>
    <P>In detail, we are the only Party in this Chamber who have produced ideas on an economic plan.  The Government have gone as far as a First Report booklet.  We are years ahead of them.  We have spent our life educating them, anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>And we have failed to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy O'Hara, has so succinctly put <Col N="1151" /> it, we have failed to do so.  It is quite sad that we normally have to do it from these benches.  Deputy O'Hara is quite right because if we had succeeded in making them understand the position, we would not be here today with the gloomy prospect of credit restriction, and so on.</P>
      <P>We are now in a time of restriction of capital investment and even in a time when we may have unemployment. We are in a period in which, though the terms of trade were for us, still we could not export enough, a period in which we are told we eat and drink too much, enjoy life too much and are not working enough.  I am glad the Taoiseach has now returned to the House.  This is all because we could not educate those people on the Government benches or sell them the idea of an economic plan.  Their first movement towards some sort of order, in the end, was interrupted by two by-elections. Then the Taoiseach produced a political solution.  Now that he has sown the wild wind, unfortunately he must, as we all must, reap the whirlwind.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House will do everything we can to bring back the economy to an even keel.  However, we have not the power the Government have.  Let us hope they have learned a lesson.  Sometimes, I begin to wonder if they ever will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amusing sometimes to listen to Fine Gael speakers talk about the economy of the country when we remember the state the economy was in on both occasions when they were the majority Party in Coalition Government.  However, I suppose they have to say something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With relation to the Prices (Amendment) Bill, the inquiry going on into the licensed trade at the moment can raise doubts as to the effectiveness of competition to bring about fair prices. I think this applies also in the motor trade in particular and probably in other trades.  It is clear that the associations in these trades, by recommending prices, have almost entirely succeeded in regulating a fixed price for all members of the trade.  It is my hope that this Prices Bill, by suggesting <Col N="1152" /> a maximum price, will not indicate to traders in all trades that this should be a fixed price and thereby, in some cases, bring about a rise.</P>
    <P>When we look at the other trades, however, such as the grocery trade and the drapery trade, I think an effective case could be made for resale price maintenance because here we see the large multiple groups, backed by tremendous financial reserves, able to buy in the largest possible bulk and at the lowest possible price, creating difficulties for other traders not in that advantageous position. The danger that would come out of this is that if a small group of such combines could get virtual control of their particular type of distribution, they then could form an association and effectively force prices very much higher than they are today.  If that situation ever came about&mdash;I hope it will not, and with various small traders co-operating and buying in bulk together, I do not think it will &mdash;then there is no doubt that a Prices Bill would be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>When I read this Bill, I think it must be in the Government's mind that, in order to get a proper workable agreement on a national basis with regard to wages, they must take upon themselves the power to control prices.  When the actuaries of the trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers get together to negotiate an increase in wages or a betterment in conditions they must be able to estimate the movement of prices during a period of time if this agreement is to have the effect they require.  There is no question in this Bill of wage freezes or anything of the kind but, with the tenth round of wage increases due next year, it is essential to have this legislation if we are to get national agreement such as was got in countries like Sweden where it has worked out most successfully.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the war, I served my time to the drapery trade. At that time, with very rare exceptions of goods that did not sell at all, the maximum price was in fact the minimum price.  I remember that, in this store, there was a cap for sale at 5/1d. Not very long after price control came <Col N="1153" /> off, this cap came down to 4/11d.  In this regard, therefore, I think it might have been wise if the Bill included provision for percentage profit as well as actual maximum price.  When we deal with prices only, and it becomes necessary for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to sanction an increase in price, the Government leave themselves open to political sniping by backbenchers who have not had regard to the national interest to try to put it across to the public that every increase in price is in fact the responsibility of the Government.  This, I do not think, would apply in respect of percentages.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a typical demonstration of the responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Party who have faced up to the problems involved in a measure of this kind in order to create an atmosphere in which a proper national wages agreement can effectively be negotiated. In any agreement made in this respect in the future, it will be known to the workers involved that the Government have the power, in the first instance, to stop prices from going up while an inquiry is being made into them and, secondly, to fix a fair maximum price in relation to conditions obtaining.  Regardless of any unfavourable comment that might be made by some employers who are getting away with it now, if there are any such employers, or of any unfavourable comment by backbenchers who try to get political advantage, the Government have gone ahead with this measure.  As I have said, a percentage mark-up might have been a better way to deal with many price fabrics.  This would be less costly to administer because the Revenue Commissioners would have all the available information from their inspectors.  It would be a better way of determining the maximum price of a great number of commodities.</P>
    <P>Section 22A, paragraph (b), reads, in relation to matters into which inquiry may be made:</P>
    <P>...require any person to furnish to the Minister any information in his possession that the Minister may <Col N="1154" /> reasonably require for enabling him to exercise his functions under this Part.</P>
    <P>I do not think &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; is required here.  We should plainly say that the Minister may get any information he may require.  Putting &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in sounds like an effort to soften the blow, which it does not. The word is repeated in the following paragraph.  Paragraph (d) deals with the maximum prices at which commodities may be sold.  I suggest that the maximum prices or percentage profit or mark-up should be included in this provision.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this when speaking on later Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said it is the Government's intention to control first and investigate afterwards.  He said it was like a Wild West show&mdash;Palladin in &ldquo;Have Gun, Will Travel&rdquo;: shoot first and ask questions afterwards.  Paragraph (e) of this section provides that the prices charged shall be those obtaining at such time before the making of the order or during such period before the making of the order as may be specified in the order.  In the event of a price rise being announced, the Minister may say: &ldquo;No, you cannot increase that price.  I shall investigate it.&rdquo;  In other words, there will be a pause in any upward movement of prices until the investigation is carried out.  That is as it should be.  The intention here is that anybody disposed to increase prices must justify his doing so.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of section 22 (b) specifies that the commodity to which an order relates shall be sold only in specified units of weight or measure. We have regulations whereby the measure for beer is a half-pint or a pint for bottled beer or stout.  A number of the more progressive hotels and lounge bars who cater for United States visitors, imported about a year ago an American beer very popular in America. The measure is not a pint or a half-pint but 14 fluid ounces, nearly threequarters of a pint.  The Revenue licans from displaying it for sale, permitting them to sell what they had in <Col N="1155" /> stock but stopping them from replacing it.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this.  If there were not a demand for this American beer, the publicans would not have stocked it.  If we are in business with tourists, we must have available in our stores and on the shelves of our bars the commodities the visitors require.</P>
    <P>Section 22B (3) states that the Minister may by order revoke or amend an order made by the Minister by virtue of this Part, including an order under this subsection.  This does away with the six months idea incorporated elsewhere in the Bill&mdash;prices fixed for a period of six months.  The Minister is taking power here to change that.  I hope it is a power he will not have to use very often.  I realise it is possibly necessary to insert it in cases of rises in import prices, in wages, rates or taxes.</P>
    <P>In the next section, there is no question of retrospection in relation to any of the provisions.  There is a stop provided, if the Minister should decide to investigate any activity in regard to prices.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's Estimate, it is generally agreed by all Parties, by workers' representatives and by employers, that agreement must be arrived at regarding wages, conditions of employment, including status and hours of work in trades and professions.  In this matter we should consider to what extent, if at all, capital gains should be taxed, or whether the yield from death duties justifies the deterrent they impose on the creation of wealth.  These questions go far beyond the social provisions of the Succession Bill or the Social Welfare Bill, which is due to be debated again tomorrow, because most socialist theorists are concerned mainly with the actual distribution of wealth, forgetting that it is vital, first of all, to create wealth so that there will be something worthwhile to distribute. That has been emphasised mainly in the United States where private enterprise has been allowed to grow to enormous proportions.  This has happened in England, through takeovers and, to some extent, here.  We should <Col N="1156" /> not be afraid of this when we realise that the standard of living for the worker in the United States is very much higher than it is here.  Therefore, workers' representatives should not be afraid to see wealth being created.  On the other hand, they should be sure, at the same time, that they get their fair proportion of that wealth.</P>
    <P>I know of employers who run their businesses for less net profit than they would get if they invested their money in shares and securities, reasonably safely, doing nothing.  Their motive in running a business is not the important thing.  Some of them may run their businesses for status and not so much for the money they can get out of it. Some of them are interested in the welfare of the nation.  Of course some of them hope to make a big profit some time or another.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reason, we should not by hasty action discourage people from running their own businesses.  I do not think we have ever done that and I do not think there is anything of which private enterprise should be afraid in this Bill.  What is important is that everybody connected with a business should get a fair share out of it.  If the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, on the one hand, have not sufficient control over their affiliated unions to enforce the National Wage Agreement, the Government had not got that control before they introduced the Prices Bill.  The Government are now taking that control and it is to be hoped that Congress will enforce any future wage agreement and enforce it in spirit as well as in detailed terms.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations that came into my mind and, no doubt, the Government considered them also. When the British Government imposed the 15 per cent levy, I wonder why we did not, having regard to the balance of payments problem, take similar action and now that the levy is ten per cent why we do not consider imposing a temporary ten per cent to last only so long as the British levy lasts.  I should like to know the reason why this is not considered desirable, our economy being linked <Col N="1157" /> so closely with that of Great Britain. For instance, if the pound sterling were to be devalued it would be essential for the Irish pound to be devalued also.  So, if the country that backs sterling finds itself in difficulties, these difficulties must also affect us to some degree.  I should like to know the main reasons why we do not follow suit in the imposition of such a levy.</P>
    <P>The pound sterling is not in the healthy position which we should like.  There is the danger that we may see devaluation before the year is out. With that in mind, if we cashed in some of our sterling investments for another currency or, as France did, for gold, would we weaken the currency to any great extent or to an extent that would affect a decision on devaluation or not?  If we sold these sterling assets for some other assets, without causing that situation, then if devaluation did take place, it would be the same as a profit to us.  I should like to hear the Government's thinking on that matter and also as to the desirability of keeping the bulk of our reserves in sterling.</P>
    <P>On the Taoiseach's Estimate, I should like to refer to something that I observed only very recently and therefore could not raise on the Estimate for Transport and Power or for the Office of Public Works.  A car ferry service has been introduced in Dún Laoghaire.  I have seen it operating. Full ships are coming in.  They have the desired effect on tourism. The investment is a good one.  As against that, all the car parking space, not only at the National Yacht Club, of which I am a member, but right down to the coal harbour has been taken away from the thousands of trippers who go out there on Sundays. There is no place to park cars.</P>

      <P>I observed this over the weekend and that is why I raised the matter.  I should like to conclude by assuring Deputy Donegan that things are not as black as he seems to think they are.  There has been a slowing down in Europe and in America in national growth.  I do not think there is any reason to fear that we will not reach our projected percentage increase in national wealth this year.  This Prices Bill is a very wise step, particularly at this stage, to create the proper atmosphere.  It is a wise step for the Government to take unto itself the necessary power to bring about a full understanding in relation to wages and prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in introducing his Estimate today, painted a rather gloomy picture, possibly a somewhat more gloomy picture than many people had anticipated.  It was generally known that the situation as regards exports in the first few months of this year was by no means a happy one and that imports had continued at an increasingly high rate.  The Taoiseach stressed the seriousness of the position and indicated that he anticipated that during the remainder of this year the adverse balance of payments would be around £50 million. It is correct to say that that is the situation.  It may also be correct <Col N="1159" /> to say that if the present trends continue the adverse balance of payments will be very considerably in excess of £50 million later in the year.</P>
      <P>Deputies, particularly those from rural areas, are aware that a difficult situation has arisen from the fall in the exports of cattle.  We have been told that at some stage that situation may be corrected because of the increased numbers of cattle on the land.  We are entitled to ask if there has been any effective increase in productivity on the agricultural side of the economy. It is fair to say that during the past year and in other years fairly substantial inducements have been given to agriculture to encourage improvement in productivity.  One wonders whether the improvement in productivity in agriculture, even up to the end of 1964, has proceeded at the rapid pace that has been experienced on the industrial side or whether there has been some dragging of feet on the part of people who have been given substantial inducements.</P>
      <P>It is correct to say that over a number of years the average farm income was fairly static but, last year, as a result of improvements in the price of cattle and other inducements the income increased by about 15 per cent. That was in one year alone.  Yet there has been a reduction in employment in the agricultural sector.  There is still the flight from the land which throws an increasing burden on the other side of the economy.  However, in dealing with the question of imports and exports and the degree of imbalance at the present time, I wonder are the Government free from blame.  It appears to us that July, 1965, is a little late for them to be examining the situation objectively.  The Government have been so many years in office and have so much advice available to them that they should not have been caught short in that serious way.  They should have realised the need for taking some protective action much earlier than towards the end of the Dáil session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few months, the Government have proceeded as if everything in the garden were rosy.  I do <Col N="1160" /> not know what they were hoping would happen.  They have a responsibility for estimating how the economy is proceeding.  In regard to the £16 millions worth of imports in the first five months of this year which has been mentioned by the Taoiseach, I think it is correct to point out that they were by no means all consumer goods.  Of that £16 million, £4 million represents capital investment in new aircraft: between £2 million and £3 million represents investment in machinery and that could possibly come under the heading of productive investment.  That leaves a fairly wide margin under the heading of consumer goods but protective action to remedy that situation or to prevent this deterioration should have been taken at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>Inherent in the discussion today appears to be some suggestion&mdash;I will not say by the Taoiseach&mdash;that an agreement negotiated between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers and other employers' bodies was responsible for everything that has happened economically.  Initially, I must correct the Deputies on the Fine Gael benches who give undue credit to the Taoiseach and the Government for what happened in November, 1963.  I will give the Taoiseach credit for taking full advantage of it in the by-election that followed because there is no doubt that at the time of the by-election in Cork, there was a general feeling in that constituency that the Government had presented the people with an increase of 12 per cent, and that resulted in support for the Government's nominee on that occasion. However, it is not correct to say, as was suggested by at least two speakers on the Fine Gael benches, that there was interference at the point of agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers and other employers' bodies.  In fact there was a breakdown in negotiations and the Taoiseach can take credit for suggesting at the time that both sides might come together again and continue the discussions.  Although there was a serious breakdown on that occasion, negotiations were resumed and agreement <Col N="1161" /> was reached on an increase of 12 per cent and certain other clauses. The fact today is that in many cases the 12 per cent increase has been almost completely eroded by the increase in the cost of living since that agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>The official index figure for May, 1965, shows an increase of ten per cent in excess of the figure obtaining at the end of 1963.  It is estimated that the figure has increased by a further one per cent.  However, if any Deputy should believe that an increase in the cost of living resulted from that agreement, he should examine the general basis on which the cost of living has increased since that time.  There was an increase of approximately one per cent in import prices.  There was an increase of approximately four per cent in the price of meat and potatoes, and no portion of that was caused by the 12 per cent increase granted to the workers.  That increase of four per cent&mdash;and at times the increase in price of these two commodities was much more but at the present it represents about four per cent&mdash;derived from increased prices obtained by the producers.  This Dáil of course imposed taxation to the extent of about two per cent.  Therefore, of the 11 per cent increase in the cost of living since 1963, seven per cent represents no portion of the 12 per cent wage adjustment.</P>
    <P>Profits, of course, did not remain stationary after the National Wage Agreement.  By no means.  In many cases prices were increased by the manufacturers before the negotiations on the wage agreement were concluded. Of the four per cent, 50 per cent has gone to profits.  The result is that the National Wage Agreement has been eaten away.  The Taoiseach was reasonably accurate when he said that, generally speaking, the terms of that agreement have been adhered to.  There are people who say that certain fringe benefits, certain anonymous adjustments, certain status claims sought and secured are outside the terms of the agreement.  Of course, that is not so and that has been made clear time and time again by the official spokesman of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> Our complaint from these benches and the complaint of the people generally throughout the country in connection with this matter is (a) the delay on the part of the Government in dealing with the situation and (b) their delay in bringing forward a Bill such as we have before us now, or something similar, at an earlier stage. It must be difficult, indeed, for the Taoiseach to come in here and introduce, together with his Estimate, a Prices Bill couched in the terms in which this Bill is couched remembering how often he and the spokesmen of his Party have indicated that they had no faith whatsoever in price control. Not only have they made that statement but one of the first acts of Fianna Fáil when they returned to office was to do away with the machinery for investigating prices thereby relieving these groups of any obligation to justify price increases.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, we had conciliation machinery and the Labour Court in operation, the court before which the trade unions representing the workers are morally required, though not compelled, to appear and make their case in public for an increase in wages.  The employers were in the happy position that they could fix prices to suit themselves behind closed doors.  The workers' representatives, seeking an increase in wages, had to make their case in public before the Labour Court and there justify, in public, an increase in wages for the workers.  Those who increased prices were under no such obligation for Fianna Fáil had removed the essential machinery.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that, when the turnover tax was introduced in the autumn of 1963, there was a public outcry.  The wage earners and the housewives were apalled at the introduction of this type of taxation.  It is well known to those who introduce this type of taxation that, once people become accustomed to the penal impost, once they become accustomed to having to pay more for everything they buy, they gradually become used to the idea.  It is like a dog with fleas; it is there; it is an irritant but they <Col N="1163" /> can do nothing about it.  Fianna Fáil relied on that psychological reaction. They knew the type of outcry that arises annually when local authorities increase rates.  They knew the kind of outcry there is at any suggestion of indirect taxation around about Budget Day.</P>
    <P>Our complaint is that Fianna Fáil imposed this taxation in the full knowledge of what they were doing and in the hope that it would gradually be accepted because the people could see no alternative.  They imposed this turnover tax in 1963. Although earlier in the year, as has been mentioned in the course of this debate, they were talking about a pay pause, they forgot about the pay pause later.  Had the Government been sincere, at the stage when the 12 per cent was granted as a result of negotiation, they would then have begun to think in terms of what they should do to secure the people against increases in prices.  They should not have delayed month after month until the benefit of the increase had been eaten away.</P>
    <P>The Government come in now seeking power to control prices.  We, in the Labour Party, support the Bill in its general terms.  We do not know, however, if the Government are really sincere in relation to this measure. There was machinery for the investigation of prices under the 1958 Act.  This Bill seeks to amend that Act.  I think that machinery was used on only three occasions.  Recently a question was asked in the House as to what had occurred in relation to an inquiry into the price of housebuilding by a certain builder.  It was indicated that the prices were considered reasonable.</P>
    <P>This is the point now at which I should like to challenge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce directly in regard to the sincerity of the Government in relation to price control machinery.  It was not the conclusion of the investigators that the prices charged were reasonable; rather the reverse.  The conclusion was that there was an excess charge of some £700, and only £350 of that <Col N="1164" /> could be justified.  The position remained therefore that the builder in question was charging £350 more than could be justified.  Yet, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that as far as he was concerned the prices charged to the people purchasing homes from that builder were reasonable.  That is why, while supporting the amendment of the 1958 Act, to give the Government power to bring in price control, I should like to suggest that if the Government are sincere in this matter, if their protestations are to mean anything more than publicity at this stage, provisions should be included in this Bill for public investigation.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that it would be proper to impose the control; in other words, that the industry, the company or manufacturer should be told: &ldquo;That is your price; you cannot increase it,&rdquo; and at that stage the Minister for Industry and Commerce should say: &ldquo;Having used the power to control your prices, now we also propose to have them investigated.&rdquo;  This investigation should be on a public basis.</P>
    <P>We know of two aspects of the question of price control.  One is that it is not possible to control the price of every article.  Everybody who has given thought to the matter is aware that if the price of raw materials which are being imported goes up, unless there has been a substantial increase in productivity or unless it is found that too much profit was being taken out of the sale of the goods, there is likely to be some passing-on of the increased prices. We know that in certain circumstances increases in wages rates where the labour content might represent a very high proportion of the cost of the finished product may require increases in prices but we hold that such things can be shown in all such cases by the manufacturer or trader concerned.</P>
    <P>We also know that it might be necessary, because of the trading position of a company, to keep certain information confidential.  In a country where we have the system of private enterprise and free competition which is <Col N="1165" /> supposed to produce a land of milk and honey, it is sometimes considered damaging to the manufacturer or person concerned if details of his operations are known to a competitor. We would agree that in certain circumstances certain information should be given on a confidential basis.  We know&mdash;in fact there is one at the present time&mdash;of investigations of wages claims from time to time in which the situation has been such that confidential information such as is contained in balance sheets, is made available to the court on a confidential basis.  Nevertheless there is a value, perhaps as a deterrent, in a public investigation of prices where there is a competent chairman and where there are representatives present to ensure that information will be brought out in public.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything those who wish to increase prices unjustifiably fear more than a public investigation.  They may be a bit nervous of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but they are more afraid that their particular activities may be exposed to the public gaze.  They are much more afraid that it might be shown that their proposal to increase the cost of an article is unjustified. They are equally afraid that it may be shown that the Minister's decision to impose control had been justified. Therefore, in this regard, I should like to stress the necessity for including such provisions.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made, completely unnecessarily, I think, to a wage agreement going hand in hand with price control.  I should like to be assured that this Bill does not mean&mdash; apparently it does not mean it&mdash; that there will be an attempt in any way to interfere with the normal collective negotiating machinery that already exists in the trade unions representing the workers and in the employers' organisations.  Negotiations on wage rates have been properly left between the organisations on both sides and any suggestion from one side or another that you can negotiate a wage rate and tie that in with the control of prices has been proved no longer to provide a satisfactory basis <Col N="1166" /> in countries like Sweden, Denmark and Holland.  In those countries where they have had certain national wage negotiations and have had them on what one might say is not only a contractual basis but almost on a legal basis for a number of years, that machinery in recent years has tended to disappear in favour of normal collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated certain methods to correct the prices situation. One of these is the use of price control and we, on these benches, support that proposal.  But it should not be just a part-time control of prices.  Surely it is in the interest of the ordinary citizen to ensure that prices do not increase unjustifiably at any time.  That is certainly true when many thousands of people have to live on quite low incomes.  To listen to some Deputies here and to people outside one would think that industrial workers are living in a land of milk and honey.  Industrial workers in the cities who are not skilled are earning about £11 per week.</P>
    <P>Can anyone tell me how an industrial worker with a gross wage of £10 16s. 0d. or £11 a week can provide for himself and his family, feed and clothe them and pay rent?  How does the agricultural worker manage to do the same on £7 or £8 a week?  These are the people in respect of whom it has now been found essential to introduce price control but it is our contention that price control machinery should be there and in operation all the time.  Many hundreds of thousands of our workers are living today on a very low wage level.</P>
    <P>When the national wage agreement was negotiated a very special and successful attempt was made to improve the position of the lower paid worker, the agricultural worker, the forestry worker and workers employed by local authorities.  Members of some of these local authorities sit in this House and they know the wages paid to people in their employment in another capacity.  In the national wage agreement there was a floor of £1 a week.  That was exactly double the best increase those workers had ever got before but they still need the <Col N="1167" /> protection of a Bill like this that should have been introduced long ago.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that the capital programme would have to be scrutinised and that we would have to ensure that only those projects that were of a productive character would be financed.  It is not quite clear whether he included in this capital for housing.  It is very difficult to ascertain from any member of the Government whether or not they consider house building to be productive.  On some occasions they take the view that it is productive and on others they say that it comes under the heading of social expenditure.  I would like to have this particular point clarified.  The situation of the people affected by the falling off in the building industry is difficult enough without the capital programme being held up.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to get some assurance from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the control of prices that he will say to the builders that there are to be no increases in prices and that he will exercise the powers that are now being given to him to investigate the increases that have taken place in that industry which are now causing severe hardship to many people.  This Bill gives the Minister authority which he did not have under the main Act and, as I understand it, if the Bill is passed all increases in prices can be controlled.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also indicated that among the steps to be taken as well as the control of prices and the import of goods there are also to be hire purchase regulations and he made the statement that the amount of the deposit would now be 15 per cent.  An investigation might also be made into the interest charges to those compelled to use hire purchase. Hire purchase now extends to every field of human activity and, as it extends, the interest charges appear to be growing all the time.  The Minister might make some investigation into that matter.</P>
    <P>We should get a little more explanation as to what the Taoiseach meant when he said that, in his view, personal <Col N="1168" /> incomes should not be permitted to increase.  That kind of statement is too broad for my liking.  It could indicate that the Taoiseach has in mind the introduction of wage control. As I said, this Government have permitted prices to rise and have made no attempt to deal with the situation. At this stage they have no basis whatever for interfering with normal wage negotiations.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to have it made clear that in relation to the Prices Bill, there is no intention of imposing a wages standstill order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass appears to be more ignorant of the realities of the situation than the Taoiseach.  Introducing his Estimate, the Taoiseach indicated that he was aware that under their constitution the Irish Congress of Trade Unions did not have authority to impose decisions on the constituent unions and their members.  Deputy Lemass did not appear to be clear on that matter.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are a policy-making body and depend on the support of their constituent unions to implement any decisions.  The unions individually take responsibility for their members and for their own domestic policy.</P>
    <P>I opened by saying that the Taoiseach had painted a very gloomy picture.  On any occasion this Government or any Government bring into this House a measure that can be shown to be to the benefit of the people as a whole, it will generally get the support of the Labour Party. Deputy Corish has indicated in general terms that the Labour Party are supporting this Bill, although with a number of reservations.  There are some things we believe should be in the Bill in order to protect the general public. We ask that these matters be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Unless this measure is meant to be utilised in the interest of the people, it is no use putting in on the Statute Book.  In so far as the 1958 Act was supposed to protect the public, it has been a tragic joke.  It has not served its purpose.  The Minister is aware that, because of the Bill's failure to accomplish anything of value, there is a resolution on the agenda of the Irish <Col N="1169" /> Congress of Trade Unions directing that their representatives be withdrawn from the prices advisory body set up under that Act.  The Minister has included in price control machinery for investigation.  Perhaps that resolution might be looked at again.  If anything is to be done in the present situation. if the confidence of the public is to be maintained, if any real attempt is to be made to prevent the position deteriorating, a very serious responsibility will rest on the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to how the powers outlined in this Bill are utilised.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that it is good to see the conversion of Fianna Fáil.  It is good to see the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if I may say so without offence, swallowing their words.  On many occasions and in many places both inside and outside this House, they repeated that the sole means of controlling prices was to let them find their own level on the basis of free competition.  Yet Deputies of their Party&mdash;and Deputy Lemass no later than this evening&mdash;have indicated that in certain trades free competition does not exist.  Free competition in the terms used by Fianna Fáil spokesmen has meant, as far as the public are concerned, that the cost of living has continued to increase steadily.  Now it appears that some attempt is being made to deal with unjustified increases. Where that attempt is a serious one, the Minister will get the support of this Party.  Where it is not a serious one, where it is only put on the Statute Book to be trotted out whenever a crisis appears to be looming, the Minister will get the unremitting criticism and opposition of this Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in a very excellent and constructive speech here this afternoon, showed considerable restraint in describing the Taoiseach's speech earlier as merely being a sombre one.  If one has regard to some recent utterances of the spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party, the story the Taoiseach had to tell this afternoon was a most appalling one indeed.  The Taoiseach can <Col N="1170" /> appeal for co-operation in facing national difficulties in the knowledge that from the Fine Gael Party and from the Fine Gael benches that kind of constructive co-operation will be forthcoming in the national interest. But that does not mean&mdash;and let us be quite clear about this&mdash;that we in the Fine Gael benches feel in any way obliged to gag ourselves.  It does not mean that we regard the Taoiseach or the Fianna Fáil Party as being insulated against criticism or against reminders about their conduct in similar circumstances in 1956.</P>
      <P>While everyone on these benches may be quite prepared to answer any appeal from any duly-elected Irish Government to help this nation overcome difficulties which blow up from time to time, either in the economic or any other field, it does not mean that by doing that, we are going to sacrifice either our principles or our duties as an Opposition in this House. The present economic position, in many ways, with all its unpleasant potentialities, is a judgement on the Fianna Fáil Party.  The chickens are coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will now find boomeranging on their own heads the type of political campaign which was mounted by them against the inter-Party Government when somewhat similar difficulties beset this country in 1956.  We are entitled to remember and we are entitled to ask Fianna Fáil to remember.  We are entitled to educate the new Fianna Fáil Deputies. We are entitled to ask the House to remember how Fianna Fáil made hay when the political sun shone for them in the year 1956.  We remember how the picture was presented then in this House, and outside, of a weak, vacillating, leaderless Government, just drifting along, doing nothing.  We remember how Fianna Fáil played politics at a time when patriotism on the Opposition benches was needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can remember how a political division was created in this country at a time, such as the present time, when a united national effort was required in the face of economic and financial difficulties.  Despite all the criticism we heard from Fianna Fáil in those <Col N="1171" /> days, despite all the talk about the then Government being weak and vacillating, the measures the Government took at that time, knowing that the measures were necessary then to preserve national solvency, were courageous measures and were measures such as any Irish political Party, either in Government or in Opposition in the particular situation in which we found ourselves, should have supported with pride and sticking out their chests.</P>
    <P>Did we get that kind of co-operation from Fianna Fáil in 1956?  Let them answer that question themselves.  As far as Fine Gael in Opposition are concerned, Fianna Fáil can be assured, and they knew before the Taoiseach got up here this afternoon, that Fine Gael will play their part constructively and with patriotic endeavour to see that the mess to which this country has been reduced will be remedied as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope this Government will be as successful as the Government which they criticised and derided in 1956.  I hope they will be as quickly successful in getting out of the present difficulties as that Government were at that time.  It is not necessary to remind the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the steps that were taken and the effect of the steps that were taken at that time.  It is unnecessary to give him the details of the criticism that was made at that time or the doubts thrown on the effectiveness of the work the Government were doing.  I just want to remind the Minister that the steps the Government took at that time remedied the situation.  It is on the records of this House from the mouth of the Taoiseach that the steps the then Government took remedied the situation.  There was handed over to a Fianna Fáil Government a ship of State that was on an even keel and going ahead.  The Fianna Fáil Party have gloried in that ever since.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, at every by-election and at every general election since they came back to office, have tried to use the bogey of the year 1956 to frighten the voters.  We were told 1956 was the black year.  We are <Col N="1172" /> now in the year 1965 and those of us who heard the speech of the Taoiseach this afternoon will realise that while it is necessary to preserve the confidence of the people of this country, not necessarily in the Government but in the country, it is also necessary that the Government and all of us in this House should be straight and honest with the people.  We should do what we can, if you like, in the spirit in which the Taoiseach spoke this afternoon, to put before the people of this country exactly what the difficulties are, exactly what effort is required on our part and on their part to overcome those difficulties.  We are not going to do that unless we are quite straight with the people of this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says it is wrong to describe the situation, as he calls it, as either a recession or a crisis.  At the same time as we heard the Taoiseach saying that in this House this afternoon, we have, as Deputy Larkin has rightly pointed out, a complete change of front, within a matter of weeks, in the Fianna Fáil Party and inside the ranks of the Government with regard to the question of prices.  We had, within the past few months, many Fianna Fáil speakers declaring their attitude with regard to questions of price control.  We have heard the Taoiseach himself, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Fianna Fáil spokesmen all saying, that so far as they and their Party were concerned, they did not believe in statutory price control.  They did not believe price control could be effective and they did not believe it should be operated except in emergency conditions. We either have emergency conditions now or we have not.  If we have emergency conditions, then the Taoiseach, or some Fianna Fáil Minister, should get up and explain that to the people.  They should not try any soft-soaping talk about its being all wrong to describe this as either a recession or a crisis.  The Taoiseach, in December of last year, before the then Dáil broke for the Christmas recess, had this to say with regard to price control&mdash;I am quoting from the Official Report of 16th December, 1964, columns 1307 and 1308:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> If we are talking about a general system of price control it would be a mockery, a delusion and a snare unless that control could also be exercised on the factors that bring those prices into being.  I do not believe that would be a good system. I have more experience in the exercise of price control than any other Deputy in this House and it is my belief that price control puts up prices because it can never be as effective as free competition.  That has been our experience and the experience of every other free enterprise country.  If ever a Government applies a system of widespread price control the cost of living will increase.</P>
    <P>It was just seven months ago that the Taoiseach solemnly made that declaration from the benches across the floor of this House.  He assured the Dáil that if ever a Government in a free enterprise economy were to introduce price control, the result would be increased prices.  What has happened to change the Taoiseach's mind since then?</P>
    <P>On another occasion just a couple of months ago, the Taoiseach addressed himself to the question of price control and, as reported in the Official Report of 13th May, 1965, at Column 1314 he said:</P>
    <P>General control of prices would be meaningless without the control of costs, including wages.</P>
    <P>Further down in the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>It would only be in abnormal circumstances, such as those that prevailed here during the war, or where the situation was clearly out of hand, that we would think of extending Government controls in this way even as a temporary device. Whatever the difficulties of trying to work out a coherent national policy or the danger of it being disrupted by irresponsible sectional action this is the method we must try to work to the end.  In our long-term reliance on individual commonsense and individual responsibilities I think we are likely to find a much more effective method of dealing with our national affairs <Col N="1174" /> than reliance on Government control, no matter how ruthlessly that might be enforced.</P>
    <P>In other words, here we have the Taoiseach a couple of months ago saying in effect that price control could be envisaged by him or his Government only where the situation was clearly out of hand.  I think I am entitled now to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Taoiseach to tell us has that situation been arrived at.  Are we in a situation which has gone completely out of hand?</P>
    <P>This year also Deputy de Valera, one of the most senior of the Fianna Fáil Deputies supporting the Government, gave his views on the question of price control.  As reported in the Official Report of 18th February, 1965, at Column 739 he said:</P>
    <P>I should like to ask, in all objectivity, the simple question why price control, which has been so much talked about by Parties in the past, has not been brought in and made effective by Governments. There must be a reason, and it is this: You cannot operate price control in an economy such as we have in common with the whole western world, except in war-time conditions or something like that.  During the war we had price control.  Then it was of necessity associated with something the Labour Party were very vocal about and of which the Opposition, as a whole, made a great deal of capital during the war, and particularly in the immediate post-war period, namely wage control.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy de Valera the answer to the query posed by Deputy Larkin is that you can only have price control if two conditions are fulfilled: (1) that you have emergency conditions; and (2) that it goes hand in hand with wage control.</P>
    <P>I could give many other quotations on the same lines but I do not think it necessary.  It is clearly apparent to all of us that within the past few weeks Government Ministers have changed their minds on this question, and have decided that price control <Col N="1175" /> should be operated, and that it should be operated more effectively than was possible under the Prices Act, 1958. Accordingly this Bill is introduced to amend that Act.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that this is a situation in which the most complete frankness on the part of the Government and everyone in this House is necessary.  In view of statements made by Fianna Fáil spokesmen and Ministers in order to emphasise the urgent necessity for the people to tackle the problem facing us, it is necessary for them now to tell the people frankly whether or not we are in the emergency conditions to which Fianna Fáil speakers have referred, or whether the Taoiseach was not being too naïve when he prefaced his speech today by telling us it would be wrong to describe the situation as a recession or crisis.</P>
    <P>At this time we are discussing not only the Prices Bill but also the Taoiseach's Estimate.  I do not want to go into the Prices Bill in any great detail.  I want to say quite frankly that, in view of the record which I have quoted of Fianna Fáil speakers in connection with the question of price control, I am a little suspicious as to how earnest and how serious they are in regard to this measure.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am not happy about any rigid system of price control for precisely the same reasons as were given in the quotations which I read out from the Taoiseach and other speakers.  Thirdly, even if they can be implemented &mdash; obviously something must be done and I am not faulting the Government for doing something because it is clear that something must be done to clear up the mess of their own making which originated in their unnecessary imposition of turnover tax&mdash;I wonder are the provisions contained in this Bill sufficiently effective.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in this amending Bill is, in effect, bringing in a quite simple amendment.  Whereas in the Prices Act, 1958, the machinery was inquiry and investigation by the Fair Trade Commission, we are now in addition giving authority to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to <Col N="1176" /> conduct his own inquiry and having conducted an inquiry, by order to fix prices and fix charges for services for one thing or another.  No indication is given as to what type of inquiry will be carried out.  For the public, whose confidence it is necessary to get, and in that regard the Taoiseach is quite right in what he said this afternoon, there is nothing in this amending legislation which is likely to inspire their confidence.</P>
    <P>If an inquiry behind closed doors &mdash;I concede, as Deputy Larkin conceded, that there are occasions when trade secrets are absolutely essential, about which the public know nothing, about which the Dáil knows nothing, about which even the trade knows nothing&mdash;is to be conducted by the Minister in whatever fashion he likes, and if as a result of that inquiry, about which no one knows anything except the Minister, the Minister is to make an order fixing prices, what kind of confidence will be inspired by that operation?  I simply leave the query with the Minister.  It does not seem to me that that kind of operation will be such as to be effective because I do not think it will inspire confidence. What is essential is that confidence should be inspired.</P>
    <P>So far as the general economic situation is concerned, I have said that I think the picture painted by the Taoiseach here this afternoon was an appalling one.  It immediately raises the question, in my mind anyhow and I am sure in the minds of several other Deputies, why we are only now being told about it.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach kicked off by a telecast which was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 19th March, 1965.  Was there any whisper about it to those who were listening to and looking at the Taoiseach in his television appearance?  According to this report, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> The tide in Ireland's affairs has reached the flood and we must sail out capably to new horizons.</P>
    <P>Then he paraphrased Shakespeare and said:</P>
    <P>The tide is with us now.  It is at the flood and we must not leave our ship of State in the harbour to people who don't know how to operate it and who would not know where to take it.</P>
    <P>That set the pattern for the general election.  &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on.  Do not leave the ship of State to people who will not know where to take it.&rdquo; I wonder did all the people who were so impressed by the Taoiseach's appearance on television on 18th March last, realise where the Taoiseach was going to sail the ship of State inside a very few months, that he was going to come here to the Dáil on 13th July and talk about the necessity to take timely action and talk about a £50 million unbalance in our trade figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 4th April, getting a little closer to the 13th July, 1965, the Taoiseach was still in the throes of a general election.  Was this situation building up then or was it not?  That is the question I want answered.  Because, on 4th April, according to the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> the Taoiseach had this to say to his listeners:</P>
      <P>The only prospect now in sight of future difficulty and of a slowing down of the momentum of the nation's advance would be a temporary interruption of Government leadership by reason of an interlude of ineffective minority Government which might survive for a few months at most and then only if they did nothing.  That is a danger the people can eliminate by the manner in which they use their votes next Wednesday.</P>

    <P>A few days before polling day, he was <Col N="1178" /> solemnly telling the Irish electorate that everything in the garden was lovely.  There was not a cloud on the horizon and &ldquo;the only prospect now in sight of future difficulty and of a slowing down of the momentum of the nation's advance&rdquo; would be if Fianna Fáil were not elected as a Government. There was no other difficulty on the horizon.  In the course of the same report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 4th April last, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>If the progress now going on can be maintained for another five years, not even a minority or coalition Government could then stop it.  This is the &ldquo;now or never&rdquo; stage of national economic development and on April 7th the people by majority will decide one way or the other.</P>
    <P>What did the people decide?  They heard the appeals.  They had the television appearance and they decided to let Lemass lead on.  Again, I ask where has Lemass led on, so far as the people of this country are concerned.  I regret the fact, as did the Taoiseach this afternoon, that we have not got our national newspapers to carry his statement for us in the morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and let the people see where Lemass has led on.  The Taoiseach did not give any hint of the difficulties now facing the country, which he tells us we are facing, when he was reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 25th March last as saying:</P>
      <P>Ireland is now entering a time of great opportunity and the issue in the general election is whether this is going to be fully used in a determined and consistent way or neglected.</P>
      <P>Of course he went back again to paint the picture of the black year of 1956. In the same report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of that day, he said:</P>
      <P>When Fine Gael was previously in Government, credit dried up.  All business enterprises in this country were subjected to credit restrictions, and thousands of workers lost their employment as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> Then he had this to say:</P>
    <P>No sensible person could want to see the country returned to these conditions, but this is what coalition Government means.</P>
    <P>Now the people find that is what &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo; meant&mdash;credit drying up and business being restricted.</P>
    <P>Either the present situation has come about overnight, which I doubt, and which any sensible person would doubt, or it was building up over the past few months.  Why were we not told about it?  It was not for want of warning.  I have heard Deputy Dillon and other speakers from these benches time and again warning the Taoiseach of the consequences of the turnover tax which was imposed by him. I have heard them warning the Taoiseach of exactly what has happened since.  Were any of those warnings heeded?  There is a saying of which all of us are aware to the effect that &ldquo;when the devil is sick, the devil a saint would be; when the devil is well, the devil a saint is he.&rdquo;  It reminds me of the actions of the Fianna Fáil Party when I contrast their performance in 1956 with their performance in 1965.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and every one of his Ministers were warned time and again that the course on which they embarked when they imposed the turnover tax was a daft one, that it was going to lead to inflation, to price instability and to an economic situation which possibly would require stern measures to remedy it.  Those warnings were not heeded until now when we have the Government deciding it is necessary to bring in a measure of price control.  Not only were those warnings not heeded but I remember well how speakers on these benches were scorned and scoffed at by Fianna Fáil speakers who told us we were preaching a gospel of gloom and despair.  All we wanted to do then was to get the Government to face up to the mischief they were doing and to take steps in time which would prevent the situation emerging which now has arisen.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Fianna Fáil Ministers <Col N="1180" /> are hard-hearted men, Therefore, I find it difficult to understand how they let this situation arise, knowing, as they must know, the heartbreak which it creates for the poor and the aged, for the elderly pensioner, or the person trying to live on a fixed income, perhaps an income from dividends, with no means of compensating himself by wage increases.  What must a ten per cent rise in the cost of living mean to those poor people or to those elderly people?  I do not think the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his colleagues are hard-hearted.  I would ask them why they did not pause when they were receiving the warnings they did receive from this side of the House and think of where they were going, where Lemass was leading on?  We have, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, advocated both a banking and a credit policy which if it were operated would bring a sense of reality regarding credit.  It amuses me to think of the terms in which the Taoiseach in particular derided the proposals we put forward in relation to a banking and credit policy.</P>
    <P>What were those proposals?  We pointed out that neither the Government nor the Central Bank have any control over domestic credit policy. We suggested that that situation should be altered.  We pointed out that in some countries the Central Bank was empowered by law to fix minimum reserve requirements and that the Irish Central Bank had no such power. We suggested an amendment of the Central Bank Act to give it that power.  We stated in our policy document that we propose an amendment to section 51 of the Central Bank Act which provides for the making of regulations requiring commercial banks to lodge with the Central Bank for clearance all cheques, bills and other negotiable instruments payable outside the State.  We also suggested that consideration should be given at the appropriate time to increasing the foreign securities other than sterling as a Legal Tender Note fund.</P>
    <P>Those, in short, were the proposals we put forward.  The Taoiseach commented on them the day after the Fine <Col N="1181" /> Gael policy document was published in the following terms, according to an <i>Irish Press</i> report of 20th March, 1965:</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael document on the powers of the Central Bank could have been written by any newly-fledged economics graduate without political sense or experience.  It is entirely theoretical and of no practical importance at this time.  No practical disadvantage has been experienced in regard to Ireland's economic progress by reason of serious deficiencies in the Central Bank's powers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to remember that phrase.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Some day, no doubt, it may be considered desirable to consider changes but, until they are seen to be necessary, interference with the country's banking structure and arrangements would be unwise and could be destructive of public confidence.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to remember what the proposals were and to remember that when he was out of office and seeking to get back to office in the atmosphere of 1956, when we were facing a somewhat similar situation, he gave his own views.  I think this was the speech in which he hoped to create 100,000 new jobs if he got back as a Government.  According to the <i>Irish Times</i> of 18th January, 1957, this was the Taoiseach's comment on the Central Bank and the power the Central Bank should get.</P>
    <P>The part which the Banks must play in the effort to National recovery is vital.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some foundation for the widespread belief that the managements of our Banks do not regard themselves as being under any special obligation in this regard.  It is essential that the banks should have regard to the requirements of National policy, as defined by the Government of the day, in granting or withholding credit.  To the extent that this is not so now, changes must be introduced that will make it so.  Decisions on <Col N="1182" /> credit policy should be taken at a higher level than the bank boards of directors.  The present powers of the Central Bank to control the operations of the commercial banks had not, so far as was known, been utilised and it was now fairly clear that its powers were inadequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass who wanted to lead on when in Opposition could express these views with regard to credit and to the position of the commercial banks and of the Central Bank, but as soon as the Fine Gael Party published a detailed comprehensive document dealing in part with these same topics, Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach feels it must be knocked on the head. We are told that no practical disadvantage has been experienced in regard to Ireland's economic progress by reason of serious dificiencies in the Central Bank's powers which he himself had said, some years earlier, were inadequate.  That was all right.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's first reaction to the suggestion of amending the Central Bank Act to enable the Government policy&mdash;whatever Government were in &mdash;to be taken into account by banks in the operation of credit, was to say: &ldquo;There is nothing to it.  It could have been written by any first year student of political economy&rdquo;, or words to that effect.  A few days later, though, it became evident that some of the boys must have been giving him a nudge in the ribs about it, that he was not strong enough, that this was something in regard to which he might be able to put Fine Gael in the wrong. Just five days later, on 25th March, according to the <i>Irish Times</i> report, the Taoiseach had this to say:</P>
    <P>Do you understand or will any Fine Gael candidate explain what Fine Gael mean when they talk about controlling the banks?  The banks are the custodians of the people's savings and their first duty is to keep these savings intact so as to enable them to pay them out to their depositors as they are demanded of them.</P>
    <P>But, a few years earlier, the same person, speaking through the same set of teeth and with the same tongue, was telling us that it is essential that <Col N="1183" /> the banks &ldquo;should have regard to the requirements of national policy, as defined by the Government of the day, in granting or withholding credit.  To the extent that that is not so now, changes must be introduced that will make it so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to ask where the Government stand on this important matter because one of the problems the ordinary people of the country are facing today is the fact that there is a credit squeeze which is pinching everyone in the country&mdash;to use the Taoiseach's description of 1956, when he was deriding it, the fact that credit has dried up and that business in the country will be affected.  This is an important matter. The Taoiseach and his Ministers are in Government.  The ball is at their feet.  If any changes are required they are in a position to make those changes.</P>
    <P>I have referred, as the Taoiseach did earlier today, to the question of the rise in prices which has necessitated this change of front by the Government in relation to price control, in relation to the general question of price instability.  Again, what kind of information have the Government at their disposal?  Only in May last, the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke on his Estimate in the House here and, as reported at column 827 of the Official Report of 6th May, 1965, this is what he had to say&mdash;just a couple of months ago:</P>
    <P>The Prices Section of my Department has kept the position under constant review and has taken the initiative when this was considered desirable, in the investigation of price increases.  I am satisfied that the work of that Section, when coupled with that of the Fair Trade Commission and aided by the vigilance of the consumer public, has resulted in stabilising prices to a not inconsiderable degree.</P>
    <P>A few months ago, the Minister, whose function it is to keep these matters under review, was assuring the House that prices had been stabilised to a not inconsiderable degree.  I do not know whether or not the Minister <Col N="1184" /> for Industry and Commerce got that information all on his own but, if he did not, perhaps he got it from the Minister for Justice who, on 16th February, 1965, as reported at columns 408-9 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>Everybody in the country, I believe, welcomed the National Agreement.  Any disadvantageous factors were bound to be reflected in the cost of living index in the initial months after the agreement was negotiated.  From now on&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this was in February, 1965&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;we should see benefits from that agreement which was honourably concluded between the employers and the trade unions.  In the coming 12 months, with stability on the wage and salary front and with industrial peace guaranteed, we should see also a stable price level and a stable cost of living index figure.</P>
    <P>Within a few months, the whole thing has turned turtle.  We had the Taoiseach coming in this afternoon to make the kind of speech he did make.  We have the Government introducing a prices control Bill, notwithstanding that several Government speakers have been arguing against this very step within the past few months.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House and I do not want to weary the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Taoiseach, but, again, I feel it is necessary to emphasise that if the Taoiseach is to be entitled to get the type of response for which he appealed this afternoon from the Dáil and from the people&mdash;and which we on these benches are willing to give in order to assist in solving the difficulties that exist&mdash;it is essential that he should give a very much more adequate explanation to the Dáil and to the country of the change of front that has taken place and the reasons for it.  He must be prepared to say whether or not the people are now facing the type of emergency which he and other Fianna Fáil speakers regard as the only justification for a prices control measure of this sort.  We in the Fine Gael Party, as Deputy Cosgrave has made quite clear, will certainly not be <Col N="1185" /> lacking, and the Government will not find us lacking, in playing our part to assist this country in a constructive and patriotic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the House this afternoon and heard the Taoiseach.  For a second, I did not know the man who was speaking over there.  I threw my mind back to 12 months ago when he got up, full of bombast and brass, and jeered at Deputy Dillon for what he called Deputy Dillon's gloomy speech because Deputy Dillon had told him what was coming.  The Taoiseach threw that down in his gamble for Cork and Kildare and did not give a damn about the country.  Now he is appealing to our patriotism.  He knows we have a love for our country.  But let us go back a little.</P>
      <P>We knew, when we were over there and Fianna Fáil occupied these benches, that there was no use in our appealing to their patriotism.  I sat over there on the bench behind where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is now sitting.  Deputy John A. Costello was in the Taoiseach's place. The conduct from these benches would not have gone on in the Congo.  It is all on record.  Deputy John A. Costello was allowed to speak only a line at a time.  We had Deputy Blaney leading the troops &mdash; Deputies Briscoe, O'Malley, Cunningham&mdash;and we had the pious Leader of Fianna Fáil saying: &ldquo;I have nothing at all to do with it, but it is lovely.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The difficulties being experienced then by the inter-Party Government were caused by outside events&mdash;the dumping of meat on the London market by the Argentinians and the Suez crisis.  They were the Government who held down prices.  That Government, led by Deputy J.A. Costello with leaders of the Labour Party, subsidised bread, butter and sugar and kept down prices.  They built houses and they did not bring in Votes for the purpose of building houses and then not build them or spend the money.  They built more houses than they had money to pay for.  Fianna Fáil said last year they would spend so many millions on housing.</P>

      <P>This was the policy of Fianna Fáil.  They told the people about 100,000 jobs which they never delivered.  And they are the great Party &mdash;great for deluding the Irish people. Nobody could recognise the Taoiseach of today as the man of those days.  He did one good thing today: he killed the Second Programme with one crack. We now have the first programme for economic contraction.</P>
      <P>The Programmes for Economic Expansion were just another of the Taoiseach's gimmicks.  When he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I remember hearing him for the first time addressing a chamber of commerce meeting.  Everybody clapped him and we had three years of him. When he got in in 1950, the country was to be the greatest in the world. All we needed were increased production and more co-operation.  That was another Lemass gimmick.  Everybody clapped like mad.  Then we had the Common Market.  Everybody knew everything about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Esmonde, and I attended a meeting at Clonmel and Deputy Esmonde said he did not believe Britain would get into the Common Market.  He was nearly torn to pieces.  He knew and we knew that the Common Market was just another Fianna Fáil smoke-screen.  What is happening now?  They are saying over there: &ldquo;Let us have the Prices Bill and let us adjourn the Dáil and we have a dead letter&rdquo;.  I agree with Deputy M.J. O'Higgins that the Taoiseach was not candid.  He did not tell us anything about the state of the <Col N="1187" /> country.  He said, not in so many words, that they had made a search on the Continent for money.  If we had said that when we were in office, we would have been told we were trying to put the country in pawn.</P>
    <P>It is not part of our policy to run down the country's credit or to try to undermine the loans Fianna Fáil will float in an effort to get the country back on its feet.  The Leader of my Party will rise to support any such loan.  He or any of his colleagues will not go down the country, stand up at dinners and attack the loans.  Fianna Fáil deserve and will get a little scourging to remind them that there is some decency in our Parliament here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to bring the Government to task particularly for the way they tackled the British on the question of the 15 per cent surcharge.  I have the facts before me.  The British Government went screaming like the Fianna Fáil Government are now screaming. They said they were in great difficulties and that they would have to reduce the deficit in their balance of payments.  The weak Ministers representing Dark Rosaleen went over to the leader of the British Labour Party, Mr. Wilson, and they let him get away with it because they had no background in politics or in business. We were one of the countries in respect of whom Britain could say they were in balance.  I have the figures here, given in the Official Report for 22nd June, 1965.  We imported £160 million from Britain and exported £129 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> We got no report from the Government deputation when they came back. Instead of being strong and firm and saying to the British that if they wanted to correct their balance, they could do so at the expense of the countries with which they were not in balance, all they said was: &ldquo;We want to be friends with you&rdquo;.  I suppose they had great difficulty in saying that. Of course what they should have said was: &ldquo;We want to do business with you.  As far as you are concerned, you are in balance with us.  You are the British Labour Party whom the Irish in Britain have been supporting during the past 70 years and there is no reason why you should do this to us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They just went over, came back and said they could not do anything more. Then we had the sweet talk of the Taoiseach.  I am grateful to Deputy Cluskey for the figures I am about to give.  He put down a question and the reply is in the Official Report for 22nd June last, at column 1114.  Deputy Cluskey had asked for the external assets of the associated banks at the end of 1963.  He was told that in January, 1964, the figure was £99 million.  Within a year, in January, 1965, they had sunk to £91 million and by May of 1965, the figure was £75 million&mdash;a watering down of the banks' external assets of £24 million in little more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14th July, 1965.</P>
