      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what final agreements, if any, were made following the discussions with members of the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question addressed to me in this House on 13th May last, I listed a number of concrete results which had stemmed from the discussions between Ministers and officials from both areas following my talks with Captain O'Neill.  There have been further developments since then.</P>
      <P>It was agreed at a discussion between the Minister for Health and the Northern Ireland Minister of Health and Social Services that arrangements would be made to obviate ambulance transfers at the Border and that the general question of cross-Border ambulance services would be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> It was agreed at a meeting last month between the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture that the two administrations would co-operate in any future drainage schemes involving cross-Border rivers.</P>
    <P>Meetings between officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Northern Ministry of Agriculture have been proceeding with the general aim of advancing co-operation in agricultural and fishery matters.</P>
    <P>A joint report on co-operation between the respective Public Record Offices has been submitted by the Deputy Keepers in Dublin and Belfast and is now under consideration.</P>
    <P>At a discussion between the Ministers for Education in July last there was a fruitful exchange of views and arrangements were made for further <Col N="3" /> discussion, at official level, on questions of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the most desirable outcome would be that discussions between the authorities of both areas and co-operation in the solution of practical problems of public concern would become such a well established practice that they would be regarded as usual and routine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why the number of registered unemployed persons has increased by over 1,500 compared with the position two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty) Michael Carty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons on the live register as at 12th November, 1965, exceeded by 1,510 the total number of persons so registered on 16th November, 1963. The excess is a net figure and is the result of increases recorded at 67 local offices of the Department of Social welfare and decreases recorded at 51 local offices.</P>
      <P>Identifying the causes of the changes which resulted in this increase would require a protracted investigation, the results of which would not be commensurate with the expense involved. It will however be possible to obtain a good deal of general information about the situation by comparing with the mid-November, 1963, figures the industrial analysis of the live register for mid-November, 1965, which the Central Statistics Office will publish early next month.</P>
      <P>Amongst the causes which can be readily identified as being operative on the dates in question were short-time working at a large motor-assembly undertaking in Cork and the closing of Castlecomer Collieries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what has been the net increase or decrease in employment since January 1960 in (a) manufacturing industry, (b) all transportable goods industries, <Col N="4" /> and (c) agriculture, forestry and fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Estimates of the total numbers of persons at work in various branches of economic activity are made in respect of the month of April of each year and the latest such estimates at present available are those for April 1964.</P>
      <P>Between April 1960 and April 1964 it is estimated that the numbers at work in manufacturing industry increased by 24,000 and in transportable goods industries by 25,000 while, over the same period, the numbers at work in agriculture, forestry and fishing are estimated to have decreased by 38,000.</P>
      <P>For more recent periods quarterly estimates are available of the numbers of persons engaged in concerns covered by the Census of Industrial Production. Between June 1964 and June 1965 it is estimated that the numbers of such persons in manufacturing industry increased by 1,600 and the same increase took place in respect of transportable goods industries.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the amount of sugar imported from (a) Britain and (b) other sources which was (i) re-exported from this country and (ii) retained for home use in this country in each of the years 1960 to 1964 and in the year 1965 to date.</P>

      <P>Data on re-exports relate only to commodities which are re-exported without having, within the country, either passed into substantial use or undergone a process which has altered their character, composition or value.  Goods which have undergone such a process are regarded as domestic exports.  Thus raw sugar imported and converted to refined sugar is classed on export as of Irish origin. The system of classification used for re-exports provides headings only for groups of related commodities and re-exports of sugar, if any, cannot be separately distinguished.  However, in all the years in question the total value of re-exports in the Sugar and Preparations group was small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the quantities of raw <Col N="7" /> and refined sugar imported in the period in question (a) from Britain and (b) from other sources.  Corresponding <Col N="8" /> data on exports are given in my reply to Question No. 7.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Arigna mine owners contracted to supply 45,000 tons a year to the ESB power station at Arigna, which was commissioned in October, 1958.  The station, which has been working at the highest practicable load factor, has, however, been absorbing 50,000 tons or more a year. Last year, production at the mines rose to over 70,000 tons compared with an average production of about 60,000 tons a year in former years.  I understand that the producers have experienced growing difficulties in disposing of the additional output commercially in competition with other fuels.</P>

It involved a detailed examination of the main river and principal tributaries and subtributaries <Col N="19" /> upstream of Carrick-on-Suir, taking of levels, cross sections and trial borings at frequent intervals, the examination of bridges, weirs, water supply and sewerage systems and farm and other property along the channels.</P>

      <P>On completion of the surveys design of a scheme will be undertaken.  Before any works can be put in hands, it will be necessary to comply with the requirements of the Arterial Drainage Act, namely: exhibition of the scheme locally, consideration of observations of interested parties, consultation with other Government Departments and submission of the scheme to the Minister for Finance for confirmation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether, in a case where a local authority refuse to increase the rents of their houses, to intends to withhold subsidy for future housing by that local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my Second Reading speech on the Housing Bill, 1965, on 8th July, last, in which I explained <Col N="22" /> fully the purpose of the provisions in section 44 of the Bill enabling the Minister to require, in connection with subsidy, certain conditions as to rents to be observed.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that there is no intention to withhold subsidy merely because a local authority refuses to increase rents.  The new power will be used to encourage housing authorities to adopt rational rent policies which relate rents to ability to pay and to the standard of accommodation provided, which ensure that poor persons are not denied rehousing because of inability to pay rent, and that building programmes designed to eliminate unfit and overcrowded conditions are not inhibited by unrealistic rent policies which entail undue burdens on the general body of ratepayers.</P>

He may not, however, obtain <Col N="28" /> such a licence to drive vehicles of an additional class during the currency of an existing licence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any indication as to when he hopes to make an amendment?  Could the Minister say why his Department has not replied to a letter from me in which I brought a particular case to the Department's notice a month ago of a student who has a motor car driving licence and who now is going to the university from Harold's Cross and is unable to go from his home in Donnybrook to the university on an auto-cycle his father has bought for him because of this restriction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why no specific reply might have been sent to the Deputy in the case quoted was due perhaps to the fact that, at the time of the receipt of the letter bringing this to our notice, we were already in the process of drafting amendments to the regulations.  In fact, this particular difficulty had already been evidenced elsewhere and had been under review and it was on the basis that that review was still continuing, I presume, the Deputy was not specifically informed of the situation.  In so far as the amending of the regulations is concerned and when we would hope they will be in operation, all I can say is we are nearing the end of the review and we are doing the best we can to get amending regulations out in the near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Would the Minister consider changing the regulation to deal with this particular type of case because the converse is also true?  I think the Minister will agree that if a person has a provisional licence to drive an auto-cycle he cannot, during the currency of that licence, change over to driving a motor car.  I think the Minister is aware that there is considerable hardship throughout the country as a result of this particular regulation.  Would the Minister try to expedite the amendment of this regulation?</P>

Special arrangements have also been made by the Dublin Health Authority for delivery of fuel without charge to certain classes of persons in whose cases non-delivery would cause hardship, such as disabled persons in receipt of home assistance.</P>

      <P>Increases of Garda widow's pensions are assessable for widow's, non-contributory, pension purposes in accordance with the rules as to the calculation of means embodied <Col N="34" /> in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>The widow to whom the Deputy refers applied for a pension in 1961 following the death of her husband in January, 1961, but her claim was rejected on the ground that her means at that time exceeded the statutory limit.  She reapplied for pension in April, 1965, and on the basis of yearly means of £119 12 2 consisting of Garda pension (£111) and the yearly value of capital, she was awarded a widow's, non-contributory, pension at the rate of 11/- a week from 9th April, 1965.  Her Garda pension was increased by £26 a year from 1st August, 1965 and on reassesment of her means accordingly she became entitled to a pension at the rate of 6/- a week from that date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that a number of members of the Defence Forces in Clonmel were informed by their officers that income tax would be deducted from their pay; and that such members had not at any time been required to complete income tax forms nor been warned that they were to be assessed for income tax; and if he will take immediate steps to investigate this matter and to ensure that no member of the Defence Forces has income tax deductions made without being given <Col N="40" /> the opportunity to complete forms for PAYE in the normal manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's functions with regard to income tax payable by members of Na Fórsaí Cosanta are to furnish pay returns to the Revenue Commissioners as soon as possible after the end of each financial year, to collect the assessed income tax within the financial year in which the assessments are received from the Commissioners, and to pay to the Commissioners the amounts so collected.</P>
      <P>In the preparation of the 1964-65 returns, it became apparent to my Department that many non-commissioned officers and men would be liable for income tax for the first time, or would have higher assessments than in previous years, because of the substantial pay increases granted early in 1965 with retrospective effect. Accordingly in May, 1965 and again in July when it was noticed that many non-commissioned officers and men had not paid attention to the previous intimation, all Commanding Officers were instructed to give their non-commissioned officers and men, from particulars supplied to them, an indication, of the amount of income tax for which they might be liable and to tell them that the Department would facilitate them in building up credits in their pay accounts towards payment of the tax when the assessments were received from the Revenue Commissioners. Income tax forms were sent, through their Commanding Officers, to all non-commissioned officers and men who appeared to be liable, with, on each form, a note of the individual's income from the Vote for Defence for the previous financial year.  I am informed that this procedure was followed in Clonmel as in all other posts.</P>

Does he not admit that this is a continuation of the system adopted by other Government Departments of waiting until a few weeks before Christmas and then starting to deduct income tax in large amounts and relieving these people of very necessary money around the Christmas period? It is a stupid practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main objects of this Bill, which I am now asking the House to approve in principle, are, firstly, to eliminate as far as possible the present cumbersome and time-consuming procedure of taking depositions in the preliminary investigation of indictable offences in the District Court; secondly, to provide that normally these preliminary proceedings will be heard without any press, radio or television publicity; and thirdly, to re-enact various enactments relating to the grant of bail.</P>
      <P>The most important provisions are those contained in Part II.  This Part sets out the new procedure to be observed on the preliminary examination of an indictable offence in the District Court and will bring about a most important and, in my opinion, long overdue reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies know, the present law is that before a person may be put on trial for an indictable offence, that is, an offence which under the Constitution he has a right to have tried by a judge and jury, a district justice must first of all conduct a preliminary investigation. At this investigation the evidence, which is taken on oath, is written <Col N="50" /> out by the district court clerk in longhand.  After the district justice has heard the prosecution witnesses and any witnesses that may be called by the accused and after he has considered any statement the accused himself may make on being cautioned, he decides whether the prosecution has established a sufficient case to justify putting the accused on trial.  It is important to emphasise that it is not the function of the district justice to resolve any conflict between the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution and that of any witnesses for the defence.  The preliminary investigation is in no sense a trial.  All the district justice has to see is whether the prosecution has established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the accused, in other words, whether there is enough evidence which, if it is not contradicted at the trial, a reasonably-minded jury could convict upon.</P>
    <P>Because of the limited scope of this preliminary investigation it is not usual for the accused person to disclose his defence at this stage or to bring forward any witnesses on his behalf but the present procedure does allow an accused person to do so if he considers that this may secure his discharge at that stage.  It is significant, however, that only about one per cent of persons arrested or summoned for indictable offences are discharged at this point of the proceedings.  Of course, not all indictable offences go through this procedure.  A number of them may be dealt with summarily if the accused consents and if the district justice considers that the offence in question is of a minor character.  And in cases where a plea of guilty is entered in the District Court, the justice has power to impose a sentence of up to twelve months imprisonment or a fine of £100 or both for any indictable offence except the most serious ones if he considers that the punishment he can impose is adequate and the Attorney General does not object.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of this Bill we were fortunate to have the benefit of the examination given to the existing procedure by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, which is under <Col N="51" /> the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Brian Walsh.  In their First Interim Report the Committee, by a majority, recommended that the principle of having a preliminary investigation should be retained, subject to certain modifications which were designed to avoid having any investigation at all where an adult accused so desired and in other cases to reduce the time taken in court under the present arrangements. The Majority Report therefore recommended that in certain cases a person could be sent forward for trial without the taking of depositions where that person, though not wishing to plead guilty, was satisfied to waive the preliminary investigation.  In other cases the evidence would be recorded by way of affidavit in the local State Solicitor's Office rather than by deposition and the accused would be served with copies of the affidavits together with particulars of the offences and a list of the prosecution witnesses.  The accused would have the right to require the prosecution to have the witnesses attend and make a deposition and be subject to cross-examination.  The prosecution would have a similar right in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minority Report, on the other hand, recommended the complete abolition of the preliminary investigation, with the provision of certain safeguards, and envisaged that the accused would be sent forward for trial without the intervention of any judicial person to examine whether or not there was a sufficient case for putting the accused on trial and that in lieu of depositions the accused would be served with a notice in writing specifying the persons it was proposed to call as witnesses and giving a statement of the evidence that was to be given by each of them.  The Report pointed out that such safeguards as were provided for the accused by the taking of depositions must now be looked at in the light of the fact that there are now other and sufficiently adequate safeguards which did not exist before 1924 and that circumstances have greatly changed since the present law, governing the existing procedure, was enacted over a hundred <Col N="52" /> years ago.  Since 1924, all criminal charges prosecuted upon indictment must be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney General and, again since 1924, an appeal has been provided against every conviction on indictment. Apart from these safeguards, the Minority Report suggested that the court, if given power to award costs to an accused person in a proper case, would act as a further safeguard against a person being placed on trial without sufficient evidence.  Finally, it made the point that in cases which are dealt with summarily there is no pretrial procedure, the person charged is not given any notice of the evidence proposed to be given against him, or of the witnesses to be called, though he is liable on conviction to be sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Part II represent a middle course between the views expressed in both Reports.  In particular, instead of abolishing the preliminary investigation altogether, it maintains the principle that no person should be committed for trial unless a district justice considers that the prosecution has established a sufficient case for doing so.  It proposes that the accused and the justice will be supplied with a copy of the charges, a list of the witnesses to be called by the prosecution at the trial, together with a statement of the evidence that is to be given by each of them and a list of the exhibits. The decision whether to return an accused person for trial will be taken on the basis of the justice's consideration of the documents and exhibits and of any statement the accused may make after caution.</P>
    <P>In addition, the prosecution and the accused will each be entitled to require the taking on sworn deposition of so much of the evidence of any witness, whether included in the supplied list of witnesses or not, as appears to the justice to be necessary to enable him to form an opinion as to whether there is a sufficient case to warrant sending the accused forward for trial.  The preliminary examination procedure may be waived altogether by the accused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> In my opinion, the new procedure provides ample safeguards to an accused person from his having to undergo a public trial unnecessarily. At the same time, it abolishes the existing slow and costly deposition procedure in all but exceptional cases. How slow and costly this procedure is can be illustrated from an estimate I have had made of the number of hours spent in taking depositions in the District Court during the year ended 30th September last.  It was no less than three thousand hours.  Allowing five hours a day, this represents over six hundred days.  Naturally the new procedure will not entirely eliminate these sittings but there will clearly be a considerable saving of time and expense and inconvenience to all concerned.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the accused, the new procedure offers considerable advantages.  In the first place, he will be presented with a complete statement of the charges and of the prosecution case before the commencement of the preliminary examination. This is something he has not got at present.  He is saved the distress involved in prolonged attendances during the taking of depositions when, as so often is the case, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that he is going to be sent forward for trial at the end of it all.  Finally, the case against him may not be published unless he so desires it and even there the district justice has a discretion to refuse his application for publication.  These advantages are additional to the advantage which he possesses under the existing procedure of being afforded an opportunity of hearing and knowing the evidence to be given against him, of testing the evidence and possibly breaking it down in cross-examination and of giving evidence himself which may possibly result in his being discharged.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again that here we are dealing simply with the question of whether or not a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established and it will be for the prosecution to establish that case clearly.  If the accused, by availing himself of the provisions in the Bill, <Col N="54" /> can show that they have not done so, he is fully entitled to be discharged even though it may be, in the future as it has been in the past, that he is in fact guilty of the offence charged.  Our law is still that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty and there can be no question of making any inroad into that fundamental principle.  Of course, that is not to say that the provisions which we are now proposing in replacement of the present procedure will not have to be tested in practice to see that they operate satisfactorily. They are no more immune to periodic review than any other legislation enacted by this House but from the reception the Bill has received and the comments and suggestions that have been made concerning it, I am confident that it will provide a very satisfactory replacement for the present procedure.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to say a word about the provisions which restrict the publication of the proceedings or evidence at the preliminary examination. This provision gives effect to the unanimous view of the Commission that publication of the evidence might frequently be the cause of injustice to an accused person and prejudice his fair trial as, in most cases, only the case for the prosecution is presented at that stage.  The Committee were evenly divided on whether the fact that the preliminary investigation had been held and the result of it should be published.  On this aspect the Bill comes down on the side, as I have said, of allowing such publication. Subsection (3) of section 16 allows publication of such information as the judge or justice before whom the proceedings are brought permits to be published at the request of the accused.</P>
    <P>This departs somewhat from the Committee's recommendation in that the Committee thought the accused should have an absolute right to have publication if he so requested.  My own view is that it might be better to allow the judge or justice discretion whether to agree to such a request by the accused and that this is a discretion which could safely be entrusted to them and would be exercised properly <Col N="55" /> and responsibly.  However, this is a matter on which there may be differing views and I shall be glad to give consideration to what any Deputies may have to suggest concerning it.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the provisions about publication, I should like to say how gratified I was to learn that our journalists individually and the Press as a whole are overwhelmingly in favour of non-publication of the preliminary proceedings for the same reason as the Committee, that is that on the whole the publication might be prejudicial to the fair trial of the accused.  Another feature is that as well as prohibiting publication of these proceedings the Bill is giving effect to the unanimous view of the Committee that there should be specific statutory recognition of the fact that the preliminary investigation is open to the public unless the court considers it desirable because of the nature or circumstances of the case or otherwise in the interests of justice to order that the investigation be held in private.  Some statutory provisions requiring the holding of proceedings <i>in camera</i>, such as incest cases and certain proceedings under the Official Secrets Act, 1963, are not affected but, subject to this, the power of excluding persons from the court does not apply to press representatives or to certain other persons such as parents or friends of an accused person, who under the present law have an absolute right to be present at these proceedings.</P>
    <P>There are two other provisions in Part II to which I should like to draw attention.  The first is section 11, which replaces section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, authorising the Attorney General to direct that a person be sent forward for trial where the district justice has refused informations under the present law.  The section transfers this function to the High Court.  The remaining section to which I wish to refer is section 18.  Subsection (1) of this section amends 1951, which enables certain indictable offences of a minor character to be section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, <Col N="56" /> tried summarily: it requires the consent of the Attorney General for the summary trial of an offence consisting of an assault with intent to commit felony, or on peace officers, etc. Subsection (2) amends the list of indictable offences which may be tried summarily by raising the monetary value of stolen property which may be dealt with summarily from £50 to £100 and adding a number of other offences which are detailed in paragraph 24 of the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 18 provides that free legal aid will not be available at the preliminary examination except in murder cases where, traditionally, such aid has been forthcoming. I am inclined to the view that such aid is requisite only where difficult questions of law may require to be argued and that any such arguments would be appropriate to the trial itself rather than to a preliminary examination. I am bearing in mind too the safeguards, the additional safeguards, which have been built in for the accused in the new procedure.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, although somewhat elaborate, does not seem to me to require detailed comment or explanation at this stage except, perhaps, in two respects.  One of these is, again, in ease of the accused and is contained in subsections (2) and (3) of section 21.  Subsection (2) extends to the whole country the existing power of the Dublin Metropolitan Justices to remand an offender on bail for longer than eight days if both the accused and the prosecutor consent.  Subsection (3) allows the District Court, if the accused and the prosecutor consent, to remand in custody for a period of more than eight days but not exceedings 30 days.  This provision will obviate the necessity for bringing the accused before the court at frequent intervals when there is no prospect of the prosecution being able to proceed with the preliminary examination. However, the present limit of eight days will continue to apply on the occasion of the first remand in custody, at which time it is reasonable to assume that the accused may not be in a position to appreciate the full implications of his situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> The other provision in Part III to which I should like to draw attention is that in subsection (5) of section 26 which allows evidence of previous convictions to be given on an application for bail where these convictions were for offences committed while on bail. It is well known that it is a practice among some professional criminals to commit further offences of the housebreaking or larceny type while on remand on the view that even if they are apprehended for these further offences the additional sentence, if any, which they may receive will be more than balanced by the monetary gain from the commission of the offences. In the interests of the accused it is provided that the judge or justice who hears evidence of previous convictions may not try the case subsequently and there is a provision prohibiting publication of any information about the convictions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I am presenting this Bill to the House as a non-controversial measure which will make a worthwhile reform in the administration of criminal justice in this country.  I hope that it will be acceptable to the House in principle and that it will be possible to improve it still further in the course of its passage through the Oireachtas. I have already received, as I have said, a number of very useful suggestions about the Bill and I want to say that all these suggestions and any that may be made here in this House will receive sympathetic consideration.  My aim, in this as in other matters connected with the practical business of administering justice, is to have a procedure which is as good as and, indeed, better than that obtaining in other countries; one which is fair to accused persons and to the public as a whole and which is recognised generally to be so.  Only in this way can we have any real foundation on which to inculcate a genuine respect for the law and the institutions established by it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will commend itself to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there has been so much talk <Col N="58" /> about and so much publicity attached to the question of law reform that one might be forgiven for thinking that it was a subject that came into being only with the advent of recent Fianna Fáil Governments.  In fact, the question of law reform has been there for a number of years and I am sure the Minister will concede that it was given very great impetus by the inter-Party Government under the leadership of Deputy John A. Costello.  I think the Minister has brought out the point I want to make in his introduction of the Bill, that is, that the process of law reform, certainly so far as statute law is concerned, is a process that is going on all the time.</P>
      <P>I believe this is the first practical measure of law reform that has been introduced, certainly in recent years. The Minister presents it as such and also as a non-controversial measure. He is quite right.  It is certainly a measure that is not likely to provoke any very great controversy.  There are a few matters which, possibly, should be examined more closely in Committee but the measure is a welcome one.  I welcome it particularly as a practical measure of law reform.  Our aim, in the sphere of law reform, should be an effective programme of law reform, not simply the condification and amalgamation of existing legislation, not merely weeding out of old unused dead wood out of our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that that kind of work is useful.  More than that, it is even valuable work.  A great deal of valuable work of that sort has been done but it will be largely a waste of time and a waste of effort, unless, side by side with it, law reform of the sort contained in this Bill here is proceeded with, unless the Government are prepared to undertake an active and energetic drive to speed up our entire legal machinery and to bring it up to date in order to keep pace with modern needs.  Any unnecessary delays&mdash;and any practising lawyer will be able to point to a number of them&mdash;should be eliminated.  It is a thing that obviously is going to take some time but that must be the target.  Certainly <Col N="59" /> outmoded practices and procedures ought not to be allowed to remain part of our legal system merely because they are traditional, or because it will take some effort to remove them.  Our aim must be an effective, efficient and speedy legal system, and while that must be the aim of any worthwhile programme of law reform, I think the Minister will agree with me that the principal consideration at all times must be to ensure that the scales of justice are held in even balance both as between individual litigants and as between the authorities and private individuals.</P>
    <P>When a Bill of this nature is introduced, which certainly will have the effect of bringing about greater efficiency in the courts and of speeding up the legal process, I think at the same time it must be put to the test as to whether or not there is any danger that it is going to operate unfairly or unjustly against particular individuals who may be accused of offences before our courts.  By and large, I do not think this Bill is likely to give rise to that danger.  The Minister has pointed out that the Majority Report of the Committee which reported on this subject was in favour of retaining the preliminary investigation system and that the Minority Report was against it.  The Minister has arrived at a reasonably good and pretty fair compromise as between the two extremes, those who take the view that there should be no preliminary investigation at all and those who take the view that the preliminary investigation should be retained in fairness to accused persons.</P>
    <P>The suggestions contained in this Bill are, as I say, a fairly good compromise between those two views.  I am a little unhappy at the thought that under the provisions of this Bill it will be possible in future for a person to be sent forward for trial merely by accusation without any sworn testimony against him.  That is certainly one of the matters I would urge on the Minister to consider further.  I agree that it is a matter that possibly should be considered more in Committee but <Col N="60" /> I would urge the Minister to consider the possibility of providing that the statements of evidence which he is providing in the Bill should be furnished to accused persons, should be in some way verified by the affidavit of the person who is to give evidence.</P>
    <P>Most lawyers will agree with me in the knowledge that people in this country have respect for an oath and it is quite conceivable&mdash;I think I am putting that fairly mildly&mdash;that when a person comes to make a statement of the evidence he is in a position to give, or of his recollection of a particular matter, very often he will make a statement quite fluently and will give what seems to be a very good and sound picture, but if he is asked to pause and then put it in the form of an affidavit, very often the picture painted will not be in quite the same strong colours as in the unsworn statement.  It seems to me that it will not be weakening in any way the provisions which the Minister hopes to have accepted in this Bill if he provides that the statement of evidence should be verified by a short affidavit from the person giving the evidence.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is something very much the same as, for example, the affidavit of an attesting witness at the foot of the form in conveyancing, that at the end of this statement of evidence, there might be a short affidavit whereby the person verifies that the statement of his evidence is correct and accurate and that that is briefly the evidence which he is in a position to give.  The Minister has mentioned that this system of taking depositions has been cumbersome, time-consuming and tedious and I think that is the general experience not only of the administrative officials, the court clerks and so on, but of legal practitioners who have come up against it.  It is of course a very ancient system; in this country it goes back only something like 120 years but in England it is a particularly ancient system.  Here we had it starting with the Indictable Offences Act, 1849, or thereabouts, but in England it goes back much further than that.</P>
    <P>The whole object of the system was <Col N="61" /> to ensure fair play for the accused person, to ensure that a person will not be put in jeopardy either as to his life or freedom without proper consideration. It is of course what might be described as an accusatory system which is not quite the same thing as the French system where a different type of examination is conducted with a view to testing out the evidence and then getting at the truth.  As the Minister has quite correctly pointed out, the system here is not for that purpose: it is simply to establish whether or not there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for sending a person forward for trial and putting him in jeopardy as to his freedom or, as the term used to be, in peril of his life.  I feel it is rather a too drastic and too radical a departure from the system we have had up to now to say that this can be done in future without any sworn testimony of any kind being presented to the District Justice.</P>
    <P>I am quite aware that under the provisions of the Bill it is open either to the accused person or to the State to seek to have sworn depositions taken but that is not an absolute right under the Bill as it is framed at the moment, because it depends entirely on the discretion of the District Justice and it is a discretion which can be operated as I read the Bill, only provided the District Justice is of opinion that it is necessary to enable him to form a proper view of the evidence and it is only if he comes to that conclusion that he is entitled to allow sworn depositions to be taken.  So I would urge the Minister between now and Committee Stage to consider the suggestion of having these statements verified by affidavit.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider the documents that are to be served. In section 5 this Bill provides that instead of the system of taking sworn depositions at the preliminary examination a statement of the charges to be made will be served on the accused person, that he will also be given a list of the witnesses who are to be called at the trial, a statement of the evidence which each of them will give and a list of exhibits, if any.  From a practical point of view my suggestion, as the practice grows out of this, may be <Col N="62" /> covered but I think we should ensure it will be covered.  It would be necessary in furnishing this information to an accused person that some essential minimum information regarding the witness should also be furnished.  For instance, it should be essential to furnish the accused with the age of the witness so that he will know whether the witness being produced against him is an infant, a young person or an adult.  It would be desirable also that the occupation of the witness should be furnished and if the witness is related to a person who is in the position, if you like, of complainant, that information should also be furnished to the accused.  That would probably be done in practice because in the ordinary way the statement taken would probably say: &ldquo;I am so and so of such and such a place and my occupation is such and such.&rdquo; But I think some steps should be taken by the Minister to ensure that kind of information would be given.</P>
    <P>Another point occurred to me which is also more of a Committee point but if the Minister looks at it now it may save me putting down an amendment on Committee.  Section 14 provides roughly for the kind of case where a witness has not made himself available to the State Solicitor to give evidence and it is necessary to make application to the court to provide that his evidence will be taken.  In that event the evidence will be taken in private under section 14 by the district justice or the court clerk. Section 14 (5) provides that a copy of the statement shall be supplied to the Attorney General.  I think it is abundantly clear that what the Minister intends is that a copy of the statement will be available both to the accused person and to the Attorney General.  That might be made clear by means of an amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to prolong the debate.  I am glad that we have in the Bill a practical measure of law reform rather than simply a codification measure and I hope that the Committee examining these questions of court procedures&mdash;I know they have since reported to the Minister in regard to jury service and jurors&mdash;will take <Col N="63" /> a broad and deep look at the whole question of legal machinery here.  It is within their terms of reference to do that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say particularly to the Minister who is, or was, a practising lawyer himself, that it would be a very grave mistake, notwithstanding the fact that this Committee is in being, if he neglected to consult the governing bodies of the legal professions when he introduces Bills which effect reform, if you like, but effect changes anyhow in legal practices and procedure.  I should like him to give &mdash;I am sure he will&mdash;the fullest assurances to the House that, first, he has consulted with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council in regard to this measure and, secondly, that he will consult them in relation to future measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure from which I assume the Minister got some of his inspiration was well worth while. I think he said himself, and Deputy O'Higgins said, that the Minister has taken ideas from both the majority and minority reports and in our opinion he has come up with a reasonably good piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>The general object of the Bill, in the Minister's words, is to simplify and expedite the preliminary investigation of indictable offences.  It is desirable in these preliminary investigations to expedite the whole procedure, but I have often thought in respect of ordinary cases heard in the district court that they are heard too quickly, to such an extent that witnesses were prevented&mdash;not deliberately&mdash; from giving evidence which they themselves thought was valuable.  In some of our district courts we get machinelike justice and if the Minister could try to ensure by whatever methods he can employ what in my opinion would be fairer hearings whereby witnesses who want to give more evidence which they consider valuable will be enabled to do so, he would be improving the position further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not absolutely relevant but there is another criticism I make of <Col N="64" /> district court hearings.  The acoustics seem to be pretty awful.  It is important that the public should know what is going on and I believe that the public in many district courts do not know what goes on.  That may not be the fault of the justices, the witnesses or solicitors who appear in the courts but in the cause of justice and of justice appearing to be done every person who attends, either as a spectator or otherwise, should be able to hear quite clearly all the evidence and particularly the judgment.  For the sake of the preservation of the good name our courts undoubtedly have it would be well worth while introducing some amplification system.  That is not entirely relevant to this legislation.  We welcome the Bill in that it appears to us it will simplify and expedite preliminary investigation of indictable offences.</P>
    <P>The position as described to us by the Minister is certainly cumbersome and time-wasting and that has been recognised by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and they have made certain recommendations.  It is significant that at present evidence is taken down in longhand and I am not quite clear whether or not this evidence at the preliminary investigation must still be taken down in longhand.  I cannot understand why.  Perhaps the Minister will explain to the layman why it is still necessary to take down evidence in longhand.  What is the objection to taking and transcribing shorthand notes or having the evidence taken on a recording machine?  There may be some reason known to the Minister, Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Ryan but I cannot understand why, in 1965, evidence should still have to be taken down in longhand.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the procedure for the preliminary investigation. The Majority Report of the Committee made four recommendations with a view to improving the procedure by changing it.  The Minority Report was to the effect that the preliminary investigation be abolished altogether, that a person to be returned for trial should be notified of the witnesses, their evidence and so on. The Majority Report, which is not accepted in its entirety by the Minister, <Col N="65" /> seems to me to be based on the system in the French courts, where an examining magistrate hears and records the evidence.  I would be rather doubtful whether the taking of statements by the Gárdaí, as recommended, would be the best method.  Without any reflection on anybody, it is a system that might be open to some sort of abuse.</P>
    <P>The Committee appear to be unanimous that all publicity of the preliminary investigation be prohibited unless the accused requests it should be published. It consoles us all to hear from the Minister that the Press, individually and as a whole, agree with this recommendation which the Minister has included in the Bill.  That is a good decision.  Publication of the evidence could prejudice a jury who might be called on to give a decision in another court.  It is important for jurymen to see the witnesses, to hear the evidence being given and to make an assessment of it.  That may differ entirely from the assessment one makes when reading evidence.  If the evidence is published, it is read in the first case; and there is a chance that a juryman, having read it, might come to a certain conclusion&mdash;a conclusion he would be loth to change even when hearing the actual evidence given in another court.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased&mdash;I did not doubt the Minister would do otherwise&mdash;that the public will be allowed into these preliminary investigations, even though the evidence is not published by the newspapers, radio, television and so on.</P>
    <P>It seems in this case the Minister may be a step ahead of the British Government, because they are only now thinking of prohibiting the publication of evidence.  I understand&mdash; perhaps this is where the Minister found his example&mdash;the prohibition of evidence is enforced in Scotland.  However, I am not clear on that.  The Minister's predecessor got many ideas for the Succession Bill from Scottish law, and perhaps the Minister was attracted to it in this particular matter as well.</P>
    <P>Another very welcome change is the proposal to ensure that the Attorney General cannot by himself decide that <Col N="66" /> an accused person shall be sent for trial, but can only do this by application to the High Court.  With all due respect to Attorneys General, I do not think this is a function they should have.  If a decision of a District Justice is to be reversed, it should not be done by an individual who happens to be the Attorney General but should be done by the method now proposed, that is, by application to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to go into all the details of this Bill, many of which have already been covered by the Minister and by Deputy O'Higgins. We can learn a lot about the Bill and amend it to some extent on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The memorandum issued with the Bill is certainly an excellent one for somebody who has not been, and who does not expect to be, involved with the law in any way.  It gives a good breakdown of the Bill.  If we could get similar memoranda in respect of some of the complicated legislation we have here, it would make it much easier for those of us who do not practise in the various professions to which these Bills refer.</P>
    <P>In section 14 there is power of compulsion to ensure that evidence will be given by those who do not volunteer to give it.  I do not know whether this is desirable or not.  The Minister did not give us very full views as to the reason for including it.  There is no question of a penalty if a person refuses to give evidence.  The memorandum says:</P>
    <P>Section 14 is a new provision designed to compel the attendance before a district justice of a prospective witness who is able to give material evidence in relation to an indictable offence which is under investigation but has neglected or refused, on request, to make a statement of that evidence to a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>How can anybody make any witness talk?  If the Garda Síochána are of the opinion that I or anybody else can give evidence, I do not know whether there is justification for anybody <Col N="67" /> taking power to ensure that that evidence must be given.  If I refuse to give evidence, will the Minister say what penalty there is?</P>

      <P>These are details in which I am not too well versed.  We shall probably learn a little more on Committee Stage.  As far as the Bill generally is concerned, it is acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe from the Minister's statement that he regards this Bill as experimental, to a certain degree, until we see how it works, when, if necessary, we can amend it. It seems to me to be generally agreed that some revision of the preliminary proceedings in criminal matters is overdue and this appears to be a constructive effort to do something about that. There is one matter to which I should like to refer in particular.  It is a matter upon which I have some feeling. It relates to subsection (3) of section 21 which states:</P>
      <P>Where the Court remands a person in custody (other than on the occasion of his first appearance before the Court) it may remand him for a period exceeding eight days but not exceeding thirty days if he and the prosecutor consent.</P>
      <P>At first glance there appears to be adequate safeguard within that subsection. But I do not think there is. On the first remand the person must be produced before the justice after a lapse of eight days.  The District Justice will again determine at that stage whether a further remand in custody is permissible.  At the subsequent remand, if the defendant agrees, he can be remanded for a period not exceeding 30 days.  I suggest to the Minister he might turn over in his mind between now and the Committee Stage whether or not this is a desirable reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind that a great many people brought before the court are not very sophisticated and may be in a state of considerable confusion and alarm, much overawed by the general machinery of the law.  There is no more objectionable happening than that a person under indictment should be left in jail for protracted periods without being brought before the court. There is no more consoling institution than the sessions of the criminal court which are described as &ldquo;Sessions of <Col N="70" /> General Jail Delivery&rdquo; which provide the public with the assurance that there is no one left lingering in jail without being brought before an independent judicial authority to determine whether his or her continued detention is lawful and constitutional.</P>
    <P>I have an uneasy feeling that, if a person remanded for eight days is further remanded in custody for 30 days, and then possibly brought before a District Justice again and further remanded for another 30 days, there might be odd individuals who ought not really to be in jail at all for these protracted periods, individuals who do not themselves know how to go about bringing this to the attention of the court and making their protest against this unreasonable detention known.  I cannot see any great hardship involved in producing persons who are remanded in custody before the court every eight days.  That would impose upon the police authority or the Attorney General the obligation of satisfying the District Justice as to why the State is not in a position to proceed.</P>
    <P>This is a matter to which, I think, the Minister might turn his attention with a view to seeing whether this provision is consistent with the protection of the liberty of the individual.  I incline to the view that it is not.  Perhaps, when the Minister is concluding, he will deal with this particular matter. It is one that causes me some anxiety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hold that it is still for the convenience of the accused to tidy up these preliminary proceedings leading to indictment and so on.  We consider that that can only be in the interests of the accused and that the abolition of this kind of time-honoured pageantry that went with the preliminary hearing is a very good thing.  I wonder if the Minister would comment on the period of remand? Section 21 provides that the court shall not remand a person for a period exceeding eight days, except where the section otherwise provides.  Would the Minister comment as to whether he thinks this period could be shortened or is it the period he thinks necessary in this case?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Corish has said, we are pretty much in favour of tidying up the law in any of the areas where we think it needs tidying up at the moment.  We will have more to say when the Minister gets down to the question of reform of the law.  I do not think we would annoy the more public spirited of the professional men who earn their living in that profession by any of our comments on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start by assuring Deputy O'Leary that of all the forms of legal activity, I know none more inconvenient for lawyers themselves than the present system of taking depositions? If the Deputy ever had to sit on that part of his anatomy provided for the purpose in court day after day for five hours a day listening to witnesses dictating their evidence to allow a court clerk to write it out in longhand and then to the interminable arguments between both sides as to whether <Col N="72" /> the clerk's narrative form truly represents the question and answer process of exacting the evidence, he certainly would not feel that this was a Bill which the lawyers would not wish to see introduced.  This Bill will deliver the district courts from an appalling burden of unnecessary work.  What surprises me is that the Bill should be introduced containing a blind spot. One would think we were living in the nineteenth century.  There is no provision here for a tape recorder.  When are we going to do the proper thing and introduce tape recorders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course.  I am far from satisfied that the preparation of a statement by a guard or a district court clerk in a narrative form, writing out what he considers to be a fair narrative of what has been extracted by question an answer truly represents the picture.  For instance, one does not get in a narrative an impression as to whether the person answering a question is hesitating about answering the question.  When presented with evidence in narrative form or in cold print, one does not get any impression as to whether a witness is certain or uncertain.  That is where the tape recorder has an advantage.  It gives some impression of the witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system is cumbersome and imposes a colossal strain upon the accused, who is the person primarily to be considered, but it does at least give an accused person and his advisers some opportunity to assess the quality of the various witnesses the prosecution will bring against them.  That is something that we will lose under a system of presenting evidence in the form of written statements.  I am sure the Minister from his experience as a lawyer knows that conflict can often arise between a statement by a witness supplied in an abstract of a Garda report of a traffic accident and the ultimate evidence given by that witness in court.  The written statement gives no impression as to whether or not the witness is a witness who will be a credible witness or whether or not he <Col N="73" /> is a witness who will stand up to cross-examination or as to how clear the witness is in his recollection.  That is something that is only teased out in the course of examination in a full plenary hearing.</P>
    <P>The present system of taking depositions which allows the witness to be cross-examined and to be tested does give the accused person an opportunity to assess the value of a witness who will be produced against him.  It may well be that on balance it is to the accused's advantage to lose that opportunity in favour of avoiding the colossal personal strain and pecuniary strain the present system imposes but there is a great deal to be said in favour of what Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has said, that some evidence besides the blunt statement of a witness should be given as to age, occupation, relationship, and so on.  I do not know whether we can go as far as recommending that a photograph be produced of each witness but it could be of great value in ascertaining the impression which would be made upon a court subsequently if one has some view of the witnesses the State was going to produce.</P>
    <P>There is one very serious omission from the Bill but I fancy that the Minister will probably see our view on this and the necessary amendment may be made on Committee Stage.  Section 5 provides that a list of exhibits shall be furnished by the Attorney General to the accused and that a copy of those documents shall also be furnished to the court but there does not appear to be any provision for the exhibition of the actual exhibit to the accused person.  There is no opportunity provided in the Bill for an accused person to get the dagger with the blood on it, the gun or any other instrument or exhibit which the Attorney General may produce later on.  If I am wrong in this, I would be grateful for the Minister's correction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here introducing a new format, a new type of court.  It may well be that it is better to leave it out because if you put it in, the justice may feel that he is confined to any particular matters which the Bill says he may hear but I should like the Minister to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I should like to come back to the question of the tape recorder. Section 6, subsection (3) (b), provides that anything the accused may say shall be taken down in writing and other sections provide that any evidence taken in court on deposition shall be taken down in writing.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="75" /> take his courage in his hands and to provide a system of tape recording.  I know the objection is that tape recordings can be tampered with.  One can get over that by this process: If you had three tape recorders recording the evidence on three tapes, one tape could be in the custody of the court, another tape in the custody of the prosecution and the third in the custody of the accused.  If a dispute arose subsequently as between prosecution and the accused as to which was the true record, the tape in the custody of the court could be considered as being the governing one.  In order to avoid tampering by the court, the tape could be put into a box and sealed in the presence of both the prosecution and the defendant.  It is not beyond the resources of science to develop such a machine.  I am quite certain such a machine is in existence and it is simply a matter of having it purchased.  Anyway, even if it is not in existence, it is certainly capable of being devised.  I am not an electrician but I think one knows sufficient about such things to say it would be possible to have such a machine made available. I think it is true to say that tape recorders are in common use in other countries.  We should have them here and I think there is a great deal to be said for them.  They would give you a truer picture of the evidence than the process of having every word taken down in shorthand and then committed to paper.</P>
    <P>I notice, under section 11 subsection (1), it is provided that:</P>
    <P>Where a justice of the District Court decides not to send a person forward for trial the High Court, on the application of the Attorney General, may, after consideration of the documents required to be supplied to the accused, any exhibits and any deposition taken or statement recorded under this Part in relation to the offence, direct that he be sent forward for trial to a specified court to which such justice could lawfully have sent him.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why this power has been conferred on the High Court and not the Circuit Court.  It is <Col N="76" /> one of the objects of the Bill to expedite the period between the time the person is charged and the time the person has to stand trial.  I have the fear that if we confer this power on the High Court alone, it will lead to longer delays than if this power were exercisable by the Circuit Court.  If it is a form of appeal, I do not know why we&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Court has, so to speak, the traditional jurisdiction in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I suppose so; but we should not be afraid to break with tradition if it will lead to a more expeditious form of appeal and at the same time, does not harm the interests of the accused person.  Indeed, it might be that it would be as quick to go to the High Court but it might be inconvenient in some circumstances.  This provision might require a person to travel to Dublin at some inconvenience and expense who could well be present at a Circuit Court down the country.</P>
      <P>Section 17 says:</P>
      <P>Where a person has been sent forward for trial under this Part the indictment against him may include, either in substitution for or in addition to counts charging the offence for which he has been sent forward, any counts founded on facts or evidence disclosed in any of the documents with which he is required to be supplied under this Part, being counts which may lawfully be joined in the same indictment.</P>
      <P>I think that provision is undesirable.  It is confined to the evidence which may already have been made available at the earlier stage but once a person has been sent forward for trial, the charges should be confined to the complaint already made.</P>
      <P>Under section 22, subsection (1), we find that:</P>
      <P>The Court may, where it remands a person in custody for a period not exceeding three days, commit him to the custody of a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> This, I think, is a new provision in the law.  I wonder what necessitates it? Is it due to the fact that we have closed so many provincial prisons and have to provide a longer period to transmit a person to, say, the city of Dublin or Limerick?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the main reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can see the necessity for that but I wonder should we not have some safeguard providing that the rank of the member of the Garda Síochána should be that of sergeant or inspector whose calibre would be that much higher than that of an ordinary member.  One has no reason to doubt that members of the Garda Síochána who are given the responsibility of a person in custody will look after that person well but there is a danger in it and it is against these dangers that we ought to provide safeguards in a Bill of this kind.  I should like the Minister to look into this point.</P>
      <P>Section 23 provides that:</P>
      <P>A justice of the District Court or a peace commissioner may accept from a person charged with an offence who is of no fixed abode or is not resident in the State the deposit of a sum of money equivalent to the amount of bail in lieu of a surety or sureties.</P>
      <P>I cannot find in this Bill any obligation on a justice of the District Court or a peace commissioner to hand over a sum of money so received.  One has no reason to doubt that they would pass it on to whoever is entitled to it.  I wonder is there provision elsewhere? Peace commissioners are generally regarded as honourable men but all men are honourable until they are found to be otherwise.  It would be preferable to get some information as to the ultimate destination of any money so handed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be extremely cautious, whilst engaged in law reform, to ensure that we do not, in the process of endeavouring to improve the administration of justice, do something which is quite contrary to our motives.  I have just a slight fear that some of the provisions <Col N="78" /> in this Bill, while well intended, might do considerable harm.  In the course of Committee Stage and subsequent Stages, we, in the Fine Gael benches, will do whatever we can to bring these worries of ours before the House to see if they are capable of being removed.  We certainly think that an effort is being made to ease the tremendous burden on accused persons which the present archaic system imposes on them.  We feel this Bill goes some of the way and we will support it to that extent.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister earnestly to consider whether we should not provide for these tape recorders.  I believe this is the key to a great deal of our difficulties, not alone in the District Court but in other courts as well.  It would considerably reduce the cost of litigation if tape recorders could be made available in all courts.  Unfortunately, there appears to be considerable resistance on the part of the establishment to introduce tape recorders.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 6, the Minister said that, in the ordinary course, there will only be full plenary taking of depositions if either the accused or the prosecution requires it.  But section 6 provides that not only must either side require such a full taking of depositions but it must appear to the justice to be necessary.  It seems to me to be wholly undesirable that an accused person or his advisers should be at the mercy of the district justice as to whether or not there will be a full examination.  There may well be causes known to the accused or to his advisers as to why the evidence of a particular witness should be tested and it might be contrary to the provision to have to disclose to a court why the evidence of a person should be tested.  Therefore, I would prefer to see this limit on the right to a full plenary taking of deposition removed.  I do not think it is necessary in the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>People who seek to have depositions taken in the old way will not do it light-heartedly.  Likewise, prosecution will not do it light-heartedly.  I do not think there is any necessity whatever to bring in a district justice to determine <Col N="79" /> whether or not this evidence should be taken in that particular manner.  The Minister did not give us one figure when he was introducing the Bill today.  He mentioned that only one per cent of persons are discharged at the end of taking of depositions and that, apparently, in 99 per cent of the cases, the person is sent forward for trial.  That is an interesting figure. There is another figure I should like him to give in order that we may get a proper assessment of the overall picture.  What percentage of persons sent forward for trial under the present system are subsequently acquitted or convicted?  It is important that we should have that in order to assess the value of the provisions in the new Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, we in the Labour Party welcome this law reform but there are one or two points which I should like the Minister to clarify in relation to sections 6 and 7.  They do not, in my opinion, make it absolutely clear that either the accused or the legal representatives should be entitled to appear at preliminary investigations and be allowed to state that a <i>prima facie</i> case has not been made or make any other legal objection they care to make.  It does not seem to be quite clear that they are entitled to be present.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (3) is another provision of which I should like some clarification. It states that:</P>
      <P>If a justice is of opinion that a summary offence only is disclosed, then, if the prosecution does not object, he shall deal with the case as if that offence had been orignally charged.</P>
      <P>Are we to take it that if only a summary offence is disclosed the justice cannot return for trial, whether or not the prosecution objects?</P>

      <P>I have only one or two observations to make in reference to the content of this measure.  I am not at all sure how it will work.  When they are talking about this Bill, Deputies should remember <Col N="80" /> one thing, that this preliminary investigation of indictable offences was something devised for the protection of persons who may be innocent.  That should be kept before everybody's mind, irrespective of whether this inures to the benefit of lawyers or not, and I do approve of the Minister's attitude in not giving in to people who want him to do away with this entirely. It is a great help for innocent persons, persons who should not be brought before the courts unnecessarily, particularly with the atmosphere of indictments. It is desirable that there should be some sort of open hearing of charges against people so that they could, at the earliest possible moment, make their case and rid themselves of the incubus of criminal charges hanging over them.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what this statement given by the prosecution is intended to achieve, nor am I at all certain of the kind of statement that is to be given. I have a recollection myself of appearing before the Military Tribunal in the good old or the bad old days some years ago, and that was the procedure: when you walked into the court, you were thrown a document and that was the statement that was to be given in evidence.  Is that what we are to have here?  There is nothing that I can find in the Bill saying when the accused is to get this document.  I assume the normal district justice will give an opportunity to the accused to read the document, if he says he has not had time to read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this sort of thing should be done by regulation.  However, once the Minister is apprised of the danger there, I am quite satisfied he will see to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come then to the second point I want to make, and that is, what is the content of this Bill?  Those of us who are practising the law, even though we are subject to all sorts of nasty remarks, do happen to know what goes on.  Anybody who has done a number of running-down cases in court knows <Col N="81" /> that after an accident, the guards, as part of their duty, take down a statement. From my experience of what happens in court afterwards, I would advise that nobody should ever tell a guard anything.  The guard takes a statement: &ldquo;I was proceeding&rdquo; and so on.  This is done in guards' language and the unfortunate witness comes into court and some question arises about part of the statement, and he is asked: &ldquo;Did you not make that statement to the guard?&rdquo;&ldquo;Was that not only an hour after the accident occurred?  Was it not much fresher in your mind then?&rdquo; The witness says: &ldquo;I did not say that&rdquo; or has to say he has no recollection of it.  Of course it is the guard's statement, and the witness is asked: &ldquo;Are you saying the guard is telling an untruth?&rdquo;&ldquo;Of course not&rdquo; the witness says,&ldquo;but I did not say it all the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who is going to take this statement? In what language will it be taken?  Is it &ldquo;guardese,&rdquo; if I may use an expression of that kind?  When the accused was proceeding along, he saw this, that and the other, in the words of the Guards, and then he is surprised afterwards when a certain interpretation is put on it.  That may be shorthand or it may be a concise method of saying things.  What is to happen then?  He gets his statement and the trial comes before the jury.  Not one word outside that statement should be allowed in court.  That is the theory; the practice may be different.  The Attorney General, when he sees the statement, may say: &ldquo;This statement is no use. How could I prosecute on that?  Give me another one.&rdquo; Another statement is made and it is handed over on the morning of the case or shortly before it.</P>
    <P>This is not as simple as it looks.  It looks a grand reform.  It stops all that nonsense that we have been trying to stop for years of somebody painfully taking, in longhand, the depositions given on oath by a witness in the course of the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence.  I should also like the Minister to tell me in this context what is the significance of the use in the first subsection of section 4 of the word &ldquo;examination,&rdquo; in contradistinction <Col N="82" /> to the use of the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; in subsection (2) of the same section.  I draw the inference from that that what is going to take place now is not a preliminary investigation of the offence but a preliminary examination of the offence.  There is something changed in that and I want to know if it is intended and, if so, what is the purpose of it.  A preliminary examination is different from an investigation.</P>

      <P>I take it this is deliberately intended to be something different from investigating the offence. I am not against the principle underlying this section but the impression made on my mind is that when the district justice sees the poor devil in the dock, he will look at the statement and say: &ldquo;I have considered this matter and I am going to send you for trial.&rdquo; That is what will happen as sure as I am standing here.  If it is an examination, that is what I visualise. If it is an investigation, it should be something in the nature of a probing, but the district justice just looks at the documents handed to him by the Garda or somebody else, reads them in his chamber before he comes into court and makes up his mind, before anybody says anything, that he will send this man for trial.  An investigation is an examining, a probing to see if there is anything to be said.  Is it the intention&mdash;my impression is that it is not unless subsequent procedure in section 6 is brought into operation&mdash; that the accused should not be entitled to say anything?</P>

      <P>The Minister need not bob his head.  We are passing the section now.  That is my interpretation of it and I know what I am talking about.  I have been in those places, not frequently because any time I was threatened with it I ran a mile from it.  Knowing what I do know, I am aware that is what certain district justices will do.  This should be an examination, a probing.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister if that is so and he says it is not.  I prefer an investigation because I or somebody else can come afterwards and say the case was not investigated but only looked at by the district justice.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on section 6 because again I wish to be advised as to the Minister's intention in relation to the powers to be conferred on district justices.  The district justice makes a decision to send for trial or not at any stage.  In section 6 there is provision for putting somebody on oath.  If an accused person wants somebody to be tested out on oath or evidence to be given which he thinks is necessary for his defence&mdash;it will not happen often because the tactics are to say as little as possible, give away as little as possible at the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence&mdash;he must invoke this complicated procedure in section 6. What is its object?  Presumably some cracked accused or some solicitor who may be representing him may think he wants to put somebody into the box, perhaps in order to persuade the district justice that there is no case to be met.  It is up to the district justice and if he says he will not let you do it, that the accused will not be allowed to put somebody into the box, then the accused cannot do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is complicated machinery and I do not know what it is.  I should like to know it.  I can hardly conceive circumstances in which an accused person would want to do this. <Col N="84" /> I hope it is not the intention of this procedure to put somebody into the witness box to supplement something he has already said by way of statement. It appears to me that the machinery contemplates that the district justice reads the thing and says he wants to hear Garda So-and-So.  He then puts the witness into the box.  I am not too sure of it, but if the accused gets up, or his representative, and says: &ldquo;I want to put so-and-so into the witness box,&rdquo; the district justice need not allow it.</P>

      <P>This is not carping criticism.  I point these things out so that certain things may not happen and that people will know where they are.  I now come to section 11 which, it is stated, replaces section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act.  To the extent that the power under the section is taken from the Attorney General, I agree with it.  As far as I recall, when I was Attorney General I used the power only once.  I had a discussion on it, when this section was passing through the House in 1936, with the then Attorney General.  He asked me for my view and I told him I did not like it.  You have this preliminary investigation, as I said at the outset, which is supposed to be there for the protection of the accused person.  Surely it is only pique that brings the other section into play? I do not think this <Col N="85" /> repeals the section.  It does not say so. I do not see why section 11 and section 62 of the Act cannot stand together.  It would be difficult to argue that they are so opposed to each other that the section here must be an implied repeal. Why not expressly say so if that is intended?</P>

      <P>The last point I wish to make is in reference to section 14 which I think should be taken out straight away.  Under its provisions nobody would be safe.  You could be yanked as a witness into the district court and made to swear this, that and the other.  It undermines the fundamental rights of the person.  He can be yanked before a court to make a statement before the court.  He can be dragged before the court on the application of the Attorney General, if the Attorney General thinks he has a statement to make.  That is not right. It is contrary to the fundamental right of the person and even to facilitate the administration of the law, it should not be introduced.</P>
      <P>I strongly object to that section and submit that the Minister should take it out now.  I find it difficult also to follow the drafting of section 13. Certain evidence can be laid at the trial if the deponent is dead or so ill or incapacitated as to be unable to attend the trial.  Subsection (2) provides that the deposition shall not be read, except in the case of the deponent's death, without the accused's consent.  If a deposition is taken and the witness is ill, does that mean the evidence can be given without the accused's consent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for a very constructive discussion on this matter in which both non-legal and legal people participated. After all, that is as it should be. The law is not something in isolation. Its administration concerns everybody, and nobody more so than the ordinary citizen.  It is a very good thing that Deputies who are not in the legal world should participate in discussions on legal measures which may appear to concern only lawyers but in fact, in a real sense, concern the activities, liberty and life of every citizen in the State.</P>
      <P>The main principle behind the Bill has generally been welcomed.  That the present deposition procedure is a cumbrous, awkward, tedious, time-wasting procedure is generally acknowledged. It dates from the Victorian age.  We have had it for over 100 years.  It has now outlived its usefulness and this was the main theme in the Commission's Report and it has been the main theme of every speech today. However, it has equally been pointed out by both Deputies M.J. O'Higgins and J.A. Costello, amongst others, that in eliminating this tedious procedure we should at the same time have regard to the whole original purpose behind that procedure which was the protection of the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made reference to some points which I should like to deal with at the outset.  He referred to the statements to be supplied to the accused and sought that they be verified by way of sworn affidavit.  The immediate difficulty in that respect is that which caused me to reject the majority recommendation in the Report, that is, the difficulty of getting witnesses over long distances and from remote parts of the country to come to verify or swear an affidavit.  It involves difficulty from an administrative point of view, too, and that was what caused me to reject the majority report.  Equally, the same argument would apply to what Deputy M.J. O'Higgins suggests.  Both he and <Col N="87" /> Deputy J.A. Costello referred to another aspect which I shall consider between now and Committee Stage and that relates to section 6 (2) &mdash;placing the onus on the justice to decide whether or not additional evidence sought by the prosecutor or sought by the accused should or should not be admitted.  I shall have another look at that matter between now and the Committee Stage and that may help in some way to meet also Deputy M.J. O'Higgins's first point.</P>
    <P>There is some validity in the argument that has been advanced that this should be an absolute right residing in the accused.  At the same time, it is only right that I, here, should put the contrary argument as well, that you will then have the situation where the accused man could frustrate the whole process of the court by calling every Tom, Dick and Harry who might have no relevance whatever to the court proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could do that at present but it would not help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could.  That is why we thought it desirable that the district justice would form an opinion whether it was material to the question to be decided.  I have no doubt the district justice would allow it unless the evidence would clearly be irrelevant. I promise the House that between now and Committee Stage, I shall have a look at that particular aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which has been mentioned by several Deputies concerns this question of the right of the accused, or his legal representative, to make submissions or to have a right of audience, as it were, in court.  I agree that this is not spelled out in section 6.  I would have thought&mdash;and I thought most lawyers who have knowledge of the way the courts operate would agree with me&mdash;that this right is implicit in every court procedure, whether it is civil or criminal. It is a fundamental implication that the parties in court have the right of audience and the right of submission. I do not think it is a matter that needs to be written into the section and, indeed, if written in, it might cause <Col N="88" /> difficulty as to interpretation as to how far the judge should or should not go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>After taking full advice in the matter from the Attorney General and my advisers, I did not think it necessary to incorporate it specifically in the Bill having regard to the fact that it can be regarded as the ordinary rule of practice in the courts.  It is basic to the very nature of the courts that these people have these particular rights.  However, if Deputies consider that something along those lines should be written into that particular section, I shall consider the matter between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins also raised some matter under section 5 (1) (b) seeking that certain additional information concerning the witnesses themselves should also be a requirement in any documentation to be served on the accused.  He made the point that the bare names of the witnesses might not be sufficient for the accused.  Of course that information would, in most cases, already be contained in the statement which would have to be submitted as well.  I shall have a look at that matter too between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of who would draw up the statements.  The State Solicitor in each particular area would have the job of doing this on the basis of the Garda statement.  He is the responsible officer of the legal administration. On him would devolve the responsibility of carefully preparing the statements of the evidence proposed to be given by each witness.  It is also proposed that these statements will be served in good time on the defendant and lodged with the District Court, also in good time.  Again, the point has been raised here as to why we do not specify the number of days prior to the hearing that these statements would be served on the accused and lodged in the courts.  These matters are better dealt with by way of regulation. <Col N="89" /> At present, we are drawing up regulations to deal with matters of that kind.  It is better, from the point of view of presentation of legislation, that they be dealt with in that fashion.</P>
    <P>In that context, there is no question of rushing this Bill into legal form too quickly.  It is a Bill which makes a very fundamental change in our criminal procedure and for that reason regulations are being drawn up in very great detail at the present time.  I have asked the District Court Rules Committee to do so.  I envisage this Bill coming into force at the same time as regulations which will spell out details such as were sought in this House.  Prior to the actual hearing the accused would receive the documents and the court would have them also. Suffice it to say the House can be assured there will be ample time given by way of lodgment of documents and the serving of them.  There is no intention, as has been suggested, that the accused would walk into court and find documents thrust at him and a hasty decision given by the district justice.  There is no intention of having any such procedure.  Ample time and due notice will be given for the defence and for his or her legal adviser to question the matter fully and to come into the court after due deliberation and consideration of the case.</P>

Costello referred to whether we should not style this preliminary hearing an investigation. It is a matter of terminology.  He prefers to call it an investigation but I preferred to refer to it as an examination.  I am open to change. I would have thought that investigation had too much of an inquisitorial ring about it as against court procedure. <Col N="90" /> It is only a matter of terminology and I am open to be convinced that the proper description might be preliminary investigation rather than preliminary examination.  I want to assure the House there is nothing sinister in that particular change.</P>

I want to employ a terminology distinct from police terminology, and the word &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; has a particular ring about it.  But as it has been there for so long it might be no harm to revert to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Ryan raised some points in connection with the present longhand procedure and the introduction of tape recording machines.  The Bill, if it becomes law in its present form, will eliminate the procedure itself in almost all cases. The existing procedure is rendered very tedious by reason of the operation of writing down in longhand. Indeed, I would defend the longhand operation on the basis that you had to have the narrative precisely in the form of what the witness said.  This might not be easy or possible by mechanical means.  As people know, the deposition has to be read over to the witness and perhaps recorrected, and this might not be possible with mechanical means.</P>

      <P>As it is now in the Bill, I feel the new procedure will protect the accused to an even greater degree than at the present time as well as providing a more expeditious hearing in which everybody concerned with the trial, the witnesses and the court officials will not be involved in the duplication which exists at present. The basic protection for the accused I find in the Bill as it stands is that the full State case will be made known to him.  There will be a full documentation&mdash;the statement of the charge and the statement of the evidence will be made available to him in good time so that he knows exactly what it is proposed to say against him.  That is a much better procedure than that employed at the present time and to which Deputy Tully referred as a lot of shadow boxing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned the question of exhibits.  It is proposed that a list of exhibits will be served on the accused in good time and that the exhibits will be shown in court.  The main purpose is to ensure, first of all, that you have a more expeditious hearing and, secondly, that in the process of doing that, the rights, the protection and the safety of the person accused are fully protected.  I believe we have arrived at that stage in the Bill by not adopting a minority recommendation which did not envisage the accused having this right to call in any witness he might wish for cross-examination. I felt, rightly, that that was going too far in regard to expeditious hearing of the case.  I do not believe this basic right has been <Col N="92" /> very often exercised and I do not believe it will be too often exercised in the future.  There is the occasional number of cases, the minority, where the accused may wish to fight it out at the preliminary level.  One can envisage, particularly in sex crimes, that it might be very desirable that the accused person should not be put in jeopardy before a jury and that he might wish to fight out his case or defend his name at the preliminary hearing.  This happens only in a minority of cases.  In most cases the fight is reserved for the trial but at the same time we should preserve the right of a person to clear his or her name at the earliest possible stage.  That is why the accused should be enabled to have every witness he may wish in court subject to cross-examination by his legal adviser.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health service is inadequate to the needs of the people, and that in particular many injustices arise in the administration of the medical card system, and calls on the Government without further delay to establish a comprehensive no means test health service with a free choice of doctor for all sections of the community.  &mdash;(Deputy Kyne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened carefully to all that the Minister had to say on this motion, it is safe to say that his approach is undoubtedly a reasonable approach.  It has indeed been most conciliatory, but while that is so, we are still left wondering what is his intention in regard to the White Paper.  Every speaker in this debate had something to say in favour of the motion and the Minister himself made statements which contribute to the motion.  If nothing else this motion has evoked from all those who spoke a <Col N="94" /> positive indication that there is a need for an improvement in the health services. I noticed that the Minister, speaking at the Árd Fheis last week, said that one of his main objections to a free, comprehensive medical service is that the people would be treated like cattle.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that under the present system people are being treated like cattle.  I am very pleased to know that he realises that there is a need for a change.  I know that when I was on the Select Committee with him, he recognised the need then but unfortunately his predecessor did not think the same way.  The same can be said for the advisers in the Department.  I hope the Minister will keep pushing towards this objective of bringing satisfactory services to our people.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I am satisfied that the people who plan health services are too far removed from the people's needs to know exactly what they do need.  This is the cause of all our trouble and it is quite true to say that the university of adversity is the best type of university for this exercise. One has only to spend a little time in any of our local dispensaries to see our people being treated like cattle herded together, waiting and watching for assistance, assistance which they should be given as an entitlement.  This is something which has caused people to cry out for a free choice of doctor. We believe that every Party has adopted the view that there should be a free choice of doctor.  There is no real trouble about that.  If we have a free choice of doctor, perhaps it will result in the elimination of the antiquated pauper houses which are described as dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If nothing else, we have got to get this system away from this hand-out treatment.  I know from my experience of looking after my constituents what it would mean to have a free choice of doctor.  It would mean an awful lot because I have known people who had medical cards but who did not avail of the benefits which they could have had because of the absence of a choice of doctor, because of the rude way in which they were treated and because of the obvious lack of interest in them <Col N="95" /> when they went to avail of the existing system.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the expenses borne by people who come within the ambit of the present scheme in regard to medicines and drugs.  I have known some such cases.  I have known, for example, the case of a man who had £10 16s. a week, whose wife was in a mental home, and who had a son working and who was required to pay consistently for his wife's upkeep in the mental home.  The reason he was required to pay for her upkeep was that his son had an income.  We have all grown up sufficiently to realise now that unfortunately the majority of boys and girls who are working do not contribute in the way we would imagine they would, or the way a civil servant imagines they should contribute, to the upkeep of their homes. These are things that have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>There is of course an appeal but this is something that requires a lot of doing.  No matter whether they have £8, £9 or £10 a week, you find people not wishing to appeal, as if they were begging, for entitlement.  That consistently happens.  You also have the situation in which a number of people do not know what they are entitled to. In some cases they apply for a medical card, do not get it and do not pursue the matter further.  No matter what happens, even if this motion is not passed, it will certainly inspire a movement and whatever is done must be an improvement.  If nothing more, I appeal to the Minister to take steps to ensure that the administration of health services is taken out of the hands of the local authority in the person of the county or city manager. It should not be left to the whim of an individual, or the people who work for him and who must carry out his instructions, to determine whether a person should or should not have something to keep them well.  This matter cries out for attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had not quite made up his mind on what was to be done about the health services but this is something that must be done. <Col N="96" /> This is one of the reasons why we in the Labour Party advocate free, comprehensive medical services.  A number of people are described as ratepayers, people who could be described as tenants of small dwellings, and each one of them could safely be described as a member of the working classes.  A considerable number of these just eke out an existence but they are denied medical cards and medical services because of what appear to be their possessions.  If a real investigation were made it would be found that object poverty exists in a number of homes occupied by the tenants of small dwellings.  This also cries out for attention.  Such people are very often left to the mercy of a manager or his employees who are conditioned by the whim of the manager who feels obliged to keep down the rates.</P>
    <P>I had an experience in connection with the choice of doctor in my own constituency&mdash;indeed, more than one. I had a group of people signing a petition to have something done about a doctor who was supposed to be attending to their needs.  Nothing was done.  In his good time the doctor went but in the case of one woman that he attended&mdash;she was expecting a baby&mdash;he promised to come back. In the meantime he was transferred. The baby died and there was a suggestion that this was as a result of the doctor's bad handling of the case. The father decided to take it up with the medical officer but needless to say the city medical officer took the stand of his profession and did nothing about it.  These things are very hard to prove but they indicate the need for a choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>Before the promised White Paper comes out&mdash;I hope it will not be too long&mdash;the Minister should take serious notice of the present position in the Six Counties and here.  By now I am sure it is common knowledge that one of the main planks in the Unionist platform in the present election is the social welfare and health services.  They have actually issued a brochure showing the services existing in what they describe as Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.  This is a revelation to anybody making comparisons. It should urge us, if we <Col N="97" /> are sincere about desiring unification of the country, to do something about our own services.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Kyne spoke on this motion, he indicated that we were prepared to assist the Minister and the Government in finding money for this project.  It is easy to ask: &ldquo;Where will the money come from?&rdquo; The situation calls for a close examination but I think it reasonable to ask the Minister to consider seriously the priorities of the matter.  Far more money has been spent over a number of years in the maintenance of animal health than on the health of human beings.  I got this information recently in reply to parliamentary questions I addressed to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health.  The replies showed clearly that we had not been looking after human beings as we should.  It was about time to consider the human beings because if we fail to look after them our cattle will not be much use to us.</P>
    <P>It would not be a bad thing, as regards the matter of payments, if the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Health got together.  I and my colleagues have had occasion to try to ascertain if certain things could be done through the health services and we have had the Minister for Health saying&mdash;not the present Minister but his predecessor&mdash;that he is waiting for the Minister for Social Welfare.  Similarly, we were told the Minister for Social Welfare was waiting for the Minister for Health.  Before the White Paper comes out there should be consultations between these Ministers with a view to ensuring proper health and social services.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are paying directly or indirectly for services which are absolutely unsatisfactory.  I am sure the Minister has taken notice of the fact that whenever there is an increase in the social welfare contribution from the worker there is never a complaint despite the fact that there are continual complaints about the benefits.  From my knowledge and experience of the working people I am satisfied that they are quite prepared to pay for proper services and the only way in which we can obtain proper services is by having free, comprehensive <Col N="98" /> services.  The idea of discrimination is bad and discrimination will come about even if we have a Minister as well intentioned as we have now.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he had in mind the choice of doctor but he also said that where people did not obtain benefit they would be entitled to appeal.  This right of appeal will prevent proper health services from operating.  We must stop thinking in terms of appeal and have more regard to entitlement.  A person is either entitled to something or he is not. You make application for something to which you are entitled, but if somebody judges you are not entitled to it, you have to go through the exercise of arm-twisting, cajoling or string-pulling to get that to which you feel you are entitled.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, medical appeals are dragged out and, in the meantime, the applicant is left without the service to which he is entitled.  In view of what has already happened, I do not believe an appeal meets the case.  For example, I know of a case of a woman who required surgical boots for two of her children.  Her husband had £10 5s. a week.  She was denied a medical card because her daughter, who was saving up to get married, was working.  There was an appeal, but it took four months to reach a decision.  In the meantime, the surgical boots had to be provided.  It is all very well to say that, if there is an appeal, it means something will be done in the case of a person not being rightly treated; but you cannot make an appeal when somebody urgently requires medical service.  I am asking the Minister to get away from that. Comparisons have been made with the &ldquo;Black North&rdquo;, and comparisons can be made with other parts of Europe. There has been a lot of talk about free trade and the Common Market, but we will have to improve our social and health services if we are not to continue to be described as an underdeveloped country.  We keep on preaching that we are not underdeveloped. Let us put more value on our people's health than on anything else.  Let us put first things first, and <Col N="99" /> the health of our people is undoubtedly our first priority.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this century, a commission of inquiry was set up to inquire into the workhouse hospitals.  Shortly after the conclusion of that inquiry, a dispensary doctor from Cavan wrote an article in a journal called <i>The Irish Monthly</i> in which he summarised his evidence before this commission of inquiry into the provision of medical services for the poor of this country.  He emphasised in this document that, just as important as the hands of a surgeon, just as important as the knowledge of the medical man, was the maintenance of the dignity and self-respect of the sick poor.  He said then that the poorhouse system&mdash;the system of medical charity such as we had in operation in Ireland then and now&mdash;could not maintain the dignity and self-respect of the sick poor.  This man said then&mdash; and this was 61 years ago&mdash;that he wanted to see that the sick poor had the same right as the rich people, and that was freedom to choose their own doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael have been advocating this for many years.  The Labour Party have likewise being advocating it.  Within the last week, we had the Minister for Health throwing out his predecessor with all his works and pomps and saying that he, too, believed in the free choice of doctor. It is only recently I came across this article of 1904.  I was not a little proud of the fact that the man who wrote it was my grandfather.  It was 61 years ago that a dispensary doctor working in rural Ireland said that the poor of this country had the right to a free choice of doctor.  We have not yet given it to them after 40 years of freedom, and are we going to give it so long as we have in office a Government who have no conception of the necessity to have a proper health service? I pity the present Minister.  I accept his bona fides and his anxiety to have such a service.  But he is a member of a Government which for years had as their deputy leader a man totally, morally and psychologically opposed to giving poor persons a free choice of <Col N="100" /> doctor.  We know from their published programmes that they rejected it as not having any contributory or beneficial influence on economic expansion, health, education and what they call social investment.  We reject this idea. We believe a proper social programme and a proper health service are just as essential to our economic growth and welfare as any other service the Government can provide.  Until such time as we have an adequate health service, there is no prospect of seeing a just society in operation here.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, are only too happy to lend our support to this motion in the name of some members of the Labour Party.  We are in favour of a comprehensive health service which will give a free choice of doctor. We believe the way to bring about that health service is to ask for a reasonable contribution from every person who has an income.  Those who have not got an income would receive the same health benefits without having to go through the present undignified and demoralising system of applying for medical cards, which in practice under our legislation are a badge of poverty and are accepted as such.  At present the main weakness of our health service is that a person of limited means has no choice of doctor but must go to a particular State official.  In the course of the last general election campaign, a dispensary doctor declared he was not going to vote for Fine Gael any more because he was a dispensary doctor and he did not agree with the Fine Gael health scheme because it gave the poor a free choice of doctor. He was queried as to why he adopted this attitude and he said: &ldquo;They are not paying for it, so why should they have a free choice of doctor?&rdquo; As far as Fine Gael are concerned, we are glad not to have the support of people who think that way.  We think it is appalling that that attitude of mind should exist in the twentieth century.</P>
    <P>Another weakness of the present health service is that the provision of a medical card to preserve life or to kill pain is in competition with roads, bins, public lighting, vocational education, rates and all the multitude of services a local authority provides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> That should not be so.  It should be a prior charge on our resources, be they national or local.  Until you have that approach to the relief of human suffering, the present miserable system will continue.  We reject as trite the kind of tripe we used to get from the Minister's predecessor.  His figure of £15 million as the cost of a decent medical service is complete and utter cod.  With the Minister throwing out Deputy MacEntee's works and pomps, as he has been busily doing ever since he succeeded him, he should also throw out that figure of £15 million.  In that figure there is no allowance for the reduction in our hospitalisation rate, which at present is the highest in Europe.  Why?  Because we are not treating the sick poor in their own homes.  We are not treating people in a limited way in their own homes.  We expect dispensary doctors, because of the thousands of people they have to serve, to send sick people into hospital so that they may get some kind of treatment there which the dispensary doctors themselves, because of the thousands of demands on them, are unable to provide.</P>
    <P>The real cost of a proper health service will only be about £3 million or £4 million extra on the total health bill.  That is an extremely small sum compared with the frightening figure the Minister, like his predecessor, is using now.  I am quite certain that when the Minister argues his case before the Cabinet he never advances a figure of £15 million as the additional cost of providing a decent health service here.  If you try to graft on to the Medical Charities Act of the nineteenth century twentieth century health services, I am quite certain the bill will come to another £15 million. But that is not the way to go about providing a proper health service.  We in Fine Gael have been saying that now for several years past and that is why we endorse this motion tabled by the Labour Party.  We do not use glib phrases like &ldquo;free for all&rdquo;.  We know that everything must be paid for and I have yet to find any working man or woman who would jib at paying a few shillings every week in return for being relieved of the colossal <Col N="102" /> worry and expense of medical treatment.  We will continue to argue for a comprehensive insurance health service, free to those with no incomes and paid for by those with incomes through the medium of a reasonable contribution.  We do not mind what Government or what Party brings that health service into operation.  All we want to ensure is that in our time we will achieve what a country medical doctor said at the turn of the century, namely, freedom of choice of doctor for the poorest of the poor.</P>

      <P>We all want a comprehensive health service designed to ensure that no one in need of medical attention will be denied that attention because of lack of means.  The present health services have very often been the target of ill-informed criticism. That criticism does not help those who need help.  I have heard Deputies criticise the method by which medical cards are issued.  I do not think the system is one that should be maintained very much longer, but it is not nearly so bad as some people make out.  It should be our aim to minimise suffering.  It has been said that in the area administered by the Dublin Health Authority cards are issued, or refused, by people who are not qualified to make a decision.  First of all, when a person applies for a medical card the inquiry officer goes out and finds out what the circumstances are. The case is examined in the office.  The inquiry officer makes a report.  He can issue a card but, before a card is refused, I understand it is the executive officer who must make the decision. It very often happens that an applicant for a card is rejected.  His income is too high, or something like that.  Later, he may apply again through a member of this House or a member of the City Council and a card is issued to him.  What happens very often is that the illness has become much more <Col N="103" /> serious or the income has fallen.  That puts the applicant into the category for a medical card immediately.  The Dublin Health Authority administers the system very, very fairly indeed. Their whole ambition is to help those who need the card.  One speaker said here this evening that he applied two or three times and his application was rejected.  Then he became a member of this House and he had no difficulty getting a card.  Any active member of a local authority or of this House knows that these things are done by the health authority examining each case on its merits and giving a fair decision.</P>

      <P>In the time at my disposal, I want to bring to the Minister the irregularities and anomalies in the present Health Act.  Some of us may have the good fortune to sit on a health authority with managers who are human.  Others may have to contend with managers who are cold and inhuman and who take very odd decisions with regard to the people entitled to health services.  I can make a comparison between the health authority of which I am a member and a neighbouring health authority in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an elderly woman living a mile outside the Limerick border. She was dying alone in her home. A good neighbour came to me and <Col N="104" /> asked me to have her transferred to our hospital in Limerick.  I tried to do that, but unsuccessfully.  It seemed more desirable to transfer her to Limerick, a short distance away, rather than impose a journey of 26 miles on her to the county hospital in Clare. Our resident medical officer in Limerick told me admission was refused.  The unfortunate woman died.  I instituted inquiries and the answer I got was that there was no co-operation and no understanding between the health authority in Clare and the health authority in Limerick. I could recount other instances for the Minister but I am sure he is well aware of them.  Because of the interpretation of the Act as between one manager and another and because of their divergent views as to how these services should be used, unfortunate people are deprived of that to which they are justly entitled.  We in the Labour Party believe that a manager, whether human or inhuman, should not be the deciding factor in these matters.</P>
    <P>There is no co-operation between one health authority and another. Drugs prescribed by professional men in the medical services are being withheld and put on one side by an order of the Minister to all managers of health authorities.  Who is the deciding factor in this?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned some of the anomalies in the Health Act and the administration of the Health Act.  The Minister is as well aware of them as I am.  We welcomed the statements the Minister made shortly after taking office as to the radical changes that we might expect in the health services. We are still awaiting these radical <Col N="105" /> changes, particularly those changes we envisaged as a result of statements made by the Minister with regard to the nursing profession and psychiatric treatment.  There were statements made by the Minister which suggested that 30 per cent of the people of Ireland are mad or half mad and that the institutions in which these mental cases are housed are archaic and have been handed over from an old régime. Grandiose statements were made by the Minister but we await action and await it anxiously.</P>
    <P>We are now presented with an effort at stalling in the introduction of a White Paper.  The White Paper will contain many promises, particularly having regard to the fact that local elections will take place in June next. I do not know what we will be facing after that.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are not satisfied and the Minister in his heart and soul is not satisfied.  He has stated that the issue of a medical card was treated as a joke.  We have no time for joking about the health of the nation and do not treat these matters jocosely.  The Minister's humour and our humour do not coincide.  Every health authority must contribute 50 per cent of the health charges.  I do not know of any health authority that has agreed to this 50-50 basis.  At the last meeting of Limerick Health Authority, a recommendation was sent to the Minister. At the previous meeting, a recommendation was sent to the Minister.  The first proposal sent to the Minister for the introduction of a fairer basis of contribution came from the Minister's own Party in the Limerick Health Authority.  Nothing has been done since then.</P>
    <P>When a request was made that the State contribution should be increased and the burden on local ratepayers correspondingly decreased the reply received from the Minister's predecessor was that that would involve sending down civil servants to run the authority and that he was loth to hand over further authority to civil servants. If the Department of Local Government can relieve rates through the Road Fund, there is no reason why the <Col N="106" /> Minister for Health should not be in the same position in regard to the health services.</P>
    <P>We are looking forward to the introduction of the White Paper.  I know it will contain the Santa Claus promises that we have been getting from the Minister.  We are sick and tired of listening to statements made at dances, dinners and all kinds of functions ridiculing the services.  We all know of the anomalies that exist.  We want them rectified.  We want to see action being taken.  Since the Minister took office, nothing has been done to satisfy the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>My time is very brief, which is a matter for regret because this subject is very dear to the heart of the Labour Party.  We have introduced the motion with a view to arousing public opinion and to bring out the delinquent Fine Gael Party and to make them see that we are the spearhead of the movement for a free for all health service for the people of Ireland.  We offer no apology to any other Party for introducing this motion, which we will press by way of division.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention the fact that the powers of health authorities are limited in respect of visits to institutions.  Members of Limerick City Health Authority are in a singular position in regard to visits to a certain institution.  As public representatives and members of a health authority we are entitled to visit, in reason, any of our health institutions or hospitals on reasonable demand. Unfortunately, we in Limerick are not entitled to do that because of the whim of a certain individual.  We do not ask for anything unreasonable.  If a patient in an institution demands or requests a visit from a member of a health authority or any other public representative that should be sufficient reason for allowing the visit, within reason.</P>
    <P>I shall now give a personal opinion as to how the services should be run generally.  The Minister would be well advised to consider regionalising the services.  In that way there would be a broader and more humane approach as <Col N="107" /> between one manager and another.  If the services were regionalised there would be a more reasonable approach and a levelling out of the discrepancies and anomalies that exist at the present time.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the introduction of the White Paper, I want to warn the Minister that as far as the Labour Party are concerned, this is to be no stalling gimmick.  We will insist on a final decision being made one way or another in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>Tairgim go léifear an Bille an Dara Uair.</P>
      <P>Bille é seo chun scéim nua a chur ar fáil in áit na scéime atá ann i láthair na huaire faoi na hAchtanna um Chúiteamh do Lucht Oibre, 1934 go 1955.  Séard atá beartaithe ná an Scéim Árachais Shóisialaigh a leathnú chun freastail ar díobhálacha agus galair cheirde agus cuirfear íocaíochtaí níos fearr ar fáil d'oibrithe gortaithe agus a gcleithiúnaithe, ar chostas réasúnta. In ionad an freagracht seo maidir le cúiteamh do lucht oibre bheith leagtha go díreach ar an bhfostóir mar atá faoi láthair, freagracht a mbíonn sé ìnárachaithe ina éadan de ghnáth, íocfaidh mo Roinnse sochair leasa shóisíalaigh má deintear díobháil pearsanta d'oibrí de dheasca agus i gcúrsa na fostaíochta.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol do Theachtaí, cuireadh Coimisiún ar bun chun iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo agus thairg an Coimisiún seo dhá tuarascáil dhom i 1962.  T'réis dhom staidéar a dhéanamh ar na tuarascáil seo bhí mé sásta nárbh' fhearr rud a dhéanfaí ná an Bille seo a rith.  Bhí sé soiléir gur scéim casta, costasach atá ann faoi láthair, a riaradh scaipthe imeasc na comhluchtanna árachais, socraithe á ndéanamh ins na cúirteanna agus mar sin de, agus go mbéadh cúiteamh i bhfad níos fearr le fáil ag oibrithe ar an gcostas céanna faoi scéim den chineál atá ghá moladh agam sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>Tosóidh an scéim nua ar lá a bhéas socraithe de réir Ordú.  Riarófar í ó chiste lena ndéanfaidh fostóirí amháin ranníoca.  Beidh na ranníoca seo de réir 2/1d sa tseachtain d'oibrí fir agus 1/6d sa tseachtain d'oibrí mná.  Ar an iomlán, siad na hoibrithe a thiocfaidh faoin scéim nua ná iad siúd a thigeann faoin scéim um cúiteamh do lucht oibre anois, ach beidh cineálacha eile oibrithe inárachaithe faoin scéim nua freisin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mór an difríocht atá idir na sochair a íocfar faoin scéim nua agus na híocaíochtaí faoin sean scéim.  Ar feadh sé seachtain's fiche díreach taréis na timpiste, agus an t-oibrí gan a <Col N="110" /> bheith in ann obair a dhéanamh de bharr gortaithe, gheobhaidh sé liúntas, ar a dtugtar &ldquo;sochar díobhála&rdquo; de 115/- sa tseachtain.  Beidh méadú ar seo de réir 40/- sa tseachtain le haghaidh cleithiúnaí aosaithe, 13/- an duine sa tseachtain le haghaidh na céad beirte clainne agus 8/- an duine sa tseachtain le haghaidh gach páiste eile sa chlann.  íocfar na méadaithe seo i leith páistí atá faoi 16 bliana d'aois agus páistí atá idir 16 bliana agus 18 bliana atá ar scoil, i bprintíseacht ar bheagán pá nó ina mbreoiteacháin. Mar sin de, féadfaidh fear gortaithe a bhfuil céile agus beirt pháiste aige, sochar díobhála seachtainiúil a shroisfidh £9 1s. ina iomlán d'fháil.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhéas deireadh leis an sochar díobhála beidh an t-oibrí i dteideal sochar nua, &ldquo;sochar míthreorach&rdquo;, d'fháil, agus, fá na choinne seo, is cuma é bheith in ann, nó gan a bheith in ann, obair a dhéanamh.  Is ar mhíthreoir oibrí de bharr na timpiste a bhéas an teideal don sochar seo ag brath.  Íocfar pinsean de 115/-sa tseachtain i gcás in a bhfuil an míthreoir go hiomlán&mdash;cuir i gcás, go bhfuil sé dall ar fad&mdash;agus íocfar pinsean ag ráta níos ísle de réir míthreóra an iarrthóra. íocfar an ráta iomlán le haghaidh tréimhse ar bith in a mbeidh an t-oibrí ag fáil cóir leighis in ospidéal pé aca gur ag an ráta iomlán nó ráta níos ísle atá pinsean á íoc leis.  Íocfar na méadaithe le haghaidh cleithiúnaithe, mar i gcás sochair díobhála, leis an bpinsean ar feadh na tréimhse seo freisin, muna bhfuil na méadaithe chéanna á n-íoc leis an oibrí i dteannta le sochar míchumais faoi na hAchtanna Leasa Shóisialaigh.  Má bhíonn an míthreoir níos lú ná 20 per cent den iomlán íocfar cnapshuim airgid nach mó ná £380 leis an oibrí in ionad pinsin. Méadófar an pinsean míthreorach de réir 52/6d sa tseachtain, maraon le méadaithe eile le haghaidh cleithiúnaithe, má bhíonn an t-oibrí, de bharr na timpiste, gortaithe go buan agus gan a bheith ábalta obair a dhéanamh ar feadh an chuid eile dá shaol. Méadófar an pinsean, freisin, de réir liúntais suas go dtí 40/- sa bhreis sa tseachtain, nó 80/- sa bhreis sa tseachtain i gcás ar bith in a bhfuil an t-oibrí <Col N="111" /> gortaithe go mór, má caithfear aire a thabhairt dó i rith an ama uilig agus é taobh amuigh d'ospidéal.  Beidh na sochair le haghaidh mná pósta éagsúla, daoine faoi 18 bliana, ag rátaí níos ísle.  Beidh na rátaí seo thart fá dhá-thrian den ghnáth ráta.</P>
    <P>Beidh an mhéid sochair a bhéas iníoctha d'oibrí gortaithe, teoranta de réir gnáth pá iomlán seachtaine an oibrí ag am na timpiste.  Maidir leis an uasteora seo, áfach, glacfar árdaithe pá san bhfostaíocht in ar tharla timpiste san áireamh.</P>
    <P>Le cois na sochar thuasluaite tá sé beartaithe faoin mBille go n-íocfar costaisí leighis atá réasunta agus riachtanach, agus a éiríonn as timpiste cheirde.  Íocfar na costaisí seo san mhéid nach mbeidh siad iníoctha faoi forálacha na hAchtanna Sláinte nó na hAchtanna Cóireála Meabhair-Ghalar, nó de réir sochair cóireála faoi na hAchtanna Leasa Shóisialaigh.  Faoi fhoráil seo an Bhille íocfar costas ar bith a thuiteann ar an oibrí de bharr cóir ospidéil faoi na hAchtanna Sláinte, nó cóir liachta nó aire banliachta taobh amuigh d'ospidéal, nó soláthairí leighis, maraon le géaga bréige.  Déanfar íocaíochtaí freisin i leith chostaisí a bhaineann le athshlánú oibrí.</P>
    <P>I gcás báis oibrí de dheasca tionóisce íocfar pinsean de 95/- sa tseachtain lena bhaintreach maraon le méadaithe le haghaidh páistí, ar aon dul leis na méadaithe a bhéas iníoctha le sochar díobhála.  Faoi na forálacha seo, freisin, beidh pinsean de 47/6d sa tseachtain iníoctha i leith dilleachtaí agus pinsin de 24/- sa tseachtain do thuismitheoir nó do bheirt tuismitheoir cleithiúnaí.</P>
    <P>Má fhaigheann bean bás de thoradh timpiste cheirde, gheobhaidh cleithiúnaí baintreach fir dí, nach mbeidh ábalta obair a dhéanamh choíche, pinsean a bhéas ar aon dul le pinsean baintrí mná.  Más rud é nach duine é nach mbeidh in ann obair a dhéanamh choíche ach go raibh sé i gcleithiúnas a mhná chéile, gheobhaidh sé suim airgid de £247.  Íocfar deontas tórraimh de £50 taréis báis de thoradh timpiste.</P>
    <P>Sé an taon choinníoll amháin le haghaidh ceann ar bith de na sochair a lua mé ná go dtárlódh an timpiste <Col N="112" /> don oibrí de dheasca agus i gcúrsa fostaíochta inárachaithe.  Tá coinníoll cosúil le seo i réim san am faoi láthair faoin scéim um chúiteamh do lucht oibre.  Tá forálacha sa bhreis san mBille seo áfach chun go mbeidh sé níos fusa an coinníoll seo a shásamh. Mar shompla, de réir forálacha an Bhille, beidh sé inghlactha gur de dheasca fostaíochta a éirigh timpiste a thárla d'oibrí i gcúrsa fostaíochta, muna bhfuil fianaise a thaispeánann a mhalairt.  Mar an gcéanna, beidh sé inghlactha freisin gur éirigh a leithéid de thimpiste de dheasca fostaíochta más é droch-bhéas oibrí is cúis leis an timpist nó má bhuaileann aon ní nó splanc thintrí an t-oibrí, agus muna ndearna an t-oibrí aon ní a tharraing an timpiste air féin.</P>
    <P>Ní amháin go n-íocfaí an sochair san Bhille seo de bharr timpistí a tharlaíonn i gcúrsa fostaíochta íocfar iad freisin de bharr galair a bhuaileas oibrí de dheasca a chinéal fostaíochta.</P>
    <P>I gcás timpistí a tharla nó galair a thóg oibrithe roimh teacht na scéime nua i bhfeidhm, beidh ar fhostóirí cúiteamh faoi na hAchtanna um Chúiteamh do Lucht Oibre a íoc mar is ghnáth faoi láthair.  Tá forálacha san mBille faoinar féidir leis na daoine atá ag fáil íocaíochtaí chúiteamh lucht oibre agus nach mbeidh in ann obair a dhéanamh choíche, ceart a bheith acu íocaíocht de réir 52/6 sa tseachtain d'fháil maraon le méadaithe le haghaidh cleithiúnaithe san dóigh céanna le duine atá i dteideal sochar míthreorach d'fháil.</P>
    <P>San mBille freisin tá forálacha faoina bhfuil ceart ag faighteoirí chúiteamh lucht oibre liúntas de réir 40/- sa tseachtain, nó 80/- i gcásanna speisialta, más gá aire a thabhairt dóibh i rith an ama uilig.  Tá sé ar intinn freisin méid iomlán de shochar míchumais faoi na hAchtanna Leasa Shóisialaigh a íoc, taréis tús na scéime seo, maraon le híocaíochtaí cúiteamh lucht oibre i gcásanna nach bhfuil an liúntas breise de réir 52/6 sa tseachtain a rinne mé tagairt dó, iníoctha. Faoi na rialacha atá ann faoi láthair ní íoctair sochar míchumais faoi na hAchtanna Leasa Shóisialaigh le haon íocaíocht seachtainiúil faoi na hAchtanna um Chúiteamh do Lucht Oibre <Col N="113" /> ach san mhéid ina bhfuil sé níos mó ná an íocaíocht sin.  Mar thoradh ar seo, gheobhaidh fear ar bith, atá ag fáil íocaíochtaí cúitimh do réir £4 10s Od sa tseachtain anois, sochar míchumais de 52/6 sa tseachtain más fear singil é, nó 92/6d más fear pósta é maraon le liúntais i leith páistí, le cois na híocaíochtaí cúitimh.  Laghdófar na híocaíochtaí seo i gcás ar bith ina bhfuil siad, san iomlán, níos mó ná an pá san bhfostaíocht as ar éirigh an cúiteamh.</P>
    <P>Ní chuireann an Bille seo isteach ar chearta an oibrí damáistí a éileamh faoin dhlí coiteann as neamart fostóra nó páirtí eile.  Tá forálacha san mBille, áfach, chun an sochar a bhéas ag dul don oibrí faoin mBille seo ar feadh tréimhse cúig bliana, a chur san áireamh nuair a bhíonn damáistí á meas.</P>
    <P>Riaróidh an Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh an scéim nua san dóigh céanna le sochair Leasa Shóisialaigh eile. Béarfaidh Oifigigh Bhreithiúnachta na Roinne breitheanna ar an teideal do shochar.  Beidh comhairle ó chomhairleoirí liachta na Roinne agus ó shaineolaí liachta le fáil ag na hoifigigh seo nuair a bhíonn gá leis.  Féadfaidh duine ar bith nach bhfuil sásta le breith oifigigh breithiúnachta achomharc a dhéanamh ach ní bheidh ceart ag duine achomharc a dhéanamh in éadan meastachán sealadach sochair. Breathnófar ar na meastacháin seo taréis beagán ama.  Tá forálacha freisin san mBille a chuireann de dhualgas ar na hoibrithe fógraí a thabhairt dá bhfhostóirí i dtaobh timpistí a b'fhéidir go n-éireodh éilimh astu.  Beidh sé de dhualgas ar na fostóirí freisin faoi fhorálacha an Bhille fógraí a thabhairt i dtaobh timpistí agus gach eolas is gá a thabhairt i dtaobh na n-éileamh.</P>
    <P>Céim mhór ar aghaidh i gcúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh is ea an Bille seo agus molaim don Dáil glacadh leis.</P>
    <P>For almost 70 years, since the first Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897, the compensation of workmen for employment injury, irrespective of any question of negligence, has been a direct liability, imposed by law, on the workman's employer.  Under the existing Acts insurance by an employer to cover his liability is optional and it <Col N="114" /> is a matter for the workman to make his claim and, in the event of dispute, to take steps to enforce it in the courts.  The present levels of compensation, as last revised in the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1955, are briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>for total or partial incapacity for work, a maximum weekly payment of £4 10s. 0d. which may in defined circumstances be commuted into a lump sum on the application of either the employer or the workman &mdash;in other words it may be commuted into a lump sum without the consent of the workman&mdash;for medical expenses of an injured workman, a sum not exceeding £5 which a Court may order an employer to pay in addition to compensation; and for fatal accidents, a maximum payment by way of lump sum of £900 if there are adult dependants only or £1,800 where there are child dependants under the age of 16.  A sum of £15, for medical expenses and burial, may be paid if there are no dependants.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of this Bill, which replaces the present system of workmen's compensation by extending the existing social insurance scheme to provide for occupational injuries and diseases, is to provide better benefits, at reasonable cost to employers, for injured workmen and their dependants. Compensation for employment injury will henceforward be a social service rather than an obligation on an individual employer.</P>
    <P>In December, 1955, the then Minister for Social Welfare set up a Commission to examine and report on the present system of workmen's compensation and its possible replacement by a scheme of national insurance, or otherwise.  The Commission, whose members I would again like to thank for the very valuable work they did and for the time and care they devoted to their difficult task, made an exhaustive and detailed examination of the present system and possible alternatives.  While agreeing that extensive changes in workmen's compensation were desirable, the Commission were unable to agree on the best method by which these should be <Col N="115" /> achieved and two reports were furnished to me in 1962.</P>
    <P>The Majority Report, signed by ten members of the Commission, favoured retention of the present system, based on direct liability of the workman's employer, with more than 70 recommended improvements.  These recommendations included compulsory insurance of employers with commercial insurance companies against their workmen's compensation liability, an increase in the maximum weekly payment of compensation from £4 10s., where pre-accident earnings are £6 or more, to £7, where pre-accident earnings exceed £11 13s. 3d., but with no allowances for dependants nor provision for loss of faculty as distinct from incapacity for work.  Pensions in lieu of lump sums for fatal accidents were also recommended.  In regard to the recommendation requiring compulsory insurance, it has to be mentioned that in addition to information that some employers were unable to insure their workers because of prohibitive premiums, the Commission received evidence that certain native timber merchants are not covered by insurance because they cannot get an insurance company to accept the risk.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommendation, therefore, as well as compelling employers to insure, would involve compulsion of insurance companies to accept certain proposals for insurance. Compulsory insurance involving the payment of premiums hitherto found to be prohibitive could of course lead to difficulties for the affected industries and hardship to the employers and workers concerned.  The Minority Report, signed by five members of the Commission, agreed with the recommendations for improvements if the existing system continued but considered that the existing system even with the improvements would not represent the best method for dealing with employment injury or disease. They proposed that the existing system of workmen's compensation be abolished and replaced by the Social Insurance Occupational Injuries Scheme which was proposed to the Commission by the Irish Congress <Col N="116" /> of Trade Unions.  This scheme was largely modelled on the industrial injuries schemes operating in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In determining the best way in which to make provision for employment injury, the principal considerations should obviously be the adequacy, both in range and amount, of the benefits to be provided to injured workmen and their dependants, and the provision of these benefits at minimum cost to employers and in such a way as to encourage as much as possible a workman's rehabilitation and return to work.  It is also, of course, important that the benefits should be available without delay and that disputes between employers and workers in obtaining them should be eliminated as far as possible.  Having most carefully considered the views of all the members of the Commission, I came to the conclusion, and I am happy to say that the Government agreed with me, that these requirements would best be met by the Bill which I am now submitting.</P>
    <P>There are a number of fundamental faults in the present system, which would still remain even if that system were improved as the majority of the Commission recommended and which make it unsatisfactory as a means of financial protection in the case of persons injured or killed at their employment. In particular, the system allows too much scope for contention between the workman and the employer or his insurance company and rests in the last resort on the threat or practice of litigation.  This tends to retard the workman's recovery and to prejudice good relations between him and his employer.  Disputes are inevitable, with consequent hardship on injured workmen and their families where wages have terminated and compensation has not commenced.  Numerous cases of this nature have come to the notice of my Department in dealing with interim claims for payment of disability benefit pending settlement of compensation claims.</P>
    <P>A system under which compensation would be payable as a social service with the employer not involved in the claim is obviously more desirable. The present system also provides <Col N="117" /> no financial aid for rehabilitation, no compensation for loss of faculty or disfigurement as distinct from incapacity for work and no allowances for dependants in respect of a non-fatal accident.  Lump sum settlements are a major feature. Besides encouraging workmen to stay away from work until they receive them, these do not, in the Government's view, ensure the maintenance of necessary weekly income for injured workmen.</P>
    <P>The system, even if the majority recommendations were implemented, would continue to be expensive and unwieldy: involving administration by insurance companies, the premiums of which would naturally include some element of profit; adjudication by the courts; a separate agency endeavouring to enforce compulsory insurance; a separate bureau for ensuring payment of compensation due where liability is not met otherwise; and, finally, a multiplicity of insurance companies lacking the procedural uniformity inherent in a centralised organisation and failing to provide security for injured workmen such as that which they now enjoy in regard to disability and unemployment benefits.  The cost of administration of any such arrangement would be unnecessarily high and excessive by comparison with the scheme now proposed.</P>
    <P>In the matter of overall cost, the contributions of employers under the Bill, to which I will refer at more length later, will amount to about £2,500,000 a year.  This, together with their independent liability for common law damages, which was put by the Commission at between £930,000 and £1,150,000 if all employers were to insure against this risk, gives a total cost to employers of about £3,600,000 taking the higher figure.  On the other hand, the majority of the commission calculated the cost of workmen's compensation with their improvements, and also including common law insurance, at between £2,990,000 and £3,190,000, while the minority of the commission disagreeing with these figures, put this cost at between £3,698,000 and £3,944,000.  These estimates <Col N="118" /> of the majority and minority did not, however, cover the cost of inpatient hospital services and outpatient specialist medical services to insured persons which the majority recommended should be met by the Social Insurance Fund, or the cost of enforcing compulsory insurance of workmen's compensation liability and of paying disability benefit to a workman immediately on his being entitled thereto without taking into account any question of his claim to workmen's compensation, which were also recommended. Including these costs, other than the cost of the medical services which were to be financed by increased contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, the total cost on the basis of the majority estimate could amount to £4,040,000 and, on the basis of the minority estimate, £4,794,000, and would involve also a small increase in the cost of the social insurance stamp.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to qualify the figures quoted by pointing out, as the Commission itself did, that any comparison of costs of this nature is fraught with uncertainty and it is not possible to indicate more than a general order of magnitude.  I mention these figures merely to show in a general way that the cost of this scheme is not excessive by comparison with what employers would have had to pay if the majority proposals had been accepted.  This is particularly so when one considers that the principal benefits in the Bill are about 18 per cent higher than those recommended by the minority in 1962 and, if a similar increase were made in the majority rates of compensation, their costs of their proposals as indicated above would be so much greater.  It is, then, practically certain that the majority proposals would be more expensive than the proposals in this Bill which provides for benefits which are far superior.</P>
    <P>While a comparison of overall costs can only be made in very general terms, a firmer assessment is possible regarding the proportion of contribution income to be returned in benefit. In this respect we can look to what has happened in the past when insurance companies provided cover against <Col N="119" /> employers' liability including workmen's compensation.  In this connection I will quote from the report of the minority of the Commission, who said:</P>
    <P>Over the 33 years of the operation of the existing system for which figures are available to us, that is, from 1927 to 1959, less than 9/3d found its way into the hands of injured workmen in the form of workmen's compensation and damages at common law out of every £1 charged in premiums by the commercial insurance companies.  Because of the very high awards in the Courts and settlements made out of Court in common law cases the actual amount out of each £1 of premium paid in compensation must have been significantly less than that figure.  The balance of the £1 went to increase reserves and pay commission, expenses of management, and profits.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill, the entire income, less only costs of administration, will go in benefits to injured workmen, and, using the experience in Great Britain and Northern Ireland of a somewhat similar scheme and our own experience in administration of Social Welfare benefits, it is expected that the return in benefits should in the long-term be over 18/- in the £1.  Moreover, the application of flat rate contributions to be collected on a single stamp with existing social insurance contributions, and involving no new enforcement machinery, and flat-rate benefits together with claims administration by one centralised Government Department rather than the involved system which I have already described dispersed over a number of insurance companies will clearly result in a considerable reduction in administration costs.  Employers will, therefore, pay far less under the proposed scheme than they would have to pay if comparable amounts were to be paid to workmen by way of compensation under the existing system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the most important question of benefits, Deputies will <Col N="120" /> appreciate the obvious merit of the scheme in providing workmen and their dependants with a guaranteed payment, easily secured without recourse to litigation or dispute with employers.  As I have already stated, the present system relies, in the last resort, on the threat or practice of litigation and this can place the injured workman in a very vulnerable position.  The natural hesitancy of workmen, particularly those who look forward to resuming employment, to take court action against their employer, can result in workmen settling for less compensation than is properly due to them.  On the other hand, it may happen that an employer who does not desire to take court action himself is forced to do so by his insurance company.  The new arrangements will eliminate these objectionable features of the present system and thereby contribute towards more harmonious relations between employers and workers.</P>
    <P>The range and amounts of the benefits provided are superior to those now afforded under the workmen's compensation system and to those recommended in the Majority Report.  In regard to the increased range of benefits I would point to the provisions in the Bill for payments in respect of dependants and in respect of loss of faculty irrespective of whether there is incapacity for work, for pensions instead of lump sums in respect of both fatal and non-fatal accidents, for constant attendance required by a seriously disabled workman, and for medical care expenses.  I consider the elimination of lump sum settlements of weekly payments of compensation to be a decided improvement.  There can be few Deputies who have not come across cases in which the acceptance of lump sums has resulted in considerable and prolonged hardship due to the money being dissipated long before the need for compensation ended.</P>
    <P>Information regarding the persons to be covered by the scheme and the benefits provided is given in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, and I will confine myself <Col N="121" /> here to an outline, with some elaboration, of the main features. First, a word about the persons who will benefit under these proposals. Broadly speaking, the scheme will require compulsory insurance against personal injury caused by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, and against prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment, of all persons who are employed under a contract of service, other than non-manual workers whose remuneration exceeds £1,200 a year.</P>
    <P>Subject to this limit, the scheme will also cover civil servants and public and local authority officials but not members of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána who are not now covered by workmen's compensation but who are provided for by special schemes.  Persons such as taxi drivers employed in plying for hire under a contract of bailment are also included. The scheme will cover employed persons under the age of 16 and over age 70 who are not now insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  However, contributions, to which I will refer later, will not be payable for children under age 16.</P>
    <P>The scheme will, therefore apply to persons now covered by the Workmen's Compensation Acts with the addition of persons in non-manual employment earning between £600 and £1,200 a year, and some others including certain share-fishermen.  All share-fishermen under contract of service will be covered and, in addition, wholetime share-fishermen whether under contract of service or not.</P>
    <P>I should add in reference to the coverage of civil servants that it is intended to modify the provisions of the Act, using regulatory powers conferred by section 12 of the Principal Act, the Social Welfare Act, 1952, so that established civil servants, will be ineligible to receive benefits under the scheme for the first six months following an accident and will only receive reduced benefits thereafter.  The sick pay and pension arrangements of such persons will be adjusted in such a way as to ensure that they do not receive less than they would have done if they <Col N="122" /> were fully qualified under the scheme. There will be a corresponding reduction in the insurance contribution payable for such persons.</P>
    <P>In regard to the type of accident to be covered, the existing Acts provide compensation for an accident &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of the employment&rdquo; and this is to be the condition for benefit under this Bill. It was put to the Commission on Workmen's Compensation that the expression &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of employment&rdquo; has occasioned a great volume of expensive litigation, that its meaning is obscure and that the legal interpretation of these words has resulted in inequitable decisions which caused much hardship to workers in the past.  As the expression is used in most systems of employment injury throughout the world, including the current industrial injuries legislation in Britain and Northern Ireland, and as its meaning is well settled as a result of decisions over the past 60 years, the Commission recommended that it should be retained.</P>
    <P>They were agreed, however, that certain judicial interpretations of the expression have created hardship in some cases, chiefly due to the fact that the onus of proof rests upon the workman, and they accordingly recommend that the general condition of &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of the employment&rdquo; should be qualified in various ways so as to give a presumption in favour of the workman in cases where hardship could otherwise result.  The suggestions of the Commission in this regard are being implemented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A change of particular importance is that an accident arising in the course of employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, also to have arisen out of the employment. The onus of proving that an accident arose in the course of the employment will remain on the claimant to benefit, but he will not be obliged, as at present, to show beyond doubt that it arose out of the employment. To achieve this, he would have to establish that it arose because he was doing something which he was employed to do, or because the nature <Col N="123" /> of the employment exposed him to some particular risk.</P>
    <P>It is, for example, a common occurrence for skilled workmen to assist labourers to load and unload lorries so as to save time, but a carpenter, say, who helps to unload timber from a lorry from this motive could, under the present Acts, be refused compensation if he were injured in the process.  The benefit of any doubt will be given to the workman in such cases in future.  Another provision of this nature is to the effect that an accident happening in the course of employment which is due to another person's misconduct, or to the insured person being struck by any object or by lightning will be treated as arising out of his employment if he in no way contributed to the accident by an action not incidental to his employment.  A provision of this nature was introduced in Britain and Northern Ireland in 1961 and an example given was of a bus conductor attacked by youths while on duty.  It is clearly reasonable that compensation should be provided in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in reply to a question in this House on 19th June, 1963, that the question of accidents due to lightning would be considered in connection with amending legislation. Accidents from this cause are specially referred to in the new provision and the position under which compensation could be refused in respect of a road-worker killed by lightning while cleaning out gullies to prevent flooding is, I am happy to say, now to be corrected. Another type of case which is specifically dealt with is that of a worker injured in an accident which occurs while he is travelling to or from his place of work in transport provided by or on behalf of his employer, other than transport operated as part of a public transport service.  In the past, such cases have been compensated only where there was a contractual obligation to use the transport provided.</P>
    <P>Special provision is also made to cover people injured in real or supposed emergencies on their employers' premises and apprentices injured while <Col N="124" /> in attendance at a technical school or other place for training or instruction. In regard to the latter provision, instances were reported to the Comission on Workmen's Compensation of apprentices who were required by their employers, or by the terms of their contract, to attend technical schools or other place of instruction and who were not compensated for accidents on the ground that they were not working in their employment when the accidents occurred.  Benefit will not be refused in respect of accidents which are due to a workman's misconduct. Under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, compensation is not payable where the accident is attributable to the serious and wilful misconduct of the workman unless the injury results in death or in serious and permanent disablement.  Consequently, compensation is not with held if the consequences of the accident are serious but penalties are imposed if they are not.</P>
    <P>The restriction of benefit to serious injury or death in such cases was dropped in Britain and Northern Ireland when their industrial injuries schemes commenced in 1948, it being pointed out at the time that while this might be justified by some kind of logic it was a source of considerable irritation in practice and its removal would be welcomed, and that in any event, before benefit becomes payable it must be shown that the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment.  A somewhat similar change is made in regard to injuries which result from an action performed in contravention of statutory requirements or employer's orders.  These will not be excluded so long as the act was done for the purposes of, and in connection with, the employer's trade or business, provided that the accident is such that it would have been regarded as arising out of and in the course of employment if it had not been the result of breach of orders by the workman.  Under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the injuries in such a case would be compensated only where they resulted in death or serious and permanent disablement.</P>
    <P>Finally, as a general comment on the new provisions easing the conditions <Col N="125" /> for obtaining employment injury benefits, I would mention that as early as 1925 the International Labour Office, in a survey of workmen's compensation for industrial accidents, stated that &ldquo;everywhere modern compensation legislation tends increasingly to disregard the legal notion of fault and to take more and more into consideration the economic need for enlarging the sphere of occupational risk&rdquo;, while in a later survey in 1936, that Office stated &ldquo;the principle of occupational risk ... has gradually replaced throughout the world the principle of employers' liability for industrial accidents as the legal basis for the right to compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Turning to the details of the benefits under the scheme, the initial benefit for a workman meeting with an employment accident will be injury benefit. This will be paid, within the limit of pre-accident earnings, at a weekly rate of 115/- for the first twenty-six weeks of incapacity for work, with increases for adult and child dependants at rates similar to those applying in the case of disability benefit and unemployment benefit under the existing social insurance scheme, that is 40/- a week for an adult dependant, 13/- for each of the first two children and 8/- for each other child.  Adult dependants will, as in the case of existing social insurance benefits, be a wife, dependent husband or woman looking after a widower's children, but the children to be treated as dependants will include, as well as all children under age 16, those between 16 and 18 if they are at school, in apprenticeship at low earnings or are invalids.</P>
    <P>Married women who are maintained by their husbands will receive a reduced benefit but other married women and all single women and widows will receive the same benefit as men.  The present arrangement whereby workmen's compensation is payable for the first three days of incapacity for work when the incapacity lasts for at least two weeks is being continued in the new scheme and injury benefit will, therefore, be paid for the first three days when the recipient has been incapable of work for 12 days, excluding Sundays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> In the majority of work accidents, the workman is able to resume work after a relatively short absence with no continuing ill effects.  Consequently, it is expected that in most cases compensation will be by way of injury benefit only.  However, where the effects of the accident continue beyond the period of injury benefit the workman will be given a long-term benefit related to the degree of his disablement or loss of faculty, that is to say, a benefit in respect of his loss of health, strength and the power to enjoy life.  This will be paid by way of a pension except in cases of relatively minor disablement where a pension, if payable, would be very small and the payment will instead take the form of a lump sum.</P>
    <P>This benefit, since it is not dependent on incapacity for work, may be paid to a person who has resumed work and, in this sense, corresponds to the existing provision whereby Workmen's Compensation may be paid to a person who is not incapable of work but has suffered some loss of earnings as a result of a work-accident. The new benefit, however, avoids the anomalies in the existing system under which a man's potential post-accident earnings are taken into account even though he is not receiving such earnings. Any such arrangement of reckoning notional earnings must inhibit a workman from undergoing rehabilitative measures.</P>
    <P>The new benefit also has the merit that compensation will be payable where loss of faculty does not entail any loss of earnings but nonetheless leaves the workman under a possible life-long handicap.  This will remedy the situation which can arise under the present system whereby, for example, a girl who has facial disfigurement as a result of an accident at work receives no compensation except and in so far as she has suffered loss of earnings.  The rate of this benefit for total loss of faculty will correspond to the personal rate of injury benefit, 115/- a week in the case of a man, and proportionate reduced rates will be payable where loss of faculty is less than total.</P>
    <P>A person receiving disablement benefit who is incapable of work or <Col N="127" /> who is unemployed may receive disability or unemployment benefit, if he is otherwise qualified therefor, in addition.  A special supplement to disablement benefit, unemployability supplement, is provided in the scheme, to ensure that persons who are permanently incapable of work as a result of occupational accident or disease will receive a payment corresponding to disability benefit at maximum rate, with increases for dependants.  One important feature of the supplement is that in determining whether a person is permanently incapable of work, the fact that he is earning, or may be able to earn, up to £104 a year will be disregarded.</P>
    <P>A further supplement of up to 40/-a week, or 80/- a week in exceptional cases, will be provided for persons who are 100 per cent disabled and are in need of constant attendance, otherwise than in hospital.  This supplement will be paid irrespective of whether the attendance given is paid for or not, and, indeed, would be payable where the attendance is given by the workman's wife or other member of his family.  It will be seen, therefore, that a man with a wife and two children who is permanently and totally disabled as a result of a work-accident may, subject to a limit of his pre-accident earnings, receive payments amounting to £15 13s. 6d, including the maximum allowance of £4 a week for constant attendance.</P>
    <P>As a final word in regard to disablement benefit, provision is made in the scheme for the payment of disablement pension at the 100 per cent rate during any period in which the beneficiary is receiving in-patient hospital treatment required by his injury or loss of faculty, even though his loss of faculty would not otherwise warrant a 100 per cent pension.  This provision, taken in conjunction with the payment of all his medical care expenses and entitlement to disability benefit or unemployability supplement will ensure that injured workmen are in no way deterred from undergoing treatment for their condition, including rehabilitation measures where these are suitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> Dealing now with the benefits payable when a workman dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease, provision is made whereby the widow of such a workman will receive a pension of 95/- a week, together with allowances for children as in the case of injury benefit.  A similar pension, with allowances for children, will be paid to a dependent widower of a woman who dies as a result of an employment accident or disease.  To qualify for a pension the widower must be permanently incapable of self-support by reason of physical or mental infirmity.  If he is not permanently incapable of self-support but was dependent on his wife at her death, he will receive a gratuity of £247, the equivalent of one year's pension.  A pension granted to a widow will, as in the case of a widow's pension under the existing Social Welfare Acts, cease on her re-marriage.  Pensions at the rate of 24/- a week will be payable to the dependent parents of a workman who dies as a result of a work-accident. If both parents were dependent, i.e. wholly or mainly maintained, two pensions will be paid.  An orphan's pension of 47/6d a week will be granted in respect of an orphaned child or step-child of the workman and also for any orphaned child who was dependent on the workman at his death.</P>
    <P>A funeral grant of £50 will be payable to the legal personal representative of the deceased but if there is no next-of-kin the £50 or a lesser sum if the funeral expenses are less than £50, will be paid to any person who has paid or is due the funeral expenses.</P>
    <P>In addition to the benefits which I have outlined, injured workmen, or their dependants in fatal cases, will be entitled to any reasonable and necessary medical expenses incurred by a workman as a result of a work-accident. Under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the only payment provided in respect of the medical expenses of an injured workman is a sum of up to £5 which a court may direct an employer to pay in addition to the compensation for which he is liable.  The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952, of the <Col N="129" /> International Labour Organisation, requires that an employment injury benefit scheme should provide for free medical care, comprising, briefly, medical, surgical and pharmaceutical aid, including hospitalisation, and the supply and renewal of artificial limbs and surgical appliances.</P>
    <P>As the Commission on Workmen's Compensation points out, a convention of this nature represents the general agreement of informed world opinion, and, indeed many countries elsewhere have adopted these standards of medical care in whole or in part.  Our present system of workmen's compensation, under which not more than £5 is provided for medical expenses, does not by any means reach those standards and the proposals for the payment of medical expenses in this Bill will remove this serious deficiency in the existing system.  Injured workmen will, as insured persons under the Social Welfare Acts, be eligible for the benefits provided under the Health Acts and Mental Treatment Acts and for treatment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Unless, however, they are in the lower income group they will not be eligible under the Health or Mental Treatment Acts for general practitioner services and medicines or appliances supplied outside hospital, and they will be liable for charges of up to 10/- a day for impatient hospital treatment, 7/6d for an x-ray or 2/6d for any other treatment as a hospital outpatient.  The cost to the injured workman of all of these services will be met under the new scheme.  The cost will, of course, be limited to that which arises after the services provided under the Health Acts, Mental Treatment Acts or by way of treatment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts have been fully availed of.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, compensation is at present payable in respect of certain industrial diseases which are scheduled under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  The new scheme will also apply to diseases which are due to the nature of a person's employment, and provision is made for the making of regulations under which the diseases to be covered will be prescribed <Col N="130" /> and the provisions of the scheme will be adapted to these special cases.  The provisions dealing with the coverage of diseases under the existing Acts were examined by the Commission on Workmen's Compensation who found them to be too rigid. They, therefore, recommended adoption of provision in the Workmen's Compensation Acts similar to that now made in this scheme.  The extent to which diseases will be covered by the scheme will be a continuing process and the list will, from time to time, be added to as our pattern of industry changes and as new diseases manifest themselves.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health will, of course, be consulted in regard to the appropriations or otherwise of prescribing a particular disease.  I should mention that it is intended to cover from the outset all the diseases at present scheduled under the Workmen's Compensation Acts with certain additions.  In particular, the present coverage in respect of pneumoconiosis which is limited to coal mining or the search for coal will be extended so as to apply to any mining operation.  A further addition of particular interest to farm workers will be the disease known as Weil's disease.  Certain other diseases which are required to be covered by International Convention but which are not now covered by the Workmen's Compensation Acts will also receive immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>The Workmen's Compensation Acts will be repealed as from the appointed day but employers will continue to be liable to pay compensation under those Acts in respect of accidents which occurred or diseases which were contracted before that date.  The position of workmen receiving compensation under the existing Acts and who therefore do not come within the ambit of the new scheme has been carefully considered and it has been decided that some increase should be provided in this Bill.  To increase the maximum weekly amount payable under the Workmen's Compensation Acts would increase the existing liabilities of individual employers or their insurance companies and it is proposed instead that any increases granted will be met <Col N="131" /> from the contributions by the general body of employers to the Occupational Injuries Fund set up for this scheme.</P>
    <P>Regulations to be made under the Bill will enable workmen's compensation recipients, who are permanently incapable of work or of earning more than £104 a year, to receive the unemployability supplement, with additions for adult and child dependants, which will be provided to a disablement pensioner in similar circumstances.  The regulations will also give recipients of workmen's compensation who are 100 per cent disabled the same right to a constant attendance allowance of up to 40/- a week, or 80/- a week if exceptionally severely disabled, as recipients of 100 per cent disablement pension.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to amend the regulations made under the Social Welfare Acts for payment of disability benefit with workmen's compensation so that concurrent payment of both benefits will be possible in cases where the supplement to which I have just referred is not payable.  As Deputies are aware, disability benefit is not now payable with workmen's compensation except to the extent that such benefit exceeds the compensation.  Since the standard rate of disability benefit for a man and wife will, from January next, be 92/6d, this means that a married man in receipt of workmen's compensation will, from the appointed day, be eligible to receive an increase of £4. 10. 0d a week if he is incapable of work or, being permanently so incapable, of earning more than £104 a year, and up to £8. 10. 0. if he is in need of constant attendance, subject to the limitation that overall payments will not exceed pre-accident earnings.</P>
    <P>The persons who will be eligible to receive these additional payments are those who were at any time on or after 1st October, 1965, entitled to weekly payments of workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the provision in the Bill which limits the total amount which may be paid by way of benefits, including any increases, in non-fatal cases to the amount of the workman's pre-accident earnings.  Earnings for <Col N="132" /> this purpose will be those at the time of the accident in the employment in which the accident occurred and will include perquisites or wages in kind, such as meals supplied to agricultural workers.  Overtime payments will be excluded but where a person was working part-time, or was on short time, his earnings will be made up to the amount payable for a full normal working week in his employment.  If his employer has nobody employed full-time at the same work the earnings of another worker in similar employment in the same district may be taken into account in calculating the earnings.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of pre-accident earnings as the earnings, disregarding over-time or short-time, at the time of the accident rather than, as in the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the average earnings received over a period immediately before the accident follows on a detailed examination of the existing provision by the Workmen's Compensation Commission.  The Commission came to the conclusion that in arriving at earnings greater weight should be attached to the fact that it was while the workman was in the service of a particular employer, and engaged on the particular work required by that employer, that he suffered injury, and accordingly it is more equitable and simpler to relate compensation to the weekly rate of wages payable at the time of the accident by that employer. No justification was seen for taking a rate greater or smaller than that actually in payment at the time of the accident by averaging that rate with rates paid by other employers for other work.  No reduction on account of earnings will be made in the gratuities which will be payable where disablement is less than 20 per cent and a minimum payment, equivalent to the amount payable by way of pension for disablement of 20 per cent, will be made in all injury benefit and disablement pension cases.</P>
    <P>As disablement pension, including any increase for dependants, unemployability or constant attendance, will be liable to reduction because of pre-accident earnings, provision is also made that disablement pension may <Col N="133" /> be reduced where the amount of the pension, together with any disability benefit, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance payable, is greater than the pre-accident earnings. There is also provision for review of the reduced amount of pension payable, in any case where the wages in the employment have increased since the date of the accident or where an apprentice or other young person would, were it not for the accident, have reached full adult wages.</P>
    <P>Since a limitation by reference to earnings is to be placed on the amount of benefits payable to injured workmen for future accidents it is right that a similar limitation should also be applied to the weekly amounts which will be payable under this scheme by way of any supplement to workmen's compensation in respect of unemployability or constant attendance.  Provision is accordingly included for a reduction of a person's weekly payment under the scheme if such payment along with his weekly payment of workmen's compensation would exceed the weekly earnings for the time being in the employment in which the accident occurred or the disease was contracted.  A similar limitation will be applied in relation to disability benefit payable with workmen's compensation under the regulations, to which I have already referred, which will permit full payment of that benefit with workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be administered by using the existing machinery in my Department for the determination of claims to social welfare benefits and by extending such administrative machinery where necessary.  Claims for benefit will need to be supported by confirmation from the employer as to the circumstances of the accident or disease, and where the benefit claim is based on incapacity for work, periodic medical evidence will be required as in the case of claims to disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts at present.  Claims will be decided by deciding officers, who will refer questions of a medical nature, in particular questions regarding degrees of disablement, to medical referees in my Department.  Specialist medical advice <Col N="134" /> will be obtained where this is considered necessary.</P>
    <P>A claimant will have a right of appeal against the decision of a deciding officer except in regard to short-term provisional assessments of disablement which of their nature are tentative and must be reviewed in any event.  Appeals will be decided by appeals officers of my Department who may obtain further specialist advice on medical questions.  Decisions by appeals officers on benefit claims will, as in the case of existing social welfare benefits, be final, subject to review only if new information as to the facts of the case comes to light or if there has been a change of circumstances which would warrant a revision of the decision.  Any question of insurability will be determined by a deciding officer and there will be a right of appeal to an appeals officer with a further right of appeal to the High Court on a question of law.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the circumstances of accidents will be recorded as early as possible after their occurrence and to facilitate the making of claims, provision is made for the giving of notice by workers to their employers of accidents which may give rise to claims, and for reports by employers of such accidents.  There will also be arrangements whereby a workman who meets with an accident may seek a declaration that the accident arose out of and in the course of insurable employment, even if he is not immediately incapacitated or disabled, so that in the event of his being incapacitated or disabled in the future his right to benefit will be secured.  Employers will also be required to furnish any information required for the purpose of deciding any claim, or application for declaration such as I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The provision for disqualifying a person for receipt of injury benefit or disablement benefit for a period of up to six weeks for failure, without a good reason, to undergo medical examination or treatment or to observe rules of behaviour, is on similar lines to that already provided under the Social Welfare Acts in relation to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> The duty of training disabled persons for employment suitable to their condition of health and for the making of arrangements with employers for placing disabled persons in suitable employment is, under the Health Acts, vested in local health authorities. Persons in receipt of occupational injuries benefits will be encouraged to avail themselves of these and any other rehabilitation services, and provision has been made in the Bill for a grant to be made out of the Occupational Injuries Fund, if necessary, towards the cost.  Furthermore, recipients of disablement benefit receiving rehabilitation treatment as inpatients will be entitled to pension at the full 100 per cent, rate, with increases for dependants, and will be eligible to receive disability benefit or unemployability supplement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision enabling financial assistance to be given to persons engaged on research into the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and diseases, and indeed for the Minister himself to employ persons to carry out such research, my Department will be very much concerned with the question of safety measures for all persons who will be covered by the scheme, in particular those whose safe conditions of working are not the specific concern of any Department at present.  Comprehensive statistics of the incidence of occupational accidents and diseases do not exist at present and the experience of claims under the Bill and the information regarding accidents and diseases given therein will provide a new and very valuable basis on which to direct lines of inquiry into accident and disease prevention. The provision will also enable research to be carried out for the purpose of determining whether particular diseases, or injuries not caused by accident, should be prescribed for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the cost of the scheme.  I will deal now with the method of providing the funds to meet such cost.  The scheme in general applies only to accidents occuring or diseases developing on or after the <Col N="136" /> appointed day, although some provision is made for increases for existing workmen's compensation cases. The benefits include long-term payments by way of disablement pension and supplements, and survivors pensions. Yearly expenditure on benefits will, therefore, increase progressively over a considerable period of years until stability is reached.</P>
    <P>The rates of contributions have been determined on a funded basis with the purpose of achieving an ultimate position of financial stability in which annual income, allowing for interest accruing from excess contributions in the earlier years, and outgo will balance.  This means that the increased expenditure arising in later years from the growth in the number of pensions and supplements in payment will be met without the necessity of increasing the rates of contributions now provided.  These are 2s. 1d for male employees and 1s. 6d for female employees and will, it is estimated, cover all the costs arising from the scheme. These are: the expenditure on occupational injuries benefits, payments in respect of medical care, payment of disability benefit with disablement benefit, the cost of supplements to workmen's compensation payments, including disability benefit paid with such compensation, payments towards rehabilitation and research, and the cost of administration.  The contributions will be payable by employers.</P>
    <P>Under the existing workmen's compensation scheme, employers are liable to pay the compensation provided under the Acts for injured workmen, and if they insure against this risk they must bear the full cost of the insurance.  The contributions payable in future will form part of the overall social insurance contribution except where the person is insured for occupational injuries purposes only, e.g. persons over age 70.  Contributions will not be payable for persons under the age of 16 and their title to injury benefit will be limited by regulations.</P>
    <P>All contributions collected will be paid into a new fund, the Occupational Injuries Fund, which will meet all payments to be made under the scheme. <Col N="137" /> There is provision for actuarial reviews at five-yearly intervals so as to ensure that the contributions are adequate to keep the Fund solvent at all times.  As payments, especially payments to recipients of workmen's compensation, may have to be met in the early stages before sufficient contributions are paid into the Fund, there is also provision for borrowing from the Exchequer during the first two years of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that disablement benefit, which is payable in respect of loss of faculty, may be paid along with any other benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, e.g., disability benefit. Disability benefit, which is a payment in respect of incapacity for work, will not, however, be paid concurrently with injury benefit or with unemployability supplement, which are also payable for incapacity, and as such, cover the same contingency.  Similarly a widow's or orphan's pension under the existing Acts will not be paid concurrently with a widow's or orphan's pension under this scheme.  These and other provisions necessary to ensure that there will not be double payment for the same contingency will be made in overlapping benefits regulations under the existing Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a very important feature of compensation for employment accidents and diseases which remains to be dealt with.  I refer to the question of damages which may be claimed by an injured person from a wrongdoer.  This right of taking an action for damages in respect of a wrong is not, of course, confined to employment injury but this is the only aspect which arises in this Bill.  At present if a workman is injured in circumstances which would give him a title to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts and the circumstances are also such that he would have a claim for damages against his employer or a third party, based on negligence, he may be paid the compensation or the damages but not both.  If he has accepted workmen's compensation he may make his claim at common law as well, but if the claim for damages succeeds any <Col N="138" /> amount paid by way of workmen's compensation is recoverable by the employer.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to remove a person's existing right to claim damages under the Civil Liability Acts, 1961 and 1964, or otherwise at common law, in respect of injuries caused by the negligence of an employer or a third party, nor is it proposed that benefits under this Bill will be reduced as a result of any award of such damages.  The Commission on Workmen's Compensation accepted in relation to such cases of double entitlement to benefit and damages that the Fund would not be relieved but that the common law damages would be limited to any margin by which the common law judgement exceeds the estimated capital value of the benefits received and to be received under the Occupational Injuries Scheme.</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing in this connection that, even with the set-off of the benefits against damages, the Commission estimated that the cost of insurance by employers against common law damages only could increase by between £100,000 and £215,000 following the introduction of a social insurance occupational injuries scheme.  To avoid a double payment to workmen by way of damages and benefit, and consequently a double charge on employers generally, it is provided in the Bill that the amount of injury benefit or disablement benefit, disregarding any increase for constant attendance but including all other increases, payable for five years from the time when the cause of action arises will be taken into account in an assessment of damages for any loss of earnings or profits accruing from the injuries.</P>
    <P>The set-off is related only to damages for loss of earnings or profits and will not therefore affect damages awarded under other headings, such as pain and suffering, which are not, strictly speaking, reckoned in the determination of benefits.  The period over which the value of benefits is to be calculated is limited to five years because, as the explanatory memorandum points out, it would generally be impracticable for a court <Col N="139" /> or jury to estimate these benefits over a longer period.  The provision made in the Bill in regard to reducing common law damages is similar to that now operating in Britain and Northern Ireland, except that, under their arrangements, workers share in the financing of the industrial injuries scheme and consequently only one half of the benefits received in the first five years is set off against damages. The provision for reducing damages does not apply, except in regard to funeral expenses, to damages awarded to dependants of persons fatally injured.  It is considered right that in such cases, which are few in number, the widow or other dependant should receive the pension provided under the scheme and the common-law lump sum as well.  A widow's pension under the existing Acts is disregarded in the assessment of common law damages.</P>
    <P>Regard has been had in the preparation of this Bill to the most modern international concepts in the matter of compensation for employment injury.  I have already referred to the requirements of the International Labour Organisation's Minimum Standards Convention of 1952 in regard to medical care but a more comprehensive measure was adopted by that Organisation only last year&mdash;the Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964.  This Convention revised and considerably raised the standards of a number of pre-war Conventions, many of the provisions of which had been found by the International Labour Organisation to correspond no longer to the concepts and practices which have evolved since they were adopted.  This country had not reached the position of being able to comply with even the lower standards provided for in the earlier Conventions.  Compliance with the standards set by the new Convention, which has been achieved in this scheme, will mean that this country has made a significant step forward in the field of social security and be, for the first time, in the forefront of those countries which have highly developed systems of insurance against occupational injury and disease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> As a final word, I should mention that this Bill has been drafted by way of amendment of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the basic social insurance Act.  This will enable the new benefits to be operated within the existing machinery and obviates duplication of the general provisions required to deal with, for example, decisions on claims, appeals, overlapping benefits, etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a major advance in our social services, a completely new method of dealing with employment injury, and a greatly improved system of recompense for those injured while engaged not only in making their own livelihood but in contributing to the national economy.</P>
    <P>As the Commission on Workmen's Compensation pointed out, however, it has long been recognised that compensation is not to be measured solely by cash and the restoration of the injured workman to full working capacity or to the maximum fitness that any residual disablement would allow is just as important, if not more so.  This latter objective was constantly in mind in preparing this Bill.  While providing substantially better cash benefits, provisions, such as now exist, which could inhibit a workman's rehabilitation have been studiously avoided.  On the contrary, many provisions designed to assist and encourage medical treatment and rehabilitation have, as I have already shown, been specifically included.</P>
    <P>I have, I think, given a reasonable summary of the provisions of the Bill, and I trust that those Deputies who have been pressing for the introduction of an earlier Bill will accept that it was worthwhile to examine methodically and thoroughly all aspects of the problem of employment injury and disease rather than precipitately introduce a measure which would be less satisfactory or comprehensive than the present Bill, which I now commend for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Because this Bill proposes, even though belatedly, to increase the compensation and other benefits payable to injured workmen in the course of their employment, we accept it; but, because <Col N="141" /> the Bill proposes to make the payment of compensation to injured workmen dependent on the decision of an official of the Minister's Department, with the right of appeal to another official of the same Department, and with no right of appeal to a truly independent tribunal of any sort, we cannot be enthusiastic about the Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, compensation for accidents to workmen, arising in the course of their employment, has since 1897 been payable under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  For over 30 years now, the Act which has governed the payment of compensation in these cases is the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934.  By and large, that Act operated very well.  It gave general satisfaction both to the employers and employees.  In case of dispute arising under that Act between a workman and his employer, the dispute was adjudicated upon by the Circuit Court and it should be said at this stage that down through the years Circuit Court judges operated that Act with great sympathy and understanding, and in case of doubt practically invariably came down on the side of the workman because they felt that it was better to err on the side of mercy and on the side of the workman if a mistake had to be made or if there was any doubt in the case presented to them.</P>
      <P>When we come to the later Stages of the Bill, I will be pointing out the differences between the workmen's compensation code as it has been operated here down through the years and the proposals contained in the Bill.  As I have said, the code worked very well and gave general satisfaction until the payments under the existing enactments became grossly inadequate, having regard to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1934 Act was introduced, a workman who was totally incapacitated became entitled to the small weekly payment of £1. 10/-.  After the commencement of the Second World War, that was increased by special order, if I am not greatly mistaken, to 37/6d a week and remained at that figure until the year 1955 when it was increased by the Workmen's Compensation <Col N="142" /> Act of that year to £4. 10/-.  The weekly compensation payable to a workman has stood at that figure of £4. 10/- ever since.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt whatever that for many years that weekly payment of £4. 10/- was grossly inadequate and this Party have appealed on several occasions to the Government to increase it to a figure that would be in keeping with the increase in the cost of living over the years.  The Government have not seen fit until today to accede to that request from this Party and, indeed, from other Parties in the House.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong that we should accept this Bill <i>in toto</i> as a measure without defects simply and solely &mdash;because it proposes to make good, at this late date, the wrong that workmen have been suffering since shortly after 1955.  At any time since 1955, the Minister could have brought workmen's compensation payments up to date by introducing a short Bill containing a few sections.  Therefore, in our approach to this Bill, and especially on Committee Stage, we should go through it section by section and ensure that it is improved very considerably.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has informed the House, the proposal in the Bill is to transfer the liability for compensation to workmen in respect of injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment from the employer to the State and, in particular, to the Department of Social Welfare.  It is proposed to finance the scheme by making it obligatory on employers to pay an additional social welfare contribution in respect of each employee &mdash;2/1 in respect of male employees and 1/6 in respect of female employees.</P>
    <P>There is one question which I should like to pose at this stage.  Is this scheme to afford complete indemnity by the State to workmen who receive injuries in the course of their employment or will a workman whose employer fails to pay this contribution of 2/1 per week or 1/6d per week, as the case may be, be excluded from benefit?  If he is to be excluded, it is not much of an improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Does the Minister propose to set up an organisation such as the Motor Insurers Bureau to ensure that in a case where an employer has failed to pay the contribution, the employee will be compensated?  Indeed, it would not be necessary for the Minister to set up such an organisation because he could achieve the desired result simply by saying that a workman who is injured in the course of his employment is entitled to compensation from the Department of Social Welfare, even if his employer has failed to pay a contribution in respect of him.  I should like that matter to be clarified.  It is not clear from a reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The next point I should like to raise is that if there is no such provision in the Bill, then an employee whose employer is a man of straw and who meets with an accident or is otherwise injured during the course of his employment has no redress whatever.  If I am told that if his employer has not paid a contribution in respect of him, he can claim against his employer, I say that that is of no advantage to the employee if his employer happens to be a man of straw.</P>
    <P>The next point I should like to make about the contribution, before I leave it, is that this seems to be a flat rate payable in respect of all employees. The contribution of 2/1d per week will be paid in respect of the clerical worker, just as 2/1d per week will be paid in respect of the builders' labourer or the employee operating woodwork machinery.  At the present time, of course, there are various rates of insurance premiums.  The insurance premium for a person engaged in operating woodwork machinery would be infinitely higher than that payable in respect of a clerical worker but, here, we have a flat rate, which appears to be inequitable.  It seems employers and people employed in what might be described as fairly safe occupations will be subsidising the employers and employees in the more dangerous trades and occupations.  That is one fault which is apparent in the Bill, as presented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Another matter with which the Minister dealt is the question of common law liability.  Let the House not get the idea and, certainly, let the country not get the idea that we are now, in this measure, shifting over from the employer to the State all liability in respect of injuries to workmen received in the course of their employment.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  I know the Minister has not said so but let us be clear about it.  We are now proposing to transfer to the State liability in respect of injuries to workmen arising in the course of their employment which do not entail any common law liability on the employer.  The employer, for his own protection, will still have to insure against his common law liability.  He will still have to insure against its being held that he operated an unsafe system of working, or against his own negligence, or against the negligence of one employee in relation to another.  He will have to pay to to the State 2/1d per week in respect of each workman he employs and, at the same time, pay a substantial premium to an insurance company to indemnify him against his common law liability.</P>
    <P>I think the trend in other countries has been that when workmen's compensation was transferred to the State, common law liability or claims tended to increase substantially.  I may be subject to correction but I think that has been the experience in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  Therefore it is quite likely that the insurance premiums which employers will have to pay will not be substantially reduced.  I think the increase in the weekly compensation and in the death benefits, and the provision of additional compensation for dependent children, are long overdue and I welcome those provisions.</P>
    <P>There is a new provision in the measure which, for the first time, does not relate the compensation to the amount of weekly earnings of the injured person.  A person earning £10 a week and another person earning double that amount may well get the same compensation.  I know it is provided that a workman cannot receive more compensation than wages but you <Col N="145" /> could have a case, under the proposals here, where a workman earning £10 a week might get the same compensation as a fellow workman earning double that amount.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that lump sum settlements and payments have been abolished and he thinks that is a very good thing.  What will the Minister or his advisers do in a case of doubt, in a case where it is difficult to decide whether or not a man is incapacitated?  Under the code at the present time, the lump sum settlement was a very satisfactory way out in such cases.  That has been removed from the present scheme.  I think a pension for a dependent widow is a more satisfactory compensation for the death of her husband than a lump sum because it protects her from extravagance or from wasting the compensation she receives.</P>
    <P>Before leaving that aspect of compensation, I should say the Minister has pointed out that a widow who becomes entitled to a pension under this scheme will not be entitled to a widow's pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  The Minister realises, of course, that she may have contributed for a great number of years to the social welfare scheme and have become entitled to a widow's contributory pension.  Notwithstanding that fact, she will not be given that pension under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I notice that dependants appear to be confined to widows, widowers, orphans and parents.  Under the code which we are now replacing, a dependent brother or sister or other collateral relations of a workman, were compensated.  They are being excluded from this measure.  In many cases in this country brothers and sisters are real dependants of workmen and are looked after by them.  Notwithstanding that, they seem to be excluded from this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that damages at common law will be reduced by the amount of payments under this scheme calculated over a period of five years.  In England and Northern Ireland, only one half of those benefits are taken into account in assessing damages at common law. <Col N="146" /> The Minister should have followed the precedent set in England and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, my main objection to this new scheme is that the workman will be placed at the mercy of the Department of Social Welfare and that he will get much less sympathetic consideration from the deciding officer and the appeals officer who, I insist, are really full-time officers of the Minister's Department, who are really anonymous persons, than he would get from an independent tribunal.  I am not here making a case that the present method of appeal to the Circuit Court should be retained as it is.  I am not even making the case here that both branches of the legal profession should be heard by the independent tribunal to which I have referred, but I do insist that the workmen of this country will regret the day their right to compensation for injuries is decided by a deciding officer and an appeals officer of the Department of Social Welfare than by a Circuit Court judge or some other absolutely independent and unbiased tribunal.</P>
    <P>People who have served long years in the Department of Social Welfare become biased unconsciously and quite honestly against claimants, and believe that all claimants are malingerers. Some years ago I acted as chairman of a board of referees, a tribunal which decided whether a workman was entitled to unemployment benefit or not.  As chairman of that board, I had as registrar a civil servant who I am sure is not now in the service.  Every time I found in favour of a workman, he appeared to be annoyed; he became irritated and lost his temper.  He seemed to think my duty there was simply to decide that the workman was not genuinely seeking employment, that the distance the workman was asked to travel was reasonable, and that every time I should come down against the workman.  That was, I suppose, his training and his experience, and he could not help it.  That was his honest approach to the thing.  I certainly did not agree with it and I was not guided by it.  I fear that when <Col N="147" /> the decision in these cases is handed over to the officers I mention, the workmen will get a less favourable deal than they are getting at the present time.</P>
    <P>I come across cases quite frequently where workmen's compensation is paid and the Social Welfare supplement discontinued.  That is a typical example of it.  At the present time if workmen's compensation is not as much as the workman would be entitled to if he were ill under the Social Welfare Act, he is entitled to a contribution from the Social Welfare Fund.  I know of several cases where workmen's compensation is paid by the insurance company and the Department suspend payment of the Social Welfare contribution on the recommendation of the medical referee.</P>
    <P>I know other cases where, although the county surgeon and, in one case, the regional orthopaedic surgeon, certifies a man as unfit for work, the medical referee finds he is fit for work and he is left without any Social Welfare benefit for weeks until he appeals to the appeals officer, and even then it is hard to convince him. Those are cases which influence me greatly in coming to the conclusion that if this Bill is allowed to go through this House without some provision being written into it entitling the workmen to appeal to a proper tribunal, the workmen of this country will regret it very much.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, if a workman meets with an accident and there is a dispute as to whether or not he is entitled to compensation, he goes to the Circuit Court judge.  He gets an order for payment of weekly compensation and when he gets that order, his compensation cannot be terminated until the Circuit Court judge so decides and amends the order.  Under the proposed scheme the absolute reverse appears to be the case.  If the workman is being paid disability benefit, his benefit can be discontinued on the certificate of a medical referee and he can be left without any benefit for several weeks until such time as his case comes before <Col N="148" /> the appeals officer.  That is the complete reverse of the position that has existed under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>Again, under the scheme which will operate under this Bill, a workman is not entitled to be represented before the appeals officer by his legal representative, unless the appeals officer so decides.  The workman should have the right to be represented before this tribunal by his legal repesentative.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there are not certain worthwhile provisions in this Bill.  I have dealt with them and I approve of them but this is a Bill which must come under very close scrutiny in Committee, if the rights of workmen are to be adequately protected and safeguarded and if workmen are to continue to get the same sympathetic hearing and consideration as they have been getting from Circuit Court judges in this country down through the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome and support the general principles of the Bill which was introduced in July of this year because it implements the principal features of the minority report of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.  The commission, as we know, was established by the Government led by Deputy J. A. Costello in which the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, was Minister for Social Welfare, on 21st December, 1955, nearly ten years ago. That body reported to the Minister in February, 1962.  The commission sat for more than four years and the Minister's predecessor added to the commission representatives of the insurance companies with the object of weighing down in a certain way the findings of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech said it was better to wait and get a good Bill like this rather than rush it as some of us had suggested during the past few years.  Most of what is contained in this Bill has been in operation in Britain and in Northern Ireland for a long number of years and we had the example of its working. If we wanted to compare actuarially we had the practical experience of the working of such legislation close to us. <Col N="149" /> We do not, therefore, agree that it was necessary to wait until 1965 to introduce this Bill.  That is not taking away from our support of this Bill as it is because we believe, despite what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, that it was time the handling of affairs affecting the livelihood of so many men and women in this country was taken out of the hands of the insurance companies and of the courts who in many cases found it extremely difficult to deal with insurance companies. Some of the settlements obtained were considered very generous; some of the settlements were a disgrace.  Apparently that was the way workmen's compensation legislation worked for years.  It became a kind of law unto itself.  All sorts of obscure judgements could be cited. When some unfortunate man looked as if he would get a decent settlement the law said it must follow suit, but the direct opposite to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said occurred because we had so many people not insuring their workers and who, when cases were taken against them, were the men of straw Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to and nobody got anything.</P>
    <P>In this Bill at least insurance is compulsory.  At least we are insisting that everybody, even those under 16 years, even those over 70, who are insurable under the social welfare code, will be insurable for workmen's compensation and occupational injury purposes.  Having said that, I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that this is principally a Committee Stage Bill.  It is a Bill, I may say, that the Minister will not get through as framed because he will get numerous amendments from the Labour Party and I feel sure Fine Gael will also have amendments. That is what makes good law&mdash;that Members of the House will attempt to persuade the Minister and their fellow Members that the Bill is not framed in the best possible way, that it can be beneficially altered.</P>
    <P>While the Occupational Injuries Bill is a great improvement on the workmen's compensation code, nevertheless, it falls far short of a proper comprehensive occupational injuries code which is a desirable and necessary <Col N="150" /> feature of our social welfare code.  The four essential elements in such a code are prevention, compensation, hospitalisation and rehabilitation.  An examination of the commission's report reveals that in the first of these elements the Minister for Social Welfare has done nothing at all.  There has been no positive legislation in the matter of agriculture and this was the object of special comment by the commission.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain why he has not made any effort to ensure that this particular hazard is dealt with.  We all know that at present there are far too many accidents in agriculture.  Talking about agriculture, it is extraordinary that there are not so many accidents as occupational diseases in agriculture&mdash;that farm work has become one of the most hazardous occupations in the country. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that woodwork machinists who operate saws have got hazardous jobs but it is true that more people are knocked out of work in agriculture through injury and industrial diseases than in any other branch of industry in the country.  We have a situation where many kinds of new-fangled weed killers and various types of fertilisers are being used, most of which change from day to day and week to week so that if somebody suffers from an industrial disease as a result of using some of them, that by the time he takes action the composition is no longer on sale.</P>
    <P>This is something which must be faced by the Government if we are to have a really comprehensive Bill to meet this sort of thing.  I am glad the Minister has decided to extend the provision affecting coal miners who unfortunately suffer from pneumoconiosis. I do not know what the incidence of this disease is in mines other than coal mines.  I am sure there is some of it and it is only right other miners should be covered as well.</P>
    <P>In framing the Bill, the Minister has slaughtered a number of sacred cows and it is rather a pity he has not removed all the warbles which are injuring a perfectly good hide.  Every marginal case has been brought within the scope of the Bill but the deciding <Col N="151" /> officers and the appeal officers will be working entirely on new frontiers, far beyond the horizon of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  I suppose it will be the same set-up.  Employers' and workers' representatives will be on the assessors panel when appeals come up for consideration.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick when he says there is a danger there.</P>
    <P>We all know that in this House the Minister has again and again been questioned about the long delay there is from one hearing of an appeal to the next.  The Minister made a statement to me here some months ago which rather shocked me.  Possibly he did not mean it in the way in which he said it.  However, to me, it did convey that if somebody had been examined by one of his officers and was declared not unfit for work, there was no hurry in having his appeal heard, there was no necessity for hurry to have his appeal heard.  From that, we must assume that it was considered by the Department that he was, in fact, fit for work.</P>
    <P>What will happen if the same thing occurs with somebody applying for compensation under this Bill?  Deputy Fitzpatrick says it is true that sometimes you will find workmen's compensation being paid, and continued to be paid, if the supplement by the Department of Social Welfare is stopped but it is also true that in many cases the Department of Social Welfare pay benefit to people who would starve but for the fact that they are paying it because the insurance companies have stopped paying the workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to every coin. I think the most serious one is the fact that, having this situation changed now, the Department of Social Welfare will be there.  Consider the position if the Department decide that a man is fit for work and should be fit to resume, even though the local medical evidence is against that decision, even though the surgeon in the local hospital is against that decision. I know of a couple of cases where this happened.  They say the <Col N="152" /> man is unfit for work.  He has no other Department to fall back on and if he does not get social welfare benefit, he is literally starved into going back to work.  This is an aspect which the Minister and the House will have to take cognisance of because there is a danger that, with the present system we have of appeals under the Department of Social Welfare, we may have grave injustices and apparently there is no appeal against this.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect about which I should like to ask the Minister. What provision has he made to meet the huge demands which will fall on his Department as soon as this Bill becomes law?  Is it not true that far more Social Welfare appeals officers will be required?  Is it not true that extra personnel will be required to deal with this tremendous situation? Mind you, it is not just simply a matter as has been said here, of fitting it into the Department of Social Welfare: further personnel will be required to handle the whole thing. Is it proposed to have the necessary personnel ready and will every effort be made to ensure that if any mistake is to be made, it will not be made at the expense of the unfortunate person who is out of work because of an injury at work?</P>
    <P>There is one thing in the Bill which it rather surprises me has been continued and the Minister himself seems to think it is a great idea.  I refer to the words &ldquo;accident arising out of and in the course of employment.&rdquo; I should like to point out that, in the Bill itself, 69 lines of print are required to explain the extended scope of the occupational injuries code because of the unnecessary and undefined word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  What is an accident? If a stockman is tending a bull and it knocks him down and injures him seriously, is that an accident?  Did the bull not do it deliberately?  If a bus conductor is coming home late on a Saturday night and a group of teddy-boys attack him, is that an accident? Was it not deliberate?  Why is the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; kept there?  Would it not have been much better if it had been phrased in a different way? If you put in the phrase &ldquo;injury not <Col N="153" /> self-inflicted&rdquo;, it would have the same effect.  It could not be misunderstood in the way in which the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is misunderstood and it might possibly save a lot of the wrangling which is bound to occur despite the fact that the Minister says the phrase &ldquo;accident arising out of and in the course of employment&rdquo; is so wide that there will be no danger at all of anybody being ruled out because of a doubt that it did occur&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Legislature of Queensland deleted the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; from its code in 1944.  I understand it is also being taken out of compensation codes in a number of other countries.  In fact, in some of the countries in which it is retained, the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; has been substituted by the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;, so it reads: &ldquo;accident arising out of or in the course of employment&rdquo;.  The Minister might consider this.  He may feel it is a trivial matter but he might consider it.  Knowing how some of these appeals are twisted and how difficult it sometimes is to get across the actual meaning of some of these phrases, particularly when we have not the legal men to work out the actual concise meaning of a word, it is important that there should not be any room for doubt.</P>
      <P>The code is not proposed to relate to wages or loss of earnings.  The injury benefit at the rate of 115/-, supported by the standard Social Welfare benefit for dependants, is possibly for the initial injury period and these payments may be continued for a period of 20 weeks.  The benefit proposed for a married person having three children is £9 9s, plus 8/- for each other child dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a pension for loss of faculty, assessed at 20 per cent or more, payable for life, should encourage an injured workman to resume work as soon as possible.  It means that if he is prepared to resume the work, his compensation is not reduced and his right to further compensation is not jeopardised in any <Col N="154" /> way.  This is a good idea.  It is in operation in other countries and I see no reason why it should not have a good effect here.</P>
    <P>I am very glad also to see that compensation for disfigurement is included whereby disablement benefit is payable following an accident, though the injured person may be capable of resuming work.  It should help to keep persons at work where injuries of a minor nature are at present holding them up until the case is settled.</P>
    <P>Small lump sums, gratuities, and so on, are payable in respect of minor injuries. The new code is clearly concerned with continuing payments of maintenance and income.  This is a good idea because many lump sums paid under the existing code were not really in the interest of the insured worker.  Some people did make a very good living as a result of receiving a substantial lump sum in workmen's compensation, and were able to live well where otherwise they would have been in very bad circumstances for the rest of their lives, but there are many cases of people who, not knowing the value of money, spent it rather foolishly whereas if they had had a weekly income, which would be continued, they would be much better off, at least in the eyes of the onlooker, though nobody except themselves knows whether they are doing well or ill.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the value of the disablement benefits after injury appropriate to any particular degree of disability.  These have not been described so I presume the Northern Ireland table of injuries and assessment will apply.  This raises a question.  Why is it that the rates operated in Northern Ireland until March 1965 when the basic rate of benefit was increased by £1 from 115/- to 135/-a week and the maximum gratuity was increased to £450 do not operate?  The settlements for dependants are also higher in Great Britain.  Why is it that it is on last year's benefits the assessment is made for this new Bill?  In other words, we are, as far as the benefits are concerned, £1 a week under Great Britain and £1 a week <Col N="155" /> under Northern Ireland.  In fact, this is so, despite the fact that the amount being paid for this benefit by the employer here is greater than that being paid either in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a possible explanation which I do not, at the present time, understand.  Perhaps the Minister might take the trouble to try to explain why this occurs?  It is difficult, I suppose, to forecast, with any degree of accuracy, the likely cost of the proposed benefits or, for that matter, the cost of parity of the scheme.  But we have, as I said earlier, the experience of the system in Great Britain and in the Six Countries for quite a long time. I am sure the Minister is aware that the absence of heavy industry and mining risks in Northern Ireland has had a significant effect on expenditure. Because of the fact that those risks are not in Northern Ireland but are in Great Britain, the cost of running the scheme in the Six Countries is very much less per head than it is in Great Britain.  Moreover, the published reports reveal that the actuarial forecast of the rates of contribution have been over-estimated because it has been found possible on occasions to increase the benefits and reduce the contribution.  The weekly contributions are sufficient to maintain solvency and build up a fund.  The latest reports estimate that the British rate of contribution is slightly less than 1d. a week above solvency level.  That being so, I cannot see how the Minister's advisers could have reached the figure of the benefits and the costs which they have produced, particularly because of another factor which I will comment on later.</P>
    <P>The present all-in weekly contribution in Great Britain, including the Exchequer subsidy of 20 per cent, is 22.8 pence and this is .9 pence above solvency.  The required contribution is 21.9 pence and the net requirement in Northern Ireland is 21.25 pence which is sufficient to support the basic rate of injury benefits and disablement benefits which are £1 a week higher than the 115/- in the Bill, together with which there is a special hardship <Col N="156" /> allowance of up to £2 14s. 0d.  This special hardship allowance is not mentioned at all in our Bill.  It appears as if somebody is either attempting to make sure that there will be no possible loss on the scheme or that there will be a substantial profit on the scheme.  There may be one possibility which I have not over-looked&mdash;the Minister will probably explain it&mdash;that because of the arrangements being made over the present type of workmen's compensation being paid, and the necessity to supplement it in a number of cases, it is required to have more than that which would have the new scheme solvent under normal circumstances.  If that is so, the Minister should say so because it appears that the present scheme is not too easy to explain or to understand.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the special hardship allowance is 4d. a week. Since the proposed scheme does not include a special hardship allowance, the weekly contribution could be 4d. lower or 17.25 pence a week.  Perhaps the Minister might like to explain how the disparity occurs?  Briefly, why is this charge being made if we are paying £1 a week less than the other two places I have quoted and paying no special hardship allowance?  It appears as if there is something a little screwy and I would like the Minister to explain it.  I may say, by way of comment, that the average degree of disablement in Great Britain is 30 per cent and in Northern Ireland it is 33 per cent.  The disablement benefit is assessed in accordance with the prescribed degree of disablement.  A gratuity of £380 is being given here for a 20 per cent degree of disablement. It probably exceeds the lump sum granted by insurance companies in respect of some period of incapacity. The same 20 per cent in Great Britain would entitle a person to £450.</P>
    <P>With regard to occupational injuries, a gratuity is payable in addition to the weekly benefit.  I should like to know, with regard to the special hardship allowance, whether this has been considered at all by the Minister.  As I said, in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a special hardship allowance of up to 54/- is payable in 1965.  It was <Col N="157" /> 46/- in 1954.  This benefit is paid when an injured worker is unable to perform his usual occupation or to do work of an equivalent standard.  The special hardship allowance in Great Britain is 80 per cent of the cost of the disablement benefit.  In Northern Ireland, 65 per cent of the disablement benefit attracts a special hardship allowance.  The special hardship allowance payable in addition to the disablement benefit is a settlement of major importance.  The disablement benefit would have been a failure in Great Britain and Northern Ireland but for the hardship allowance.  I do not believe the disablement benefit scheme will give satisfaction unless the special hardship allowance is provided. I should like to know why it has been omitted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I should like to comment on, that is, the three waiting days.  The three waiting days period has been retained unless the injured person is disabled for two weeks.  No cash benefit is paid during that period, although the injured person would be entitled to medical attention during the first three days. I do not think it is reasonable to deprive an injured person of such benefit.  In fact, disablement benefit can be paid out of the fund to persons who may not lose any time at all.</P>
    <P>There is one provision for which I suppose there is a very good reason but it is a source of worry to those of us who are responsible for striking the rates.  Here again, as in workmen's compensation up to now, the cost of the injured workman, if he has got a general medical service card, goes on the scheme.  Up to now, I thought it was a disgraceful thing that if somebody who was ill and was being paid workmen's compensation&mdash;and in fact medical fees were given in certain circumstances to those people, even in a court of law&mdash;had a medical services card then the local rates had to pay for whatever he would be entitled to and thereby the insurance companies were getting away with the cost of that man's medical attention.  This is included here again.  I assume the Minister will say that the extra cost might be very substantial and I agree that it <Col N="158" /> is a good way of keeping a check on such expenditure.  For that reason, there is a certain amount of justification for it but I am not altogether happy with it.  The sooner we reach the stage where an insured person is entitled to medical care by right without having to look for a medical card, the better it will be for all concerned. The maximum payment for a single person is £5 15s and this represents only 40 per cent of the average wage.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister when devising the Bill considered something which was mentioned to me by Deputy Larkin, that is, the question of the worker who is injured going to or coming from his work. All of us have had experience of a man who was so injured but because of the fact that he had just left his work and was on his own bicycle, or perhaps was walking, it did not count.  It does not count unless he is carrying tools belonging to his employer or going to a specified place. I remember the case of a carter who was employed by a county council and who was setting off for work in the morning with his cart.  He had a barrel of tar on the cart and therefore would normally have been considered to have been in the occupation of his employer. However, as he was going through his gate to the road, he put his foot on the stock of the wheel and the horse turned around and went back into the garden and the man's leg was caught and broken.  The insurance company representing his employer refused to accept responsibility on the ground that the accident did not occur between the man's house and his place of employment and that he had gone a few yards towards his house.  That case was sustained in court.  The man was out of work for a long time and received no compensation.  The Minister might consider trying to cover cases like that in the Bill.  We have had quite a lot of these cases of a man falling off his bicycle on his way home, or slipping off a fence, and unfortunately these things happen at the wrong time.  The Minister might consider including a section to cover that particular type of accident.  If he does, he will be improving his Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill is a step in the <Col N="159" /> right direction.  I would hate to see it being held up because of the fact that the £4 10s. which was introduced in 1955, and is still in operation, is very much less than what would be required to sustain an ordinary person, not to talk about a man or woman suffering from an occupational injury. The present system whereby the workman's income has to be supplemented by social welfare, where he has a family, makes the matter even worse. I hope the Bill will go through this House and eventually become law in as quick a time as possible but having said that, I want to tell the Minister that there are a number of small sections which will require amending. We intend to submit amendments to improve the legislation.  That does not mean that we are opposed to the Bill because, as I said already, we think it time this was done.  The greatest fault is that it took the Government so long to uncover the egg which had been hatched for ten years.  Let us hope it is going to be a good egg.</P>
    <P>The administration of this is something about which the Minister will have to be very careful.  As the Minister knows, I have great respect for his Department and the way in which they administer their affairs and the way in which they are able to deal with something when it is brought to their notice but I have found, particularly in recent months, that there are quite a number of things which I have to bring to their notice and I am sure other Deputies are reaching this position also.  I should hate to think that some injured workman would be left without means of sustenance until he eventually contacted a Deputy who brought the matter to the notice of the Minister's Department.  When the Bill is going through, we must try to ensure that it will be operated in such a way that matters can be dealt with in a reasonably speedy time.</P>
    <P>To come back to the comments made by Deputy Fitzpatrick, he is a legal man and has far more experience of these things than I have, but as an ordinary layman, I could give to the Minister and the House a list of a couple of dozen cases of workmen's <Col N="160" /> compensation which started some years ago and which do not appear as if they are ever going to end.  Some are receiving compensation; some were receiving it for a period but it has stopped.  Some of them have never received any compensation despite the fact that these people have been insured.  It appears that an early change is needed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not know whether those in the legal profession have become aware of it or not but certainly those who are close enough to the sufferers have noticed that there is a hardening on the part of insurance companies, even in pretty trivial cases since this measure was introduced. Apparently, an effort is now being made to avoid being involved in any more payments until this Bill is passed in the hope that the responsibility will pass to somebody else.  I see the Minister is making arrangements whereby any agreements or arrangements that have been reached before this measure must be honoured by the insurance companies concerned but it is true that quite a number of cases will drag on until immediately after the Bill is passed and, therefore, very definite efforts must be made to get those cleared up.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill and in its final form we trust it will do all we hope it will do for the injured workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good Bill and should improve workmen's compensation considerably both from the employers' and the workers' point of view.  Since workmen's compensation can be put on the same level as social welfare it is only appropriate that the Department of Social Welfare should undertake the administration of workmen's compensation in another form. The Minister has so arranged it that the cost of benefits under the new system he is introducing will be less than the costs under the present system and that means more benefits will be derived than could be derived from the premiums paid to commercial insurances.  The Bill will give more stability to employers.  The State will, from now on, take the part of the insurance which was definitely inadequate <Col N="161" /> and not benefiting sufficiently either workers or employers.  The cost of insurance to the employers in many cases was very high and also in many cases the insurance companies fell down on the job.  Most Deputies will know of cases in which the insurance company failed to pay denying liability on some ground or another leaving the employer in the unfortunate position of having to meet the claim against him.  In nine cases out of ten, the employer was not capable of doing this because of insufficient funds.</P>
      <P>From the employer's point of view, this Bill also stabilises the position. He will now pay no contribution towards the benefits he will derive from the Bill.  Up to now in many cases when a worker had a claim he had to go to court in an effort to solve his problems.  In many cases this did not solve anything because he received a lump sum and we all realise that a lump sum is very attractive to the ordinary worker on the day of receipt but the worker is not capable generally of stretching out his money to cover him during his period of incapacity. I am glad the Minister has provided that the worker will receive a weekly sum instead of a lump sum. Many workers accepted lump sums which were inadequate.  They were so long waiting for the money that they were willing to settle for any figure offered even though it was not sufficient to cover their period of incapacity.</P>
      <P>In future there will be no confusion between workmen's compensation and disability benefits, a factor which caused hardship to many families and individuals in the past.  I am also glad that the Minister has stabilised the price of the stamp.  Under the new system in respect of each male worker the employer will have to pay 2/1d and in respect of each female worker, 1/6d.  I think this is very fair and I am glad that the Minister has taken into account the fact that some employments have greater risks than others and he has levelled them all out so that the same rates will apply regardless of the employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one point on which I <Col N="162" /> am inclined to disagree, that is, in regard to agricultural workers whose stamps will now be 2/1d.  If the agricultural workers' compensation is based on his pre-accident earnings, I imagine he will not receive the same benefits as his fellow-workers in industry or in other spheres.  I should like to see the Minister amending the Bill to assist the agricultural worker to the extent that he would derive the same benefits, if incapacitated, as every other worker.  I have no doubt this Bill will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom an t-Aire a mholadh as ucht an Bhille seo.  Níl le rá agam ach go dtaithneoidh an Bille seo le gach éinne agus go molfaidh gach Teachta é.</P>

      <P>This Bill introduces two fundamental changes in the system of workmen's compensation as hitherto operated.  I am quite unconvinced that either of them is necessary or that it will benefit the workman.  I am approaching consideration of this Bill entirely from the point of view of the workman.  Approaching it from that aspect, and from the experience I have had over a very considerable number of years of the operation in this country of workmen's compensation, I have no doubt this is an employer's Bill and not a workman's Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, in stating the attitude of this Party, said we were not enthusiastic about this Bill.  That is putting it mildly.  It is a gross understatement. The first principle that would appear to operate, if this Bill goes through, is the transfer from the employer to the taxpayer of his liability in respect of negligence and accidents to his employees.  What is the justification for that?  Why should the taxpayer have to pay for an employer's accident to his employees?  In particular, in cases of hazardous employments, where even insurance companies were forced to charge prohibitive or almost prohibitive premiums&mdash; certainly very high premiums&mdash;for insurance, why should employers get assisted by the taxpayers to discharge their liabilities to their injured workmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The Minister devoted a perfunctory series of pages giving the reasons for the change from the personal liability of the employer to the taxpayer.  I was quite unconvinced by the manner in which he approached that and the reasons he gave for it.  What is the point of setting up a Commission and of asking expert people to give their services for a period of almost seven years?  Day after day, week after week, certainly month after month over that long period they gave their services voluntarily to the consideration of the very difficult problems implicit in workmen's compensation.  Those people made a Report which is, I think, a monument of hard work, great consideration and great public service. But they get a perfunctory two or three lines from the Minister in his statement thanking them very much: &ldquo;You are very good but we do not give a hoot about what you say.&rdquo; This Commission was presided over by a distinguished judge, Judge Shannon, who had far more experience of workmen's compensation and its working and the needs of the workman in connection with that than anybody in this House, in the Labour Party or in the Labour movement.  He was the man who, I would say, was one of the most judicial people I have come across in my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, he had far more experience of the working of that and brought to it, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, what practically all branches of the judiciary brought to the consideration of the rights of workmen&mdash;complete sympathy, knowledge and understanding of what was required in the working of this Act, Everybody knows that the Act of 1906 was supposed to have been passed by the British Parliament in such a form that anybody could read it and that it would be the simplest possible measure to work.  There were never so many decisions and consideration of complex facts decided by various courts as under the Act of 1906.  The one outstanding feature of <Col N="164" /> the administration of that Act was the attitude of the House of Lords.  During all the years until we ceased to have anything to do with them the highest tribunal in the British system were always in favour of the workman. That is the proven fact in connection with the administration of that Act. As Deputy Fitzpatrick again pointed out, every Circuit Court judge and the Supreme Court always approached the consideration of problems dealing with the workman from a sympathetic point of view and with complete sympathy towards the workman.</P>
      <P>I want to say this in favour of my own profession and of Deputy Fitzpatrick's profession, too.  This system worked well, and is still working well, in the courts here because it got the support and the work of the solicitors and barristers throughout the country, particularly the young barristers. Both gave their services free if necessary and, in my view, no workman ever lost a case or ever lost an opportunity of presenting his case to the country because he had neither solicitor nor counsel.  The young counsel who travelled down the country and those who practised in the cities of Dublin and Cork all gave very good services indeed to the workmen. There is no use in anybody saying that the insurance companies did not do this, that, or the other; whatever they did, they did it because they were forced to do it by young counsel, and frequently, young solicitors.  They saved the taxpayer the expense of a free legal aid system by the services they gave throughout the years in connection with the administration of this Workman's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second principle involved in this Bill takes away the rights of the workmen from the courts.  The workmen will lose.  They will feel the draught very much when they can no longer have their rights brought to the courts as has been done all down the years. Certainly, as far as I and my Party are concerned, I hope we will fight against this in every possible way and, if at all possible, bring back the right of the workman to bring his case to court and have it decided by an independent tribunal and not by bureaucrats. <Col N="165" /> I am not saying anything in disparagement of them, but they are not fitted for this work; they are not suitable because they have no experience of it.  I want to know, first, why was the change necessary?  This tribunal, that worked for seven years, came to a conclusion which they expressed in paragraph 496 of their Report:</P>
    <P>Our broad conclusion from these calculations is that the cost to employers of these different systems would be more or less the same.</P>
    <P>They had just gone through all the various systems that had been suggested and had them actuarially examined.  They went on:</P>
    <P>While the Flat-Rate Social Insurance Scheme would appear on the face of it likely to cost rather less than the present system as amended by the Commission's proposals or the Monopoly State Insurance Authority Scheme, allowance must be made for the fact that the costings for the Social Insurance Scheme take no account of the possible impact on common law claims of the higher workmen's compensation benefits under that Scheme nor do they include provision for the additional cost of disability benefit from the Social Insurance Fund under this Scheme, which might involve a further £250,000 a year of which almost £200,000 would be contributed by taxpayers and employers. In view of this it appears to us that the decision as between these different systems is one that must be taken primarily on the basis of their relative intrinsic merits, including, of course, the relative volume of benefits or claims which would reach the hands of injured workmen. We were strongly influenced by the arguments in favour of the preservation of the <i>status quo</i> and the undesirability of interfering with the established private enterprise system unless substantial advantages could thereby be achieved.</P>
    <P>That is a conclusion the Minister has taken up only by a series of superficial points, all of which were examined by the Commission itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> It is no use my wasting the time of the House trying to get a change of attitude so far as this first point is concerned.  I do not think it is possible now to change the notion that the taxpayers are to be brought to the help of employers.  Apparently that has been decided by the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, but I do not think the case has been made for it. I am not talking now for insurance companies: I hold no brief for them. In fact, very seldom did I hold a brief for them.  Mostly I appeared for workmen. However, I am speaking here tonight in relation to this Bill and my criticisms are directed against it because I have the interests of the workers, from the point of view of compensation, at heart.  I know something about it.  The case has not been established as to why the taxpayers should pay, but that is what is being done.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister in the course of his speech&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;gave any indication of the number of extra civil servants that will be required on foot of this Bill.  And it is not just a question of an increase in numbers; it is a question of increased cost as well. Deputy Tully, I think, adverted to that aspect in the course of his comments on the Bill.  No one in the Department at the moment has any experience of workmen's compensation. Again, that is not a criticism.  It is a statement of fact.  Existing Civil Service personnel know nothing about it. They have had no experience of it. It is not their job to know it.  But it is a job solicitors, particularly solicitors down the country, know very well.</P>
    <P>I said that the system has worked well.  There are very few legal actions in court now under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  Things have settled down and the system works very well.  More particularly still, it works for the benefit of the worker. How the Minister can justify his present attitude is beyond me.  The taxpayers are being met with increased demands.  As employers they will have to pay an additional sum for their employees.  They will also have to pay additional taxes to help relieve employers <Col N="167" /> of their liability.  What will they be asked to pay under the heading of increased Civil Service personnel? There is, I think, some suggestion in the Minority Report that what they coyly call the cost of administration would actually run to something like £200,000.  That estimate was made a considerable number of years back.  What would the figure be in terms of today's costs?  Treble that sum.  Multiply it by five, rather, and you will have something nearer to the actual cost.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers are entitled to know why they should have to pay for the employers.  I agree some system of compulsory insurance was long overdue. The system of accident insurance has worked fairly well and methods have been devised to cope with those who drive motor cars while not properly or fully insured.  The same could be done in this instance.  I am not at all convinced by the very meagre reasoning of the Minister that the taxpayers generally should be called upon to discharge a liability employers have to their workers, but that is what is proposed here.  The taxpayers are being asked to take upon themselves the duties of the employers. Why should they?  I cannot see the argument at all.  I can see the point of view of the workman who believes that, if he is injured in the course of his employment, his employer should pay.  Surely it should be possible to devise another system which would give all that is proposed in this Bill without imposing an additional heavy liability on taxpayers generally and still more bureaucracy on the country as a whole.  There is far too much of it.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the second proposal, which I describe as simultaneously the most important and the most pernicious in the Bill.  Workmen's rights are being taken away from them by this Bill.  I emphasise that again.  Deputy Tully asked why there should be a definition in this section of an accident as something arising out of and in the course of a workman's employment.  I do not see why there <Col N="168" /> should be anything in this Bill except a simple section providing that when a workman meets with an injury in his employment, he is to be paid by the State.  What is the point in putting in &ldquo;arising out of and in the course of his employment&rdquo;?  The onus of proof and all the judicial and legal formalism will be operated by non-lawyers who will know nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I want to put a case.  A workman meets with an injury and applies for compensation.  The matter comes before a civil servant who must exercise a judicial function.  May I say, in passing, that I have very grave doubts of the constitutionality of many parts of this Bill because workmen's rights will be affected and all sorts of points which have been decided down through the years both here and in England, in the House of Lords and in our Supreme Court here, will no longer apply.  There are numerous decisions that lawyers know and appreciate. What will the civil servant do when it comes to deciding as to whether or not a workman should get compensation? The workman will get very little chance of making his case or of knowing the reasons why.</P>
    <P>Let me put it this way for the benefit of the Labour Party.  This is something about which I feel very strongly and that is why I am spending so much time on it.  Solicitors and barristers know the decided cases.  They know their way around workmen's compensation as people know their way around their own houses.  In future these cases will come before civil servants.  The function of the civil servant is to do his job and, in doing it, to keep down expenses.  In the early days of this State, I had something to do with the administration of unemployment insurance. The one phrase I saw appearing in file after file from civil servants was: &ldquo;We must protect the Fund&rdquo;. They were protecting the unemployment insurance fund.  That was their duty.  It was not their duty to see the person out of employment got that to which he was entitled.  &ldquo;We must protect the Fund&rdquo;.  There will be a fund under this Bill and the duty of the <Col N="169" /> civil servants will be to protect that fund.  They will do that in accordance with their lights but not in accordance with any sympathy to which the workman would be entitled.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be opposed, and bitterly opposed, unless there is some provision to enable a workman to appeal to the Supreme Court in reference to his rights to the benefits that are there.  This Bill will be one of shame on this House if we permit it to leave here as a completely bureaucratic Bill designed to prevent workmen from getting their rights.  Let me emphasise again that it is the workmen's rights that are being affected. Employers will get out of their liability by paying 2/1 for a man and 1/6 for a woman engaged in the most hazardous employments.  The taxpayers will take over the real liability and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out, the insurance companies can laugh at the lot of us because they are the people who will make money out of this.  They will not lose anything because it is the taxpayers who will pay.  They will charge any extra <Col N="170" /> premium they like to the ordinary employer in order to indemnify him against common law actions arising out of negligence on the part of himself or the workman.  Employers with the most hazardous occupations will get the taxpayers to idemnify them. The employers will have less to pay. Undoubtedly there will be fewer incentives, or perhaps no incentive at all, to take proper precautions to nullify hazardous conditions of employment in order to ensure that workmen do not get injured.  That is another important defect in this Bill.  The amount is a standard amount irrespective of the employment.</P>
    <P>The question of risks is dealt with in the Report of the Commission at paragraph 429.  I do not want to take up the time of the House reading it, but that is one of the things that weighed with the majority of the Commission in making their report.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
