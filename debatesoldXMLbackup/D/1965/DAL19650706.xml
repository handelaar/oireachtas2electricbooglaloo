      <P>In the matter of questions, it has been arranged that all the questions will be taken today to facilitate the production and distribution to Members of tomorrow's Order Paper.  If a large number of today's questions were not reached and had to be incorporated in tomorrow's Order Paper it would be difficult to have the Order Paper available at the usual time.  As there are 131 questions for answer, I propose to limit the number of supplementary questions and I would ask the full co-operation of all the Deputies to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  I take it that your notice of intent to limit the number of supplementary questions is a request for co-operation from your colleagues in the House. There is no Standing Order under which the number of supplementaries can be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplementary questions are at the discretion of the Chair as to the number and relevancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And doubtless everyone will wish to co-operate with the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that, normally, questions would cease at 4 p.m. and would be continued tomorrow, there is still the same time taken up.  Why, therefore, limit the number of supplementaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to prepare tomorrow's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but these would be answered tomorrow and <Col N="500" /> there would be no necessity for the limitation of supplementaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>So that questions may be got out in time to be put on tomorrow's Order Paper.  They have to be stencilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They would still take the same time, whether they are answered today or tomorrow, in the aggregate.  I do not want to be taken as objecting to your ruling but I would ask you not to be too rigid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 15 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the speech to which these questions refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the 1945 Air Transport Agreement between Ireland and the United States provides that when either of the contracting parties considers it desirable to modify the routes or conditions set forth in the annex to that Agreement it may request consultation between the competent authorities of both contracting <Col N="517" /> parties, such consultation to begin within a period of 60 days from the date of the request.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Agreement, consultations between Irish and American representatives have taken place from time to time on the granting of landing rights in Dublin Airport to United States air companies.  The latest of these conferences took place in Dublin in November, 1961.  Since then no request has been received from the American Government for a further conference on the matter.</P>
    <P>I see no reason to make the formal protest suggested by Deputy Corish in a case such as this where an Ambassador states his view as to the landing rights he would desire for the air companies of the country he represents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard the Ambassador's references as an approach to reconsideration of the terms of the 1945 Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Agreement, section 11 clearly sets out the method of having a conference constituted and when a request is made officially by the United States Government we agree, as we have agreed in the past and, of course, would agree again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I really dealt with the matter which I am asked here, that was, the question of the landing rights in Ireland afforded to the United States air companies.  These questions all refer to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat the question? It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for External Affairs if he will make a statement <Col N="518" /> with regard to the speech made by the United States Ambassador on 29th June criticising this country's general attitude to trade with the United States and policies regarding the landing rights of American airlines in Irish airports; and whether the Government intends to protest to the US Government about the Ambassador's action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The policies regarding the landing rights of the American air companies I have covered.  I have answered Deputy Corish on that and I do not think there is any reason for making the formal protest he suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is a serious criticism of this country to say that we have not availed of markets that are open to us in respect of beef, spirits and sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to beef, there were better prices in Europe and in order to divert beef supplies to America, we would have had to establish State control and give exporters a State subsidy in order that they might get the same prices for their cattle and beef as they could have got in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sugar Company, I understand, were prepared to export 10,000 tons of sugar, the full amount of the quota, after the last beet harvest but could not get shipping as there was a prolonged longshoremen's strike in the United States.  They finally did get shipping for 1,500 tons which they exported, but the shipment did not arrive until January.</P>

    <Col N="527" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on a full review of cross-Border traffic facilities carried out recently, the hours during which attendance may be obtained without prior request have been extended. At Lifford Bridge a full 24 hours service is being maintained and prior request is no longer required, while at Moybridge, County Monaghan, prior request is now required only between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m.</P>
      <P>The charge of 2/- per vehicle made for customs clearance between the hours of 12 midnight and 7 a.m. enables service during these hours to be provided without appreciable cost to the general taxpayer while its effect on the individual private motorists and traders who avail of the service is inconsiderable.  I am not prepared to abolish the charge.</P>

It is a question of whether the service provided is paid for by the people who avail of it or by the general taxpayer and I think the present arrangement is the more equitable one.  If that arrangement did not exist, the burden of payment would fall on the general taxpayer, and it would be a considerable burden.</P>

Subsequently Laois County Council decided to examine the proposal on the basis of a more extensive scheme capable of supplying a greater area.  Finally in October, 1962, the local authority agreed to the adoption of a regional scheme estimated to cost £151,000. The documentation of this scheme and the taking of gaugings at the source proceeded from January, 1963, until the summer of 1964, when the local authority were informed that preparation of contract documents could proceed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>A special allowance is an annual sum of such amount as will, when added to an applicant's means, not equal or exceed a prescribed sum. The special allowance payable to the person referred to by the Deputy was reduced with effect from the 13th August, 1964.  It appeared from the evidence available that the person concerned was over 70 years of age at that time and consequently his allowance had to be recalculated by reference to the smaller prescribed sum which is applicable to a person of 70 <Col N="547" /> years of age or over.  On the 28th May, 1965, the allowance was restored to its original rate with retrospective effect to the 13th August, 1964, when my Department became aware that the claim of the person in question for an old age pension had been refused on the grounds that he did not satisfy the statutory condition in regard to age.  Payment has been made of all moneys due on foot of the higher rate of allowance restored as from the 13th August, 1964.</P>

Potez at Galway will, in the near future, go back into full production; whether the promised potential of employment for 700 men will in fact be fulfilled in the foreseeable future; if he is aware that the wholesale redundancy at Potez, particularly taken in connection with the closure of at least two other firms, and redundancy at various others have created a most serious employment situation in Galway; and if he will thoroughly investigate the possibility of any other firm taking over the factory now occupied by Messrs.

      <P>Due to the circumstances which led to the laying off of workers at Potez in Galway, I am not in a position to say when the factory will resume full production or whether the promised potential employment will be fulfilled.

      <P>I am not aware that my statement has occasioned widespread disappointment. It is common knowledge that the Government has never accepted the proposition that the State has a duty to provide unconditionally all medical, dental and ancillary services free of cost for everyone, without regard to individual need or circumstances.</P>
      <P>As I said in my speech to which the Deputies refer, my review of the health services is progressing well.

      <P>If the Deputy had read my statement, he would see that I said I had no intention of recommending to the Government that a free-for-all health service should be introduced.  Apart from the fact that it would not economically be possible, it would be neither essential nor desirable that we should propose to do so.  Those who are unable to pay for medical services should be given them free of cost.  Those who may find it a grave hardship to meet their medical commitments should be assisted and those who can afford treatment should pay for it.</P>

      <P>I think we disposed of the amendment.  The Minister, on the last occasion, said he was going to consider this section again.  I know we have not reached the Report Stage yet but, perhaps, the Minister has had an opportunity of giving some thought to the matter.  If that is so, we could, perhaps, have the benefit of his <Col N="574" /> thoughts now because it might shorten discussion on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given some thought to this but I am afraid I have not come to any final conclusion on it.  The Deputy will remember that I suggested I was contemplating raising the exemption limit to £5,000 in the case of those benefits and on pressure from the Deputy I said I would consider looking into the section more widely than just that.  Having given wider thought to it since, I found that I just could not go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, does the Minister not consider that while raising the exemption limit would certainly ease the problem to some extent it would not eliminate the retrospective effect of the section?  As the section is at present drafted, there is a very serious depreciation in the value of pension schemes which, in fact, have already been approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Perhaps in that connection the Minister would consider some alteration in the retrospection so as to avoid the worst effects which, as at present drafted, the section would have.  As the Minister knows, the provision which people make, in either contributing to a pension scheme or in making a contribution in order to secure a lump sum at death, is designed to alleviate some of the problems which arise for dependants on the death of a wage or salary earner, or a person in that position who is anxious to make some form of provision.  For that reason, perhaps the Minister will further consider the possibility of making the position clear whereby it would be regarded as separate estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in regard to the two points made by Deputy Cosgrave that there is no new retrospection element in this section different from that in operation under any of the other Finance Acts.  As I said on a number of occasions, the duties imposed under the Finance Acts in respect of estates of deceased persons operate, and have always operated, as of the date of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the second point, as far as superannuation schemes are concerned, <Col N="575" /> they have been examined and have been agreed between the proposers of the scheme and the Revenue Commissioners, and that examination does not affect the ultimate liability for death duties as such.  The purpose of the examination, as I understand it, is to ensure to the satisfaction of the proposers of the scheme and the Revenue Commissioners that the contribution payable to the scheme will rank for income tax relief.  Another important point is, during the course of the operation of the scheme, it would not have such elements as payment of large sums periodically so as to depress ultimately the value of the estate of the benefits for estate duty purposes.  To say that the scheme has the approval of the Revenue Commissioners does not, in effect, have anything to do with the ultimate obligation of the benefits for the purposes of death duties arising on the death of the persons involved.</P>
    <P>I should not like to give Deputy Cosgrave the impression that I have anything in contemplation in relation to the two points he has just made.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure about the position so I put down amendment No. 34 just in case.  I do not think this section does anything except bring a married woman's policy within the ambit of the code.  If there is anything other than that, then there is a point in the amendment.  If the effect of the section is merely to abolish the separate estate effect on policies under the Married Women's Status Act, then I think we can say what we have to say on the section itself.  In any event, if it is within the rules of order, I should be happy for the amendment to be discussed with the section.  If the Minister would rather have it that way, I do not mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand it, Deputy Sweetman has in a word explained our position.  We are opposed to the aggregation which is involved by the change in the law proposed by section 23.  The position has been, since the enactment of the proviso referred to in section 4 of the Finance Act of 1894, that this class of benefit is provided as in the case of a person who dedicates himself to providing some benefit, for a named beneficiary, usually his wife, and a person who can never share in any way in the property which is deemed to pass on his death.  It has always been accepted as socially desirable, and therefore conceded by those in charge of the taxing provisions, that, while such property shall be liable to death duties because it is deemed to pass on death, it should be treated as an estate in its own right, a separate estate, and that has meant that there has been a benefit and I think a just benefit, to the estate of a person who makes such provision.</P>
      <P>In Deputy Sweetman's proposals, which were subsequently enacted in the Finance Act of 1955, there was a provision that if a person decided to make provision by means of a number of such benefits&mdash; to take out a policy and nominate a benefit in respect of his wife and another policy in which he nominates a benefit in respect of some other member of the family&mdash;all aggregate together and the property so deemed to pass on his death will be subject to that partial aggregation.  I think that is as far as one reasonably should go in a matter of this kind.  It is proper and it certainly would represent our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But here the Minister for Finance now says we will cut out the exemption or the restriction completely on aggregation.  We will make all death benefits aggregate, to stand as part of the estate passing on death.  A simple example has already been given and there is no harm in repeating it. If a man by means of a life insurance policy makes a provision of benefit for his wife for, say, the sum of £5,000 and dies leaving other estate, amounting to £5,000, the position would be that the death benefits, since <Col N="578" /> they stand on their own, are regarded merely as an estate of £5,000, which does not fall for any duty because it is not in excess of £5,000, and no duty is payable on that estate.  Once this section is passed, this will be regarded as something that will be taxable. When a man dies, if he leaves an estate which has a total value of £10,000, duty will have to be paid at the rate of four per cent, so there is a four per per cent charge of duty on a minimum provision of that kind.  Any Deputy who votes for this section, let there be no mistake about it, will be voting to tax the type of benefit which decent people have traditionally provided for their families.</P>
    <P>I do not see what case can be made for a tax of this kind.  I do not see what justification can be advanced for it.  Indeed, I regard it in many respects as amounting to a breach of faith in relation to people who by dint of hard work and sacrifice in the past, by pinching and saving to keep up the premiums of a life assurance policy in times of stress, have contrived to keep up that policy, in the knowledge that under the law as it has been over the past 60 years, that policy would pay such duty only as would be attributable to its own value.  We now propose, at the end of a lifetime of saving by such a person who wants to have the satisfaction that he has done something worthwhile to benefit his family, to legislate to tax that man for his past efforts.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about savings by Ministers for Finance.  The Minister's predecessor spoke about savings.  The Minister has not been in office long enough to have made a number of speeches on the matter, but he has made one or two speeches about the importance of saving for the future of the country.  Of course that is perfectly true.  It is a truism.  We should all save.  We should all save more, and it is State policy that savings should be encouraged.  We have savings drives from time to time.  Saving was encouraged long before this State was established.  Saving was traditional in Victorian times and recognised as such in Victorian times.  Now in 1965 it is proposed to tax that type of provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> If the Minister stands over this section, the Fianna Fáil Party can be assured&mdash;there are no newspapers now &mdash;that at every possible opportunity, we will drive home to the people the difference between word and action. We will drive home to the people that the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil Party have by this section taxed the widow and other members of the family for whom the decent father has been trying to provide. That is the only sanction we can use, the sanction of advertising to the public that the Minister for Finance is seeking to put this provision through the House by reason of his majority. Any Deputy who votes for this section will do so in the full knowledge and realisation of what is involved.  I regard this as a most retrograde step and one which is contrary to accepted social policy and the national interest.</P>
    <P>If this provision is allowed to pass through the Oireachtas, many people who are saving in other ways and doing other things which they are encouraged to do will say: &ldquo;It is all very well, but when it comes near the time to collect it, when it comes near the time when my store should be available for the purpose I have in mind, will another Minister for Finance come along and tax the provision I made by pinching and saving when I could ill afford it?&rdquo; This is an indefensible section and the Minister has not so far put forward any justification for it.  If the State's finances are such that we have to save the Central Fund by taxing death benefits for widows, we should pack up and leave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that the purpose of the section is to aggregate policies already aggregated by the 1955 Act and to aggregate them with the rest of the free estate.  Very few people will so arrange their business as to leave exactly £5,000 in value in the free estate and exactly £5,000 in the value of the proceeds of an insurance policy or whatever death benefit it is.  At the moment if a person had that, £5,000 would be free under the ordinary exclusion of the first £5,000 of free estate, and £5,000 of the policies, even of the aggregation of policies, would also be free.  There <Col N="580" /> are very few people who so arrange their affairs as to fall into that category. If the sum were £5,010 under the present law, that would be liable to estate duty.</P>

      <P>Whatever the margin is.  I am suggesting that no one will so arrange his business as to leave exactly £5,000 in free estate.  I propose to bring in an amendment on Report Stage that will relieve the position considerably so far as these policies are concerned.  Let me give an example of what I have in mind. Let us assume that a policy worth £5,000 on the person's death matures in favour of the widow, and the person has been paying premiums on that policy for a long number of years in excess of the five year period for which gifts <i>inter vivos</i> will operate. Let us assume that the value of the premiums he has paid up to the five years before his death was £4,000 and the value of the premiums for the five years before his death was £1,000, in that case I propose to free the £4,000.</P>

The purpose of this is to get at the larger estates that are so arranged as to avoid payment of death duty and so make the smaller people, by direct taxation and otherwise, pay what should be forthcoming from these larger estates.

      <P>We cannot discuss the amendment until we see it in its concrete form.  If we are to judge by the explanation we got of this section in the explanatory memorandum, it is questionable whether we shall be able to discuss it even then.  The purpose of an explanatory memorandum is to make the technical provisions of a technical Bill such as the Finance Bill easily understood by lay people.  What does the explanatory memorandum say about section 23:</P>
      <P>Section 23 is designed to ensure that property which was provided by the deceased and which, under existing law, is regarded as property in which he never had an interest and is therefore non-aggregable, will in future be aggregated with the rest of the property passing on his death for the purpose of determining the rate of Estate Duty payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might mean something to a person who knows something about death <Col N="582" /> duty law but would any ordinary person reading that think it was intended to cover a policy effected under the Married Women's Status Act? Would any ordinary person think that such a life insurance policy was covered?  Would any ordinary person think that what was meant was that the policy moneys were to be aggregated with the free estate?  I want to emphasise that the submission by the Minister of this explanatory memorandum in relation to this section in particular is a disgrace.  He ought to be thoroughly ashamed of putting it before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back on the history of the variation in the law made in 1955, I was unable to find the data in my papers over the weekend. The submission made to me in 1955 as a result of which I brought to the House the amendment concerned in the 1955 Act I can remember well. I can remember what happened.  A person arranged his affairs so that he took out 100 separate policies of £1,000 each for his wife.  Under the law then, each policy was to be considered an estate in itself and it was obvious that arrangement was a clear avoidance of liability of duty a person should fairly pay for the benefit of the community.</P>
      <P>Consideration was given at that time &mdash;I can remember it well and I asked the Minister to go back on the record &mdash;as to whether we should have all those policies aggregated with the free estate.  A definite decision was taken by me that we should not make them aggregated, but, for the purpose of preventing that person from taking advantage of that type of avoidance, I provided that all the policies should be aggregated so that a person with very substantial means would be prevented from getting in that way a very substantial sum free of death duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the slightest hesitation now, ten years afterwards, in saying I was right in deciding that the policies would not be aggregated with the free estate.  I was right to say they should not be aggregated <i>inter se</i>.  It prevented avoidance of death duty liabilities and it prevented hardship.  The provision <Col N="583" /> in this section may prevent avoidance but it brings hardship and that is where, in the framing of this Bill, the Minister has been living completely in the clouds.  This is a Bill more fitted for a type of society in other countries&mdash;a society of dissolute dukes and something else.</P>

We have, I am glad to say, arrived at a situation where life insurance companies are playing a full part in national development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This section will have the effect of preventing them playing as full a part in the future because they will not get funds to the same degree.  There was every reason in 1955 for preventing people taking out a number of separate policies because each separate document was to be treated as an estate in itself. There is no reason at all to provide in this Bill that a person must aggregate in order to pay a substantially larger sum to the State.</P>
      <P>On section 22, I said the other night that this is not a provision from which the really rich man will get benefit. The Minister defined a really rich man as not the pipe-smoking rich man but a person with assets in excess of £100,000.  A person with such assets will not pay one penny more under this section because the rate of duty for a policy of £100,000 is 40 per cent. That is the maximum rate payable in any event.  If there were a provision in respect of which a person who had a free estate of, shall we say, £100,000 &mdash;one of the very rich people to whom the Minister referred&mdash;and by taking out a policy worth an additional £100,000 he could make a saving, I could understand the Minister coming to the House.  In fact that man has been paying exactly the same before as he will pay after the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only the people of moderate <Col N="584" /> means who are being assaulted and attacked by this section, and it does no good if the Minister comes to the House and says he will increase the margin here or the margin there.  That will get him into exactly the same difficulties as he got into in relation to another case and in respect of which he, the Government and the entire national economy, are having to pay at the present time.  The reductions that were made there were wrong. They had to be limited and the fact they have been limited has meant a public outcry.  He will get himself into exactly the same trouble here.  He may get himself, perhaps, in slightly worse trouble when it is realised that certain sums that are paid as gratuities will not be taxable at all.</P>
    <P>This is not a case to hit the very big man.  It is a section that is being brought in by the Minister because it is easier to be uniform, easier to work in uniformity with the British law.  It is not because it is necessary or desirable for us by ourselves <i>per se</i> here. It is a bad section.  It has nothing to commend it and the Minister would be well advised to go back and see the memoranda and the decisions I took in 1955 because I think they were the right decisions, to aggregate policies as such and not with the free estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to repeat something, since Deputy Sweetman has again brought up the explanatory memorandum.  He says no ordinary person would understand the full significance of the memorandum in respect of section 23.  I suggest that no ordinary person would understand any part of the memorandum.  It takes a person reasonably versed in income tax law and financial matters generally to understand even the implications of the explanatory memorandum.  The terms of the Bill make it such as would be understood only by an expert but even though the memorandum, with reference to section 23, does not refer specifically to insurance policies, nevertheless, it does not refer only to insurance policies.  There are other forms of benefit that could be affected by it, for example, annuity bonds purchased <Col N="585" /> by a person for another.  I am given to understand that any insurance man, any person who is used to dealing with life assurance, would understand fully the significance of the explanatory memorandum and what section 23 meant.</P>
      <P>I repeat that section 23 does effect what Deputy Sweetman says is so bad: it aggregates the policies which have already been aggregated with the rest of the deceased's estate.  I repeat that the provision for aggregation will not affect the ordinary person, even the more than ordinary person Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Higgins have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it would be even lower than that because the free estate now is £5,000, or rather, there is complete relief of death duties on £5,000 or more.  If a person has £5,000 free estate and £5,000 death benefit estate&mdash;call it that&mdash;they are not aggregated now.  Therefore, there is no duty payable, but if the aggregation of the two estates reaches more than £5,000, then they would be liable.</P>

Are we not going to reach the stage where a £5,000 free <Col N="586" /> estate will be taxed in practically every instance and a £5,000 free estate, in point of fact, will be of little or no value to anybody?  Could we not get a definite ruling that the first £5,000 would be free of tax, no matter how much the free estate would amount to, that there is to be £5,000 free, whether the estate is more or less?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising on the section as it stands, leaving out altogether the marginal cases which have been referred to, as a number of people remarked, people do not always arrange their affairs accurately nor can they be certain that values will come to precise figures.  The principal objection to this section, as we see it, is that it does two things.  For the first time, it aggregates insurance policies with the free estate and, secondly, it penalises people whom we have all tried to encourage and <Col N="588" /> assist, the type of individuals in the community who have, as Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Sweetman said, used their best exertions to provide by insurance policies or by death benefits for their dependants, who have made arrangements with insurance companies and who, at considerable personal sacrifice, pay each year an annuity or premium and who make arrangements whereby the widow will have an annual sum or, alternatively, in a number of cases, a lump sum, who have made the greatest possible effort, even beyond what might be expected of them, and who have denied themselves, and quite possible their families, too, while working and earning their livelihood to ensure that if they die before their families have been reared and provided for, there will be some provision for these families as a result of the policies they have effected through the means provided by insurance companies.</P>
      <P>These people are not merely doing a good social and humanitarian act but they are also doing, from the point of view of economy, something that has been encouraged by successive Ministers for Finance: they are saving.  One of the things that economists have been telling us is that too much is being spent and too little saved.  These savings are economically beneficial and socially desirable.  After considerable study, the insurance companies have developed schemes to provide what are considered the most beneficial terms and to provide for circumstances such as we have been discussing here.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister should reconsider the whole section.  For the first time, we are aggregating the insurance polices formerly separated from the free estate and in that way penalising those who are providing for themselves without any obligation to the State.  If this section, as drafted, goes through and deters people from making this provision which they will otherwise make, it may well be that class of people will be unable to make such provision for the widow and children and provision for these may then become the responsibility of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> I believe this section is economically bad and socially undesirable, and as drafted we must oppose it.  I hope the Minister will reconsider it in a generous and sympathetic manner and amend it so that it will not operate against the economic interest of the State or penalise a number of people in such a way as to prevent them from discharging the social duty of providing for those dependent upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some information as to what class of persons we are really trying to catch.  I think there is a certain amount of confusion generally in the minds of Deputies, as there is some confusion in my mind. If we are to let loose the lower income groups and if the top income groups are to be unaffected, I am forced to the conclusion that we are going to catch the middle man.  I do not believe the middle man is the sort of person we should be chasing, if we should be chasing anyone.  Has the Minister any information that people with estates of £10,000 and upwards are indulging in large-scale avoidance measures to defraud the Revenue?  I very much doubt that.</P>
      <P>I am forced then to the conclusion that this is an effort to achieve uniformity and, if that is so, let us throw it out.  I do not see any value in uniformity as such.  I am prepared to go with the Minister in any case where he can show us that there is a large-scale avoidance of tax by people who can well pay, in cases such as Deputy Sweetman has instanced from his own experience.  If we relieve the small estates of any liability and if the top grade people still have to pay only the top rate, I think we are discriminating against the medium sized estate and I cannot see any justification for that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the explanatory memorandum, I happened to be present at a discussion at which there was a manager of a trustee company and two solicitors also present, all of whom might be supposed to know something about this type of legislation and to understand the explanatory memorandum.  Two of the three did not think that a policy under <Col N="590" /> the Marriage Act was caught.  It is true that they had only had a short time to read it but the fact remains that anybody who had a bare mimimum knowledge of these matters should have been able to follow it.  I do not propose to give the names of these people in public but I will tell the Minister some time when I meet him privately.  The memorandum is designated an explanatory memorandum. Explanatory to whom?  Is it to the technician?  He does not want it because he will read the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum is meant to be something for lay people or for the technician so that he may use it as a guide to certain sections.  In this case it does neither.</P>
      <P>To go back to the section, if a very rich person has free estate of £100,000 made up of stocks and shares, a house or houses and house furniture, and if he takes out an insurance policy for another £100,000, he is no worse off after this section has been enacted than before it came into existence.  He will be paying exactly the same sum. If a person has free estate of £7,000 consisting of a house, furniture and a little money in the bank and has provided an insurance policy for his wife of £3,000, as the law now stands, he would be paying on £7,000 at two per cent which would be £140.  As it will be, he will be paying on £10,000 at four per cent, which is £400, less £150, which is £250.  Therefore, that is the exact margin over that which everybody is losing until you become very rich, and as soon as you become very rich, you are losing nothing by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the explanatory memorandum, I agree with Deputy Sweetman to this extent: I presume it was meant as a guide to those Deputies who are not financial or legal experts.  We are fortunate to have a few such people in the House, but it is fair to say that the vast bulk of Deputies are not in such a happy position.  If this is meant to be an explanatory memorandum for Deputies, it does not serve that purpose.  If necessary, there should be an explanatory memorandum to the explanatory memorandum to make it <Col N="591" /> simpler.  What is the point of giving this to Deputies to whom in point of fact it means little or nothing?  I hope that in the case of future Finance Bills or any other Bills, we will get an explanatory memorandum sufficiently simple and in such lay language that the ordinary Deputy will have no difficulty whatsoever in seeing the pitfalls or anything that he should look for and have a point of view on.</P>
      <P>With regard to this section 23, I do not think that anybody in the House put forward a point of view that there should not be death duties.  Certainly it has not been a subject of debate today.  The question arises: what are we to pay death duties on, and whom are we trying to catch?  I am not particularly interested in the man of £100,000, or over £75,000, or even over £50,000.  The person I am interested in is the small to middle income group person with an estate of £15,000 or thereabouts.  Having that, he would have sufficient money to be able to provide for himself or to pay some death duties.  I do not think this kind of person, while he may not be poor, could be regarded as being very well off.  I think that if the Minister hopes to aggregate the different estates which are to be taxed on death, he ought to aggregate the benefits that can escape, that the free estate and the insurance policy ought to be aggregated, too, that the person whose house might be worth more than £5,000, if he has a similar policy, ought to be able to aggregate his estate in order to rearrange his affairs a bit better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of death duties is to assist the State to provide revenue to help the less fortunate of the middle-class people, and these are the people who are largely going to be caught under this Bill.  We are taxing these people to get money to give them benefits at some future date, which seems a crazy type of finance.  Could we not try to formulate some scheme of what we believe estate duty should be and at what stage it should stop? I understand that section 22 is going to be resubmitted to the House and I would suggest that the Minister might <Col N="592" /> consider having section 23 resubmitted so that in due course we could discuss it when we would know exactly what we were discussing and what his point of view is.  He perhaps could tell us what type of person he is hoping to catch, what type of person he does not wish to catch, and where we stand. At the moment the whole position is far from clear to me and, I am sure, to many members of the House.  The explanations he has given have not in all cases made the position clearer. In the case of a person who has a house worth £5,000, I think the Minister mentioned that he might extend this to £7,000.  Is this on the free estate or on the total aggregate estate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the point of view of the Minister is that estates of £7,000 or over would be subject to death duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House an intimation of two further amendments that I propose which would bring it up to maybe £10,000 in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to state some policy or some philosophy which he believes in regarding estates, that estates of such and such in size should pay death duties and estates under it should not. It should not be difficult to let us know what exactly we believe in and are trying to achieve, the people who are to be taxed and those whom we do not want to tax.  Surely we could get a definite statement from the Minister on what the Government believe.  As it stands, I would not be fully inclined to vote for section 23, but if we understood what the Minister has in mind exactly, what he is hoping to do and the type of person affected, then if we hear his explanation, perhaps we would not oppose this section.  For that reason, is it possible that this section <Col N="593" /> could be recommitted so that we possibly would know a bit more clearly what the Minister's point of view is and his philosophy is on death duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, when we have death duties in general, we have to see that we implement them.  There are certain points which make it difficult to say that at this particular stage there will be no duty or no higher duty.  We have to fix some point at some stage from which you start and some point on top at which we finish.  Where that point ought to be is the difficulty.  We have the 40 per cent rate on £100,000 above which we do not go.  Then the difficulty about the minimum arises because there are changes in certain circumstances. If a widow and children are left, the estate given to them will be liable to different rates according to the number of children left with the widow.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am going to make further easing provisions here by relieving a certain proportion of the insurance policy.  I admit that I could not tell specifically now how that would work and I could not answer Deputy Norton's question in any great detail in order to put a figure in his mind, but what I have said is that the £150 abatement which I propose to allow for the widow and £100 for each of the dependent children will, I hope, raise those two sums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When you go into certain circumstances, you create a little chink which is going to widen out to a considerable extent to relieve a lot of people.  It could break down the whole code.  I can assure you that people who have to pay death duties are pretty slick about this.  They can not only devise systems themselves but they pay very expensive fees to advisers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if a man with a modest-sized house worth £5,000 or <Col N="594" /> £6,000 makes a provision for payment of estate duty for his wife and three or four children, it is wrong to have a tax provision in respect of the wife and children and to tax the very dwelling in which they live.  I know the Minister's problem.  I am for death duties but I do not want to see people harmed to the extent to which this section would appear to harm them. It is a question of getting a figure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> To delete subsection (4) and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Subsections (1) and (3) of this section shall have effect only in cases in which the deceased dies after 11th May, 1968.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister gave some indication at an early stage that he differed from my interpretation of section 24 and he will remember that I indicated to him then the case I had in mind.  The case is that a person made a gift on 1st January, 1963, and dies on 2nd January, 1966.  That is more than three years, but the disposition was made within three years before such passing. Under subsection (4), in the case I have in mind, the gift will have been made within three years before the passing of the Act and there will, therefore, be liability to duty.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Act of 1910, section 59, the position was dealt with entirely differently.  It was provided in that Act that the purpose was to deal with people who had made a gift after 13th April, 1908.  I understand 13th April, 1908, was the date of the Budget of that year and the Act provided that, in the case of a person dying on or after 30th April, 1909, there was then one year in which a gift was exempt. The Act of 1909 provided that the one year would be extended to three years and that any gift already made would be clear.  This Bill provides that what was three years must now be five years but it does not provide the same clearance as given in section 59.  I should like the Minister to explain why he has drafted it in this way and has not followed the precedent in the 1910 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that what I said the last day was correct, that the transitional relieving period which now operates, that is, the three years before the passing of the Act, was the same as the transitional relieving period in the 1910 Act except that three years are substituted for one year. I also believe that if the amendment proposed by Deputy Sweetman was accepted, it would introduce a new principle altogether in death duties&mdash; one that should not be accepted.  Let me give an example.  If a gift were <Col N="601" /> made before the passing of the Bill by a person dying after the 11th May, 1968&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must go back to the 1910 Act, which made it quite clear that any dispositions then made would run out, so to speak, for a year.  As I understand it, Budget day was the 30th April, 1908, and the Act starts off by saying that in the case of a person dying after the 30th April, 1909, the liability provided would obtain but that there would be no liability in the case of a gift made before the 30th April, 1908.  Therefore, anything that had this one year exemption on the day Mr. Lloyd George stood up to make his Budget <Col N="602" /> speech remained exempt.  I do not mind which way the Minister does it but the period should run out.  The period ran out the year before, and the Minister should let the period run out now.  My amendment is framed exactly as the amendment in the 1910 Act was framed but I am quite prepared to put it another way.  Would the Minister prefer it to provide as follows: &ldquo;this section shall have effect only in cases in which the deceased dies after the passing of the Act and the relevant disposition, surrender, assurance, divesting, determination or other transaction was made or effected after the 11th May, 1962&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 1962, three years back.  Then everything that had gone, if it was made after that date, would have run out after the passing of the Act and three years before it. I want to ensure, as was done in 1909, that a valid gift runs its term and be free.  That is what the 1909 Act does in section 59 but it is not what this section does.  I do not mind how the section is amended as long as it arrives at the same conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplementing, in a different way, what Deputy Sweetman said, I think we are all agreed, are we not, on this business of principle, that a gift which was made by anyone before the Minister stood up to make his Budget statement should carry with it and surrounding it the benefit of the law as it was at the time of the disposition?  Putting it very gently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a better summary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the consensus of opinion here is that such a gift should be treated for this purpose, or any other purpose, in the light of the law as it was when the gift was made.  If we are agreed on that, it seems to me&mdash;this is only a suggestion, it is not intended to be a drafting answer to the matter&mdash;that it would be quite simple to provide a subsection in this section to the effect that this <Col N="603" /> section shall not apply to any gift made before the 11th May, 1965.  If we so provide in relation to any gift made before the Minister made his Budget statement, then the three year period applies in relation to any gift made after that and the law falls into place in relation to time and death and so on, but we are not concerned with providing in relation to time and death.  The section would operate in relation to any gift made after Budget day, or any date we take, but obviously Budget day would seem to be the proper date.  Then, after Budget day, the provisions of section 24 would apply.</P>
      <P>I think that would meet what Deputy Sweetman has in mind and the expressed view and sentiment of the Minister that retrospection should not apply.  The only way it does, it seems to me, is if you pass from Budget day and take a day such as the day after the passing of the Act.  Then you become involved in too many complications in dealing with the death of the man, the time of disposition and so on, and you get into the kind of difficulty in which we all are.  Go back to the simple thing and say that the Act will not affect any gift made before Budget day and that only the law then applying should attach to these gifts, and in relation to any gift made after Budget day, if the Dáil passes this Bill, the new law should apply.  Certainly that would be in accordance with ordinary democratic practice and would kill any idea of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that if he makes some approach along that line on the Report Stage something could be done.  Certainly I think it is clear that the examples given by Deputy Sweetman do indicate, within the section as it stands, a case of retrospection. They do indicate in regard to a disposition made prior to the passing of this Bill, or prior to Budget day, that there is a situation in which under the section there is retroactive effect of the law and the disposition made in the light of certain law is now finding the law different.  We do not desire that and we should not allow <Col N="604" /> it to happen.  We can prevent it by the simple expedient of making the section apply only to gifts made after the Minister's statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As it appears from the section as drafted, the 1910 Act to which we have referred was in fact the Finance 1909-10 Acts of 1910. Apparently, for what reason I do not know, the Act covered the two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands simply substitutes &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;3 years&rdquo; in both places where &ldquo;3 years&rdquo; occur in the 1910 Act.  I understand that, for the purpose of that Act, Budget day was 30th April, 1909, and, by reason of the year's operation of the <i>inter vivos</i> provision, gifts made before 30th April, 1908 were excluded.  Therefore, the retrospective period was one year.  It coincides with the period in which gifts <i>inter vivos</i> were then excluded.  We are doing exactly the same thing, except that we are putting the five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be full protection.  My argument on this amendment is designed solely to ensure that you do exactly what was done in 1909.  As I understand the situation, the Finance Act, 1910, was passed on 29th April, 1910.  The Finance Act, 1910, was enacted as a result of the Budget on 30th April, 1909.  When the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he then was, stood up on that date, he indicated that any gift which had already run its full term before Budget day would be clear.  That is not the position here because the words here are &ldquo;within 3 years from the passing of the Act&rdquo;.  It seems to me that that is not the same.  The position, as I read it, is that if the Minister takes the Finance Act, 1910, and takes section 59 and alters all the figures, 5 for 3, all the way down in section 59 and <Col N="605" /> then comes back to this House, I do not know about my colleagues but I shall not object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the object of that drafting is to ensure that a gift which has achieved the purpose under the law at the time of the disposition will not now be caught.  In other words, a gift in respect of which, at that time, the 12 months had expired, would not be caught.  But that is only a little bit of double-dealing, if you like, because the objection to retrospection surely is in relation to the gift about which, at the time it is made, the law says: &ldquo;If you make that gift and 3 years pass, that gift shall not be liable to death duties&rdquo;, and so it should be.  Now, 12 months later&mdash;that 12 months gone&mdash; the Minister for Finance comes in and changes the law and the person who had the gift and the person who made it now find that instead of merely having to live another two years, he now has to live another four years to escape the impact of death duties. That is retrospection and, no matter whether or not the section in the Finance Act, 1910, is correctly applied here, I would feel that that kind of retrospection is contrary to the form in which all of us here would desire to see our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can achieve an absolute guarantee that there will be no retrospection if we say: &ldquo;If we are changing the law, it shall not affect any gifts made before we announce the change.&rdquo;  That is perfectly clear.  It is simple and easily understood.  It does not require any technical knowledge or anything of that kind to appreciate what we are doing.  The law shall operate only in relation to gifts made after Budget day if we say that there is no retrospection and the built-in protection for a gift will operate or not operate according to the law immediately <Col N="606" /> before it.  That is the kind of object I thought the Minister was standing for and a sentiment which I thought he was expressing and which I was prepared to applaud.</P>

      <P>I would agree very much with Deputy O'Higgins on that point.  I feel it is a pity that we have not the Official Reports of last week's debate because, according to my recollection, we dealt with this matter generally in connection with section 18.  A number of amendments were put down by Fine Gael Deputies dealing with retrospection generally which were withdrawn on the Minister's general undertaking to review the position further.  I cannot see any real difference between the matter which the Minister has conceded to some extent under section 18 and the matter which is under discussion now.  I am all with Deputy O'Higgins: the simpler the better.  I think that is a very good rule to adopt.  Far too much of our financial provisions and our taxation code is shrouded in complete mystery, due to the amount of verbiage which surrounds it.  I should feel very much happier with this if the Minister would give us some indication that he will reconsider this subsection of section 24 in exactly the same way as he has done in relation to section 18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 21, line 31, after &ldquo;years&rdquo; to add:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or who if over the age of sixteen years was at the death of the deceased receiving full time instruction at any university college, school or other educational establishment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is, I think, quite clear.  It is to provide the abatement provision which the Minister proposes, in the same way as is allowed in the income tax code, in respect of a member of the family who is receiving instruction at a university, school or other educational establishment.  It does not require any words of mine to convince Deputies that such a boy or girl is in all respects a dependant in the household.  It would appear to be reasonable that, if in a family containing such a boy or girl there is the tragedy of the death of the father, or whoever is the important member of the family, if we are providing for abatement for the widow and children under 16 years of age, we should certainly extend the abatement to a child over 16 years of age who is not earning because he or she is seeking further education and training.  That is the object of the <Col N="612" /> amendment, and I hope the Minister will sympathetically entertain the proposal in the amendment, even if the manner in which it is drafted or put forward is not particularly apt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder can I add something to what Deputy O'Higgins said, because I personally would like to see some extension of the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  I would be with him completely that the other classes to which he referred are very deserving. Very often, particularly in the country areas, we find a child who is over 16 years but is still very much a dependant. There may be a daughter, or two daughters, still working at home for no wages, and sometimes there may even be sons over 16 years working on the farm, and with no income of their own.  I do not know what sort of definition we should bring in and I wonder would the Minister be able to help us in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am not a country man myself and possibly it is out of order for me to introduce this, but it is something which I know other Deputies are concerned about, and if someone else could develop this theme better, I would be quite happy about it.  I feel that limiting it to children of 16 years does not really meet the case.  Probably a better case could be made than I can make for children who are over 16 years, but who are still literally dependants, either because they are not paid wages or because they are physically or mentally handicapped in some way, and will remain dependent for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in this case seem to indicate a child who would be dependent on the estate? It is common in country districts for a boy or girl to be resident at home and not have any earning capacity other than their labour in the home.  When they come to leave the home, they must of necessity be a burden on it. It seems to me that if the relief proposed by the Minister is to have effect <Col N="613" /> in the rural areas, it should cover children who are dependent on the estate.</P>
      <P>One other point strikes me.  I listened as attentively as possible to the discussion on the benefit to the widow.  If the wife is the legal owner and she dies first, is the widower entitled to the same benefit?</P>

      <P>This is a relief, and it is difficult to create all the reliefs at the same time.  The difficulty which would arise in the case suggested by Deputy Booth and perhaps amplified somewhat by Deputy Kennedy is in trying to define &ldquo;rural areas&rdquo;.  This is a problem which has cropped up in many Bills.  I think it would be reasonable to accept the spirit of the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins.  I think I can go that far anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5) to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>In this amendment I am trying to draw attention to something I think the Minister does not mean.  In the first part of section 26, &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; is defined as being property accruing to a dependant.  We then go on to define a &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; as a widow or child. In subsection (3) (a) and (b) we define the concession that is being given in relation to the widow's benefit or in relation to the child's benefit.  We must therefore relate back the concession to property accruing to a child, for example, under the joint meaning of these two sections.</P>
      <P>When you come on to subsection (5) (a), you find:</P>
      <P>In a case in which the amount of a benefit is not affected by a liability to estate duty arising in connection with the death of the deceased, no abatement shall be made under those subsections;</P>
      <P>A paraphrase of that would be: &ldquo;In a case in which the amount of the property going to a child is not affected by a liability to death duty.&rdquo;  It seems to me that on that basis if a person has an estate of £15,000&mdash;the size of the estate provided by the Minister&mdash; and leaves a widow and three children, if he leaves each of the children £2,000 and the residue to the widow, then none of the children is getting a benefit affected by a liability to death duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the amount allowed in that case is £150. If, on the other hand, the same testator goes to a good solicitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the solicitor draws the will with this section in mind and says the effect of the will is to leave nine-fifteenths to the widow and two-fifteenths to each child, then the abatement of estate duty will be not £150 but £450.  It seems to me obviously wrong that the substantial <Col N="615" /> difference in the concession of £300 should depend on a mere technicality in drawing a document like that.  It seems grossly unfair that premium should be put on that technicality.  An efficient way of covering both cases would be through this amendment.  I am equally willing to accept any other method by which the normal manner in which a testator would draw a will like that would qualify for the benefit rather than the abnormal way of putting it at one-fifteenth shares.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman is quite correct.  If a person leaves specific sums, the residue would be caught for estate duty and not the specific sums. One need not go to the point of setting out certain fractions of the estate in order to ensure that the maximum abatement benefit will be got, but in the case of the estate he mentioned, if instead of saying two-fifteenths, the testator said £2,000 to child A, £2,000 to child B and the residue to the wife, that would leave the wife the same fraction, nine-fifteenths.  The solicitor could advise the client to include in the will provision that all the specific bequests will bear a share of the duty, in which event the full value of the abatement would accrue, and I am sure a prudent solicitor would be alive to that situation and so advise his client.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 22, line 22, to insert &ldquo;or created&rdquo; after &ldquo;conferred&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was prompted by the experience of the House in relation to the introduction of the Committee Stage of the Succession Bill.  Deputies will perhaps recall that we had the novel experience of the Minister for Justice moving a Financial Resolution on the inception of the Committee Stage of the Succession Bill.  On inquiry from Fine Gael Deputies, it quickly became apparent that the change in the law proposed under the Succession Bill would, by reason of the creation of legal right in a widow, create an estate or a succession which might pass and which might become liable to death duty provisions.  Here, <Col N="617" /> under section 27, there is still the obscure approach which seems to be part and parcel of the drafting of the finance legislation, because this coy section&mdash;it is a coy section&mdash;is a provision aimed at giving relief.</P>
    <P>It proposes in effect to abolish legacy duty in respect of widows and that, of course, is desirable.  However, the manner in which it is put forward here is to abolish the one per cent on succession duty and the additional succession duty at the 10/- rate on a legacy from a testator or intestate dying after the passing of the Bill.  Of course, this Bill, presumably, was in draft at the same time as the Succession Bill went into draft and possibly the drafting was not fully considered because it appears to me that &ldquo;a succession conferred&rdquo; are words suitable to cover successions which arise in the normal way but I do not know whether the word &ldquo;conferred&rdquo; is sufficiently wide to include a succession created by statute, a statutory right which, in fact, is the result of the Succession Bill if it is passed.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I suggest, to make the thing perfectly clear, that we should include in the section the words which I have suggested, which would mean that the concluding words of subsection (1) of the section would then read:</P>
    <P>... or on a succession conferred or created after such passing.</P>
    <P>If that were done it would be perfectly clear that the statutory legal right if it is subsequently passed and becomes part of the law would be a succession created by Act of Parliament and would enjoy the exemption which is proposed in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told the technical word employed in the Death Duty Acts in relation to the creation of successions is &ldquo;conferred&rdquo;.  That word is in sections 3 and 5 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853 and, therefore, it is considered that the word used, &ldquo;conferred&rdquo;, includes the word &ldquo;created&rdquo; proposed by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point he raised on the Succession Bill, the Succession Duty Act of 1853 in section 2, says that every devolution by law of any <Col N="618" /> benefit or any beneficial interest in property confers a succession.  So that, the Succession Bill is caught up, I take it, with the earlier Succession Duty Act, 1853, and I understand that the word &ldquo;conferred&rdquo; is all-embracing for the purpose.</P>

      <P>Before section 28, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The duty upon an account of <Col N="619" /> property or an interest ceasing on death to which sections 18 and 19 of this Act apply or the duty due upon an account of chattels real, may, at the option of the person delivering the account, be paid by eight equal yearly instalments or sixteen half-yearly instalments with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the date at which the first instalment is due and such instalment shall be due at the expiration of one year from the death, and the interest on the unpaid portion of the duty shall be added to each instalment and paid accordingly; but the duty for the time being unpaid with such interest to the date of payment may be paid at any time, and in case the property is sold, shall be paid on completion of the sale.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point of sections 18 and 19 of the Bill is that you get behind the shares of the company and you go back to the property itself.  If you are going back to the property itself for the purpose of assessing duty, equally you should go back to the property itself for the purpose of the reliefs.  What is sauce for the goose should be also sauce for the gander.</P>
      <P>In relation to land, hereditaments and real estate generally, there is a relief where deaths come quickly one after the other and there is equally in such cases a provision for extending the payment of the duty over a period of years.  The amendment which Deputy O'Higgins moved and to which he asked me to address myself covers the extension rather than the quick succession.  We had a discussion on the quick succession part of it already but, if there is going to be the going back behind the ownership of the shares to make sure that greater duty is obtained, equally there should be the arrangement to allow the people concerned to pay the duty over a period of years.  If this is not done it will have, in my view, the effect of closing down many a family business after the death of one of the main owners of such business.</P>

      <P>Before section 28, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1914, is hereby amended by inserting after `land' where it first occurs of the following:</P>

      <P>Before section 28, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subsection (1) of section 10 of the Finance Act, 1894, is hereby repealed and there shall be substituted in lieu thereof the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioners with respect to the repayment of any excess of duty, or by the amount of duty claimed by the Commissioners whether on the ground of the rate charged, the value of any property or otherwise may appeal to the High Court within the time and in the manner provided by Rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a person brings an <Col N="622" /> appeal under section 10 of the Finance Act, 1894, the Commissioners may, if they so think fit, charge the assets of the deceased with the amount of the duty claimed, and such charge shall have effect as on and from the date upon which such charges is duly registered against the property of the deceased and shall take priority over all charges and incumbrances whether statutory or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(3)  No fee or other payment shall be required for the registration of any charge authorised by subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subsection (4) of section 10 of the Finance Act, 1894, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to simplify and make easier the means of appeal against a charge of estate duty as put forward by the Revenue Commissioners.  Deputies who have taken part in this debate up to the present must appreciate that the death duty code in this country is extremely complex, difficult and technical.  Complex and involved as the situation is at the moment, the position of people who, in fact, are subsequently visited with a charge for duty is made extremely difficult by the form in which an appeal may be taken.  One would imagine that there should be a simple form of appeal, but, under the law as it is, if a person wishes to appeal against the decision of the Revenue Commissioner that person must lodge the amount of duty.</P>
    <P>That is frequently quite an intolerable liability to discharge.  People are often not in a position to do it, which means that the appeals section cannot be used and does not function.  If we decide to confer the right of appeal on a person charged with duty, it is only fair that we should make the appeals section work.  At the moment it does not work in many cases because the duty to be lodged cannot be found. The object of the amendment is to ensure that, where a person is aggrieved by a decision of the Revenue Commissioners, he can lodge notice of appeal and have the matter decided <Col N="623" /> either for or against him by an independent court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that subsection (1) of section 10 of the Finance Act contains ample facilities for appeal. It is true that it is a condition that the appellant should lodge the duty claimed by the Revenue Commissioners but the court has power, in cases of hardship, to dispense with the lodgment requirement subject to the appellent giving securities for the amount claimed.  That should take care of the ordinary case in which hardship would arise.  My experience of the courts is not as extensive as that of Deputy O'Higgins but I have found that the courts are generally reasonable in taking security for costs or for tax, as in this case, and they would not, in genuine cases of hardship, impose an undue burden on any person seeking recourse to the courts.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggests as part of the amendment that where a person brings an appeal under section 10 of the Finance Act, 1894, the Commissioners may, if they so think fit, charge the assets of the deceased with the amount of the duty claimed, and such charge shall have effect as on and from the date on which such charge is duly registered.  Two difficulties would be involved there.  The first is that if the property is settled property a charge would not be effective in any event.  I do not think it would be equitable that all the property of the person should be charged.  The subject property of the appeal must be the same as the property charged for.</P>
      <P>If the assets of the deceased were in the form of British securities, the assessment of duty on which was appealed, then the charge of the Revenue Commissioners would not be very effective.  Having regard to this difficulty and to the fact that the courts have the power to dispense with the lodgment of the amount of the duty claimed, I suggest that the appellant has ample protection already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters to which I would like to refer very briefly.  The first is the case of a recipient of certain social welfare benefits.  I have one case in mind which has come to my knowledge of a woman who became a widow and was entitled to, and was granted, a widow's pension in the normal way.  She then became blind and was, I think, very correctly entitled to a blind pension as well.  When she came to qualify for the old age pension, instead of getting an increase or even continuing to get what she had got, she was reduced by 15/- per week.  I know that this case is an exceptional one in the social welfare code, and one does not normally qualify for two different classes of benefit, but it is very reasonable that a blind widow should be treated more generously than a widow who is in full possession of her faculties.  She might not be able to contribute to her own upkeep.  I would ask the Minister to investigate that type of case and see whether he could make some amendment of the regulations so that a widow in that position will not suffer when she reaches qualification age for old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case which has come to my mind, and which I believe is not unique at all, is that of a person who is not normally insurable, a self-employed worker, who is injured and disabled.  I have come across the case of one of my constituents who was self-employed as a carrier.  He fell from his vehicle and suffered injuries when the vehicle went over him, as a result of which, after a long period in hospital, both legs had to be amputated. This man is now completely disabled and is not entitled to any pension whatsoever because he was not insured.  No third party could be held responsible because no third party was involved.  Here again I hope the Minister could find some way in <Col N="625" /> which people in that category could be assisted.</P>
    <P>This man is at present being supported by his two sons, one of whom is in permanent employment and the other in temporary employment.  Their main trouble is to find someone who can look after their father during their working day.  They can and do look after him very loyally in the evening, and they set him up in his chair in the morning before they go to work, but from the time they leave the house until they come back, they are entirely dependent on their neighbours and various charitable workers who may drop in from time to time and see that this entirely helpless man is being looked after.  Quite apart from that, he does need attention during the day and his two sons are unable to finance that out of their own means. They can look after his normal living expenses.  If the Minister could look into that case, I would be very grateful. I can quite see that we do not want to encourage people not to become voluntary contributors, but cases like that do arise within the community and I think it would be the will of the community generally that some effort should be made to alleviate their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The old age pensioners have got some increase in their pensions this year and this has been welcomed by everyone.  I think nobody who pays taxes objects to paying for this increase.  It must be remembered, however, that they are still very badly off and that the means test for non-contributory pensioners is very rigid and severe.  A non-contributory pensioner begins to have his pension reduced under the means test if he or she has another income of about £1 per week, and by the time an income of a little over £2 has been proved, the best part of the pension has been removed altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that in assessing the means derived from a small farm, the Department officers are often very severe, because when people are old, they cannot extract as much profit from their few head of stock as when they are fit and energetic, and very <Col N="626" /> often they have to pay somebody or give them gratuities to get things done which they are no longer able to do themselves.</P>
    <P>If they have a little money, the supposed income therefrom is also assessed at a very high rate, and if they have more than £375 in their possession, the income from this is calculated at ten per cent to disqualify them from a pension.  These poor people hang on to their few pounds because with a future of decreasing mobility and failing health before them, the savings they have are their only sheet anchor.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps symptomatic of the Minister's approach to this that the 10/- given goes only to those with less than £26.  If they have more, they get only 5/-.  They also have to wait for long and weary months to get it.  I do not want to appear critical of the Minister, but the crying need moves me to make these points.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a lot more that can be done for old people than giving them a pension.  When old persons need hospitalisation for the first time, I feel that they should go for some weeks to a proper geriatric unit where a decision can be made as to whether or not they will be again physically able to go out into the world.  While this was taking place and they were getting all the medical treatment they required, an almoner could go out to their homes and report on whether their home circumstances would allow their return, if their state of health did. Then, and only then, should a decision be made as to whether they should go to the county home or not.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in children's allowances this year.  As the prices of foodstuffs and clothes increase, it becomes daily more difficult for housewives to rear their children as they would wish.  I feel that there should have been some provision for this, and if it were not possible for every child, surely those with large families should have got some increases.</P>
    <P>While home assistance is disbursed by the local authorities, no money comes from the Department of Social <Col N="627" /> Welfare or the Department of Health to supplement what can be given from the rates.  The Minister for Social Welfare might think of introducing some scheme whereby home assistance would be met from his Department, thus relieving the rates and giving the poor person a far better chance of getting some realistic help.</P>
    <P>The single man in the rural area has just been cut off unemployment assistance for the summer months.  I know that there are very few people who have no stamps to get unemployment benefit and are on home assistance in the rural areas, but there are the few.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister will press on the Government by next year to give him more funds to help the needy.  Surely it is the duty of everyone to help one's neighbour who is less fortunate.  I wish him well in his task in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise the change in the approach this particular year to those under the social welfare code.  Some people say that general elections are bad things for the country, but for one section of people anyway, the underprivileged, the recent general election has borne much fruit. We are glad to say that Fianna Fáil have adopted part of the Fine Gael policy which was announced at the time of the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome the increases given to the various classes of persons who are unable to provide for themselves. It is accepted generally in the country that it was as a result of the Fine Gael policy announced before the election that these increases took place.  Up to this a miserable half crown was given each year, not even enough to meet the cost of living.  However, why should Fianna Fáil bring in a stricter means test this year?  Why should all the non-contributory pensioners not get their 10/- for which they have to wait long enough, until August?  If a person has the small sum of 11/- a week from any other source he gets only half the increase.  Up to this the non-contributory pensioner living on his own got home assistance to the extent <Col N="628" /> of at least 10/- a week and there was a very strict examination before it was given.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mrs. Burke pointed out, this is the one service given by the county council which is not contributed to from central funds.  Roads, housing, disablement benefit, all other services given by the county council, get a contribution from central funds.  I appeal to the Minister not to have this test imposed on old people in respect of the extra 10/-.  I hope that when they do receive this increase, the old age pensioners will not have to suffer a reduction in their home assistance allowance.  Imagine any person living on his own, who has to pay rent, provide fuel and the other necessaries of life, trying to support himself on the very small amount of 47/6 per week.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has brought in sections 8 to 10 in this Social Welfare Bill which will enable people in the congested areas to work their land to the fullest capacity and to the extent of their ability, and that there will not be a strict inspection of every family and of every beast on the land for the purpose of a means test in relation to home assistance.  My constituency is not in the congested districts and consequently is not affected in this regard, but even if it were, there are very few of this type of people in the constituency, small farmers who would be drawing unemployment assistance.  However, there is another category there, the ordinary worker who undertakes task work such as thinning beet and turnips. When the end of the year comes, the amount he has earned in that task work is totalled and is assessed as means for the purpose of home assistance. It is a great hardship that a married man who takes on task work in my area, which is a tillage county, for eight or ten weeks during the spring or autumn, as the case may be, should have his earnings taken into account when he applies for unemployment assistance and have his benefit reduced by three, four or five shillings per week.  The Government and this House should encourage people to work, not discourage them.  I would ask the <Col N="629" /> Minister to look into this matter.  He has already brought in other sections affecting the west and the congested districts and he should introduce a provision in order to ensure that these workers' earnings for this task work will not be assessed as means when they are claiming unemployment assistance in the following year.</P>
    <P>There is a great temptation for people who sign for unemployment assistance to go out and work after signing in the morning.  I would ask the Minister not to put them in the position of being tempted to break regulations in this respect.  He should encourage these people to go out to work.  Labour is very scarce in the country&mdash;we know the extent of emigration that has taken place since Fianna Fáil took office in 1957&mdash;and farmers would be very pleased to have this labour available.  This would be an encouragement to people to stay in the country and I would ask the Minister to introduce a provision to relieve the situation.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been brought to my notice several times is that when a person falls ill, he has to forgo the first three days of his sickness benefit.  When the head of a family or a single man becomes sick, he requires more assistance than when he is working.  I know that if a man falls ill again within 13 weeks of his previous illness, he will not have the first three days excluded, but it is a serious handicap for people to be denied sickness benefit for these three days.  I would ask the Minister again, now that the efforts of the Fine Gael Party have resulted in a more liberal approach to the social welfare code, to reconsider this matter.  A person should be entitled to draw national health benefit from the day he falls sick and submits his first certificate and not be penalised for the first three days.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention in relation to workmen's compensation. The maximum amount a person can draw is £4 10s. per week.  This matter has been raised here on several occasions, always accompanied by a request that the £4 10s be increased.  In the old days, when <Col N="630" /> workmen's compensation was £2 10s. per week, a person was entitled to draw up to 75 per cent of the wages he earned in the previous 12 months. Now £4 10s. today could not be 75 per cent of wages earned in the previous 12 months.  I know the Minister will say he intends to have a comprehensive scheme of workmen's compensation. In the meantime, I think the Minister should increase the amount of the allowance.</P>
    <P>Recently I had a case of a farm labourer who was earning £8 per week.  He had been out of work through injury in the course of his work for six or seven weeks and he could not understand why he should be compelled to go on drawing at the rate of £4 10s. per week.  This maximum was introduced in 1956.  It bears no relationship to the cost of living today and the general pattern of increases in wages.  A substantial increase is warranted.  The Minister should not wait until he introduces a Bill to increase the allowance of £4 10s. per week.</P>
    <P>I have had several cases in the past year of sickness benefit claimants being told that they should apply for workmen's compensation.  Apparently, if a man falls ill while at work he is sent a form to fill in.  He states on that form that he fell ill at work and he is immediately told he should be drawing workmen's compensation. That can continue for as long as a month.  One can imagine the position of a man with a family waiting for over a month for a decision as to whether he is entitled to social welfare benefit, sickness benefit or workmen's compensation.  I have had several cases, as I say, and I have had to get in touch with the Minister's Department and prove to the Department that the man was ill.  He had not met with an accident.  He went home sick from work.  The Minister should look into this and correct the present unsatisfactory position.  Social welfare benefit should be paid immediately.  If it should transpire that a recipient was really entitled to workmen's compensation then it is an easy matter to recoup the moneys spent from the insurance company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The last point I want to raise is the position of the person drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  A neighbour with a grudge writes an anonymous letter saying that the man is at work.  An inquiry is called for if a person is actually working and drawing assistance at the same time, but I know cases where men with families were cut off benefit immediately on receipt of an anonymous letter.  That should not occur. Make inquiries and, if the allegations in the letter are substantiated, cut the man off, but do not cut him off immediately on receipt of the letter.  It is wrong that a person should be denied his due share.  I ask the Minister to look into these things and to consider again the giving of a 5/-increase to non-contributory pensioners with an income of £27 per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crotty's reference to the fact that, under the workmen's compensation code, a worker earning £14, £15 or £16 per week is entitled to a maximum of only £4 10s. per week underlines the anachronisms with which the social welfare code abounds.  It was, I think, in 1955 that the figure of £4 10s. was fixed.  It baffles comprehension why, between 1955 and 1965, no one in the Minister's Department saw any need for a revision of the figure.  If the Minister and his Department were in touch with the people to whom they are under an obligation they would know that there is a great deal of suffering today because of their failure to revise the figure of £4 10s.  Why revision should stop at 1955 and the figure should remain static ever since is something I should like the Minister to explain to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that I and others are not at all satisfied that the social welfare code is being administered properly?  Deputy Crotty has already drawn attention to the delays which occur in the payment of social welfare benefits.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the conduct of some of the medical referees appointed by the Minister.  I know one who <Col N="632" /> greeted an old lady on one occasion: &ldquo;You are lasting a long time, aren't you?&rdquo; That may be a good joke coming from equal to equal, but coming from an officer of the Minister's Department to one of these, our least brethren, it is absolutely unpardonable. If it were an isolated incident I might overlook it, but I know the attitude adopted by many of the Minister's officials towards these people. The social welfare code should be administered in a spirit of charity, in the real sense of that word, and in the realisation that the people looking for something are in real difficulty.  They are looking for understanding and help.  But they do not get it.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely blame the Minister's officials because the printed regulations are very clear.  Rule 3 lays it down that a claimant shall not be absent from his place of residence without leaving word of where he may be found.  I do not know of any other Christian society which imposes upon a human being the responsibility of leaving at his house a minute to minute description of where he may be found simply because he has the misfortune to have recourse to social welfare. The Minister may say that this is merely a headline but the Minister and his officials know as well as I do that, if I make representations on behalf of somebody, I will be told he is not entitled to benefit because he did not obey the rules; he was absent from his place of residence and did not leave word of where he might be found.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to remove these petty annoyances.  Indeed, they are more than petty; they are unchristian and anachronistic and unfitted to the system under which we live nowadays.  I do not think the Minister could subscribe to the suggestion that because somebody has the misfortune to have recourse to his Department, he cannot go outside his house without letting the Minister's officials know exactly where he is going to be all through the day, that he will have to say: &ldquo;I will be in Paddy Murphy's public house at 12 o'clock and I will be in the toilet at 12.15 and at 12.30, I will be over in <Col N="633" /> Johnny Murphy's house and at 12.45 I will go up to say a few prayers in the church.&rdquo;  Is that what the Minister requires of people?  It may be true that these regulations need not be enforced but they can be enforced.  What I object to is the letter of a rule such as that being imposed on people, a rule which is absolutely unsustainable.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why in the city of Cork, due to some reason that I cannot comprehend and which nobody in the city of Cork can comprehend, what used be national health payments must come up to Dublin first and then back to Cork.  The cheques must come down from Dublin and go to the local employment exchange from which they are sent out by some special courier in the employment exchange. Time and again, it has been suggested to the Minister that the simple thing to do&mdash;and I trust that he will not object if we suggest a simple thing&mdash;would be, in a place like the city of Cork where there are so many workers and so many in receipt of what used be national health, to set up a depot where the claims would be dealt with and cheques issued.  That suggestion has been made here year after year and has been repulsed year after year, much to the detriment of the people I represent.  I expect that the same situation exists in Waterford and Limerick.  I should like the Minister to give this House and the people of Cork city, Limerick city and of Waterford city a cogent reason why that cannot be done.  It is all very well for people sitting here to say: &ldquo;Well, these people will be out of benefit for only four or five days.&rdquo;  Often they are out of benefit for more than a week.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister's advisers to realise what that means to somebody who has nothing, who has no credit&mdash;which most of us will not have shortly, judging by the way things are going.  These depressed classes, the least of our brethren, about whom I am speaking, are waiting for something with which to buy bread and butter, tea and sugar, for their families while somebody in Cork city is writing to somebody in Dublin to say: &ldquo;Would you ever send down a cheque for this person in Cork?&rdquo; The person <Col N="634" /> has to wait for that letter to go up to Dublin and then wait for the cheque to be delivered in Cork, and then wait for somebody to get up on his bicycle to go out to a working suburb in Cork and deliver the letter.</P>
    <P>I trust I will not have to say this again next year.  I am not discouraged by the fact that I have been saying it year after year.  I might as well be a dumb mouth speaking to deaf ears. However, the time has come for something to be done about these things.  It seems that we can modernise every section of our administration and government, except this most important section.  I would appeal to the Minister to give serious thought to this problem.  I would appeal to him not to look upon it in a self-satisfied sort of way and to say: &ldquo;These are small things.&rdquo;  They are small things for the Minister and they are small things for me, but they are large things for the man who has a wife and six or seven children waiting for the cheque to come from Dublin.  I know, and many Deputies who come from centres of population know, of the untold suffering imposed on people as a result of this cumbrous procedure.  I would ask the Minister, if he does not intend to change this cumbrous procedure, to tell the House why not and to tell the House why it is better that all these things must go to Dublin and then back to Cork, and go to Dublin and then back to Limerick, and go to Dublin and then back to Waterford, while hungry people are waiting for the cheques.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points with which I intended to deal, but there is one further point.  Deputy Crotty spoke about proposed legislation in regard to workmen's compensation. I should like those who think it better to cancel the workmen's compensation code and introduce a Bill whereby this Department, which thinks so little of these people in Cork, Limerick and Waterford, will deal in private, mark you, with the problems of these people who, at the moment, can go into public court and be professionally represented, and who think that that is good legislation, to consider the shortcomings of the legislation <Col N="635" /> we have at the moment in relation to dealing with these problems.  I should like them to consider whether it is better that the workman who suffers a disability should have recourse to the courts or have to deal in private with judges appointed by the Minister under various guises such as appeals officers.  It is one of the most serious aspects of social welfare which is being overlooked in this House by various people who should be interested in our working classes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can vividly recall the Minister, during the recent election campaign, saying that on the re-election of Fianna Fáil, all social welfare benefits would be increased.  I am glad to say that he has fulfilled his promise and has increased social welfare benefits to a certain extent.  I hope that if our economic expansion continues, he will be able to do so again next year. Despite the fact that these benefits have been increased, I have a grievance about the old age pensioners. The Minister could have given more to old age pensioners living alone, those who have nobody to look after them and who have to provide all their daily needs, the daily needs we all have, meals, clothing and so forth, out of the pension they get from the State. It would have been more acceptable to everybody if the Minister had granted more to these unfortunate people.  Most of them are very feeble and the extra few shillings would not have mattered to the State but would have been very acceptable to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the present increases are very welcome to social welfare recipients.  I should like the Minister to bear in mind that there is one section of those people which is very badly treated.  No provision is made for people who are disabled or who are invalids, who have to fend for themselves.  There is a scheme similar to home assistance called the disabled persons' maintenance allowance scheme, which is administered by the local authorities. It seems impossible to get this. I think the Minister should, in time to come, make some provision for these people.  The only fall-back <Col N="636" /> they have is the fact that some of the relations may claim them, accept them and take them into their homes to live.  If they do not do so, it is a poor look-out for those people if they have to fend for themselves on the small assistance they get and on which.  I feel, they are incapable of living.  Until the Minister does something about this, we cannot fully be satisfied with our social welfare benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, as Deputy D. Costello and others on the Opposition benches have alleged, in any way complacent about our social welfare services. Unlike them, I think I have been giving continuous proof of that.  In each year since I became Minister for Social Welfare, there have been substantial improvements, both in the rate of payment of all the social welfare schemes and in the actual coverage of the schemes themselves.  But, while I am not complacent and while I, like other Deputies, can see many further improvements that can be made, I do say, with some degree of pride, that this Bill which has had, I think, a somewhat surprisingly hostile reception from the Opposition, marks a significant step forward in social welfare in this country.  While there has not been any actual opposition to the Bill, as far as I could gather, there seems to be something in it that has upset Deputies in the Opposition benches, judging from the general trend of the speeches.  I can hardly be blamed for thinking that it has been caused by the fact that this one single Bill does so much at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening statement that the increase in gross expenditure, in a full financial year, in the income maintenance services administered by my Department, as provided for in this Bill, is £9.53 million. I mentioned that this represents an increase of 19.3 per cent in the gross expenditure on social welfare, exclusive of administrative costs.  Not one of the Deputies opposite thought it worth while to refer to that.  I think this increase of almost 20 per cent, taken in conjunction with the fact that there have been substantial increases in the rates of payment and in the <Col N="637" /> gross expenditure in every year for a number of years past, is not something to be brushed aside as a mere bagatelle, as something of no importance, while there were irresponsible suggestions that there should be what are described as further small improvements, but which would obviously add considerably to the total cost.  I think we can congratulate ourselves, without being too complacent, on having made an advance in a single year of almost 20 per cent in the gross expenditure on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Unlike the vague generalities of the other Parties and the mere listing of desirable things to be done without any reference to the practicability of the community financing them, our undertaking with regard to social welfare was clear and explicit.  It was accepted by the people because it was so obviously a logical development of the policy we have been pursuing over the years and a logical development of our proven interest in the improvement of social welfare.</P>
    <P>We stated that it was our intention to devote an increased proportion of the rising national resources to social welfare.  This Bill is, as the people rightly expected, an immediate implementation of that undertaking.  I mentioned that the Bill provides for an increase of 19.3 per cent in the gross expenditure on social welfare in this year.  Over the past ten years, the gross expenditure on social welfare varied from five to 5.5 per cent of the gross national product and at the new annual rate of spending provided for in this Bill, assuming that the gross national product expands to £1,016 million as has been forecast, the gross expenditure on social welfare will be at the rate of 6.1 per cent of the gross national product.  That is a significant advance, no matter what Deputies opposite may say.  It shows that we are implementing our explicit undertaking, both in the letter and in the spirit.</P>
    <P>This devoting of an increasing proportion of the rising national resources to social welfare continues to be our guiding principle.  If the economy continues to expand as it is expected to expand in accordance with the targets of the <i>Second Programme for <Col N="638" /> Economic Expansion,</i> then we can expect further improvement in subsequent years.  While I am not complacent about the state of our social welfare services at present, it is by this method, by relating our expenditure to the capacity of the community to provide the necessary money, that we shall eventually arrive at an acceptable social welfare code.  How much of the money that will become available in the future will be spent on increases in the rates of payment under the existing scheme and how much will be devoted to the expansion of the social welfare code is something that will have to be decided from year to year in the light of circumstances obtaining.</P>
    <P>I find no more difficulty than anybody else in this House in listing a number of expansions which it would be desirable to make in our social welfare code or new fringe benefits that could be introduced.  There is no difficulty at all in these things.  I could do, as Deputy D. Costello said he did, namely, just study what is provided in other countries and pick out the best: there is no difficulty in that.</P>

      <P>We are faced with the problem of providing the money.  That is a very inconvenient detail for Deputy D. Costello, I quite appreciate, but it is essential and it is something that must be attended to.  In this Bill, we are providing an increased rate of expenditure of £9.53 million.  That means nothing whatever, I am quite well aware, to Deputy D. Costello, but it means a lot to the community. If we were to provide all these new things which we all know about, it would cost more and the money has to come from somewhere.  It is because we have attended to this essential feature, because we have realised that there is a limit to the amount of money you can extract from the community if you want the economy to continue to expand, that we have been able in every year to provide substantial <Col N="639" /> increases for social welfare.</P>
      <P>While they were in office, the Coalition Government were able to provide improvements in some of the schemes in one year only in each of their two terms of office.  That was because the Opposition do not pay any attention to this inconvenient detail of the expenditure that is involved.  It is amusing, to a certain extent, to hear Deputy D. Costello claim that the Government are bankrupt of ideas in regard to social welfare and to hear Deputy James Tully, on the other hand, claim that the whole idea of developing social welfare originated with his Party, spread to Fine Gael and eventually and belatedly affected Fianna Fáil.

Now that Deputy Costello is tied down to hard facts and cannot indulge in the vague generalities which he indulged in, he is becoming upset about it.  The contingencies which are listed in this International Labour Convention on minimum standards of social security are sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury, family, maternity, <Col N="640" /> invalidity and survivors.  We have an income maintenance coverage for every one of those contingencies on the insurance side and, where appropriate, on the assistance side.</P>
      <P>It is a fact also every single development in this virtually comprehensive social welfare system was brought about by a Fianna Fáil Government. Still the Opposition, although there was no development in social welfare under the alternative Government, maintain that Fianna Fáil have been completely bereft of ideas in so far as social welfare is concerned.  Not alone was there no development in social welfare under the Opposition Government but they failed even to keep the existing schemes that were provided by Fianna Fáil Governments in line with increases in the cost of living that took place during their term of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as we have put all these ideas of ours into practice in the past, just as we have provided all the social welfare services which we have at present, we will continue to expand it in the future according as the success of our economic policy makes it possible for us to do so.  I gathered from the Opposition speeches that few, if any, of the Deputies opposite believe that we have reached the stage at which we can be content with the actual rates of payment under the existing schemes or, in other words, that we have not reached the stage where we can devote all the money that will become available in the future for the expansion of our social welfare system rather than for the improvement of rates, so that for some time to come, it seems likely to me that the pattern of social welfare improvement will be as it is in this Bill.  There will have to be a selection of the desirable things to do to fit the amount of money that is available. The Bills then will be a combination of increases in the rates of payment under the different existing schemes combined with a gradual and probably a piecemeal expansion of the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, while, as I say, it is quite easy to draft out a list of the improvements it is possible to make, that would largely be an academic exercise, until such time as we know that the money necessary to implement such a programme will be available.  However, Deputies need have no fear.  The desirable lines of further improvement are being studied but as I say, in the meantime, the process of improving the existing schemes will gradually expand.  This has been continued under this Government over <Col N="642" /> the years and will continue in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I find it rather surprising that I should be called upon to defend the principle of paying social assistance on the basis of need.  It seems to me to be perfectly obvious, when the amount of money available is limited, and when it can be extracted only by taxation from the people, that it is a fundamental principle that social assistance should be distributed according to the need of the applicant. This can be established only by a means test.  The £10 million of increased transfer of income, which is being provided for between this Social Welfare Bill and the increases that have been provided in the disabled persons' maintenance allowances and the infectious diseases allowances is as much as the Government considered it possible to provide extra this year.  As Deputies know, this involved extra taxation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, since the amount available to me was limited, when I am asked to abandon the proposal to give a 10/- increase to a new means category of pensioner under £26 5s. Od. a year and 5/- increase to others, what I am being asked in effect to do is to give instead a flat rate increase of 7/6 to all non-contributory pensioners because these increases are as much as could be given out of the money available.  A flat rate of 10/- to all old age pensioners would cost an additional sum of £650,000, which, of course, is completely unimportant to Deputy Tully and Deputy Costello, but which was something which was taken into consideration by the Government.  That money was not available to me in this year.  Even if it were it would be fairer to use it to give something extra still to those people who have nothing at all.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to consider exactly what their opposition to the extra provision for those with low incomes means.  It means taking 2/6 extra from those people whose means are under £26 5s. Od. a year in order to give it to people who are better off. That is what the Opposition Deputies are asking me to do.  A single person, after this Bill goes through, over 70, <Col N="643" /> with means of £156 15s. Od. per annum or a married man with a means of £313 10s. Od. will qualify for the minimum rate of non-contributory pension of 7/6.  That means that between the person's own means and the pension, there will be a total of £176 5s. Od. for the single man and £333 for the married man without dependants.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 46 and No. 47 will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>Before section 28, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of estate duty the agricultural value of agricultural <Col N="644" /> property shall henceforth be charged with duty at 55 per cent of the normal rate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of amendments Nos. 46 and 47 is to introduce into the estate duty rate the provisions that already exist in relation to the estate duty code in England and also, so far as agricultural land is concerned, I believe in the North of Ireland.  In England, there is a provision that in respect of agricultural property, estate duty shall be charged at 55 per cent of normal duty and a similar provision was subsequently introduced in respect of industrial property.  I shall deal with England because I do not know what the position is in the North of Ireland. The effect of this provision in England as compared with the Republic is as follows: Taking estates between £10,000 and £12,500, the rate in the Republic is six per cent and the agricultural rate in England is 3.3 per cent; between £12,500 and £15,000, the rate here is eight per cent, while the British rate is 4.4 per cent; between £15,000 and £17,500, the rate in the Republic is ten per cent, while the British rate is 5.5 per cent; between £17,500 and £20,000, the rate here is 12 per cent, while the British rate is 6.6 per cent; and between £20,000 and £25,000, the rate in the Republic is 14 per cent, while the rate in England is 8.2 per cent.  Going one step further, between £25,000 and £30,000, the rate in the Republic is 16 per cent, while the rate in England is 9.9 per cent.  There are corresponding differences as between increases up the scale and it is only when one reaches the very high valued estates that a comparative equality is achieved.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to introduce here the same kind of built-in provision in relation to agricultural property and purely family business and business inheritance of that kind. There have been cogitations as to whether death duties should or should not be retained.  We do not in this amendment propose to abolish all death duties but we do suggest that this provision, which is recognised in Great Britain, and I believe also in Northern Ireland, should be applied <Col N="645" /> here.  It is timely that we should face up to this situation.  If the disparity which now exists between our scale and rate of estate duty continues, there is a great danger, I think a very real danger, that capital, which this country requires, may disappear and that people who compare comparative rates of estate duty may seek residence in the North of Ireland or in England and that the country may lose.</P>
    <P>I think consideration should be given to a proposal of this kind.  I might remind the House that immediately before the Second Reading debate, the Minister in his speech which I referred to earlier, sought praise for the fact that our rate of estate duty was lower than in England.  Of course he was comparing what is our scale with what would be the ordinary unabated scale in England.  He either was not advised or did not advert to the fact that in relation to agriculture and business in England, there is abatement to the extent of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is need at the moment to encourage people who have money to invest to come here.  I hold no brief for the fact that they have money or riches, but I do think this country requires to attract a great number of people with a great deal of money.  While there may be a reluctance in some parts of the House to abolish death duties entirely, we certainly should seek to reduce the load of death duties on agricultural land and on businesses that are run here. That is the object of these two amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support these amendments by dealing with specific cases.  Let us take, first of all, the case of a man with a farm valued at £8,000, who has on that farm £2,000 worth of stock.  In addition, he has £1,000 worth of furniture, and perhaps a few pounds ready money in the bank for working capital. That is a total of £11,000.  No one could suggest for one instance that he is a rich man.  In my constituency and Deputy Norton's constituency, he would be a pretty small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here is that the estate of such a man will pay, subject to <Col N="646" /> section 26 to which I will come back in a moment, £660 in estate duty.  In Northern Ireland or Great Britain, exactly the same estate would pay £282, so this small estate is being asked to pay £378 more.  There is a saving contained in section 26 that clearly the farm cannot be divided up. It cannot be left to three or four children.  It must be left to the widow or to one child.  I will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and suppose it is left to the widow alone, because that is where the greatest saving would be, and there would be a lesser variation between our duty and the duty in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Even after allowing for section 26, that man's estate is asked to pay here £228 more than it would be asked to pay in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us take a slightly larger estate. Let us take the case of a man with a farm valued at £10,000, who has on that farm £3,000 worth of livestock, £3,000 worth of machinery, furniture, working capital and odds and ends of any sort you like.  The total value of the estate is £16,000.  That is not a big estate.  Certainly a farm valued at £10,000 would not be regarded as a big farm in Kildare.  Where are we then?  In this country that estate will bear duty of £1,600, less section 26. Again, giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt of the maximum, less £150, that is to say £1,450, in Britain, an estate with exactly the same value for land, livestock and bits and pieces, would have to pay only £1,150, that is, £300 less.  In Northern Ireland, the same estate would have to pay only £920, or £530 less than down here.</P>
    <P>All that arises because agricultural land is taken on a different basis of rate in Northern Ireland and Great Britain from here.  It is so taken for one reason, and one reason only: to provide assistance for the unit of the family farm.  It is to provide assistance for the family farm unit that that agricultural relief is given.  It is now accepted and understood, as Deputy Corish mentioned earlier this afternoon, that land and farmhouses are not readily cashable.  If we put a high duty on them, all we do is provide that they must be sold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> I think Deputies on every side of the House accept that one of the problems of agriculture in Ireland is that it is starved of working capital.  Only the other day the Minister brought into the Oireachtas a Bill extending the provisions of the Agricultural Credit Acts. He made the case for that Bill that more working capital was needed for agriculture, that more money had to be ploughed into the working of agriculture. What is the sense in coming here one week and saying that, and coming in this week and saying that every time anyone connected with agriculture dies, something around 20 per cent more will be taken out of the estate as compared with Great Britain, and something around 30 per cent more will be taken as compared with Northern Ireland?  Is it not a crazy performance to come in here one week looking for more money to plough into agriculture, and to come in the next week and say that the State will take that money out of agriculture any time anyone dies?</P>
    <P>The reason for that is, as I have said, that in Great Britain&mdash;and it was followed up some years after in Northern Ireland&mdash;it was recognised and understood that something had to be done, having regard to the ways in which the values had gone up, to take account of the fact, and that otherwise every time the owner of a farm of the moderate size I have been talking about died, either one of two things would happen: the farm would have to be sold, or the successor to the farmer would be starved of working capital to carry on agriculture on that farm as we on all sides of the House would like to see it carried on.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask fairly enough why was this not adverted to before. In earlier years, before the value of land appreciated to the extent to which it has appreciated today, when the person died, the land went into a much lower category of rate, and it did not matter so much.  It might be within the exempt category, or it might be in the category for which an artificial value could be taken because it was <Col N="648" /> valued at less than £10,000.  There is a provision for taking an artificial value when the whole estate does not exceed £10,000.  I think I am right in saying that it is not merely the value of the land, but the value of the whole estate, that has to be less before the artificial value of the land can be calculated in a particular way by reference to the poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister contradicts my figures&mdash;I do not think he will because they are right&mdash;in the case of a farm worth £8,000 going to a widow, and with the appendages of stock and bits and pieces, including furniture, the duty here is £660.  Deducting the widow's allowance, it is £510.  The duty in Northern Ireland is £282.  In Britain the duty is £282.  How does the Minister justify the £228 differential? In the other case, where the value of the farm is £10,000 and the value of stock and bits and pieces £6,000, the duty is £1,450.  In Britain it is £1,150 and in Northern Ireland £920.</P>
    <P>Neither of those cases is one in which I am arguing for a rich man. In these modern days both are of very modest means indeed.  In the case of the widow or of the child, under this section the differential will be greater, the saving less.  It is clear that there will not be the ready money to meet this differential in duty to run the farm properly.  The Minister may come back and say: &ldquo;If I do not have this differential in relation to agricultural land, we shall find people coming in here buying up land for the purpose of saving duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister abandoned that argument when he dropped the 25 per cent stamp duty on foreigners buying land. I forget the section under which it was dropped.  The Minister was rather cross with us the other day when we asked why he was dropping it.  His defence is that it is not necessary now that the 1965 Land Act is law.  He said that the Land Commission would take care of the situation and ensure that nobody would buy more land than in the past.  May I add that it is quite certain nobody can buy more land purely for the purpose of avoiding death duties?  There is not any case <Col N="649" /> to be made by the Minister for hitting the man of moderate means.  We had that argument already.  In this section the Minister is doing it and I suggest he should, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>From the arguments put forward one would imagine that the agricultural community are being hit very heavily by estate duties.  Of course, that is not the case, as Deputy Sweetman well knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated yield from agricultural property as such is about £300,000, a very low percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But a very high percentage relative to the case in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go back. Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred to the address I gave on death duties to what was described by the <i>Irish Times</i> as &ldquo;a captive audience&rdquo;.  He sought to indicate that I claimed our death duties were more favourable than those in Britain in practically all cases.  I told the House last week that I was not dealing with the proposition often argued that death duties should be abolished so that we would attract people with large estates to invest money here.  What I was dealing with were the death duties payable on very large estates.</P>
      <P>We stop at £100,000 when the rate is 40 per cent, whereas the British go up to 80 per cent on a much higher figure.  I said that if there was any validity to the argument that more favourable conditions in this respect attract more investment, then it ought to work.  This provision has been in operation only four years, since 1960, and I do not think, as I said on the other occasion, that that is long enough in which to test the validity of the suggestion that without death duties we would attract very large estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Again, I come back to the position of farmers here.  In the first place, farmers pay a very small proportion of the total amount of money collected in estate duties.  As well as that, they pay no income tax as such: they pay a small proportion of income tax from assessment on poor law valuation under Schedule A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They pay rates here but they do not in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we provide about 62 per cent of the full rate of assessment on farm land.  I am not sure of the exact figure, but that is the one I remember from the Budget debate, when I gave those facts.  That is a substantial contribution to farmers' local taxation.  They pay no income tax.  There is a system of assessment of farm lands&mdash;what is described as artificial value.  It is a multiplication of the PLV by 25.  If it does not exceed £1,000, there is no estate duty payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The estate must not exceed £10,000.  Is there not duplication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The total estate must not exceed £1,000 net.  This artificial value does not apply in the North.  It is of some benefit to the farming community here.  Now, in this amendment, we are trying to get them further benefits.  I am not suggesting that they do not deserve it, but in the context of our finances we cannot afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Each estate under £1,000 is free.  Therefore, the artificial value does not enter into it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment in Northern Ireland is on the true value, not the artificial value.  I have been trying to indicate that farmers are not doing badly.  I wish they could do better but we must have regard to the obligations of the rest of the people to pay taxes.  There have been arguments about death duties on superannuation benefits and on insurance policies and a special case was made about the value of shares attributable to business premises or machinery.  Now we have the farmers being made the subject of <Col N="651" /> a special case.  We shall have so many special cases that the argument for the abolishing of death duties will have disappeared altogether.</P>
      <P>To come to a recent appraisal&mdash;I was taking for the purpose of this amendment about 200 cases of estate duty.  Of these, 67 were described as farmers.  Of the 67 cases, duty was charged in 19 cases.  Some of these 19 cases were assessed before the limit was raised to £5,000, but if that provision had been in operation, of these 19 cases, 11 would have been exempt from duty altogether.  That was after 27th April.  Of the eight remaining cases in which the existing exemption limit was exceeded, one case, apparently, was an unusual one and may be disregarded.  It was a case of two farms being liable to duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me the entire 200 cases may be disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the remaining seven cases, all the farms were in single ownership.  In six of these cases, there were ample funds besides the farm to pay whatever duty was assessed.  In the remaining case, the farm was sold by direction of the deceased in his will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the Minister get these cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They were a random selection by the Revenue Commissioners. Of the 200, 67 were farmers. Of these 67, 19 were assessable to duty and of the 19, 11 would not now be assessable by reason of the raising of the limit to £5,000, and of the remainder, six of the farms had ample liquid assets to pay whatever duty was required and in the remaining case, the farm was sold, but only by direction of the will of the deceased, so that gives an indication as to how hard hit the farming community is by reason of these death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we are treating farmers reasonably well.  It is not fair just to take the rates of duty applicable and say the farmers in the North are <Col N="652" /> so much better off than the farmers here.  The farmers up there have to pay income tax in the ordinary way. The farmers here do not have to pay income tax.  By and large, I suggest that you just cannot take this one instance out and say because in a certain instance the farmers in the Six Countries or in Great Britain do better, they are doing better all round.  They are not doing better all round as far as taxation is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister up any day he likes on his figures.  First of all, he came in here the other day and made a great song and dance of the Agricultural Credit Acts and the additional credit needed for agriculture.  I have not got the quotation here but I would wager a small bet that he was boasting of increased capital employed in agriculture in the past ten years of the order of £3 million.  The figure might be a little wrong either way.  He told us a few minutes ago that £300,000 a year is taken up in estate duty.  Ten times £300,000 is £3 million.  So he gives out money in agricultural credit for the purpose of taking it back from agricultural land in estate duty.  Farmers in Kildare, who are wideawake farmers, will be delighted to hear the Minister's explanation in respect of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea that because farmers do not pay income tax they are a wealthy community is tripe.  I admit that circumstances have changed a little in the past few years and I am not, therefore, necessarily able to analyse the same two sets of figures today as I was a few years ago but it so happened that I was an executor of a will in this country where farm accounts were prepared and I was also an executor of my uncle who was domiciled in England and who had a dairy farm in Berkshire.  There was a provision in respect of his land by virtue of which it had to be held in trust until his youngest child became 21 and I saw these English farm accounts year in and year out for a matter of four or five years until the youngest child did become 21.  As I say, it is not <Col N="653" /> yesterday&mdash;it is a few years back&mdash; but the comparison is just as good.</P>
    <P>One year with another, the amount that had to be paid in rates on the farm here was equivalent to the amount that had to be paid in income tax on the profits of the farm in England and the net amount, if you like to call it that, remaining after payment of outgoings was virtually the same in one country as in the other. One year there would be a little one way, the next year there would be a little the other way, but it was virtually the same.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in these figures from the point of view of this argument that has been put up by Ministers for Finance over the years that the farmers were getting an immense benefit because they were charged here to income tax only under Schedule B and Schedule B is determined on the fixed valuation.  I am not arguing about what the amount of rates remission is.  I am just telling the Minister factually that that happened and&mdash;I have not got a case for 1964-65&mdash;but in the years in which it did happen, the fact was that there was virtually no difference.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister got his 200 cases.  I am not suggesting that the Minister went along to a pigeon-hole and took them out but <Col N="654" /> I will challenge the Minister to get from the Agricultural Credit Corporation the amount that they have given out in agricultural credit for working land in Kildare every year for the past ten years and let him examine the number of cases in Kildare where there have been deaths in the past ten years and, on his own figures, he will find that £300,000 for ten years equals £3 million.</P>
    <P>There is no case for this.  It is the same as we were at before.  The purpose of this is not to provide money from the rich for the poor.  The purpose of this enactment that we are endeavouring to amend is to take money from the middle-class type of farmer.  The middle-class type of farmer is the type that anyone who knows rural Ireland admits is short of agricultural credit.  The effect of this will be that any time there is a death in a family, the farmer will be shorter of credit and having taken money out of that farm for the Minister for Finance, he will either have to sell or he will have to go back to the Minister for Finance and, in another form, through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, take the money out to make it up. That is bad national business.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 22, lines 42 and 48, to delete &ldquo;ninety&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;eighty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section is a section which has been introduced into the Finance Bill following a recommendation from the NIEC and it is designed to provide a reduction in the rate of stamp duty in respect of amalgamation of companies.  It appears to be in accordance with the provisions of a British section contained in the British Finance Act 1927, section 55, but so far as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  If I am correct in viewing it in that light, it appears that the section does repeat a number of the defects which in experience have been shown to be associated with the British section.  I have in these amendments endeavoured to refer to one or two defects.  First of all, I direct attention by amendment No. 48 to the fact that the section before us, in its repeating of the English section, appears to have used the 90 per cent figure for issued share capital in correspondence with the English Companies Act of 1948, whereas, in fact, the provision in our Companies Act of 1963 by section 209 should be 80 per cent.  The first amendment is to provide 80 per cent in place of the word &ldquo;ninety&rdquo; in section 28 (1) (b) in reference to the issued share capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> The second amendment refers to what I am told has been by experience a known defect in the working of the English section, because here it is proposed that the percentage should be a percentage of the issued share capital in relation to amalgamations and so on, whereas what is frequently concerned with the proposal is a provision in relation to shares of a particular class.  Frequently, an amalgamation is not concerned with the position of preference shareholders but would be concerned with the ordinary shareholders. In the operation of the English section, it becomes mandatory to arrange for the takeover or amalgamation of the required percentage of the entire issued capital, and that frequently has meant that this section has not become possible to operate.</P>
    <P>There are other defects in the section which I have not attempted by amendment to cure.  I do not know whether we should raise them now but we certainly can raise them on the section.  There is, for instance, no provision in the English section for a bid for cash and no provision to deal with the acquisition of an undertaking for cash.  It deals only with share exchange, and again that is repeated in this section.  It may mean that a lot of worthwhile amalgamations and reconstructions of a company which are desirable may be limited and made more difficult.  However, in discussing these two amendments, I am merely directing the attention of the House to two particular defects.  On the section itself, I shall point out other things which I think should be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, there is no defect whatever in the use of the percentage we propose in the section, that is, 90 per cent, as against the 80 per cent which is provided in the Companies Act for an entirely different purpose.  In the Companies Act, section 204, there is provision for the acquisition of the minority shares in a company under these circumstances. Company A takes over company B and buys 80 per cent of the shares in company B for cash.  This is a takeover, purchase or whatever you <Col N="658" /> like to call it.  Having effected that takeover by this purchase for value for cash of 80 per cent of company B, then they may compulsorily acquire the remaining 20 per cent.  The remaining 20 per cent may be people who dissented from the takeover, people the beneficial ownership of whose shares were not readily traceable. That was effected by the 1959 interim Companies Act following a recommendation of the Committee on Company Law and was re-enacted in the 1963 Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 204 of the Companies Act, 1963.  It was for that specific purpose, because a company having taken over another would not want a 20 per cent dissident group. There are other forms of amalgamations or reconstructions which this section is intended to facilitate, say, where company A and company B are in substantially the same ownership. Take Leinster House Limited.  Leinster House Limited has not been going too well.  We decide to set up Leinster House (1965) Limited.  Ninety per cent of the owners of Leinster House Limited are in the new company as to the same percentage, 90 per cent.  This is a transfer of shares, not a takeover for cash and it is for the purpose of facilitating such an amalgamation, such a reconstruction, that the relief from stamp duty is introduced in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I should like to say that the 80 per cent has no reference whatever to the 90 per cent.  The fact that Britain has 90 per cent in its Companies Act for the purpose of a takeover for cash was completely coincidental to the 90 per cent in the Finance Bill for the purposes of relief from stamp duty where there is not a takeover for cash but a reconstruction or amalgamation of the company.  I am sure that, having heard that, if the sub-leader writer of the <i>Irish Times</i> of 25th June, 1965, were in a position to re-write the sub-leader tomorrow, he would admit that the gnomes of <Col N="659" /> Merrion Street had not blundered here. Far from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it represented what I regard as substantial ownership.  There is no obligation on me to take the 80 per cent in the Companies Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I do not accept that. This is for the purpose of the relief of stamp duty in relation to facilitating amalgamations, and specifically for the purpose of facilitating amalgamations in present circumstances when we are encouraging the rationalisation of firms in this way.  Recommendations were made by a number of people, by a Dublin firm of solicitors who are used to dealing with such propositions. Representations were made to me directly by the Chairman of the Industrial Development Authority and there were other similar representations made.  In another connection Deputy O'Higgins, apart altogether from the defects he alleged there were in the drafting of our amendment, said it was wrong that we should have completely &ldquo;cogged&rdquo; the British amendment.  I am advised that the amendment introduced into British law in 1927&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my reply to the debate on the Second Reading, I indicated that section 28 as it now <Col N="660" /> stands appeared to me to be rather long and that, if possible, I would have it shortened.  However, the entire code of our law on stamp duties is rather complicated and to a certain extent I believe it must be so.  It all derives form the intricate statute, the Stamp Act of 1891, which we adapted here in 1923.  If this section had been enacted earlier than 1923, we would also have adapted it.  The section I propose represents exactly what I was asked to do in circumstances that were set out, the facilitation of the amalgamation of companies and the reconstruction of companies in order to help them to become more competitive.  It was also recommended that we frame the provisions on the lines of the British legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, the purpose of the section, as I said, is to give relief from stamp duty in the case of the amalgamation of companies substantially in the same ownership.  If the relief were extended to shares of a particular class, they could be a class which were not ordinary shares and, therefore, would not conform to the requirement of substantial ownership. Again, I say there is no defect in the drafting as such.  In fact, the amendment which Deputy O'Higgins seeks to have included was deliberately omitted.</P>

      <P>Does the section mean that a company has to be formed for the express purpose of taking over the company to be amalgamated, that the company must go through the performance of having a special resolution passed on what its intention is under this section, that that cumbersome procedure must be adopted in order to get the exemption here?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned Leinster House (1965) Limited.  There are many cases of companies that are shareholders of other companies.  It may be desirable that there should be an amalgamation or reconstruction so that business can proceed properly. Under this section the fact that a company is a shareholder of the company excludes it from the benefit of this section.  You have to have a new company formed for the specific purpose of the amalgamation envisaged before the exemption here is sought. I assert again that this is a lazy way of drafting.  This is taking a section in the British Act of 1927 and putting it holus-bolus into this Finance Bill.  It is certainly a coincidence that 90 per cent happens to be the takeover percentage in England and 80 per cent is ours.  It is an extraordinary coincidence that 90 per cent was decided as the desirable percentage of issued share capital for the operation of this particular section when, in relation to the Companies Act, we have provided that 80 per cent is a sufficient demonstration of effective control of a company. That is certainly a coincidence and I assert that this is a case in which someone has blundered and that someone is now defending the blunder.  I believe that is what is happening.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>Before section 29, but in Part IV, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No stamp duties shall be chargeable on the conveyance or transfer of lands, tenements and hereditaments where the amount of the consideration for the sale does not exceed £5,000 and the purchaser is an Irish citizen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to relieve the position of people involved in the purchase of a house, small farm, or something of that kind.  At the moment, under the stamp duty provisions, there is a tax imposed in respect of the conveyance or transfer of houses and lands which starts in this country at a purchase price of £700 and, at that level, there is a stamp duty payable of £7.  In Northern Ireland, no stamp duty is payable and that applies right up the scale to a purchase price of £4,500.  In Northern Ireland, no duty whatever is payable up to £4,500.  Here, in the Republic, a stamp duty of £135 has to be paid. Stamp duty ranging from £7 up to £135 is payable on the purchase price of property in the Republic.  In Northern Ireland, £4,500 is regarded as being so small that it should not be subject to duty.  Under this amendment, I propose that we take a figure of £5,000 and say that, in relation to a purchase price not exceeding that figure, we should not impose a tax. If we continue taxation on small properties of that kind, it will mean that a tax of £150, which is a very considerable duty to pay, will be imposed on a property of £5,000 in value.  The object of this amendment is to abolish that rate of taxation.</P>

It was perfectly clear, from the wording, that in this the Minister has not been retrospective. I only wish that the same enlightened approach had been adopted by him in other respects.  This covers only cases from the 12th May, 1965.  I do not quarrel with the section as such varying the law as from 12th May, 1965, but I certainly do quarrel with <Col N="666" /> the way in which the Minister has expressed it in the so-called explanatory memorandum which, as we go along, seems to make things even less explanatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>A moment ago we were discussing the effect of turnover tax on clubs and this subsection is designed to make farmers and fishermen pay turnover tax on the goods they sell by retail.  I think I should remind the House that under the Finance Act, 1963, which introduced the turnover tax which has led to much of the economic troubles which now face the country, there was an exemption specifically provided for farmers and fishermen who sold their own produce by retail.  That exemption has continued but now there is introduced in subsection (3) a provision which will apply turnover tax to every farmer and fisherman who sells his own goods or his own products by retail, with a saving that the tax only applies to this produce in excess of £150 worth each month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section and concealed in it, there is, in fact, an extension of the turnover tax to fishermen in the west of Ireland who sell their own produce, a body of men who at times endanger <Col N="668" /> their lives, to farmers who might feel elevated and might seek to derive benefit from Father McDyer's movement in the west of Ireland.  Farmers who join any worthwhile co-operative effort to sell vegetables retail will now be taxed under this section.  I would feel that this extension of the turnover tax to farmers and fishermen is a most unfair proposal.  The object of this amendment is to delete this subsection and to restrict the turnover tax within the confines of the Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>Involved in this amendment is opposition also to section 35 which is a consequential provision on this subsection. It is a consequential amendment of the Schedule to the Finance Act, 1962.</P>

      <P>Co-operatives, as such, were liable to turnover tax, so there is no point in appealing to Father McDyer and the people of Glencolumbkille in this context.  Farmers and fishermen who had their own produce and sold it retail to shops that they owned were also liable.  As I understand it, the intention was to give relief from turnover tax to farmers or fishermen who are effecting small periodic sales of their own produce.  I remember when Dr. Ryan introduced that particular provision in the 1963 Act.  My recollection is that he said it was for the purpose of giving farmers relief from the payment of turnover tax for periodic sales of certain surpluses off their land&mdash;maybe cabbage, potatoes, and so on&mdash;or fishermen who sell fish locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few fishermen would sell fish at the pier when they landed.  There is hardly a hotelier in the south or west of Ireland, no matter what kind of reputation the fishing village may have for the quality or quantity of its fish, <Col N="669" /> that can get fish in that way from the fishermen.  They usually sell through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, whether or not under contract I do not know. However, I know that it is practically impossible to get fish from fishermen in that way.  But, if the occasion did arise where fishermen wanted to sell small quantities&mdash;for example, they might have five boxes of fish and only about one quarter of another box&mdash; they might sell a few fish where that amount would make up, say, one quarter of a box.  However, if they had five boxes, you may be sure it would be sold in the ordinary way. This is to facilitate casual sales of these small quantities.</P>
    <P>Similarly with farmers who might have a surplus of potatoes over and above what they would normally sell to the market and who would like to sell them locally: they would be given equal relief from payment of turnover tax.  There was one case, however, in which certain difficulties arose.  I said that farmers or fishermen who sold their produce through retail shops which they owned were and always had been liable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The shop is liable, then.  Take a farmer with a substantial milk round.  He does not sell through a shop but with his pony and cart around the town or his motor-driven van.  In many cases, such farmers have established very substantial milk rounds.  There have been complaints from genuine roundsmen that the farmer has the advantage over them in (1) that he does not have to pay turnover tax and (2) that he can sell the milk, even if he had to pay turnover tax, at a cheaper rate than they can because they, the roundsmen, have to buy from others farmers.

      <P>The Minister is missing out the fact that if this is made law, it means that every farmer or every fisherman who sells is subject to inspection and the consequent annoyance which follows inspection.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The turnover tax, yes, and they have been going from town to town.  If that starts with the farmers, we know what will happen.  I live in a seaside area where, because of early cropping, the farmers are able to sell crops which they grow quicker than they are generally sold in other parts of the country and they sell quite a lot of those crops off the farm. Some people come along and collect quite a stock in vans and drive off into the towns.  They may be gathered by the shops themselves.  However, most of the produce is in fact sold in small quantities to individuals, people who come to the seaside for a holiday, day trippers, and so on.  It would not be an extraordinary sale which would produce £50 in a week for the goods and that would cover the cost of loading <Col N="671" /> as well as everything else.</P>
      <P>I also live near a fishing village where it is quite common to sell salmon.  At the early time of the year, as the Minister probably knows, salmon is sold at a very high price. It would not be an extraordinary thing to find a few salmon sold for, say, £50. We have it on record where the first salmon this year was sold for very much more than £50.  However, in the early part of the year, it is quite a common thing that a few salmon would possibly be sold and would be worth more than £50.  It may be said that it would be exceptional.  I saw a fisherman who caught 100 salmon in one haul: he did not get any more for the rest of the season.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sales by farmers and fishermen of their own produce otherwise than <Col N="672" /> in connection with the carrying on of the business of a shop or similar retail business.</P>
    <P>In other words, if a farmer runs a business, then he is liable because he is selling his produce in a shop.  This amendment, and the next one, if it is passed, proposes exempting the sales by farmers and fishermen of their own produce other than retail sales.  That means every retail sale by a farmer or fisherman, no matter what it is, is no longer an exempted activity.  There is then Deputy Tully's point which I consider is a very sound one.  Then the whole question arises: Can it be established that the retail sales in two successive months do not exceed £150? If they do not exceed £150 then the tax does not apply and so on.  There is a whole wealth of discrimination and so on, which, the Minister may take it, is trying to light a penny candle from a star.  You will not get accounts kept by farmers or fishermen.

Section 46 gives all the definitions and I cannot see any definition of &ldquo;retail.&rdquo; I gather from what the Minister has said if I sell a stone of potatoes today and a stone of potatoes tomorrow to somebody who comes along, I am selling by retail.  Nobody will eat a stone of potatoes himself at any one time.  I do not see any difference between selling a stone of potatoes from my own farm today and another stone tomorrow and selling a bullock from my own farm today, another <Col N="673" /> bullock from my own farm tomorrow and a third bullock the following week and doing that for the next month. Then the farmer is liable for tax because the three bullocks he sold would retail at more than £150.</P>

I am sure this was not drawn out of a hat, that there must have been some intelligent thought given to it.  There must be some figure.

    <P>When I say live animals are specifically mentioned there, they are exclusive of the type of goods referred to in the second category.  I do not know what Deputy Norton is talking about when he asked me to take Deputies into my confidence.  I thought I dealt with this in as intelligent a way as I could.

      <P>There was a rather cynical tone about the Deputy's remarks. I want to say that I said in as intelligent a way as I could at the start that the purpose of the amendment was mainly to meet what I thought were genuine complaints from milk roundsmen who were finding themselves in competition with farmers who sold their milk in the ordinary way they would sell casual commodities. They were able to do quite a substantial amount of business on sales of milk in towns, and to a lesser extent in the city, to the grave disadvantage of men who depended for their livelihood on selling milk.</P>

      <P>It does not happen in Cork.  The milk people bottle their milk.  Does the Minister suggest farmers are going around with vans selling their milk in the towns and making £150 per month?  Either the Minister, or somebody else who told him, must be drawing on his imagination.  I could not see it happening and I am sure it does not happen in any part of the country.  Surely, if it does, it would be much better to include a section dealing with milk?  Why put it in this way, knowing it will cause quite a lot of annoyance?  Whether the Minister likes it or not, this will certainly cause quite a lot of annoyance.  I referred to the former Deputy Leneghan earlier.  He made the Government feel his presence in an effort to have this particular section applied.  It was not intended to include it.  I am sure the Minister realises as well as I do what happened as a result of that.  That Deputy is no longer here to defend the line he took at that time.</P>

He said that in order to understand this, he would like to know how many people will be involved and how much money will be raised from this.  We have not been told.  The Minister says it is because some milkmen have complained to him, not because they want to get off the turnover tax&mdash;although I am sure they would not mind getting off it&mdash;but because they were saying: &ldquo;I have to pay and that fellow has not to pay; make him pay.&rdquo;  It would be the simplest thing to bring in a section relieving milkmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what &ldquo;retail&rdquo; means.  I think selling grain in that way means selling it off my farm.  There is no definition of retail.  Will the Minister define &ldquo;retail&rdquo; as meaning selling in a shop or, as I may point out to the Minister, as it is defined in the Schedule to the Act of 1963&mdash;the carrying on of a business or a shop or similar retail business.  If it were to be like that, then this amendment would make sense. Then it would not mean there would be hordes of inspectors going into every farmer's buildings to discover whether or not he was selling grain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave that to the boys opposite to decide.  They will cope with that situation.  The plain fact of the matter is there is no definition of retail.  Does it mean selling everything off my farm that is not exempted, such as live animals as the Minister told me, for example?  Hay is sold on the farm.  No farmer sells hay wholesale.  What does that mean? What will it be when it is sold to another farmer who wants it?  Barley is sold to one person, not to somebody else to sell, or to a shop.</P>

      <P>Who will dole out <Col N="678" /> the barrel of barley in 16 different parcels of a stone each?  It would be sold retail if it were done that way. Each sale the farmer makes for the purposes of the definition in this section is a retail sale and the Minister has to amend this, or perhaps, as he will not give us the amount, in this lies the cue, the answer to what the Minister wants to do&mdash;to force every farmer in the country to pay turnover tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long story.  If a builder goes in on land and develops it and sells houses off the land, assuming he buys the fee simple of the land and sells houses as he builds them by way of lease, under existing law, even though he is carrying on that as a normal trade, he is not liable to income tax.  He is liable only under Schedule A&mdash;tax related to the PLV of his land.  He does not dispose of his interest, only of a lessor's interest, and the courts have held he is not liable to income tax in the ordinary way of trade.  One attempt was made to prevent this.  It was in the 1935 Act which provided that if the builder went in with the intention of building, he would then be caught.  However, it was found impossible to prove intention and this part of the Bill is intended to get around all these difficulties and the other means of avoidance of tax.  That is very briefly what the provision means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pretty accurate, except for one thing.  Certain people declared they had no intention when in fact that was untrue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) a business of dealing in or developing land shall not be deemed to be carried on where the person so disposing of the same had been in occupation thereof for the whole of the three years prior to such disposal as his only or main residence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, the Minister's amendment and Deputy Sweetman's amendment are all to the same effect.  The object is to ensure that the provisions of these sections shall not apply where in fact there has been family residence in a house, where the person has lived in it and merely because when it is subsequently decided to sell that house there has been, whether it is fortuitous or otherwise, an increase in its market value, it does appear unreasonable that taxation provisions should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the whole object and purpose of these sections is to deal with the tax evader, the man who dodges the liability for income tax which ordinary folk have to face up to.  It is not intended, at least I assume it is not intended, to deal with the case where a person has as his residence a place which he bought for that purpose or which his family had for that purpose, which is frequently the case, and when by reason of a change in family plans or for some other reason it is decided to sell it and there is at that stage an increase in its market value which often may be <Col N="685" /> only in keeping with the change in the times.  I would feel that the section should not impose on that person a liability to tax.  That is the object of my amendment and I think it is the sense also of the Minister's amendment and of Deputy Sweetman's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; if the person has a house built for himself and goes in to occupy it as his exclusive and only dwelling, then it does not matter how long he stays in it, if he sells it again, he is not caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What does &ldquo;exclusive occupation&rdquo; mean?  Are you not allowed to have your wife and family in the house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If I used the word &ldquo;exclusive,&rdquo; I used it wrongly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is used in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly includes his wife and family; in fact, anybody who ordinarily lives with him.  He could have other dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one case I know of, for instance, where a person is living now in what was originally a family residence and which is, in relation to his own particular family, now, a very large mansion and he has portion of it let.  In due course, presumably, that person will sell that house.  First of all, I am concerned that these sections should not apply to him at all because this was not a purchase for the purpose of development or of tax dodging.  If the Minister agrees with me, some amendment should be provided to ensure that.  Also, I am concerned with the use in the reconstruction section of the words &ldquo;exclusive occupation&rdquo;. Does that mean that if there has been a letting or subletting of any portion of the house then these provisions will apply?  Has a person to be in occupation of the entire of the house for either this period suggested here or some other period, and so on?  Does the fact that portion of it may be let destroy whatever protection exclusive occupation is entitled to?</P>

      <P>I want to make this case to the Minister.  There is the case of a person who builds a small seaside bungalow, goes and uses it himself for the summer and maybe lets it for one month of the summer either to a friend or, perhaps, even to some of his family. If he goes to sell that, is he not going to be caught for capital gains tax on such a sale?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow Deputy Lenihan on this because it appears quite clear to me that the Minister is not the slightest bit interested in these small exceptional cases that have been quoted from the opposite benches.  I do not think he has any intention of taxing people in that capacity.  What I gather is that the Minister is trying to make sure that anybody who really is making a business of this, even in a small way, must bear tax just as he would if he extended his operation and made it really a full scale business.  I am with the Minister there entirely.  I think people who do go over the borderline should get caught but I do agree with my colleague, Deputy Lenihan, here, that it is this intrusion of Case VI of Schedule D, the all-embracing section, which is giving rise to all this trouble <Col N="688" /> and, like him, I would ask the Minister to look into the matter very carefully to see whether the reference to Case VI in subsection (4) (b) might be omitted altogether.  If that is done, we will still catch the people the Minister wants to catch but we will not impose an injust burden on these small people who are just making a few quid possibly here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an isolated instance which could be so well organised as to make a very big amount of profit but I take it the House would not suggest that because it is an isolated instance, and well organised by a group or by a company, of property being developed and then sold in a way that might appear to be a once and for all transaction, that it should escape.  I think the House would agree that that is not the kind of case that should escape but I had to make sure that I covered the case proposed by Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Booth and to bring in a measure of relief&mdash;I think it will apply more to section 41 than to this section &mdash;and to give that measure of relief to isolated transactions, whereby, even if a reasonably substantial profit is made, say about £1,000, that that would be specifically excluded.</P>
