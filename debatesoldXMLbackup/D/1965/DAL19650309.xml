      <P>This country is a party to the international conventions for the control of narcotics and, accordingly, has in force statutory provisions in regard to the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, possession and use of narcotic drugs. All the information available appears to indicate that addiction to narcotic drugs is not a problem in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted reports that, in some countries, the abuse of certain drugs of the tranquilliser and anti-depressant type, which are not covered by the international conventions referred to, has presented a problem.  To guard against the possibility of similar abuse arising here, regulations were made in 1954, 1962 and 1963 controlling the sale and distribution of such drugs. They may be sold retail only on medical prescription and, from enquiries which I have made, I am satisfied that such abuse of these substances as there may be in this country is on a limited scale.  In order to ensure, however, that there will be sufficient additional powers available to deal with unauthorised trafficking, possession and use of these drugs should the need <Col N="1445" /> arise, I am at present considering the promotion of appropriate legislation.</P>

      <i>(a)</i> The bulk of the revenue from tobacco is obtained from raw leaf imported for manufacture into cigarettes, pipe tobaccos and other products.  The duties on the leaf are collected without reference to end use and, accordingly, accurate statistics of the receipts from leaf used in the manufacture of cigarettes are not available.  However, it may broadly be taken that about 90% of the total receipts from tobacco are derived from cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> Separate figures of net receipts from petrol are not available, but more than 99% of the receipts of duty from Mineral Hydrocarbon Light Oil are in respect of petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to by the Deputy which was <Col N="1449" /> published on 20 February, 1965.  The actual terms of the text, so far as relevant to the matter raised in the question, were, however, as follows:</P>
      <P>An increase of some £2,000,000 in our resources although less than in 1963 may we think be regarded as very satisfactory.  With so many competitive institutions offering very high rates for deposits it is becoming more difficult for the Banks to expand their credit resources.  It is of course only from that source that we can expand our advances.</P>
      <P>You will have seen that the increase in advances was almost £3,000,000.  This was an exceptionally high figure for us and we are finding it necessary to regulate our advances so as to give main priority to those of a productive nature.</P>
      <P>I have no function in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the Royal Bank of Ireland Limited, but I am of opinion that a credit policy which gives main priority to advances of a productive nature is in the public interest and should meet with general approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

It is not possible at that stage to specify the length of the delay.  All applications received prior to 30th September have been provided for in the 1964/65 programme.  Offers of grants are at present being issued in respect of all applications received up to and including 31st March, 1964, in connection with the 1965/66 programme. <Col N="1452" /> The total number of outstanding applications received after 30th September, 1963, is 1,921 of which 1,412 were received subsequent to 31st March, 1964.</P>

The estimated expenditure in 1964/65 is £267,000.

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that representations were made to him to receive a deputation regarding this matter which the Minister passed on to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government?  Or, perhaps I am wrong and it was <i>vice versa</i>, that it went first to the Department of Local Government and then to the Department of Transport and <Col N="1456" /> Power since the minute payment of £200 was made.  In the circumstances, would the Minister not reconsider the suggestions made here or would he at least be prepared to receive a deputation to go into the matter more fully?</P>

      <P>No complaints of the nature referred to by the Deputy have been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made and I am informed that, when the normal route for the transport of cement to County Donegal, namely the Portadown/Derry railway line, was closed down on 14th February, 1965, an alternative service was provided by CIE, in conjunction with the Ulster Transport Authority by the remaining rail route.  This runs via Antrim and Coleraine to Derry. Delivery by road is effected from the Derry railhead, and special demountable flats have been introduced to expedite transfer from rail to road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A combination of factors, which might be described as teething troubles in the use of the new equipment and facilities at Derry, had resulted in some initial transport delays, but I was assured that care was taken to ensure <Col N="1458" /> that nobody was left short of supplies. The measures described are, however, expected to eliminate delays, at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is for increased expenditure on Subheads A to F and I. 2 of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  The total additional sum required, including provision for an expected deficit of £76,000 in receipts, is estimated at £764,100 but this is offset by expected savings on other subheads amounting to £44,100, leaving a nett amount of £720,000 to be provided.  The largest single item is £500,000 extra for schools as we built quicker than anticipated.  The original estimate was for £2.4 million and it appears we will spend £2.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead A covers the purchase of sites and buildings.  Expenditure on this service is always difficult to forecast accurately because of unexpected demands for accommodation and because premises often have to be bought at short notice.  One of the items causing the excess this year was the purchase of an embassy residence in Washington.  Until this year, the <Col N="1474" /> ambassador has been living in various rented premises.  It was not possible to get long-term leases for any of these and frequent changes of residence were necessary; apart from the inevitable expense associated with such changes, rents were continuously increasing.</P>
    <P>Property values in Washington have been spiralling and it was obvious that the most economic course in the long run would be to purchase a residence if a suitable premises at a reasonable price could be obtained. After a full survey of the market, we finally succeeded in finding such a premises this year and purchased it.  It is a suitable building in a good location in the diplomatic centre of Washington and is, according to professional advice, very good value in comparison with present property prices in Washington.</P>
    <P>Two other major items which helped to cause the excess on this subhead were the purchase of some properties in connection with the provision of the proposed Kennedy Memorial Concert and Assembly Hall and the purchase of a building at Merrion Square to be used as a new headquarters by the Irish Red Cross Society.  Deputies will recall that I referred to this latter item this time last year and that the project was commented upon favourably; the payment did not mature until this year.</P>
    <P>The increase in Subhead B (New Works) is once again due mainly to acceleration of the school building programme.  In fact, as I stated at the outset, expenditure on schools this year is expected to reach £2.9 million as against £2.4 million provided. Deputies will regard this as very satisfactory.  The target of 100 new schools in a 12 months' period has been reached; arrangements are in hands to proceed with building to the new modular system and I have great hopes of continued good output.</P>
    <P>The prototype school to this system at Ballyboghill, North County Dublin, has been completed and is now occupied. The time taken in erection was about half that of a school on traditional lines.  The experiment has been a success and everyone concerned is <Col N="1475" /> very pleased.  The film with sound commentary showing some of the processes in the erection of this school has been shown to some managers, contractors and representatives of trade journals.  Further showings will be arranged and if any Deputy would like to see it, I shall be glad to arrange it. Arrangements with a view to inviting tenders for some twenty new schools on this system are virtually completed. Building should start in June or July.</P>
    <P>A falling-off in some other building works due to the recent strikes in Dublin has reduced the additional amount required for the subhead to £171,000.</P>
    <P>Subheads C and D cover maintenance and furnishing of State premises. The excess expenditure on these subheads is due to increased costs generally and in particular to increased wages.  Wages increases are also responsible for the additional expenditure on Subhead 12, in which provision is made for Arterial Drainage construction works.</P>
    <P>The excesses on Subheads BB and F, covering Coast Protection works and the heating and lighting of State premises respectively, arise because some claims for payment for work done last year were not received in time to be paid before the beginning of the current year.</P>
    <P>The total additional sum of £720,000 required includes, as I mentioned earlier, an expected deficit of £76,000 in receipts.  This also is due, strange though it may appear, to the recent strikes in the building industry in Dublin.  The Office of Public Works now recovers from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the cost of works executed for that Department.  This year, progress on some major works for the Department in Dublin was less than expected because of the strikes and consequently recoveries were proportionately reduced.</P>
    <P>I trust that these few remarks will explain the need for the Supplementary Estimate.  It will be seen that it is due to three main factors: purchases of properties which were not foreseen <Col N="1476" /> when the Estimate was framed, increased productivity on school building and increases in prices generally especially in wages.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy would like more information on any point, I shall do my best to give it to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters on this Estimate on which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give some more information to the House.  He has mentioned that part of the sum required is in connection with the purchase of an embassy residence in Washington. I think it would be right that the Parliamentary Secretary should give the House fuller details with regard to that.  He has made out a case which on the face of it appears to be reasonable, that in the long run it is better business to purchase a residence than to have the present system whereby embassies are taken on a rented basis and changed from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not give the House the opportunity of judging whether or not the case he has made is a fair one.  He has not told the House what the cost of the embassy building will be, nor has he told us what type of building it will be nor what the amenities in it are likely to be generally.  The Parliamentary Secretary should be aware of the fact that, by and large, the question of purchasing embassy buildings abroad is one which the people of this country are inclined to view with a rather jaundiced eye.  A rather colossal sum appears to be spent on embassies abroad and I think he is doing less than justice to himself in withholding the type of information which I am now suggesting he should give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter on which I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary would be in a position to give information but, if he can, he should.  I do not want to be misunderstood in my remarks with regard to this.  It is in connection with the proposed Kennedy Memorial Concert and Assembly Hall.  I think the Parlialiamentary Secretary should give the House, if he can, some figures as to what is involved, or is likely to be <Col N="1477" /> involved, in connection with this project. So far as I know, nothing in the nature of firm figures has yet been mentioned to the House.  I suggest that that information should be given to the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to school buildings, I think all sides of the House will agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a great need for these and the quicker the job can be tackled the better.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be quite confident that the new modular type of building will meet the demands for new school buildings.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the new type of building to be able to assess that, and I would think it is a matter on which the Parliamentary Secretary should go into detail.  He should let us know the comparative cost as between the new style and the traditional type of building, and the comparative accommodation as between the two types.  However, I do agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that, even if it is a question of sacrificing some of the features which might have been valuable in school buildings, in the interests of speed, it may very well be worth making that sacrifice at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of Estimate which, I think, is calculated to sooth tingling pre-election nerves.  It is a pleasant Estimate to consider because it indicates progress in what one might very well describe as a moribund section of the Department of Finance until the advent of the present Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is £500,000 has to be found, which we did not expect and which will be needed for the provision of schools.  This is a very healthy sign.  It shows that an effort is being made to shake off the shackles of Civil Service bureaucracy which, in my view, has held up progress in school buildings for many years and, indeed, in every Government activity in this country. We are glad that more money is to be made available for schools.  Even if the rate of progress were doubled, it still would not be satisfactory in so far as school provision is concerned in the fuller sense.  All of us, particularly those who have the responsibility of <Col N="1478" /> representation, either partially or wholly, for rural areas, are aware of the very bad condition of many of the schools throughout our constituencies.</P>
    <P>The schools in some parts of the country are really remnants of the famine or pre-famine times.  They are completely unsuitable in many cases. They are dangerous to health, largely rat-infested and with absolutely no provision whatsoever as regards sanitation. Large numbers of children are compelled to inhabit these buildings during their tender years.  They are in overcrowded conditions and dangers exist for teachers and pupils alike.  I can think of a number of places in County Dublin where people are very angry, not alone with the Government but with everyone in public life because of the inadequate progress made in the provision of schools.</P>
    <P>There is one place which comes to mind, known as the Bog of Ring near Balbriggan.  The parents there have become very angry because of the delay in the provision of schools.  They have threatened action, which is undesirable, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bend his considerable energies to the solution of the problem for the people in that part of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins mentioned the proposals to provide a concert and assembly hall in Dublin to commemorate our great fellow countryman&mdash; the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  Undoubtedly, the question of cost is of some consideration but it is not a major consideration nor do I believe Irish people would consider it a major consideration in so far as the provision of a suitable memorial to this great man is concerned.  Very shortly a decision will be made in this connection and this city will have a building, when the construction of the memorial hall is concluded, of which it may well be proud.  Quite apart from the fact that it will commemorate the memory of the late John Fitzgerald Kennedy it will be well in the forefront of architectural advance from a world viewpoint.  It is in the hands, as we know, of one of the best qualified and <Col N="1479" /> efficient architects in Europe&mdash;Mr. McGrath.</P>
    <P>There is not very much one can discuss on the Supplementary Estimate because it affords little scope for contention. It is something of a sedative on a day such as this.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his unfailing courtesy, his work in relation to the production of the Supplementary Estimate and also on the work of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the matter of schools and the amount provided, I should like, together with the previous speaker, to bring to mind the long delay in having some of the schools completed in many of our constituencies. Sometimes you will find the contractor goes away from the building for four or five months and leaves the school half finished.  That should not be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>We are glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary is providing more money for schools and that he has taken action to try to remedy the position in regard to the old schools in the country.  I hope he will take action in relation to the man who starts a school and goes away from it for four or five months.  Only a month ago another contractor left a site.  I had to bring the matter to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  You cannot blame parents if they will not send their children to school.  The local Deputies and the Government are blamed for this.</P>
      <P>Since he assumed office the Parliamentary Secretary has been very effective in getting schools started, at least in my constituency.</P>

      <P>It is spent.  I would like to thank Deputies M.J. O'Higgins, S. Dunne and J. Fanning for their kind remarks.  As they said, we are all agreed that this expenditure on schools is highly necessary.  When <Col N="1480" /> people talk about the restoration of the language, I have always felt that one of the basic things&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a dangerous subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to restore the schools in which the language will be taught.  It has been said that some hundreds of our schools in Ireland at present are nothing but hovels.  Some thousands of them, indeed, have bad sanitary accommodation and many of them have no water.  We are facing up to the problem and I must say the Office of Public Works is fortunate to have the school section under the jurisdiction of Mr. Boyd Barrett, who is tackling the problem, as can be seen here from the figures, in such an expeditious manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins requested some information with regard to the cost of the new modular schools.  We estimate that a minimum saving on this type will be in the order of about ten per cent.  It is said that when bulk tendering is entered into, which we hope will be next June or July, when 20 to 25 can be built under one contract, the saving will be greater.  The great attraction of this type of modern system is the saving in time.  The prototype school, which we erected at Ballyboghill, was built in half the time it takes to erect the ordinary school. There is a big task still before us and we are very conscious of that.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins asked me for some idea of expenditure on these schools.  In 1953 we were spending £688,000 on our schools.  Today our expenditure is nearly £3 million, which is quite good progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins also asked me for some information with regard to the new embassy building purchased recently.  The cost was £102,000.  Before it was decided to purchase the premises at 2244 S Street in Washington as a residence for our Ambassador, Mr. Raymond McGrath, the principal architect of the Office of Public Works visited Washington and inspected premises that were suggested as being suitable. There was one premises at 2510 Foxhall <Col N="1481" /> Road.  I shall not go through all the addresses.  There was one at 2329 California Street, valued at £140,000, and one at 2220 Massachusetts Avenue, valued at £102,000, and eventually we purchased the premises at 2244 S Street for £102,000.  Our advice was that it was the most suitable.  That might seem to be a lot of money, but I think we did a good business deal, in view of the very high rent we had been paying down through the years for accommodation. We must also bear in mind that nowadays it costs £50,000 to buy a building in Merrion Square in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Further to substantiate my statement that it was better to buy this premises rather than to continue to rent premises, I have a few particulars for the House.  A house known as Westover at 4300 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington was in use as a residence for our Ambassador to the United States until 1962.  A lease of the premises for two years was initially taken at a monthly rent of 700 dollars, that is, 8,400 dollars per annum.  The lease was renewed for periods of three years up to 31st December, 1961.  When a further renewal was sought, agreement could not be reached with the landlords on terms.  The premises were vacated by the Ambassador on 15th May, 1962.  The house at 2426 Tracey Place, Washington, was taken on a lease for two years from 15th May, 1962, at a rent of 9,000 dollars per annum.</P>
    <P>The premises known as Renchard House at 1743 22nd Street, Washington, were taken on a lease for a period of one year from 15th March, 1964. The rent is 12,960 dollars per annum. It is intended to remain in occupancy of this accommodation until the new residence at S Street, recently purchased, is ready for occupation.  So, I think this is a good buy, and our technical advisers say the premises are structurally sound.  I think everyone will be satisfied this is a wise move, in view of the continued increase in property values everywhere, and particularly in Washington.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins also asked me for information about the property acquired for the Kennedy Memorial <Col N="1482" /> Hall at Haddington Road.  As Deputy Dunne pointed out, an all-Party committee&mdash;a very hard working and cooperative committee&mdash;have had many meetings dealing with this project in memory of the late President Kennedy. It was decided that it should be located in Haddington Road, and it was necessary to purchase property which was not in State care to enable this conception to be one of the outstanding architectural features of this age in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fanning raised the question of delays by contractors, and he said that schools which should have been finished seven or eight months ago were still under construction, and that the parents were blaming the Government and Deputies of all Parties.  Unfortunately those complaints are true, and I am sorry to say they are not unique to North Tipperary.  That is no consolation to Deputy Fanning, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main causes of the delay was that some of the builders took on more work than they were able to do.  Other builders having taken on work found they could not get enough skilled men, but the main reason was that the contractors were taking on too much.  Down through the years, the contractors gave a tremendous service to the Office of Public Works in this school building programme.  We will have to curtail their activities in the future, and instead of allowing them to take on five or six contracts at one time, we will have to ensure that they do at most two schools in one <Col N="1483" /> year.  Deputy Fanning has been in touch with me on several occasions in regard to the problem in North Tipperary, and he is aware that it has not been solved yet.  He informed me that the progress of the contractor for the Lackamore school is most unsatisfactory, and I have asked the Commissioners to take the necessary action.</P>

    <P>The net additional sum required for Social Welfare in the current year is £1,136,000.  This is the result of an estimated excess of £1,425,000 in gross expenditure offset by an estimated increase of £289,000 in Appropriations in Aid.  The excess expenditure of £1,425,000 is apportioned between the main divisions of the Estimate as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Administration&mdash;Subheads A to C £478,000.</P>
    <P>Social Insurance &mdash; Subhead E £280,000.</P>
    <P>Social Assistance&mdash;Subheads G to J £667,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> The increase in administration costs, £478,000, is due to factors such as salary increases awarded during the year, higher costs of travelling arising from increased mileage and subsistance rates, and increases in postal and telephone charges.  The increased requirement under Social Insurance is attributable to a rising trend in the cost of certain benefits, in particular disability and treatment benefits, and to higher administration expenses. Total expenditure out of the Social Insurance Fund is estimated to show a net increase of £969,000 but, on the other hand, income to the Fund is expected to be £558,000 higher than was originally provided for.  The Exchequer subvention required to meet the resultant addition to the Fund deficit of £411,000 is reduced to £280,000 because the Subhead E provision, as now revised, takes account of a sum of £131,000 due by the Fund to the Exchequer as at 31st March, 1964. The increase in receipts into the Social Insurance Fund is attributable to a continuing upward trend in the income from employment contributions and to an increase in receipts under Reciprocal Arrangements.</P>
    <P>On the Social Assistance side the increased provision is required to meet the cost in the current year of the increased rates of payment and other improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1964.  The total cost of implementing the provisions of the Act as regards Social Assistance is estimated at £735,000 in 1964-65, made up of £502,000 for old age pensions, £130,000 for unemployment assistance and £103,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The estimate for children's allowances is expected to be exceeded by £50,000 so that the total gross excess will amount to £785,000.  There are, however, offsetting features.  If it were not for the increased expenditure arising from the Social Welfare Act there would have been net savings amounting to £118,000, mainly on unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' pensions, and when these savings are taken into account the additional sum required for Social Assistance becomes £667,000.</P>
    <P>The expected surplus of £289,000 on <Col N="1486" /> Appropriations in Aid&mdash;Subhead L&mdash; is a direct consequence of the increased expenditure on the administration Subheads. The cost to my Department of administering the social insurance and social assistance schemes is met from the Social Welfare Vote.  The costs relating to Social Insurance are, however, a charge on the Social Insurance Fund and are recouped from the Fund and appropriated in aid of the Vote. Thus, when there is increased expenditure on the administration of the social insurance scheme, there will automatically be an increase in the amount appropriated in aid of the Social Welfare Vote.</P>
    <P>These are the main features of the Supplementary Estimate, to which I would ask the agreement of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many comments one would like to make on this Supplementary Estimate but what I wish to emphasise, and get the Minister's explanation for, are the appropriations-in-aid.  He said some savings had arisen on unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' pensions.  The truth is that all over the country widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance have been reduced or stopped for considerable periods and then restored at a lesser figure, although there was no change, as far as anybody could see, in the income of the recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the increase in the appropriations-in-aid has been at the expense of the weakest section of the community.  The same applies to old age pensions.  I am aware of cases in which old age pensions have been held up or withdrawn and in some cases have not yet been paid after a lapse of several months.  It is a very grave hardship and I should like the Minister to tell the House how, if a small farmer gets an additional heifer under the heifer scheme, that is automatically regarded as an increase in means.  That has happened in a number of cases, to my knowledge.  While there may have been payment of subsidy under the heifer scheme, the income of the old age pensioner or widow cannot be said to have increased to any extent.  Yet, questions <Col N="1487" /> have been raised with recipients by social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>The increase in respect of old age pensions is £502,000.  Is that not a small sum in these days when we talk so glibly in millions?  I have heard Ministers describing a sum coming up to that figure as being &ldquo;only small beer&rdquo;.  If recipients of social welfare payments could get any increase they would not regard it as small beer.  The fact that the increase in old age pensions costs only £502,000 would suggest the pensions should be increased considerably.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what any Government may do, there will be cases of hardship in regard to social welfare recipients. The Government and the Department of Social Welfare should err on the side of the recipient.  It would be preferable that four people should get a widow's pension or old age pension to which they were not entitled than that one qualified person should be disqualified. If the operation of a rule means that one person would be disqualified, it would be preferable that two or three people not so entitled should get a pension rather than that person would be disqualified in whose case disqualification would constitute grave hardship.</P>
    <P>I submit that the whole question of social welfare payments requires reexamination and a more liberal method should be adopted towards meeting the increased costs of living and all the difficulties that the old age pensioner and the widow and orphan are now facing.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the higher costs of administration arise from increased mileage and subsistence rates and postal and telegraph charges.  The increases in the postal and telegraph charges were imposed by the Government. The Government forget that such increases are reflected in this Vote and they also forget that the recipients of these pensions have to bear proportionately the same increases but that there is no corresponding increase in their pensions to meet them.  As I mentioned on the Army Vote, these matters must be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As this Supplementary Estimate is being taken immediately before the main Estimate, I do not intend to elaborate on it but there are two points to which I should like to refer.</P>
      <P>The first is the question of the extreme delays which still occur in relation to appeals.  We have discussed this matter with the Minister on the main Estimate and by way of Parliamentary Question on a number of occasions but I am afraid the situation has not improved.  If people who have been ill and who are examined by a Departmental referee and declared fit for work, appeal, as many of them do, months elapse before a decision is given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that I have the greatest respect for him and his Department, and no matter where this matter is mentioned, I say that I have always found him most courteous and obliging in every way, but, for some extraordinary reason, this is one of the things on which I can get no action at all.  Not alone do these people not get a quick decision but in some cases where shortly after the referee's decision has been taken that they are fit for work, the persons concerned were sent to a TB hospital and were very seriously ill.  I know at least two such cases that occurred in my area.  Despite that, the best the Department could do was to resume payments from the date on which the person was sent to hospital and the question as to payment in respect of the interim period had to be submitted to a referee.  That suggests that somebody is trying to justify a wrong turn he took.  The Minister has cleared up a good number of anomalies and I would ask him to do something about this anomaly as it is causing untold hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware but it is true to say that before Christmas of last year, for some extraordinary reason, the referees went all over the place and left a great many people without their Christmas dinner.  The fact that a number of cases were subbod <Col N="1489" /> sequently reviewed and the persons found unfit for work and were paid benefit did not excuse the action taken by the Department.</P>
    <P>There must be somebody who is responsible for this.  Such action is not typical of the Minister or of his officials.  There must be some reason why this should happen in a particular section.  I would like the Minister to take sufficient interest in this matter to find out who is responsible and see that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I should like to refer is the question of the non-contributory old age pension.  Non-contributory pensioners are in a deplorable condition.  There is no use in saying that the State is doing what it can and cannot afford more.  The State can afford more and must afford more. These people are really the destitute poor of the present generation and I would appeal to the Minister to do something about them.  Now is the time because the Minister is getting an opportunity which he may not get again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for dealing so expeditiously with this Supplementary Estimate.  As Deputy Tully says, the main Estimate, on which we can have fuller discussion, will be before the House shortly.</P>
      <P>I think I can contradict what Deputy MacEoin said in regard to there being wholesale savings on unemployment assistance, widows' pensions, and so on, throughout the country.  There has certainly been no special campaign to reduce or to stop these payments but it is laid down in the law as passed by this House that changes in income must be taken into account in regard to social assistance services and I am quite satisfied that the social welfare officers and the officials of my Department who are charged with the duty of administering these laws do not adopt an over-zealous attitude in regard to them, as has been alleged here. It is, of course, their duty when there is an increase in income to investigate that and to report it and an increase in income involves either a reduction or a cessation of the assistance payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> I think a means test in regard to assistance payments is an essential feature, as anybody who examines the question closely will agree.  If there has to be a means test, it must be enforced. I certainly have no reason to believe that there is any over-zealousness on the part of the officials.  I have always tried to impress upon them that it is as much part of their duty and equally, if not more important, for them to ensure that claimants for any of these services get what they were intended by this House to get as it is for them to ensure that payments are not obtained in contravention of the intention of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Tully's complaint about what he described as extreme delays in cases of appeal, I think there is a great amount of exaggeration in what he said.  I take it that he is referring to appeals in regard to disability benefit only.  He certainly directed his remarks practically entirely to disability benefit.  My attitude is that these appeals should be decided as speedily as possible.  I am not aware that there are very long delays in these cases.  In other cases of appeals where it is a question of a person being entitled to payment or not, sometimes there are long delays. However, it is usually found, on investigation of the cause of the delay, that the decision on the appeal is being held up in order to try to establish if there is any way in which the person concerned could qualify for the benefit he or she is claiming.  One usually finds, on the basis of the evidence the appeals officer has been able to obtain, that if a decision were made earlier the decision would have to be adverse to the applicant.  The delay in those cases is usually caused by the desire of the appeals officer to be completely certain that he has all the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be necessary to see the person but where there is an inordinate delay you will usually find, on investigation, that the appeals officer is trying to establish something which will enable the applicant to <Col N="1491" /> qualify.  I admit I am not referring to the disability benefit type of case with which Deputy Tully seems to be dealing, but mainly with old age pension cases.</P>

We should remember these are cases in which it has already been decided by the medical referee that the person concerned does not qualify for disability benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a question in regard to this Supplementary Estimate.  It relates to the case of people whose employers should have stamped cards and where it has been established by an officer of <Col N="1492" /> the Minister's Department that the employee is being deprived of benefit as a result of the failure of the employer to stamp cards whereupon a right arises in the employee to sue for what he has lost.  In such cases the Minister should exercise discretion to act on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I had a case recently in which, after very long inquiry where the employer manifestly was not co-operative, it was established that the employer had failed to stamp the cards as was his duty.  I asked the Minister to exercise discretion to sue in the name of the employee, who is a countryman, and after long consideration the Minister refused.  Might I put it to the Minister that ordinarily, where you are dealing with a man who is not a member of a trade union and who has no support of that kind to assist him in such proceedings, the Minister ought, as a general rule, to act on his behalf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable for the Minister to do these things as a general rule.  There is a legal obligation on the employer to stamp the cards and my Department's interest in the matter would be to ensure that he complies with the law. Where an employee loses benefit as a result of his employer's failure to carry out his legal obligation, he has the right to sue the employer for the loss of benefit and my Department will give him every assistance in establishing his case.  In cases of particular hardship the Department can act on his behalf but it would be a very wrong thing to expect the Department to take up all these civil actions themselves. I cannot remember the particular case to which Deputy Dillon is referring but I am quite sure that, if the facts are as clear as he says, a solicitor would take the matter up for the person who has been wronged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the law ordinarily provides a remedy for the employee.  If the employee is a member of a trade union or has some sophisticated advice at his disposal, it is reasonable enough to tell him to go to his trade union and ask them to help him to start proceedings but if you are <Col N="1493" /> dealing with a chap who is not organised at all and who is a countryman to whom the business of going to a solicitor is formidable, it is a different matter.  Most solicitors would require such a person to put down some sum to cover the costs of initiating proceedings. I cannot see why the Minister should have any objection to acting on behalf of such a person once it has been determined that there has been a failure by the employer to comply with the law and that the Minister has so found as a matter of fact.  It is merely a matter of using the machinery of the court to get for the employee that to which he is entitled, and it would relieve the employee in rural Ireland of a great burden of anxiety.  Perhaps the Minister would consider&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £318,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an ArdChláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when I introduced the Estimate for this Vote in June of last year I also introduced a Supplementary Estimate, the need for which arose from the grant of increases in remuneration to members of health authority staffs.  These were &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo; increases, and the additional provision was required to enable Health Services Grant to be paid from <Col N="1494" /> the Health Vote towards the expenditure by health authorities additional to that on which the grant provision in the original Estimate had been based.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the second Supplementary Estimate which I am now placing before the House will be apparent from the information set out in the Estimate.  The additional provision, which falls under two subheads of the Vote, amounts to £818,000, against which I have found it possible to set a saving of £500,000 under another subhead, leaving the net requirement at £318,000.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead A of the Vote, which relates to remuneration of staff of the Department, an additional sum of £68,000 is required to cover expenditure which has to be met as a result of general ninth round increases and, also, adjustments of remuneration of grades arising out of claims made through the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead G&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities, it is necessary to seek a further £750,000.  This is the amount by which, it is estimated, the grants payable in the current financial year will be increased by reason of increases in remuneration of certain staffs of health authorities, mainly medical and nursing.  These increases are the result of decisions taken at arbitration under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration applicable to local staffs.  It is estimated that the gross additional expenditure of health authorities in this respect within the current financial year will be £1,580,000, and one-half of that amount will be recoupable as Health Services Grant.  The total estimated amount to be recouped is £790,000. Under the arrangements for payment of the grant, ninety-five per cent is payable within the financial year in advance of the submission of final accounts, and accordingly the amount to be met within this year is £750,000.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the Estimate that I am budgeting for a saving of £500,000 under Subhead K&mdash;Hospitals Trust Fund&mdash;Grant-in-Aid.  As I explained when introducing the original Estimate the purpose of this Grant-in-Aid <Col N="1495" /> is to enable me to continue with the hospital building programme.  Due to the interruption of building work in the Dublin area, as a result of the building strike last autumn, progress on projects then in operation was much less than had been expected and other work could not be started as early as had been hoped. Mainly for this reason I find it possible to limit my demands on the Grant-in-Aid this year and I am accordingly in a position to set a saving of £500,000 against the gross additional provision which I am seeking under subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers, of course, a very limited scope.  In fact it operates to make additional provision resulting from the spiral of inflation and the consequential necessity to adjust salaries and incomes to meet the steadily increasing cost of living.  The broad question of the health services will arise for discussion on the Minister's main Estimate when it comes before the House and we do not propose now to trespass on the patience of the Chair by seeking to initiate a wide debate on the health services within the narrow field provided by this Supplementary Estimate.  Frankly, however, I am not clear in my mind as to the exact machinery whereunder the Minister takes credit to himself for a saving of £500,000 under subhead K&mdash;Grant-in-Aid. Are we to take it that, in substance, he is using £500,000 from the Grant-in-Aid from the Hospitals Trust Fund this year for the purposes of the Vote or is he saying he will not be called on for half of the Grant-in-Aid he had planned to give the Hospitals Trust Fund in order to proceed with hospital building?  Perhaps he would be in a position to say whether, in view of this fortuitous economy this year, he will have to make provision next year for all the additional costs set out in this Supplementary Estimate, plus the £500,000 he finds himself free not to pay in the course of this financial year owing to the building strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers a very narrow field and I agree with Deputy Dillon that it <Col N="1496" /> would be unwise for that reason to try to broaden the scope of the debate on it and have a full dress debate on health.  Because the money required is for the specific reasons set out, we feel there is no point in having any further debate on it and we are agreeable to passing the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very gratifying to know that, for once, the Leader of the Opposition finds himself bound by the Standing Orders and does not, therefore, propose to exceed the ambit of the Supplementary Estimate.  I am very grateful for that.  I think the Leader of the Opposition ought not, however, encourage the belief that we are in an inflationary spiral because, if that view were to become a commonplace opinion, then we should be heading for financial disaster.  Moreover it would be a disaster not based upon the facts, but upon the misleading propaganda in which persons like the Leader of the Opposition commonly indulge when they are on an election platform.</P>
      <P>A large part of the increase for which I am now asking the House to make provision does not arise so much from the ninth round as from the fact that there has been a readjustment of remuneration ostensibly to preserve or restore the relative importance of certain vocations.  A great part of the money which I am now asking the House to provide for disbursement among health authority staffs arises out of status claims, most notably that which was made recently in regard to the remuneration of psychiatric nurses. That is not a reflection of the cost of living.  It is merely a recognition of the fact that for some time past what would be regarded as equitable remuneration for these staffs has lagged behind that which has been accorded to other public employees.  It has got nothing whatever to do with a spiral of inflation.  It is merely a readjustment of relative remuneration in order to bring the people in certain employments into proper accord with what is being paid in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the query the Deputy put in relation to the draw on the Grant-in-Aid, the Grant-in-Aid is provided in order that I may be able to continue my building programme; but, <Col N="1497" /> if it is not necessary for me to draw on that Grant-in-Aid, I have more money available from the Hospitals Trust Fund in order to meet the demands of the voluntary general hospitals arising out of the increase in the remuneration of their staffs.  As the local authorities pay capitation to the voluntary general hospitals on the basis of the number of local authority patients for which they provide, I am in the situation that I do not have to draw on the grant for building purposes, and am able to find the money out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I am, therefore, quite entitled to take credit for the fact that I did not make that draw on the Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have dealt with the first two sections of the Bill in the Resolutions, and it now only remains for me to deal with section 4.  This contains a new provision which would enable the Minister for Finance to issue a non-interest-bearing Government security. For some time past I have felt and it has been put to me that there are sections of the investing public who do not find the traditional type of national loan sufficiently attractive.  Therefore I have under consideration the issue of a new kind of security intended for investors <Col N="1501" /> who are attracted by prospects of capital gain.  I have in mind that no interest would be payable but that the investment would be redeemed with the addition of a fixed premium at the end of a period of years; that the gain on redemption would be free of tax; and that each year during the currency of the loan a draw would be made for the redemption of a fixed proportion of the issue at full maturity value.</P>
    <P>I have made up my mind about the type of investment, but we have not yet worked out the details.  It would probably be run for a number of years, say, eight, ten or 12 years, with an amount added on each year which would not be interest but capital value. That, of course, will have an attraction for some people because it does not attract income tax.  This amount, accumulating each year, would amount to, say, 50 per cent more than was put in after ten or 12 years and would be payable.  There would be an additional attraction in the issue in that there would be a draw every year and a certain percentage, a small percentage, would be drawn each year.  The successful person would get the full amount they would otherwise be entitled to at the end of the period.  I imagine this is the type of investment that should suit pension funds and investments of that kind.  It will be giltedged and will give the investors the certainty of a substantial appreciation of their investment in a known period of years, together with a fair chance that the investment will appreciate under the draw which will take place each year.  I think it will be possible to have the security put on the Stock Exchange.  In that way it will be different from the Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>Some investors have expressed the opinion that the term of a national loan is too long and they would like to have a much shorter period.  In addition, there are certain investors who would be attracted by capital appreciation rather than interest being paid each year.  Of course, I need hardly say it will be worked out to cost the State somewhat the same as a national loan would cost.  That will take some fine calculation with regard to the amount that should be passed on each year, <Col N="1502" /> bearing in mind we are losing income tax and so on in an investment of this kind compared with a loan.  It should be a successful type of investment and I hope to be able to give full details at Budget time.  Perhaps around that time, or shortly after, we should be able to have a first issue of this investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fund Bill provides an occasion for a somewhat wider discussion than the specific sections but, as the Minister for Finance has chosen to avail of this occasion to elaborate on section 4, I think it is proper that I should make some comment upon it.  I think on reflection and looking at what he himself has said about section 4, the Minister feels he is making a pretty substantial requisition on the House in asking approval in principle for his proposal, because, as he himself says, it is yet very far from clear.  I now suggest how this proposal presented itself to him.  Perhaps he will correct me if my presumption is wrong.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, he proposes to issue a new national loan.  He does not say whether it is to be a tap loan or for a specific sum, at a discount say, of £70 for £100 stock, and proposes to say that that loan will be redeemed at its face value at the end of a term of 30 years or so, but that in the meantime a fraction of the loan will be drawn for redemption as the Land Bonds now are every year, so that there is introduced into the transaction a slight element of gamble similar to that associated with the existing Prize Bond issue.  If you are fortunate enough to have your number drawn in any of the intervening years between the year of issue and the 30th year of redemption, you will get your capital appreciation so much sooner than you would get it if you had to wait for the maturing of the loan.  If I have correctly interpreted what the Minister proposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy, of course, is correct in a way.  He can look at it that way: say, put in £70 and take out £100; but I had rather look at it as putting in £100 and taking out £140.  It is only a matter of words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, as the Minister says, in the heel of the hunt, it will cost the State approximately the same but as far as I can see it is another variant of the Prize Bond issue.  Whether it will attract any very substantial sums of money is open to doubt.  I cannot see any harm in it if the Minister determines it as any particular value, but I am not altogether sure that the multiplication of these types of loans based on a gambling premise is altogether desirable.  We have a Prize Bond draw and, if anybody wants to take a chance, he can. I readily acknowledge that there is this distinction&mdash;that the Prize Bond issues are short-term money and they can be drawn at the bondholder's option at any time.  In theory, all Prize Bond holders can ask for the money from the banks in the morning, whereas the holders of these Government stocks cannot realise their investment at the expense of the Treasury except either <Col N="1504" /> through the draw or through the maturing of their holding, but then the Minister hopes it will be possible for them to buy and sell them on the Stock Exchange.  Therefore, this is really a Prize Bond procedure stripped of its short-term character.</P>

      <P>The proposal really is to provide another Prize Bond but stripped of its short-term character and made a medium-term security.  To tell the truth, I do not see what anybody hopes to achieve by this.  If the Minister says it will assist him to have access to credits, I do not think there is any objection in principle to it, but I imagine that it is really designed to attract money from rich people who primarily seek capital gain rather than income tax.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to be clear on this.  Would I be right in assuming that it is intended, under this system, to have in this country a security which stands in the same relation to our income tax law as a municipal bond stands in relation to the Federal income tax law in the United States of America?  The municipal bond is not assessable to Federal income tax, with the peculiar result that municipalities are able to borrow at a much lower rate of interest than the States of the Federal Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister calculates what the discount or the bonus will be on these bonds at maturity, will the calculation be made at current rates of interest or will there be some estimate made of the savings effected as a result of this bond's addition not being liable to income tax?  It would look queer to establish a form of Government security accessible to rich individuals everywhere to avoid not only our income tax laws but possibly income tax laws in their own country. I do not know that it would be a very desirable form of security to establish. A decent democratic system depends on the proposal that we all pay our taxes&mdash;and some of us find our taxes extremely onerous&mdash;but we all pay them, in the hope and belief that our neighbour finds them as onerous as we <Col N="1505" /> do.  As long as we all pay our fair share, we keep going, but if we suddenly discover that some wealthy individual has succeeded in hiring a skilled accountant who has punched a hole in the income tax code and, as a result, he is avoiding income tax, then that gives rise to justifiable resentment on the part of the rest of the taxpaying community who feel they are being asked to bear more than their fair share of the burden.</P>
    <P>I can imagine a man who has today an income of £20,000 a year and is paying 12/6d, or whatever rate in the £ so large an income would attract, saying to himself and his family: &ldquo;If we can cut our annual income to £10,000 a year, we can put the balance of our capital into this new kind of loan and can collect on this.  I can make the other half of my income free of income tax but I will simply save it up&rdquo;.  I would ask myself the question if that was a fair form of security for the Government to issue: I should like to hear the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>I do not think we ought to create a section of the community who could avail of a device of this character to avoid what Oireachtas Éireann has determined to be a fair rate of income tax to be paid on a particular income. If this form of security is of that character, I think we ought to look at it again.  I could not help feeling that if that was the plan we had in mind, we would be catering for a society in which the poor got poorer while the rich got richer.  The Minister may say that that is not so and that what they are trying to do is to get for the Government of the country the same kind of advantage as the American municipality enjoys in compensation for this security being of a kind which in effect does not attract income tax.</P>
    <P>If the Minister said: &ldquo;We shall be able to get this money from a certain type of wealthy citizen or farmer at a lower rate of interest than we should otherwise have to pay&rdquo;, then I would be able to understand what this is all about.  Unless there is an element in it that the Government are, for the time being, to get the benefit of a substantially lower rate of interest than they <Col N="1506" /> would otherwise have to pay, I feel constrained to say that I cannot understand why this device has been worked out.  I do not think the Minister should ask us to give approval in principle to this new system of borrowing without being able to reassure us in some degree but in a more detailed form than he has been able to do in his introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage of the Central Fund Bill, I think I am entitled to ask the Minister certain questions.  We are operating this year, for the first time, a new system designed to expedite the disposal of financial business by dealing with main Estimates as soon as they are ready so as to get them out of the way by the time the Book of Estimates is ready for publication.  That has involved us in the obligation of dealing with certain of these Estimates without knowing what the global sum of the Government's estimate for expenditure in the coming financial year is likely to be.  We do not yet know how the present financial year will turn out.  I should like the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, to give us some estimate today.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach have thought it proper, not for the first time, at dinners and functions outside this House to make forecasts about the outturn of their present Budget.  That is an exercise that goes on in the autumn every year.  We, who are familiar with political procedures in this country, are inclined to get cynical about it.  We are always told in October or November that the outlook for the Budget is very bad, that the Minister is full of apprehensions that there will be a very large deficit and that there will be an obligation on him speedily to increase tax in the coming financial year.  Then, as we approach Budget time, we are accustomed to hear speeches that a modern miracle has taken place, that the immense ebullience of the national economy has resulted in increased revenue which illustrates the extraordinary prosperity of the country and that the Minister for Finance will not have to impose all the awful taxes he was so afraid last October he would have to impose.  I <Col N="1507" /> do not think that is a very healthy exercise but if the Government think it is useful there is not much we can do to stop them.</P>
    <P>We are now within three weeks of the end of the financial year.  The Minister ought to be able to foresee more precisely what the outturn will be.  All of us have accessible to us the revenue returns in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and we can all make our own surmises from them. The Minister will agree that there is available to the Department of Finance an abundance of detailed information which makes it possible for them to make much more accurate estimates than the best informed amongst the Opposition can do, having at their disposal nothing but the figures published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> from time to time.</P>
    <P>The present situation is that we have had an adverse trade balance of £120 million odd in the past 12-month period.  We have had an adverse balance of payments for the past calendar year of slightly over £30 million and the cost of living is steadily rising.  I mention these things because these are the common economic denominators by which one seeks to determine whether or not we are dealing with an inflationary situation and they are all closely interrelated.</P>
    <P>The Government have made certain predictions as to what they would regard as a healthy trend over a seven-year period.  I think they said that, over that seven-year period, they would not be unduly dismayed if there was an adverse balance of payments in the order of £16 million per annum.  Not everyone agreed that an estimated deficit of that magnitude could with equanimity be borne by a country which was in the process of drawing in substantial blocks of foreign capital for investment.  The interesting fact is that in the first two years of the period to which the Government then referred we have had an adverse trade balance in the first year I think of £20 million and in this, the second year, of slightly over £30 million so that we are running a great deal ahead of the adverse trade balance which the Government <Col N="1508" /> themselves thought to be tolerable.  Both these adverse balances have been realised in a period in which a substantial volume of foreign investment has been coming into the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's attention has been drawn recently to the situation that has developed in New Zealand.  In the decade immediately after the war, from 1946-56, New Zealand passed through the same phase as that through which we are now passing. They set out all over the world on a very active campaign to draw in foreign capital and they succeeded. They drew into the domestic economy of New Zealand a very large volume of foreign capital which, while it was coming in, operated to obscure the underlying adverse balance of payments which the New Zealand economy was in fact experiencing at that time.  The influx of foreign capital has now reached a point at which the Government of New Zealand, under considerable domestic pressure, have taken to ask themselves if they want any more because all New Zealand industry is coming under foreign control.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency for the influx of foreign capital to falter, and superimposed on that are domestic doubts as to the desirability of drawing in further foreign capital for industrial development.  As the influx of foreign capital tends to dwindle, the Government of New Zealand have been confronted with a formidable problem to meet the adverse balance of payments coming into view as a result of the reduction in the influx of foreign capital.</P>
    <P>We are at a period when we are drawing in very substantial sums of foreign capital and operating a trade deficit of £124 million.  We are running an adverse balance of payments, despite the inflow of capital of nearly twice the size that we anticipated, that the Government anticipated when they published the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> This year, I think I am right in saying that the adverse balance was £30 million.  If <Col N="1509" /> our experience approximates to the experience of New Zealand, should the influx of foreign capital tend to dwindle at the end of five or ten years, all the capital that has arrived here in the meantime will be drawing out the seven per cent from our economy that it was sent here to earn, and for every £1 million that comes in at present, we must find £70,000 a year to finance it.  For every £10 million, we must find £700,000 a year, and as the influx of foreign capital dwindles that will have to be produced by our export surplus.</P>
    <P>We have already a visible adverse trade balance of £124 million.  The Minister will agree that when we look about the world and see the USA clamping down on tourism, see Brussels warning the European Economic Community they had better be careful about their adverse trade balance of a billion dollars, we must agree that tourism is something we have got to be circumspect about.  It is one of these very volatile exports that can rise and fall in a dramatic way.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I should like the Minister to tell us today, when we have before us ascertainable facts in regard to the visible trade balance, the visible balance of payments, the visible cost of living figures, what he expects the position in regard to the national Budget to be on 31st March next.  Will we have a surplus?  Will we break even?  Does the Minister anticipate a deficit and, if so, a deficit of what size?  It would be a valuable exercise to all those considering the fundamental economy of the country to have at their disposal that information at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>Under our new procedures, we are trying, in the name of expedition in the discharge of public business, to take some of our financial fences somewhat earlier than we had been in the habit of doing.  It would be of great assistance to the Opposition to do this with a clear conscience if the Minister at this stage could give us a reasonably accurate forecast&mdash;I fully appreciate it cannot be precise &mdash; of what the out-turn of the present Budget is likely to be at the end of this <Col N="1510" /> month.  I gather from some of his pronouncements recently that it is not as gloomy a picture as he had apprehended it might be in the autumn.  If the revenue produces a surplus on this year, then the country may look forward with some confidence to some stabilising factors being introduced in the year that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the Minister has to tell us today that because of the Budget picture that is likely to emerge on the 31st of this month, the Government will be desirous of raising further revenue to meet the situation that confronts the country in the year that lies ahead, we will have rising taxes, rising rates, a rising cost of living index, a rising adverse balance of visible trade and a rising adverse balance of payments and, if the Minister for Finance urges us to believe that such a picture represents economic stability, I suggest that would be putting a strain on our credulity greater than the best goodwill on this side of the House would willingly sustain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure that in his litany of impending disaster, Deputy Dillon must have been struck by the similarity between the predicaments we are facing now and those they had to face in Britain after the Tory Government were put out.  It seems to me that since we so frequently follow the mirror image policy of Britain in social and economic ideas, it is not surprising we should find ourselves facing most of the things Deputy Dillon and Fine Gael have enumerated.  In the context of that position&mdash;the Government finding themselves short of money &mdash;and in the context of the speech by the Taoiseach recently in which he promised the country increases in taxation, nearly inevitably, to fund existing services and those at a very low level, it seems strange that the proposal contained in section 4 of the Bill should use, as an incentive, freedom from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance seems to be leaning towards the position where he will face the idea of a capital gains freedom from taxation.  The idea of capital gains without any taxation is, most people feel, something which is <Col N="1511" /> wrong in a society in which taxation is paid by the mass of the working people and in particular by the working community with large families because of the new type of indirect taxation imposed by the Government. It shows an extraordinary remoteness from the realities of the very hard living people find themselves faced with at the present time in trying to buy the essentials of life, a great remoteness from the hardships most people face in their daily lives, that these proposals should now be made by the Government.</P>
    <P>Remember, a very weak argument has been put forward as to why we should have this new scheme introduced, this new security intended to attract investors by prospects of capital gain.  First of all, as far as we know, the record has been set in the Government's time&mdash;to their credit, of course &mdash; of having loans consistently over-subscribed at the existing rates of five to seven per cent.  It seems to us there is no suggestion there that the Government are finding it hard to get money from the public by way of the existing mechanisms of national loans of one kind or another.  In that case there does not appear to be a justification established for this new proposal.</P>
    <P>The decision to provide interest-free and tax-free loans of this kind, or tax-free benefits and capital gains of this kind, is on all fours with the general trend away from taxation of the people best able to pay towards the people less able to pay this indirect tax which has been a predominant feature of Government fiscal policy in the past 10 years anyway.  One must remember that the people who are getting this gain are people who have money to invest.  I know the old lady with a few securities for the rest of her life might be cited by the Minister for Finance, but, in fact, he knows well this is a facility for a gambling type of investment by people who already have a lot of money.  In fact they have so much that they can lock it away in this manner for a number of years and still get by and live in reasonable <Col N="1512" /> luxury &mdash; certainly in a reasonable measure of comfort.</P>
    <P>Why should they be free of tax in this way?  Why should they be given a concession in this way?  The extraordinary position we have here in Ireland, as I mentioned before, is this belief that we are, first of all, a Christian society in which we have certain established verities, beliefs or standards in relation to the treatment of one another.  One was impressed during the EEC debates by the general feeling of the people who contributed from here, that we are in fact going into Europe as a sort of standard bearer with a high level of spirituality, and so on, which is particularly nauseating in view of the fact that most of the European countries with which we are to associate are far ahead of us in their organisation of community services for the dependent groups in their societies.  They dig much deeper into their pockets for the provision of better care for old people, better educational services, better health services, or what ever it may be.</P>
    <P>If one is to analyse the Christian idea as to how you care for your neighbour, how you look after the weak, the depressed, and so on, quite frankly, we lag behind other European countries.  We have this taxation policy now greatly accentuated in recent years in which our direct tax rates are much lower than the rate of indirect taxation paid by other comparable communities, people with much the same national income per head.  We have the lowest rate of direct taxation of most of these European societies, and we have one of the highest rates of indirect taxation. Therefore, the whole concern of the Government appears to be that we will relieve the already wealthy person of paying increased taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that if this proposal is introduced, we will find ourselves relieving these wealthy people of this tax.  We shall have to find the money somewhere.  Let us go back to the Taoiseach's position in which he made it quite clear that we will have to increase indirect taxation or probably direct taxation, but certainly one or other form of taxation. We believe there should not be this exemption from taxation on this type of capital gains device, particularly as there is plenty of money available in the form of national loans. The Minister has made no case at all for the introduction of this type of device.  Our rate of direct taxation is a little over five per cent and, in the European countries mentioned, it is something in the region of 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of what is it five per cent and 20 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Direct taxation on income, as opposed to 14 per cent in the United Kingdom and 20 per cent in Germany and the Netherlands. Indirect taxation is much higher. France is the only country which has a higher rate than we have of indirect taxation.  The Minister should make a proposal of this kind only when he is quite happy that he will not have to find the money small as it may be from people who can afford to pay very much less as appeared from the Taoiseach's speech, the ordinary worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach's earlier statement &mdash;which he made some time in 1963 &mdash;is correct, that the economy will be expanded, and so on, so that we can improve the general standard of living of our people, this shows no sign that he is interested in the general standard of living of the people.  A strange thing is that over recent years <Col N="1514" /> we have heard much about remarkable expansion in the national income and advances in the national welfare and the general level of prosperity all allegedly bringing great credit to the Government.  At least it should do that.  But one comes up against the reality of the Taoiseach's speech and all this is only on paper, apparently. There certainly is no question of distributing this wealth in the form of health, education or social services of any kind.  He made that quite clear.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister can justify this concession.  I do not think anybody believes now in this general idea that was current in the first <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> One of the things said was that high taxation was the greatest impediment to economic progress.  Nobody believes that any more.  There are plenty of examples where there is a high benefit society.  Western Germany, Sweden, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, Great Britain, are examples.  Great Britain, incidentally, is one of the most backward countries in Europe from the point of view of social welfare and the redistribution of incomes.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that the Minister should devise a scheme of this kind. Why should there be freedom from taxation for people with plenty of capital while the ordinary worker who increases his income by overtime has to pay taxation on that increase?  Why should these people be free from taxation and why should the ordinary worker be taxed?  When the Government complains that they do not seem to have enough money to extend the social services, it seems a pretty irresponsible thing to do to introduce this type of incentive, the exploitation of the various side effects of capital enterprise, the inflationary trends of one kind or another, the staggering changes in house property values and the devaluations, all of which can be used by people with money which they do not need to get by, just to live on. They can use it to make more money, so the wealthy people in our society are encouraged to use this type of system to make very much more money.  On the other hand, the ordinary people are finding it very hard indeed to get a living in society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> This freedom from tax is the sort of thing which helps the low level of employer contributions for social welfare benefits.  Ours again is the lowest in Europe.  It is 2.3 per cent of employers' contributions for social welfare benefits.  The bias of this Government in the 1930's was quite different.  The bias of this Government is towards featherbedding of the already wealthy persons, making things easy for them and then increasing the strains of living on the ordinary white collar person, the manual worker and in the end, on his family.  The whole problem is tied up in the different approach of the Government.  They are so concerned, at the moment, with their precarious position in this country. I would like to say that I would imagine one of the greatest and most important factors in the situation in which the Government have found themselves of having lost a very substantial majority of a few years ago is that, as far as the public is concerned, they represent an attitude of mind where easy-moneyed people will find it easier to make more money. People with a lot of money will be helped to make a lot more money.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach makes a speech which he hopes will hold the rising tide of discontent amongst the mass of people, who are beginning to understand that this type of society is not necessary.  If we wanted to increase the benefits to the public by an equitable taxation system, if we wanted to increase the benefits for education, health, housing and all the other social benefits of one kind or another by 60 per cent, we could do it.  Italy has a very low income per head of the population.  They have a level of income per head of the population something like our own.  It is reasonably comparable with ours.  If we were to adopt the system of taxation they have in Italy, we could increase the benefits in relation to the key services of education, health, housing and social benefits by 60 per cent.  If we were to adopt the same level of direct taxation which is available in Italy, we could do this.</P>
    <P>That is a formidable proposition but <Col N="1516" /> it seems to me it exemplifies the remoteness of the Government.  I suppose that comes from being in power for a long time.  The remoteness of the Government from the realities of hard thinking is shown by looking after the minority, by these little devices of giving relief on surtax, death duties and capital gains tax.  It is not the minority who will be in the ballot boxes.  It is the majority of the people who are not getting the benefits of a fair and just taxation system.  While it may take time and it may be possible to confuse the position by the use of the various media of communication, to confuse the situation and the real position, and to create the impression the Government are concerned for the welfare of the mass of the public, once the public begin to understand that that is not so, it will be represented eventually in their reaction, as far as this Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>This proposal is, as I say, on all fours with the general trend away from concern for the welfare of the mass of the people and towards concern for the welfare of the wholly wealthy minority.  It is a complete reversal of the Government's policy in the 1930's. It represents the reason they have had a considerable loss in the majority they had then compared with the position in which they now find themselves.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he has a better case to make for this proposal, he should make it.  I read the other day that the Labour Government in England are thinking of proposing something like 45 per cent tax on capital gains.  That is a complete reversal of the old Tory idea.  It represents, again, an attitude of mind. It is money made by people who are very wealthy.  They are not hard hit by the high level of taxation as the father of a large family is hard hit by indirect taxation on consumer goods of one kind or another.  It represents a complete opposition, the other side of the coin, from the Conservative Government, which preceded the present Labour Government, and it exemplifies the earlier point I made, in regard to Deputy Dillon's doubts. <Col N="1517" /> that these policies of the Government are the conservative policies of a very conservative group of politicians, who, I believe, will pay very dearly politically and electorally in the very near future for this desertion by them of the people who stood by them for many years because of their concern for them in the early thirties.  They will have their wealthy friends, but, as I said, electorally they are a relatively powerless group.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Dr. Browne's attitude on this. Let me put it this way.  Suppose I issue a £100 bond to a rich man for ten years at, say, six per cent.  He pays back two per cent in income tax, and leaves the other four per cent to accumulate.  This is exactly the same.</P>

      <P>There may be some margins.  I will not go into the shillings and halfcrowns.  The aim is to get the same amount from the borrower and give the same by way of reward.  Of course this will not suit foreign investors because the foreign investor now draws his six per cent and pays income tax in his own country.  If he had four per cent or 4½ per cent under the new system, he would not be doing as well.  There are various things we must keep in mind. That is why I could not explain all the details today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call this a capital gain, but the fact that it is called a capital gain does not mean, as Deputy Dr. Browne tried to point out, that we are favouring the rich man any more than we favoured him when he got six per cent in the <Col N="1518" /> past.  We took one-third in income tax.  This will be the same except that he must leave his money for ten, 11 or 12 years, or whatever term we decide.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind, too, that we are reaching the stage where we are not able to supply enough capital from home resources.  As Deputies are aware, we had to seek loans outside the country last year&mdash;one for the ESB and one for the air companies. When we borrow abroad like that, we have to pay the full rate of interest. The Government&mdash;and the State, through the Government&mdash;have an advantage in borrowing at home, because we get back income tax, but when we borrow abroad, we have not got that advantage.  We should be in a position to give whatever inducements we can to our own investors for whatever capital we require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking for more every year.  That is the trouble.  Two years ago it was £75 million.  Another year it was £90 million and last year and the present year it is £100 million. It is going up all the time, and we are finding it difficult to get all the money at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked a question about what way this year's finances were going to work out.  We usually look at our finances in November and December.  We see what is coming in by way of revenue and what we are likely to be asked to spend for the rest of the year.  At that time, allowing for the ordinary buoyancy of revenue which was apparent at the time, I thought the deficit would be £5 million.  It may be less.  There will be a deficit and a fairly substantial deficit. It may be less for two reasons.  One is that some of the status claims which I thought would be paid this year cannot be paid because they were slow about going to arbitration.  They must be paid next year.  The second reason is that it is very hard to predict income in March.  Usually there is an abnormal income in March.  I do not know if it will be abnormal this year, <Col N="1519" /> but it usually is.  There will be a deficit of a fairly substantial nature.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about the balance of payments.  I must admit I have been very worried about the balance of payments over the years and the only consoling factor is that other indicators are generally favourable.  I am advised by the financiers and economists that the signs, on the whole, are good. There is no reason for complacency, however, and I think I can safely say the Government is not complacent.  We are keeping a very close watch on the position.  My advisers tell me: &ldquo;We will keep a close watch on it, and probably everything will work out all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon quoted figures for last year and this year.  If I remember our forecast properly, we expected to reach a peak this year or next year and to go down again.  We may perhaps reach the figure we indicated at the time as the average over six or seven years.  I hope we will but, as Deputies are aware, it is very hard to realise these forecasts exactly.  I do not think any other points were raised and I will leave it at that for the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to raise by £4 million the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow for the performance of its statutory functions. The existing limit on such borrowings is £24 million and the Board has to date borrowed £23,796,557.  Of this £20.85 million was advanced from the Central Fund; Messrs.  Guinness advanced £¾ million.</P>
      <P>The Board raised £2 million by an issue of stock to the public in May last year and the balance was raised by borrowings from an insurance company and the Board's Superannuation Fund.  Borrowings to date will finance the Board's developments until late this summer.  The Board has already repaid £2,568,915 of the advances from the Central Fund and £184,917 of the loan from Messrs.  Guinness.</P>
      <P>The main output of Bord na Móna is determined by the requirements of peat for electricity generation.  It is Government policy that all bogs which are economically usable for electricity generation are developed for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna supplies sod peat for the electricity generating stations at Portarlington, Allenwood and Lanesboro which have a total generating capacity of 97.5 megawatts.  No further sod peat generating stations are planned.  Milled peat is supplied for electricity generation to the stations at Ferbane, Rhode, Shannonbridge and Bellacorick which have a total installed capacity of 250 megawatts.  The normal annual fuel requirements of these stations are 565,000 tons of sod peat and 1,860,000 tons of milled peat. Sod peat and milled peat requirements for electricity generation at present <Col N="1521" /> account for some 75 per cent of the total sales of Bord na Móna.  Two further milled peat generating units are planned, viz. a 40 megawatt extension at Lanesboro to come into operation early in 1966 and a 40 megawatt unit at Shannonbridge to come into operation about 1972.  When these two additional units are in operation the total requirements of milled peat for electricity generation will be 2,420,000 tons per annum.</P>
    <P>Generation of electricity from native resources as a whole, that is to say hydro, peat and native coal, amounted to about 62.5 per cent of total output in the year ended 31st March, 1964.  In that year 35.6 per cent of the total number of units supplied to the system was provided by peat-fired stations.  Peat-fired stations now represent about 36 per cent of the total generating capacity of the ESB. The development by existing methods of our peat resources for electricity generation will be completed by about 1972 when the second of the two additional peat-fired units is expected to be in operation.  As by far the greater proportion of new generating plant planned to come into operation in the meantime will be based on oil, the proportion of total generating capacity of the ESB based on peat will have fallen to about 25 per cent by 1972.</P>
    <P>In addition to the production of peat for electricity generation the Board produces annually about 330,000 tons of sod peat for general sale as well as about 700,000 tons of milled peat for briquette manufacture and 350,000 bales of moss peat.</P>
    <P>The development plans of Bord na Móna are set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The following are the main lines of expansion envisaged:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Firstly, there is the new briquette factory, estimated to cost £1.75 million to be built in the Shannonbridge area and which is planned to come into operation in about three years' time.  Production from the three existing factories in 1964-65 amounted to 295,000 tons. The Board expect that the output of <Col N="1522" /> these factories can be increased to 320,000 tons per annum.  The proposed new factory is planned to produce 135,000 tons per annum which would give a total output from the four factories of 455,000 tons per annum or the equivalent of 300,000 tons of coal.  The quantity of milled peat required for the production of briquettes at the rate of 450,000 tons per annum would be about 1,200,000 tons per annum;</P>
    <P>(ii)  The second main item is bog development estimated to cost £1.70 million.  The decision to divert some 300,000 tons per annum of the milled peat output of the Blackwater-Garryduff group of bogs to supply the fourth briquette factory has necessitated the postponement of the second 40 MW generating unit at the Shannonbridge station which has been planned for 1968-69 and which would have absorbed this output. The Athlone group of bogs now being developed to supply this unit will not be in full production until about 1972.  This is the last remaining bog area suitable for development for milled peat production by the Board's present methods.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The third item is the Board's second moss peat factory which is being erected near Portlaoise.  This factory, which will cost about £300,000, is expected to commence production during the coming summer and will enable the existing output of about 350,000 bales per annum to be doubled.  Deputies will be aware that about 80 per cent of the present moss peat production is exported.  It is expected that by far the greater part of the output of the new factory will also be exported.</P>
    <P>The balance of the Board's capital requirements is in respect of increased working capital necessitated by the expanding scale of the Board's activities and of the cost of miscellaneous minor works.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill for the raising, from £24 million to £28 million, of the existing limit on borrowings by the Board will enable the Board to continue its development work for <Col N="1523" /> another three years or so when the House will have a further opportunity of reviewing the position.  On the basis of the present estimates a further £2 million borrowing will probably be necessary at that stage for the completion of the Board's development programme.</P>
    <P>The average number of persons employed by Bord na Móna at present is 5,300.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of this Bill is being taken to repeal section 4 of the Turf Development Act, 1963.  This section provides that a contract fixing the remuneration, period of office, not exceeding five years, etc. of the Managing Director of Bord na Móna may be entered into with him by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the approval of the Government notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general provisions relating to appointment, terms of office, etc. of members of the Board under the Act under which the Board was established.  This section was intended to give the Managing Director at the time security of office.  No contract has been made with the present Managing Director. In practice, the Managing Director is appointed by the Government for periods of five years at a time and this is a more convenient administrative arrangement than a formal contract. The provision is, therefore, unnecessary and is being revoked.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has served the nation well and I am sure I am expressing the feeling of the House in congratulating the management and staff of the Board on the success of their undertaking and the efficient manner in which their operations are conducted. The success of the Board's first public stock issue in May last, which Deputies will recall was heavily over-subscribed, reflects the confidence of the public in the Board's undertaking.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I suppose, necessary that Bord na Móna should have the additional money required. We must agree that the Board has done <Col N="1524" /> well and, in particular, that the briquette factories will prove to be the success that we on this side of the House believed they would be and that there is an even greater opening for them than for any other products of the Board.  Of course, Board na Móna have a sheltered position in that they have a guaranteed market for much of their products through the ESB. While that is an advantage to them, it increases the cost of electricity on the other hand, but, I suppose, the Government having embarked on this plan a long time ago, we cannot now call a halt to it.  I do not want to cramp style in any way but I would urge the Minister to impress upon Bord na Móna the advantage to be derived from increased production of briquettes.  The Bord na Móna briquettes are a clean, very efficient and convenient form of home-produced fuel and have replaced to a very great extent imported coal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the number employed in Bord na Móna is slightly over 5,000.  There is a very large capital investment in the industry and the employment content appears comparatively small.  It is a good thing, of course, that Bord na Móna provides employment for that number.  I should like the Minister to give us a breakdown of the figure for employment because many employees of the Board are engaged on seasonal work and their employment is not continuous in a great number of cases.  I am aware that at several Bord na Móna production plants&mdash;not confined to Longford, Westmeath, Athlone or Shannonbridge &mdash;there are long periods of unemployment for a great number of personnel. The workers work hard for a certain period and earn good money.  Some method should be devised to provide whole-time employment for them.  I would again ask the Minister to give a breakdown of the figure of 5,300, giving the length of time in the year for which they are employed.  The capital investment is very great for that employment content and I am very much afraid that in many cases the employment is not whole-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that Bord na Móna has done a very fine job in levelling <Col N="1525" /> and draining the bogs upon which it operates.  Unfortunately, the farms through which the outlets run become filled up with turf mould very quickly. Around Ballymahon there are a large number of farmers who complain that Bord na Móna has failed to give them the protection they need.  In those cases where drainage is required, the Board of Works say that it is not part of the Inny drainage scheme but is a matter for Bord na Móna, while Bord na Móna deny responsibility and suggest that the farmers should avail of the Land Project to remedy the matter.  Those responsible for the Land Project take the view that the work involved would be more extensive than would come under their auspices.  I have been in correspondence with Bord na Móna and the Office of Public Works.  I got no satisfaction.  The farmers in the district have suffered considerable hardship.</P>
    <P>The peat moss produced by Bord na Móna is a very valuable commodity but I do not think its value for various purposes is sufficiently advertised. Considerable quantities are exported. Of course, every export trade is valuable even though it might not be as economic as one would like.  The merits of peat moss should be more widely advertised.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says that the public subscribed generously to Bord na Móna, I want to say that it is as if they were subscribing to the National Loan because it is a Government-guaranteed stock.  There is no reason why, if people had money, they would not put it into Bord na Móna.  It is a gilt-edged security.  It is not evidence of great faith in Bord na Móna; it is evidence of confidence in the security of the State.  That security of the State will always remain high, provided proper use is made of the finances secured by the various methods now adopted&mdash;loans, Prize Bonds and the new method announced by the Minister for Finance today.  Let us hope by all these methods the necessary capital will be provided for the development of the country in the way we all desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not completely agree with Deputy MacEoin's suggestion that the public subscribed to the loan because it was backed by the Government, because, as the Minister has said, the loan was heavily over-subscribed and, clearly, that was a measure of confidence in Bord na Móna.  There have been loans floated, not only by companies of this kind but by the Government, which have not been over-subscribed or subscribed in full measure and it is not fair to detract from the tremendous achievement of Bord na Móna since its inauguration.</P>
      <P>For that reason, naturally, to a person like myself who has advocated for so long an extension of public ownership&mdash;public ownership and control, if possible, and certainly public ownership&mdash;of enterprises of this kind, it is a great satisfaction to find such a doctrinaire conservative as the Minister, a politician, saying such nice things about Bord na Móna.  Of course, with some luck, at the end of his tenure of office, it is quite conceivable that we will find that he has become a fullblown socialist, advocating this type of development in connection with the really difficult jobs in the country, but that is possibly hoping for too much.</P>
      <P>The arguments against public ownership are completely knocked aside by the success of the ESB and Bord na Móna which have proved themselves particularly suitable to the economy of the country over the past 30 years.  If ever there has been shown clearly the way in which we should have developed our economy in the past half-century, it is shown in the success of this type of enterprise, a particularly difficult one which needed great faith on the part of the then Ministers.  They must have known all the arguments we now hear about the difficulty of making a State enterprise work, the lack of technical know-how, the lack of technicians and technocrats, the lack of sales promotion organisations, export know-hows, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect the Taoiseach displayed a strangely schizoid personality: on the one hand, in his great belief in <Col N="1527" /> the development of this type of enterprise and, on the other hand, in his tremendous lack of faith in the financing by the State of the expansion of productive investment, textiles, and so on.  He seems to have an extraordinary lack of faith in the application of the principle upon which Bord na Móna was founded, land, labour and capital, the three classic foundation stones upon which one builds up any such enterprise.  These have been wonderfully and successfully integrated in Bord na Móna.  All the things which we were told could not exist and could not be found were brought forward. Our own people came forward from the secondary and vocational schools and the universities and have contributed to the great success of this organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's conservative beliefs seem to be particularly highlighted by the contrast between his great praise, justifiable praise, of Aer Lingus, the ESB, and the appalling record which he would have to admit to in regard to the activities of private enterprise in the country over the same period.</P>
    <P>How long does one remain impenetrable to the lesson which should be learned from this type of organisation? They undertook an extremely difficult job in these barren wastelands in the various parts of rural Ireland.  It needed courage to spend money on such projects while being told that you were losing money in bogholes.  It is to the credit of the Ministers at that time that they had the courage to go ahead and spend the money because the record now shows they spent it wisely.</P>
    <P>The great question here, as in Great Britain, is to what extent we should continue to depend on our own resources. I am naturally in favour of continuing to use our resources to the greatest extent possible but in Britain there is an economic argument against the use of coal, that oil can be obtained much more easily and is a sounder proposition economically.  The possibility now has to be faced that nuclear-powered stations will replace even oil. I wonder to what extent is Bord na <Col N="1528" /> Móna facing up to that problem.  I suppose the time when we shall run out of workable resources is foreseeable but our workable resources will probably last long enough to bring us into the period in which we can use oil or nuclear-powered machines for the development of electricity and power.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why ESB power will fall from 35½ per cent to 25 per cent?  To the extent that the generating capacity of the ESB is based on peat, does that mean we have taken a decision in regard to the working out of the peat resources or that we realise that peat may not be as economical as oil?  Are we switching over to oil, or, more important, are we switching over to coal?  Why is there a reduction?</P>
    <P>What is the general policy of Bord na Móna in relation to cutaway bog? I have heard from time to time there were various schemes for the use of the turf and then the development of afforestation and other schemes which might make the cutaway bogs capable of producing some useful crop, whether ordinary crops or trees.  Is there any general plan in regard to the use of these cutaway bogs or is there just haphazard development according to the whim of whoever happens to be in occupation at the time?</P>
    <P>When the Minister refers to the areas suitable for milled peat development by the Board's present methods, does he believe that better and more efficient methods are available and that the production of milled peat is likely to be very much increased?  The amount of money needed for the present programme is about £1 million a year.  The Minister says we can look into the question in three or four years' time and, more than likely, vote another £2 million, making a total of £6 million over a seven-year period.  I am quite certain everybody is delighted to agree to the expenditure of this money and I hope it will be used as wisely in the future as it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>One of the very satisfactory results of Bord na Móna activity, again rather like Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, is the fact that it has developed the export <Col N="1529" /> side of its enterprise.  Peat moss is a very valuable crop and it appears to have an almost insatiable market.  It is a remarkable achievement that they have been able not only to supply the home market with briquettes or machine turf but have also been able to carry out this job which most of the private enterprise firms have virtually completely failed to do in the past 20 or 30 years.  The creation of substantial exports of peat moss is again a refutation of the old ideas which have been current&mdash;and I must confess that I hear them rather less and less now&mdash;the idea that publicly-owned enterprise would mean that it would be stagnant, unenterprising and lack drive and dynamism.  That is all so much eyewash now.  It is now generally accepted that if you really want to organise society efficiently, the best way to do it is under public ownership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I like the old-fashioned diehard socialism of Deputy Dr. Browne.  It gives me a kind of comfortable feeling to know that there are still some people in the world who recall a comfortable memory.  He often reminds me of the legitimate child of Keir Hardie and Keir Hardie in his cloth cap was a person I greatly admired, a person for whom I felt a great measure of affection and admiration, and perhaps I might say the same of Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
      <P>I think the test in all these matters no longer relates to the old-fashioned doctrinaire question whether enterprise is controlled by the State or controlled privately.  What matters is how best can it serve the society of which it constitutes a part; and that service appears to me to be how best can it contribute to the welfare of the individual whom it serves directly by providing employment and, indirectly, by reducing the cost of production so that the rewards of those who work in production can be maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> If this country is to develop industrially one of the most urgent needs we have, if our industrial standards are to conform to those of other countries, is cheap power.  Every increase in the cost of power carries with it the necessity of lower wages for the people who use that power in the production of end products for sale at home or for export.  I want to see the people who use the power getting the maximum return in wages.  Therefore, when I see sources of power tapped, I want to ask myself is this the sort of power best calculated to give those who are to spend their lives using it the maximum return.  That is why I object to the control of power by private enterprise in places like the United States of America and elsewhere because experience has taught that, when the control of power is a question of profit, it usually ends up in those who have to use the power paying more for it and that means a diminution of their rewards.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the House quite frankly a statistic we ought to have.  We have now operating turf-powered stations, oil-powered stations and coal-powered stations all belonging to the same period of construction. There are one or two such stations working at maximum load capacity. You have these things contemporaneously in existence to make just comparisons.  I should like to ask the Minister to tell us (1) how many million units are generated each year from turf and (2) comparing the most up-to-date turf-powered station we have with the most up-to-date oilburning station we have, which is the one in Cork, I think, what is the difference between the cost of generating electricity by turf and the cost of generating electricity by oil or coal?</P>
    <P>These are three figures we ought to have and only the Minister or the Electricity Supply Board can supply them because there are certain complex calculations that require to be made to get a fair comparison, calculations one cannot make with the information made available in the annual reports of the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna unless one has a technological training to estimate the relative cost <Col N="1531" /> of generating electricity in a station which is operating to only 50 per cent of its capacity as compared with the station operating to 100 per cent of its capacity.  It is within the Minister's reach to find a comparable basis and state with statistical accuracy what the comparative costs are.</P>
    <P>It amuses me sometimes to experience the doctrinaire soul of Deputy Dr. Browne hugging itself at the apparent success of State enterprise; but, in these moments of ecstasy, he always banishes from his mind the aspect of monopoly.  The State enterprise operating a monopoly, particularly of this kind, cannot fail to make a profit because the monopoly simply determines the cost, passes on its end product to, in this case, the Electricity Supply Board and the Electricity Supply Board pays for the end product whatever is required to meet the cost of Bord na Móna, plus whatever margin of profit is agreed upon.  Any <i>entrepreneur</i> operating a monopoly of this kind would make a fortune out of it but Parliament would, of course, very properly see that they would not permit a monopoly of such kind to remain in the hands of an <i>entrepreneur.</i></P>
    <P>When we operate in this connection a body such as Bord na Móna, employing 5,200 people, using the bulk of its production for the generation of power by selling it to the Electricity Supply Board, we ought to ask ourselves quite frankly what the cost is and, having determined what it costs, make up our minds with equal honesty as to whether we think we are getting good value for the expenditure involved. In taking that decision, we have to have regard not only to the amount of employment provided&mdash;managerial, manual, clerical&mdash;but we have also to consider the amount of transport employed and the value of the residual lands which will be made available when the bog has been cut away.</P>
    <P>In that connection there is an important matter to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred, though I do not think he realised the significance of his reference.  It is urgently necessary that there should be some intelligent plan as to how you will use the cutaway <Col N="1532" /> bog.  The Minister would be very well advised to consult the Peatland Research Station, now controlled by the Agricultural Research Institute, at Glenamoy because he will find that, in accordance with the final user of these cutaway bogs, different treatments may be necessary.  It may be suitable in order to use them for forestry to cut the bog away down to the gravel, whereas, on the other hand, if you intend to use them for the enlargement of agricultural holdings, it may be wiser to suspend denudation of the peat earlier than you would if you intended to use the bog exclusively for forestry.  These are matters that should be examined and determined now in good time.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a moment on the success of the briquette factories. I remember well when we took the decision to build the first of these factories at, I think, Ferbane.  I remember wondering, when we made an investment of, I think, £1¼ million in the first of them, whether we would ever be able to sell the output.  We took that chance.  I remember we took the decision in principle to build two of them, once we were satisfied there was a market for the briquettes. That is one of the operations of Bord na Móna which is conducted in a highly competitive field and which is earning profit.</P>
    <P>I have a kind of feeling that the socialist type of mind, represented by Deputy Dr. Browne, thinks there is something almost immoral in earning profits; whereas I feel the highest tribute you can pay to a State-operated monopoly of this kind is to be able to demonstrate that they can pay good wages, provide good employment and still make a profit sufficient to amortise their capital and to replace their machinery.  That, I think, is true of the briquette manufacturing operations of Bord na Móna.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister what proportion of the briquette output is now exported and what proportion it is anticipated it will be able to export in the future.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is sometimes a bad thing and sometimes a good thing to have too long a memory.  I think Deputy de Valera will share the recollection with <Col N="1533" /> me that, when Bord na Móna was started, Deputy Aiken, the present Minister for External Affairs, was largely responsible for it.  I remember his declaring in this House that he was satisfied that sod peat sold in sacks would yet represent the second greatest industry in this country.  My brief comment on that occasion was that I ventured to prophesy that at the end of two or three years we would not even have the sacks, which of course proved true.</P>
    <P>However, the machine turf which the company is producing is a first-class fuel.  But, mark you, this House should not be quite indifferent to the fact that the extent to which Bord na Móna has gone in selling machine-won turf as a domestic fuel throughout the country has had its repercussions.  I have never been quite able to make up my mind whether the result has been wholly satisfactory or not.  Most of us who represent rural constituencies will remember that a great many small farmers supplemented their incomes by the sale of turf.  They used to cut turf and sell it in the adjoining towns.  In Cavan and Monaghan, it was not so much cut turf as mud turf that was produced, and that was a fuel of the same quality as the machine-won turf of Bord na Móna today.  But in the west, the north-west and the southwest, a great many small farmers supplemented their income by cutting turf and selling it in the adjoining towns.</P>
    <P>That trade has, of course, all disappeared. A good many small farmers feel the loss of that supplementary income.  It is true you have substituted automation for manual work.  How far that is socially desirable in the economy of our time is something which requires consideration and reflection. I do not think you could reverse the process now because, consciously or unconsciously, we destroyed that industry of cutting turf and selling it locally, and you probably would not get people to go back into it now because it is laborious.  But I do not believe we realised what we were doing when we made machine turf universally available as a domestic fuel.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> In regard to the success of the briquettes, in which I rejoice, there is one factor which requires examination and which might operate to restrict, or even diminish, the market for briquettes. That is the problem, which occurs from time to time, in which architects and fire officers complain about the incidence of chimney fires as a result of the deposit left by turf in chimneys which, I suppose, were primarily designed to burn coal or wood.  I cannot believe in the modern times in which we live that we cannot find some procedure whereby the soot of turf can be, so to speak, self-consumed.  I know you can buy various products you put in the fire which are supposed to gasify the soot deposits ordinarily found in the chimney.</P>
    <P>I imagine the research facilities available to Bord na Móna and to the Industrial Research Council should be able to devise some additive which would be introduced into the turf in the process of making the briquettes and which would operate to gasify or consume any deposits the turf tended to leave in the chimneys in its ordinary use as fuel.  It would be a great sales point for turf briquettes if we were in a position to say that these briquettes were free from the common complaint associated with turf fires and that they contained something which abolished the tarry soot which many architects and fire officers associate with the use of turf.</P>
    <P>Somebody here today spoke of atomic power creating an entirely new prospect.  I have repeatedly tried to find from the relevant Committees of the Council of Europe, who have access to the information available in most of the 15 member countries, what is the prospect of atomic power becoming economically competitive with the sources at present available to us &mdash; hydro, coal or oil.  So far, I have been wholly unable to get any reliable prognostication.  But I have read recently&mdash;and I should be glad to know if the Minister has any light to shed on this problem&mdash;in the United States of America they believe themselves within the past 12 months to have made a very dramatic break <Col N="1535" /> through in the use of atomic power for the economic production of energy. Bearing in mind the kind of capital sums that we are expending not only in regard to Bord na Móna but to the installation of electricity generating capacity, it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister now, from the sources he has at his disposal, to give us his estimate of when it is expected that atomic power will be available on a competitive basis with traditional sources of power.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting features about this is that the whole calculation, I understand, depends on the estimate that is made of the number of years which an atomic station can be expected to last.  If you take an estimate of 20 years, it is uneconomic; if you take an estimate of 30 years, it becomes economic; if you take an estimate of 35 years, it becomes highly competitive with traditional sources, or conventional sources of power, as they call them.  Nobody has yet been able to determine what is the appropriate period over which the capital invested should be written off and that is a matter on which I should like to hear the Minister if he has any guidance to give us.</P>
    <P>We will not object to the Second Reading of this Bill but I should like to know what the true comparison is between the cost of generating electricity we actually use and how far the preference we give to turf-produced energy or energy that could be produced from coal or oil increases the end cost of the energy used generally.</P>
    <P>It is vital to a country so undeveloped industrially as ours is, to realise how important cheap power is in the successful expansion of industry, how real a burden on our costings in export markets artificial prices for power could be, and what a very marked limitation on our diversification of industry any excess cost of power would involve us in.  We need to diversify and one of the best possible inducements over and above those which we are already supplying <Col N="1536" /> by way of loans, grants and tax exemption, to draw industry to this country, would be to be in a position to say we have the cheapest power in the world available for those who wish to use it.  It would be a difficult claim for us to make, bearing in mind countries like Scandinavia where the bulk of their power is drawn from hydro-electric sources, but the Minister will agree with me that it would be an inducement we would like to be in a position to offer and, the nearer we could get to such a claim, the better position we would be in to draw to this country new types of industries in which costings depend to a very large degree on the cost of the power they have to use.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna is one of the semi-State bodies which is doing a wonderful job, not alone because it is supplying solid fuel for generating stations but also because it is giving a tremendous amount of employment. We welcome any move which will help the Board to expand.  One thing which it is hard to understand sometimes is that we get so much of our power from stations where the power is generated by a fuel other than native fuel. Possibly my outlook may be different from that of other Deputies but I think because the fuel is produced in Ireland and because in the production of it the economy is assisted, the price is not the main point.  I suppose some time someone will be able to cost whether or not it would pay us better to scrap this type of generation by peat and have cheaper foreign fuel firing our generating stations with resultant unemployment, or whether we should try to expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I believe we should expand to the limit the Bord na Móna services as far as generating stations are concerned.  Even if it does cost more eventually, the State will gain; even if it means a certain subsidy, the State and the economy will gain.  We should do this rather than attempt to depend on all foreign fuel, let it be oil or solid fuel.  This is a point which cannot be stressed too much.  At present Bord na Móna is going more and more into mechanisation, with the <Col N="1537" /> result that of necessity it must be able to produce fuel, either sod peat or any other type of fuel, and despite rising wage costs, cheaper than it did some years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister was the Minister&mdash;I will not say responsible for, because I do not think he would accept responsibility&mdash;when this famous pension scheme was introduced some years ago and I see that some of the money is borrowed from the Pension Fund. That is fair enough but I suggest that if the pension scheme had been a decent one, there would have been a lot more money in the fund which the Board could lend to itself at a reasonable rate thereby having money available for the purpose of expanding.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister says that:</P>
    <P>The development by existing methods of our peat resources for electricity generation will be completed by about 1972 when the second of the two additional peat fired units is expected to be in operation.  As by far the greater proportion of new generating plant planned to come into operation in the meantime will be based on oil, the proportion of total generating capacity of the ESB based on peat will have fallen to about 25 per cent by 1972.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister mean by that that in fact we are coming towards the end of our resources as far as peat is concerned?  If that is so, the position is serious.  It is very serious for the midlands where the economy is based on the bog.</P>
    <P>Many years ago a person described as a bogman was supposed to be somebody who was not very far advanced, socially or otherwise.  The modern bogman is quite a technician in many ways and socially is as high as or higher than many workers in this country. It is true that, mainly through the fact that there were good industrial relations between the Board, particularly in the latter years, and the trade unions operating for the men, the rates of wages and conditions have improved very much.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement that the <Col N="1538" /> generating capacity of the ESB, based on peat, will have fallen to about 25 per cent by 1972 is a very serious matter: it is only less than seven years away.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some further information about this, or is there any way in which it can be counteracted?  With modern machinery the Board should be able to reassess the value of many of the bogs which they passed over in the early years as not big enough to work and, therefore, abandoned.  Some of them were used for sod peat for a short time and abandoned.  Some of them may still be used by local people for sod peat but if they are at all close to works which are in existence, I think every effort should be made to bring them into operation in conjunction with the existing works.</P>
    <P>The whole question of employment &mdash;I am concerned mainly with employment&mdash;with Bord na Móna is bound up in this.  While I said that we are prepared to give full support to any reasonable scheme for raising money in order to allow Bord na Móna to develop, if it means that they will go out of existence in a relatively short time or reduce very much the amount of work they are doing, the matter will have to be further considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the proportion of power derived from peat production. Consumption is going up. The total number of bogs are being employed.  There will have to be so much more oil power because there are not the bogs.  Therefore, the total amount of power derived from peat will fall in the future but that does not mean that the bogs will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's statement that the bogs are being used to full capacity but are there not bogs in the country which were tested by Bord na Móna many years ago and which are not being used because it was felt that they were too small? <Col N="1539" /> Can they not be tested again with the object of having them brought into line?</P>
      <P>The other point which the Minister might consider is that one of the snags in Bord na Móna employment is the fact that while they do employ a number of skilled operatives all the year round, they require, and will, I suppose, require for a considerable time, a big number of casuals in the turf harvest season and then, when they are finished with their harvest, there is no other employment available for those people.  Would the Minister again consider discussing with Bord na Móna this question of the utilisation of cutaway bog?  I am sure it can be used and, possibly, in years to come, the product of it might be used to continue the operations of Bord na Móna itself.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister in congratulating the staff of the Board on the excellent job they have done.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind that, from the top management right down to the lowest worker on the bogs, they are doing a work which can truly be described as of national importance. I only hope the Board will continue to do this work for very many years longer than the 25 years the Minister has mentioned.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the success of the first public issue of stock in May last was an example of the confidence of the public in the Board.  Let us hope that that confidence will continue. Finally, may I say to the Minister that, having had a couple of years to think over the matter, maybe he would again look at this awful pensions scheme which has been presented to the employees and see if something can be done about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly everybody agrees that Bord na Móna has done a good job of work and that the money allocated by this House was money well invested.  It was contended by some persons at the time that there was a high element of risk in advancing such large sums of money to a comparatively untested and inexperienced young Board.  Time, however, has borne out <Col N="1540" /> the fact that the type of development which Bord na Móna undertook has yielded good results.  Quite a number of us who come from areas where Bord na Móna operate will testify to that fact.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to desirable trends which could now be initiated by Bord na Móna.  One point concerned employment.  Indeed, one would readily agree with the point that employment by Bord na Móna is at best seasonal and that in bad years some of their employees are hard hit to keep going.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make&mdash;we are all well aware of it&mdash;is that, having regard to the type of work those men are engaged on, having regard to our peculiarity of climate, it is not very easy for the Board to make provision against risk of unemployment or intermittent employment during certain times of the year.  Accordingly, it would be very desirable that the whole matter would be examined so that if we were to have subsidiary development by the Board at least reasonable employment should be given constantly to employees who have rendered good service to date.</P>
      <P>The point was also made that one could contrast the activities of the Board nowadays with the type of private turf production which obtained in Ireland in years gone by, before the advent of Bord na Móna.  It is pointless at this stage to return to those days.  Times have changed and nowadays mechanisation has got to play its part to the full.  Were it not for the fact that such an organisation as Bord na Móna evolved during the years of transition we would be out of it completely now in so far as turf development is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to drainage by the Board.  I come from an area where in recent years Bord na Móna have developed a number of bogs but I am not aware that complaints from farmers involve the allegation that drainage activities by the Board have interfered with neighbouring farms in any way.  On the contrary, in recent years in the midlands the Board have developed a number of bogs and in so doing have carried out large-scale <Col N="1541" /> drainage to the mutual advantage of both the Board and the farming community in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that we should as far as possible foster home products. The point was made that the relative merits of the costings of oil, coal and turf should be examined in regard to the production of power.  Nobody will disagree with that argument; no one will contest the point that costings should be taken of all sources from which power might be expected to be derived, costings that would give some idea of the cost of the end product.  We must always bear in mind, however&mdash;I think Deputy Tully mentioned it&mdash;that we should, even at the risk of slightly higher costs, promote the development of our own resources.  That is to say, we should prefer power from the bogs or from our rivers, even if it resulted in higher cost, to power from imported products. Hardly anybody will contest the point that power at present in this country is comparatively cheap.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years Bord na Móna have been engaged in large-scale development and the current produced is reasonably priced, provided we can keep it going and providing Bord na Móna are able to guarantee output to the ESB and to the other concerns who buy power from them.  I do not wish to widen the scope of the debate.  Like other Deputies who have spoken, I trust the money the Board require will be forthcoming, whether it be in the shape of public issues or otherwise, so that the work of the Board, even on the smaller bogs, will continue until such time as all our bog and river resources are harnessed.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the House for the manner in which they welcomed the Bill.  I do not think I need follow Deputy Dr. Browne far in regard to the argument in connection with socialism and our attitude towards State companies.  My attitude is that there is no reason for the State to intervene unless the State can do a better job than private enterprise. It is simply a matter of argument between Deputy Dr. Browne, members of the Opposition and myself as to the occasions on which the State should intervene.</P>
      <P>I would not believe there is the faintest reason for nationalising the women's clothing business.  Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the fact that the CIO reports show deficiencies in private enterprise industries.  There are deficiencies in State industries all over the world.  In the women's clothing industry, for example, exports have grown from something like £50,000 in the early 1950's to over £6 million in the past year.  That is an illustration of private enterprise operating very successfully.  I doubt if Deputy Dr. Browne would nationalise the women's clothing industry even if he had the opportunity once he saw the objections to so doing.  I do not think I need go any further into this argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We intend to exploit all the economically usable bogs.  Bord na Móna gives employment and saves considerable sums in foreign exchange.  It is the policy of the Government, as I have said, to allow Bord na Móna to produce to the utmost on the basis that the price of the product is reasonable &mdash;that it is able to repay its capital <Col N="1543" /> and pay interest at the same time on the capital issued to it.  This it is doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully expressed the hope that we might find some other method of exploiting bogs that are regarded as unsuitable.  Bord na Móna is constantly examining new methods of exploitation. At the moment, the Board have reported to me that there are bogs to be developed and re-developed before 1972.  They have got to the end of their programme.  If they discover some better method of exploitation between now and 1972, there may be a change in the position.  We do not believe in subsidising Bord na Móna. We think it should repay interest and principal, and at the same time provide fuel for the public, where it competes with coal upon which we cannot impose a tariff from Great Britain, and supply the ESB at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the statement I made that the proportion of total power produced from turf will be reduced 25 per cent in future years. That does not mean that Bord na Móna will not go ahead.  In actual fact, in 1963-64 they produced 1.6 million tons of milled peat and in the next few years they hope to reach the figure of 2.4 million tons, assuming production will be increasing.  Of course, the consumption of electricity has also increased.  Rates have varied between eight, nine, ten and 11 per cent in the past few years and more power is to be produced.  A programme is being planned up to 1970-72 for the maximum use of our turf resources and equally for the construction of generating stations using oil.  It has been planned on a basis acceptable to both Bord na Móna and the ESB, so that Bord na Móna can continue to develop the bogs not yet prepared for production, knowing that there is a definite plan, so that the largest amount of steady employment that is possible can be given in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to cutaway bogs where Bord na Móna have ceased operations.  In actual fact, the area is very small, indeed, which would be suitable for use either as agricultural land or for forestry. <Col N="1544" /> There is a bog at Lyracrompane which, I understand, will be used for forestry.  That is the largest area of cutaway bog where Bord na Móna have ceased operations.  Bord na Móna and Foras Talúntais are investigating the possible development of bigger areas that will become available as the bogs become used up.  No decision has been arrived at.  As Deputies know, there are two alternatives. One is to provide agricultural land and make use of it, as has been revealed by some of the experiments at Glenamoy.  On the other hand, there is the alternative of planting unused bogs with trees, but that matter is for consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the valuable production of briquettes. Bord na Móna will expand production in the next four years, bearing in mind whatever marketing advice they can get as to demand and also bearing in mind changes in the various forms of fuel everywhere.  I think they have taken an optimistic but, nevertheless, realistic attitude in their planning for further briquette production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of chimney fires.  I understand that Bord na Móna briquettes do not give rise to chimney fires as a result of deposits left in chimneys.  I am glad to say I have had no complaints whatever from the public as a whole, so that the occurrence of chimney fires from briquettes must be pretty rare.  As the Deputy knows, there are various kinds of grates and stoves suitable for the burning of turf and the ordinary grates can be adapted for that purpose. Existing grates can be altered and there are on the market at the present time a number of grates suitable for turf burning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon pointed out that the cost of electricity from turf was a matter for consideration and that we should be prepared to give figures in that regard.  Actually, I have given the figures to the House on a number of occasions but for Deputy Dillon's benefit I shall repeat them, and I shall quote comparative costs for the production of electricity using various types of fuel for the year ending 31st <Col N="1545" /> March, 1963: cost per unit sent out from the Shannon hydro station, 0.377d; the Erne hydro station, 0.544d; the Liffey hydro station, 0.807d; the Lee hydro station 1.056d; the Clady hydro station, 1.715d.</P>
    <P>The cost for the production of electricity from sod peat stations is: Lanesborough, 1.137d; Portarlington, 1.200d.; Allenwood, 1.140d.  Four 5 MW stations in west of Ireland, 1.849d. With regard to the milled peat stations, the cost of milled peat is somewhat lower than it is from the sod peat stations: Ferbane, 1.161d; Rhode, 1.083d; In contrast to that, the cost of electricity from the Ringsend coal-oil station is 0.785d, and from the Marina station, 0.839d.  The cost from the North Wall oil station is 1.652d.  As Deputies can see, water power will always be the cheapest.  After that comes coal and oil, followed by milled peat and then by soft peat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the necessity for maintaining the lowest possible costs for electricity for industry.  It is very hard to make exact comparisons into the cost of electricity because of the different ways tariffs are prepared in different countries but I can say, without contradiction, that the cost of electricity in this country compares favourably with the cost in Great Britain.  That is as far as I can say. Deputy Dillon will be aware, of course, that industries commencing in this country get a grant from An Foras Tionscal and exemptions are given from income tax on profits from exported goods.  I have not received a complaint that the cost of electricity is inhibiting industrial development.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Tully referred to employment and the fact that unfortunately employment on the bogs is seasonal.  Deputy MacEoin asked for figures for the breakdown of the various numbers employed.  Last year I gave this as 5,300.  The answer is a minimum of 4,000 people are employed all the year round and a maximum of 6,000 are employed at the height of the season.  The average of 5,300 represents the evaluation of those two sets of figures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> Deputy Dillon asked about exports of briquettes.  Bord na Móna exported last year 22,000 tons of briquettes and plan to increase exports to 50,000 tons a year so they are making progress in that regard. In the year 1963-64, there was an export of milled peat to Great Britain for use in various industrial applications amounting to 9,690 tons, including milled peat admixed with coal for the production of superior class coke.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear that.  Deputy Dillon asked about atomic power.  The progress in regard to atomic power stations is quite evident and every now and then we hear of a break-through in relation to production costs.  We do not believe it is possible that an atomic power station will be opened in this country for at least ten years, and possibly longer.  I understand one of the major problems is that atomic reaction must operate for 24 hours a day on full load.  Therefore, we would have to have a very high consumption before any present atomic reaction could possibly be remunerative. I might add that the ESB in keeping a careful watch on all developments in the atomic field and the House can be confident a careful watch is being kept on development in regard to that matter.</P>

      <P>That is a very bland reply, but it does not conceal the fact that the Minister does not know.  I am in great sympathy with the Minister, if he does not know.  What is the ordinary machinery of the law for suit at the instance of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to go through the Attorney General's office. It is felt wise administratively that the Minister should initiate the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the administrative reason is.  I know there is a general principle that prosecutions at the instance of the Government are conducted by the Attorney General and, as we all know, he is supposed to be the custodian of civil rights, utterly independent of the administrative control of the Government for the time being.  The Minister is part of the Executive.  On the question of a prosecution, the case is reported to the <Col N="1549" /> Attorney General and, on the facts set out, he determines whether or not a prosecution should be initiated.  Not infrequently the view of the Attorney General is at variance with the view of the Executive, either in determining that a prosecution should take place or should not take place.  Is there any grave reason why we should depart from that practice?  It seems to me to be a rather casual explanation to say it is very convenient administratively. This is a departure from the normal, is it not?</P>

This is not going out of line with practice. It is bringing this machinery into line with civil aviation and navigation legislation.</P>

      <P>This is giving effect to an international agreement and an international document, and surely if an offence is committed, the Attorney General should decide whether or not to prosecute?  I do not accept that it is the same as another Minister prosecuting someone for not putting on warble fly dressing, or something like that.  This is a different matter, and it is a matter in which there are serious issues of principle at stake.  Does it mean the Minister can employ solicitor and counsel to act in his name?

I do not think this is an unique case by any means.  I am open to correction on that.  It is hard not to use the same type of words as Deputy Dillon used but they do not mean a lot, and I am trying to look for words that mean something.  I take it that in the past there have been occasions when this procedure has been used. There are also common form cases brought at the suit of the Attorney General, but there are special circumstances that bring this into the category which is brought at the suit of the Minister.  I do not think there is anything extraordinary about it at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a Minister who constitutes part of a Government who are constantly distributing advice to all Parties in the Opposition to do their homework, it seems a little bit of an anachronism that these zealots for homework are obliged to say: &ldquo;We just forgot.&rdquo;  All I can say is that hereafter they should do their homework. I suspect that the Minister rambled into the House with a Bill thrust into his hand, read his brief, and rambled out again.  He rambles in again now with two amendments, not realising the astonishing appearance he presents. He has just forgotten.  One of his colleagues rambled in here with a Succession Bill and told us it was the beloved of his soul.  He read his brief and the whole House blew up, and he has been shedding lumps of the Succession Bill all over the country since. The reason was that he had not done his homework.  He just read his brief and he did not realise, until his attention had been directed to it, that no sane Legislature in the world would enact the legislation he had brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time the Minister's dilemma is not that he has introduced a revolutionary principle, but that he has simply forgotten to mention in the text of the Bill presented to the House something which he says is quite common form, and which he meant to have in the Bill.  All I can say is that the Minister should do his homework, because unlike us&mdash;I do not mean this in any offensive sense; I think every Minister of State should be adequately remunerated&mdash;he is remunerated for doing his homework.  We in the Opposition receive appropriate remuneration but we do not get special remuneration for doing our homework. We think our Ministers should do their homework, and I think it <Col N="1552" /> right to deprecate the practice of Ministers rambling in with Bills, reading briefs which they have not adequately studied, and galloping in later to say they want to put into the Bill, by amendment, something which was forgotten when the Bill was being drafted.  They might forget their homework occasionally but it should not be a normal occurrence.</P>

      <P>Section 12, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 13 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>The references in subsections (1) and (2) of section 62 of the Principal Act to that Act shall be construed as including references to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another legal matter, and again the amendment is put down simply with the object of inserting a new section amending section 62 of the 1936 Act which makes provision in regard to the jurisdiction of offences committed under that Act.  Section 62 provides (a) that offences under the Act will be regarded as having been committed <Col N="1553" /> in the place in which the offender may, for the time being, be. Ordinarily, jurisdiction is limited either territorially or in relation to the type of offence.  For example, a district court will deal with summary offences committed within its own district.  In the case of aircraft offences, greater flexibility is necessary and the effect of section 62 (1) is that the court, having jurisdiction at the place where the offender is apprehended, will have jurisdiction over his offence, regardless of where it was committed.  It is obviously necessary to have some kind of arrangement like this for matters relating to air services and to offences under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is the further matter that the Minister for Justice may, by order, provide as to the courts in which proceedings may be taken for enforcing any claim under the Act and may, in particular, provide for conferring jurisdiction in such proceedings on courts exercising Admiralty jurisdiction and applying to such proceedings the rules of practice and procedure applicable to proceedings in Admiralty.  Admiralty jurisdiction in Ireland is vested in the High Court, except in Cork where the Circuit Court may act in such cases. The Admiralty was originally a branch of the Courts specialising in transport law and certain judges of the High Court still specialise in this law.  This provision means that the Minister for Justice can consider claims under the Act as special cases and, as such, refer them to the High Court where they will be dealt with by judges with specialised knowledge of the laws applicable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice can also revoke any orders under this section and in the usual way, I understand, he confers with the Chief Justice before making any order under the section so that the Chief Justice's views may be ascertained before any change is made in the area of jurisdiction of any court.  The effect of the new section will be to extend the rules outlined above to cover also the jurisdiction of offences under the present Bill.  I am afraid it was another case of having omitted to apply certain legal provisions to the provisions of the new Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have put it briefly by saying: &ldquo;This is another error of omission.&rdquo;  The fact is that he has discovered that he had forgotten to make the appropriate clauses of the Principal Act applicable to matters provided for in this Bill.  All I can say to him, through the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is: pray, do your homework hereafter but, in the circumstances, we are prepared to repair your error of omission.</P>

      <P>With great respect to my leader, I object to this. This again is legislation by reference. There is no reason why the Bill should not have said that such and such a section of the 1936 Act &ldquo;is hereby repealed and the following section substituted.&rdquo; Every Deputy heard the Minister's long statement setting out the consequences of this amendment and we now find this important amendment is brought in by simply saying: &ldquo;The references in subsections (1) and (2) of section 62 of the Principal Act shall be construed as including references to this Act.&rdquo;  It is as clear as mud.  One must get the other Act and re-read it.</P>
      <P>I object to this procedure completely. I have objected, since I came into the House, no matter what Government were in office, to legislation by reference.  It is completely wrong. Yet, they expect ordinary citizens or people affected by the measure to do their homework and when an offence is committed, they will refer you to such and such a section where it is set out.  The Minister has said what the effect of this will be in a fairly elaborate way but I think this business of legislation by reference is unfair, unreasonable and unparliamentary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make two or three observations on this Estimate.  One is that I am concerned about a situation, in which I believe the Minister sympathises with me, that relates to a serving soldier who contracts a disease while in the service and as a consequence thereof is released from the Service on grounds of ill-health.  The illness is not directly attributable to his service.  Nevertheless, he enters the Army as a man in the whole of his health.  He falls ill. The Army determines that the nature of his illness is such that he is unlikely thereafter to be able to endure the rigours of Army life, and they let him go.  That chap goes home and, as a result of the illness, he may be unable to do heavy work for years.</P>
      <P>I recognise that some principle must be established founded on the principle that is in existence that where a soldier's illness is directly attributable to his Army service, he should be entitled to permanent pension so long as he is disabled, but where a soldier's illness is not directly attributable to his Army service, I think it is a hardship to turn him out and simply say: &ldquo;Go home now&rdquo; and it is not in line with the practice in the Civil Service.  The practice in the public service is that if a member of the Civil Service falls ill of a disease which is not in any way attributable to his service, he is on full pay for six months and he is on half pay for six months, and then if there is no prospect of his recovering, he is released from the service, but usually there is a very humane approach and he is given the credit of the longest possible period of sick leave before this machinery begins to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see, when we take a young chap into the Army, that he is not entitled to at least the same consideration and it would make a great difference <Col N="1558" /> to a chap who comes home to a country home sick, if he were in a position to say to his parents, or whoever he was coming home to, that he was on full pay for the first six months and on half pay for the next six months but at any rate for the next 12 months he would not be a burden upon them.</P>
    <P>I want to urge upon the Minister that the principle exists and is accepted throughout the whole public service. The financial burden on the Department of Finance would be microscopic, but it would be a very genuine evidence of interest in and solicitude for the ordinary soldier's welfare that such provision should be made.</P>
    <P>I have the uncomfortable feeling that the zeal of the Department of Defence for the protection of the Exchequer is so great that there does tend to spread through the Army a feeling that money counts a great deal more than just treatment of the ordinary soldier and I am quite certain that that does not represent the feeling of Deputies.  I think it is a great mistake to allow that atmosphere to grow.  The feeling on all sides of the House would be that we do not think a serving soldier should be treated with that cold detachment which a strict Treasury approach would justify.  We ought to recognise that serving soldiers are very directly in the service of the State and that this House in their regard represents the State.  The soldiers are in a very special sense the public servants of the State as distinct from the Government and the more we do to fortify and strengthen that view, the better I believe it is for the Army and the better it is for the community which the Army serves.</P>
    <P>I am often struck by the fact that the splendid tradition of discipline in our Army is such that they accept philosophically a great many vexatious regulations which other branches of the public service have machinery for remedying through their present machinery of arbitration and conciliation. It is manifestly not possible to introduce arbitration and conciliation into the armed services of the State but our inability to make that kind of provision for the serving soldiers ought to put upon us here a corresponding <Col N="1559" /> sense of obligation that we should be peculiarly solicitous to see that any unreasonable handicap applying to their service is recognised and remedied by us as promptly as it would be if the machinery of arbitration were available to the serving soldier.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make the case that I regard the Department of Defence as being inhuman and so forth.  The Minister for Defence is, perhaps, too much directed by the Treasury approach to the Army.  He has an obligation to constitute himself a more aggressive champion of the rights of the serving soldier as against the Treasury than it appears he has done in the past. In the specific case to which I refer, I suggest the Minister should say that any soldier who becomes ill while in the service of the State, if his illness is not directly attributable to his service, should be entitled to treatment not less generous than that which is habitually accorded to a civil servant.</P>
    <P>I was shocked recently when the Minister read out the answer to a question put down by a Deputy as to whether it was true that serving soldiers in married quarters in barracks in Dublin had to get power plugs installed at their own expense in the married quarters which they inhabit because it was not an Army practice to provide power plugs in the married quarters of the Army in the city of Dublin.  I do not believe there is a Deputy in this House or a rational person in the country who believes there is any authority here setting accommodation to tenants anywhere, other than oneroom tenement houses, who would expect the tenant to take up his residence without a power plug.  Just imagine a woman with a family of children and a husband, who cannot use an electric kettle, who cannot use an electric heater in her room where there are children going to bed or where a baby may be sick.  Think of all the uses that an ordinary person makes of a power plug and the convenience it is to have it and the inconvenience it is to be without it.</P>
    <P>These are the little things that make <Col N="1560" /> service in the Army exasperating not only to the serving soldier but to the officers who want to feel that they are making proper provision for the men who are serving under them.  Some of the barracks in which we are housing soldiers at the present time were built before the Crimean war.  Doubtless there have been adaptations made to them but buildings over 100 years old require a great deal of adaptation before they become agreeable surroundings in which to raise a family.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is unreasonable and unrealistic to ask married soldiers to take up residence in married quarters where there is not as elementary a convenience as an electric power plug.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that what may appear small matters all mount up into the kind of evidence which carries conviction to a soldier's mind that those who employ him are not much concerned with his welfare and, what is worse, must carry conviction to the minds of officers who resent that kind of treatment of their men, that their views are not given the kind of consideration which the officers of the Army should be entitled to.</P>
    <P>I cannot doubt that these matters have been brought to the attention of the Minister for Defence by the Chief of Staff or by members of the Army Council, and I hope that hereafter the Minister will constitute himself a more aggressive champion of the Army in getting these amenities for the men which make all the difference between treating them like human beings and treating them like robots.  There is nobody, as far as I know, in this House who feels detached from or indifferent to the Army.  I am perfectly convinced that any Minister for Defence who asserts himself against the Minister for Finance in matters of this kind will find that he will have support from every side of the House in remedying such oversights.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Subhead AA of this Estimate on which I should like to ask the Minister for further particulars. It relates to military educational courses and visits and makes provision for £12,000.  I do not know if that is the annual provision in this Estimate <Col N="1561" /> for staff courses abroad for the officers of our Army.  There is a great danger in our circumstances of an Army of a small island State such as we are becoming more and more cut off from world developments in military science in a time such as that in which we live.</P>
    <P>Almost every weapon system and every aviation system begins to be obsolescent on the day it leaves the drawing board, so rapid is the development in military science in recent years.  Unless our Army is kept in constant contact with developments of the most up-to-date military powers, they will find themselves in an embarrassing situation when called upon to collaborate with the armies of other powers, particularly in United Nations work, in that they represent an obsolescent force which is simply not up to date with the developments that are taking place in military science throughout the world.</P>
    <P>There is no means by which we can put at the disposal of our Army all the most recent discoveries of military science except through the Staff Colleges of friendly powers.  I should like a reassurance from the Minister that adequate provision is being made for the officers of our Army of all ranks, from lieutenant right up to the top, to have adequate access to the Staff Colleges of friendly powers so that our Army may be fully informed of the practical application of all that is most modern in military science, strategy and tactics.  The provision in this Estimate does not seem to me to be adequate for that purpose and it is one of the matters on which the Minister should be in a position to reassure us.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of some equipment which had recently been secured and which the Army anticipated they would take back with them from Cyprus.  He was referring possibly to a certain kind of armoured car.  I want to put it to the Minister that it is of vital importance for the morale of our Army that they should have access to supplies of the best and most up-to-date armaments we can afford.  Now that very well may mean that in certain <Col N="1562" /> branches of equipment, we may have to throw our hats at it and simply say, in regard to heavy artillery and certain other branches of equipment, that our Army is certainly not equipped and does not propose to enter into competition with other armies at all.  But there might be a good deal to be said for taking a radical decision along those lines and saying that, in respect of those types of armaments with which we propose to supply our Army, nothing but the best is good enough.</P>
    <P>That is one of the advantages of having a small Army.  A small country can afford to equip it, albeit in certain restricted spheres, with really modern up-to-date equipment.  Our obligation to participate in the United Nations peacekeeping operations reinforces, I think, the urgent need of putting our minds to that problem forthwith.  I think a good point of departure would be to say: let us envisage the kind of assignment we will be prepared to accept from the United Nations for our Army and, for that strictly limited kind of assignment, we now propose to give them, and maintain hereafter, an equipment which will compare with that of any army in the world.  In respect of the heavier armament, we must look to the United Nations to provide it, if that be required; but for the normal armaments necessary for the efficient prosecution of the kind of peacekeeping tasks our forces may be called upon from time to time to do, they should go to them with equipment that will compare with that of any other Army in the world.  I think that is a reasonable stipulation.</P>
    <P>If the morale of the Army is to be maintained, they are entitled to expect that their legitimate requirements, at least within that limitation, shall be provided by this House.  I do not think that would impose an intolerable burden on the Exchequer, but I do suggest that, if this State is to maintain an army, it has got to face the fact that an army consists of more than men and uniforms and armaments. Perhaps the most important element in an army is its morale and no army can maintain its morale if it does not know that its officers are, <Col N="1563" /> first, keeping abreast of all that needs to be known in modern military techniques and, secondly, that for certain limited spheres of activity, its equipment is as good as that of any other army in the world.</P>
    <P>I recognise at once that, once you have set that standard, you have to accept that these spheres of activity are strictly limited because we simply cannot afford to provide an army in every variety of armaments equal to the best.  But I believe we could afford, within a carefully chosen, prudently delineated area, to provide them with the best; and I believe, if we do that, we will make the most effective contribution of which we are capable to morale and that, in my judgement, would be a very real service to an Army of which we have every reason to be proud.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude on that note.  One of the great dangers abroad in the times in which we live is that rising generations do not recognise the inestimable treasure that this State inherited in the morale of its Civil Service and its Army.  The morale of the Army was born very largely in a period of voluntary service in which men undertook all sorts of fantastic labours and faced fantastic dangers because they were convinced of their patriotic obligation to serve their country without counting the cost. That tradition was carried over into the National Army and it is the taproot of the Army we have today. These splendid traditions need to be nourished and sustained by appreciation and the only way this Parliament has of expressing its appreciation of these standards of conduct is to communicate to the Army our genuine solicitude for the welfare of the officers and men.</P>
    <P>Welfare of the Army is not primarily a matter of comfort and clothes and food and amenities, though these things ought to be there.  The welfare of the Army, as I understand it, is principally the provision of access to knowledge and equipment which will enable officers and men to feel the equal of any army with which they are <Col N="1564" /> called upon to serve.  I do not think we are doing all we could do to give effect to these objectives and I suggest to the Minister that he should bestir himself and consult with the Army Council as to what requires to be done and then see that it is done.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Dillon express the sentiments he expressed in the latter part of his speech.  I only wish he had made that speech during the period of the first Coalition at a time when the Army got a little bit of the same treatment as that meted out to the Aer Lingus transatlantic planes and other things.  However, I will not go into that now.  The fact is I am glad Deputy Dillon said the things he said tonight.  I hope he means them.  I hope that attitude will be maintained and I hope, having heard it from Deputy Dillon in the position he occupies as Leader of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;in the position he occupies&rdquo;.  I did not stumble.  However, if the Deputy wants his little daydreams, he can have them I should hate to interfere with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with this matter seriously. I am treating Deputy Dillon with all seriousness as Leader of the Opposition.  There is now a clear implication that there is a measure of agreement amongst us as to the importance of the Army.  In the light of that importance, there arises the question of equipping the Army and maintaining its numbers at an adequate level. More important still, Deputy Dillon did not hesitate to say, and I am glad of it, that he recognises there is a cost factor involved.  Although there might be some argument as to what exactly is connoted in the limited areas to which he referred, in general terms I have to concede that the areas would be limited.  I am glad we have got so <Col N="1565" /> far because I have heard too much criticism over the years of the size of the Defence Vote.  We have had too much of the illogical criticism that too much is being spent and the very people who make the criticism complain that the Army is not paid enough.</P>
    <P>One speaker made great play with the size of the increase in the Vote. Simultaneously, he talked about the remuneration of those concerned in the Vote.  When one looks into the increases, one finds that essential things, such as remuneration of personnel and the provision of facilities for them, quite apart from equipment, represent a fairly sizeable proportion of the increase involved.  You cannot have it both ways.  I am glad Deputy Dillon, without getting down to agreements or disagreements on points of detail, agreed on a certain principle, which is important and which some of us have been trying to drive home for years in this House.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties about the Department of Defence always has been that defence being a contingent matter, it is all too easy to effect actual savings on the Vote in the course of the year.  I do not want to delay the House with what I said a number of years ago, but I want to draw the attention of the Minister and the House to the debates on this Estimate which will be found in volumes 110 and 114 of the Official Report.  Thinking over our experience during the Emergency and the things said and courses taken after it, one cannot help reflecting&mdash;defence again being a contingent matter, depending on what may happen&mdash; whether a great deal of responsibility is being assumed on the financial side, which may be crippling in an emergency.</P>
    <P>Years have passed and I think I can disclose now that it fell to my lot on the General Staff to direct an examination of the history of the Defence Forces from the financial and equipment point of view before the war.  I have no hesitation in saying it was an indictment that might have led to a serious position if the situation had <Col N="1566" /> gone against us afterwards.  I will say no more than that.  There was a very serious indictment in that history, and I have recorded it in volumes 110 and 114.  My purpose in referring to it here today is simply to put that warning on the record for future occasions, if it is needed.  The fact was that before the war the Army found themselves, when faced with the Emergency, barely with the personnel resources to mobilise and face it and completely without the equipment.  As I say, the story as to why is already on record.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few general points.  Frankly, I have much less confidence talking of these matters now than I had 15 or 20 years ago when some of us were much closer to them. I have some qualms about going beyond general directions for the very reason that I have not got the information that I feel would enable me to do so.  I will go again this far with Deputy Dillon.  I think the provision of courses and contacts for our Army personnel abroad is an important one. I am glad it is being recognised as such in this House.  We have to face it.  We have two problems in the Army today.  The first is a personnel problem. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get not only recruits but to get cadets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard certain anxieties expressed about the future in regard to the supply of officer personnel It has certainly been difficult to get recruits.  Were it not for the fortunate fact from the Army`s point of view&mdash;not from other points of view, because I do not want my use of the word to be misunderstood&mdash; were it not for the fact that service abroad was available for recruits, I think the situation would be even worse.  When the strength went below <Col N="1567" /> a certain level, that was a necessary consequence.</P>
      <P>Pay and conditions are matters that must be taken into account also.  I am glad to hear that this status increase will come into effect shortly.  It will be a useful boost to morale, but there is more than that as far as the Regular Army are concerned.  There are two problems which have always been problems in maintaining not only morale but in maintaining numbers and a standard of efficiency and, ultimately, they will have a very big effect on the right type of cadet material being available.  I am referring to the prospects they have within the service and the age at which they retire.</P>
      <P>I should like to make two suggestions to the Minister.  In regard to the promotion of officers, it would pay to have a cadre larger than the peacetime establishment would appear to justify in order to supply the professional outlet and the incentive to an officer to climb the ladder and to hold out to him the prospect of a successful career.  Secondly, I wonder about the age limit for the retiral of officers.  I know the lower age limit for junior officers was brought in when people were thinking in terms of the young, active officer and felt that the so-called &ldquo;dug-in&rdquo; office jobs could be filled by older officers of a relatively junior rank, who would come from the Reserve.  But I think that pattern is changing.  Now we have not got the Reserve to do it.  A proportion of these older officers will have these office jobs, barrack jobs and administrative jobs generally; but I do not think it unreasonable to suggest that the age limit should be shoved to some reasonable level comparable with civilian employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another factor that works here.  In the old days, officers, when retiring, could hope to get employment but that opportunity is more or less receding in this world of specialisation. The opportunities for officers retiring now are rather less and are tending to become less than they were.  It simply means that a regular officer who comes out after service will be living on his <Col N="1568" /> pension and the pension will hardly be enough to support and satisfy a man of that age with the commitments he is likely to have.  Quite apart from the fact that he is a citizen, it is a very early age to put him on an early pension list.  Where is he most likely to be most useful to the community?  It is in the State service and the only place likely to be available to him in the State service is the Army.</P>
    <P>I know there are problems in regard to blocking the way for younger officers coming up.  There is a question of balance.  But I would be prepared, in the circumstances as I see them, and also with reference to the Reserve, which I will mention, to carry a larger proportion of officers than has been customary heretofore and even in the older groups because there will be reason for them.</P>
    <P>Coming to the other ranks, other people have dealt with the need for adequate remuneration and comfort for NCOs and men in comparison with civilian employment.  The day has gone when the soldier was regarded as some kind of inferior being drafted into an organisation that takes him over completely and in which it is thought he may not be able to look after himself. The soldier is a citizen and should have equal rights and equal status with the rest of his fellow-citizens in the community which is in modern times levelling up to a certain classlessness, which is a good thing.  He must, of necessity, from the nature of his job, be subjected to a restriction and discipline in excess of what the ordinary citizen will have to bear; therefore it is all the more important that his living conditions, standards and remuneration match the average of what is around him.</P>
    <P>As I am talking about NCOs and men, I should like to mention another point to the Minister.  I never could understand the logic of the fact that gratuities are paid to officers on retiring from the Army.  Possibly there is some question of pre-discharge leave also but why should the NCOs and men not be treated on the same basis?  I should like the Minister to consider whether a pre-discharge gratuity could be given to NCOs and men.  They are perhaps liable to go out at a younger age and to need setting up in life at least as much <Col N="1569" /> as officers.  Perhaps these are things that could be followed up with a question, if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Preceded by a question. I received very small change from the Minister on a question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ways of asking questions, if you keep after them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ways of answering them, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the matter for the Minister's benefit because the comment has been made and representations have been made to the effect that there was a certain distinction between officers and NCOs, to the disadvantage of the latter.</P>
      <P>Now I want to come to the question of the Reserve.  To some extent, this is related to the question of officers and the establishment of officers and their retirement age.  In the old days, there was what corresponded to the old First Line Reserve which consisted of officers and men who had been trained as regulars and who went on to the Reserve.  In that capacity they were called for annual training and they were a group of pretty well trained personnel immediately available for embodiment on mobilisation.  That category was significantly there up to the end of the last emergency.  As I understand it, that category has dwindled and there has been very little replacement, or machinery for replacement, particularly where officers are concerned.  There are still a number of officers of that period in that category but as far as I can gather no further effort is being made to supply such an element of reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a serious situation from the point of view of a possible mobilisation. Admittedly, I am thinking in terms of a mobilisation.  The fact is that the men and officers of the Reserve &mdash;in the first instance of the AA Reserve&mdash;who had regular service or service for something much more than anything like a local defence force service could be, or what corresponded to the old Volunteer service, proved <Col N="1570" /> absolutely essential for the 1939 mobilisation.  On top of that, there was the so-called First Line Reserve and the Volunteer services.  They were not as experienced.  They had a certain amount of training but had not put in as many training hours as others.</P>
    <P>Any of us who had experience of the 1939 mobilisation realise that if the Army had not got the old Reserve of that period, things would have been in a pretty mess.  I remember battalions, like the 7th Battalion, which were reserve units, being able to mobilise as regular units and assume guard duties and duties of that nature which had to be done and also provide for officers to staff mobilisation depots.  I doubt if the same thing were to happen in the morning that you would have the equivalent personnel.  If you have not, what are you to do?  I mention this not so much from the point of view of re-establishing that kind of Reserve, because things having gone the way they have I am in some doubt as to what could be done, but from the point of view of suggesting that the Regular Army officers who are kept on after age would be a useful adjunct in that regard.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned promotions and Reserve officers in that connection. I agree that there is a tendency to have them overlooked.  I do not want to take away from the FCA because I think the FCA will and must prove a very important element of the Defence Forces, but we still have to provide for an interim period during which they are being mobilised and integrated, no matter how much training they have done or how good they are.  After they have been mobilised, quite possibly they will be required as a nucleus around which to effect a larger mobilisation. If you were to mobilise in the morning, you would still be faced with the same kind of problem as you had the last time.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that that is all the more reason why it might be appropriate now or in the near future to have some indication of the lines on which his Department are thinking in regard to the overall picture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> We can very well believe that in regard to the Army proper, the role visualised will be somewhat similar to what it was in the past, mostly to supply the defensive needs of garrisoning and so forth in our own territory. That will have to be supplemented by such foreign service assignments as we have had in recent years.  There is, however, another aspect to defence. The Army and other Defence Forces must function in a particular environment and that environment will depend on how, as a nation, we are prepared to meet a war emergency.  A war emergency must be looked on from two points of view.</P>
    <P>Before the last war, people had learned to look on such problems as the possibility of gas bombardments and conventional air raids.  Now they talk about atom bombs.  Our first approach is nowadays that the thing will be so sudden and quick that there is very little use spending effort and money to deal with it.  One might, possibly with logic and cogency, pursue that argument.  The answer, of course, is that if it is pursued, we should not have this Estimate here at all.  We are to spend a large sum of money during the coming year and have spent it in past years.  So we must take the other approach, the second one, and see what we are likely to have to face if the catastrophe of a war should come near us.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Army problems can be left to the officers and staff, but where do we stand with regard to preparing the civilian population for such a problem?  Where do we stand in regard to the technical effort that will be needed to help the community to survive?  It might be well if the Minister would give us some enlightenment on this matter, particularly on the problems of supplies and Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>I refer to Civil Defence in particular because it is like any other voluntary service in that it will have but a small number active but that small number will be absolutely vital.  They may be sneered at or joked about, but when the time comes they will be the nucleus of an essential service not only for the <Col N="1572" /> civilian population but also in conjunction with the military aspect.  Civil Defence should mean something more than Civil Defence services themselves. Overall, there should be co-ordinated planning among a number of organisations with aims related one to the other in times of emergency&mdash;fire fighting, ambulance services like the Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance service, the Knights of Malta, the official Civil Defence organisation itself with its many ramifications throughout the local authorities, voluntary rescue service, Boy Scout organisations.</P>
    <P>All these people have a potential which should be linked with our Civil Defence scheme.  In order to link them, a great amount of preliminary staff work requiring large vision will be necessary.  I should like the Minister to consider whether the time has now come when a broader overall view of defence in such times is not desirable. Somebody during the debate more or less sneered at the idea of radiation detected by Civil Defence people.  I think that the provision of a number of people trained to deal with such an unusual problem is absolutely necessary.  Just as we should recognise the importance of the voluntary military services such as the FCA, so, too, should we recognise the importance of voluntary Civil Defence and the other organisations I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Certain people would like to dismiss these problems by saying that if there is an atomic war, there is nothing we can do about it.  That may be perfectly true, but there is a lot you can do in a situation closely approaching all-out atomic war.  There may be an excessive radiation release in our vicinity but the radiation may be manageable.  There could be conventional bombing such as in the last war involving all the risks of disorganisation of supplies and fire services.  For all these things, overall planning of Civil Defence services is necessary.  It is in such circumstances that these very public-minded citizens, who give their time to these activities in peace-time, will be found to be essential units in the fight for the survival of the community.  We should recognise that <Col N="1573" /> point now, try to organise them, try to give them the training and the facilities necessary to make their work effective.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting, in general terms, to hear what the Minister has to say about the present situation in regard to Civil Defence.  Closely related to it is the problem of emergency supplies.  There is one other problem I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.  No matter what happens, if an emergency situation comes, there will be the need for a certain amount of improvisation in practically every field in the life of the community&mdash;Army, Civil Defence services, all kinds of civilian services and so forth.  That kind of improvisation can supply a great deal of the things that will make life bearable to the community under the stress of such an emergency.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it must be realised that despite technical effort the question of supplies cannot be left to the last moment.  We had some experience in the relatively favourable circumstances of the last war when the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau and other bodies were charged with trying to solve certain problems of great temporary importance to health and defence.  One type of such work became of great importance.  It concerned the purification of water supplies for Irish cities.  There was a threatened cut in supplies of chlorine for water purification.  It did not materialise but the fact is that this organisation had under way, for nine to 12 months, work which made it possible to face that problem.</P>
    <P>That is an example of the type of thing that could happen.  The moral of that story is the need for overall staff planning for supplying such needs, mainly calling in these people who were immediately ready first; then embodying, on them, the reserves you had got and then using that to embody an emergency Army.  Without those reserves and the provision for embodying them, you will not be able efficiently to organise an emergency Army.</P>
    <P>I do not go into those matters today <Col N="1574" /> to discuss defence policy or defence mechanism but merely to emphasise the importance of present serving personnel and their morale; to emphasise that proper remuneration to them is essential for national defence and to suggest again that the retiring age limits might be reviewed in view of that situation.  To complete the picture, I want to plead for the promotion of long-standing officers on the Reserves and even of readjustment of grants. Lastly, there is the question of the gratuities for the NCOs and men when they are retiring.  All of these matters are essential to the morale of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I want to break right away, now, and to talk about the Equitation School.  I listened with considerable interest to Deputy Cosgrave talking about the Equitation School and the horse.  He has stimulated me into asking the question if this is a job for the Department of Defence at all.  It might be as well to face up to this.  We should keep in mind that the reason that military jumping teams and military horsemanship achieved the prominence and the interest it did was because in the days in which that happened the armies of the world depended largely on the horse and the armies were a natural nucleus for horsemanship.  The Cavalry, the Artillery and Transport were all horsed. What was more natural than that good horsemen would come from cavalry regiments whose job, so to speak, was to live on a horse and fight on a horse? Therefore, it was a completely natural thing that jumping teams should evolve from that situation.</P>
    <P>The 1920s and the 1930s were the heyday of our Equitation School.  Our Transport and Artillery, at any event, and I think originally there was a small mounted unit, were horsed.  It was natural that all Army officers had to ride.  Horsemanship was an essential accomplishment of an Army officer and became a very natural complementary sport.  The situation is very different today.  From the military point of view, there is no horse, I think, in the Army.  The transport is mechanised; the guns are mechanised. <Col N="1575" /> There are no cavalry.  From a professional point of view, the ordinary officer is not required to know one end of a horse from another, let alone get on his back.</P>
    <P>When there is all this talk about the Equitation School, I ask, in these circumstances, if the time has not come for some other Department of State to take over responsibility for this important activity.  It is no longer a military one.  All over the world, the Jumping Teams are now no longer exclusively military nor is even our own representation exclusively military. It is merely a traditional link that now leaves the horse in the Department of Defence.  With that sobering thought, I raise the question whether it would be better for horsemanship, for our horses and for all that has evolved, if the Equitation School were transferred to some other Department&mdash;I was going to say the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I mention the Department of Agriculture is that the horse is going off the farm as the tractor and machine take over. However, I would class the horse as an agricultural product and as related. There is a big industry here&mdash;our bloodstock industry.  I do not want to digress from the Estimate for the Department of Defence but I just want to give this additional reason why it might be profitable to consider transferring the horse from the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very important industry here in our horses.  The Irish horse is famous.  The horse is becoming a sporting and a luxury animal rather than a working animal or a service animal.  I am not competent to go into details <Col N="1576" /> on that front but, since the Irish horse is very important to the Irish economy and already is a very big item in the economy in other spheres rather than the Department of Defence, I feel it might be better if the show jumping and equitation activities were now transferred to a more appropriate place.  That does not prevent any officer who has a penchant for horses or an interest in them from being interested in that sport.  Indeed, I would encourage the Minister for Defence to facilitate that officer as he would a footballer or anybody else in his sport. I would go so far even as to say that honorary or nominal commissions could be given to representatives.  In a modern Defence Department, especially one such as ours, with limited resources, the question arises whether the Equitation School is appropriate in that sector at all.</P>
    <P>Having said that about the Equitation School, I want to move to some slightly broader aspects of Defence. Things have changed a great deal since the last war.  It would be a great mistake to approach the defence problems of the day merely by going back to experiences during the past Emergency, that is, to try to interpret what would happen.  Matters relating to mobilising personnel, and so on, may have certain common factors, as I have said, but, after that, it would be dangerous to parse too closely in the light of the last Emergency.  Medical services and other things are tied in with Civil Defence.  It would be interesting if the Minister for Defence in his annual Estimate were to give some short progress reports in regard to some of these matters.  It certainly would stimulate interest in defence and it would also help to show personnel who are engaged in these activities that an interest is being taken in them.  It would boost their morale and spur them on to give greater service, which they are giving free, gratis and for nothing.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I come to the question of equipment.  That is always a difficult matter, but I would ask the Minister, in the light of previous experience, to be on his guard constantly.  I am not blaming anyone particularly for this. There has always been a certain <Col N="1577" /> temptation in dealing with Defence Estimates to make provision for equipment and then somehow or other the equipment does not come.  The money is saved but the net result is you have not got the equipment.  I feel it is no harm after a lapse of years, to mention that danger while, at the same time, freely conceding that the indiscriminate buying of equipment is not to be encouraged.  We are glad to recognise that the equipment of the Army, new rifles and so on, has gone ahead and it is encouraging to see that new weapons are in the hands of soldiers when it is quite possible a good excuse could be made for continuing with older types of weapons. Let us be fair about that.</P>
    <P>I shall finish practically as I began by reference to what was said generally, that is, debates which took place during the war and I mention volumes 110 and 114 in particular.  The reason I do so is that I think that by going back to these things for a moment, we shall be stimulated to ask questions. There have been many improvements but there are still things which might be done.  I am glad the Leader of the main Opposition took the course he adopted on this Estimate and did not pursue the line, taken by others, that the Estimate was excessive.  It is a good thing that it is realised that the provision of these services, and what is needed to maintain them, whether personnel, remuneration or equipment, is essential and does entail expenditure. What I cannot understand is the attitude of people who want more expenditure and, at the same time, complain about the size of the Vote.  I am glad Deputy Dillon did not put himself in that category which is an easy one for people in the Opposition to find themselves in.</P>
    <P>I have missed one point.  I should like to ask the Minister about electricity supplies in married quarters.  Is it a fact, when these houses were being rewired, that the wiring had not the carrying capacity necessary for the installation of plugs?  I ask that question because I have seen warnings about the danger of installing plugs. If these houses were rewired simply <Col N="1578" /> for lighting, I think an explanation is needed.  I mention this matter in order to give the Minister an opportunity of supplying the information because I think that, whatever the arrangements made for paying, if families are being brought up in these houses they should have facilities for installing plugs.  I can understand the case being made that they can instal the extra plugs themselves, but I do feel they are entitled to have the basic wiring and supply laid on to enable them to instal the plugs.  If the rewiring of these married quarters was simply for lighting, then I think the matter should be looked into again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been agreed, and rightly so, by our side of the House that we should congratulate the Minister and his Department as well as our Army serving on foreign fields.  They certainly have brought great honour to our country, both in the Congo and in Cyprus, and we should feel very proud of them, indeed.</P>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate at all but there are a few problems I should like to bring to the Minister's notice.  Looking through the Estimate, I was hoping that this year I would see some money put aside for the building of an Army Chaplain's house in Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa Barracks at Galway.  So far, no house has been provided and the Chaplain there is housed in married quarters.  The Army personnel feel it awkward from time to time if they want to see him on private business and they would feel much happier if the Chaplain had a house where they could go and discuss their problems with him in a normal way.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the question of pay increases has been awaited for quite a while in the Regular Army, as well as an increase in the yearly grants paid to the Reserve.  I should like to ask the Minister to look at this and see whether the matter can be speeded up.  A certain amount of agreement has been reached in regard to remedying the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I got on my feet was that a question was asked of the Minister lately regarding the helicopter service. I feel possibly something could be done about them and that they should <Col N="1579" /> be left in the hands of Army personnel themselves.  The Minister stated that helicopters cannot operate by night, except in certain circumstances.  I feel the Army Corps could visit the islands off the coast and pick out landing places where the helicopters could land if a fire or a flare was lit by a warden in the case of an emergency.  A person on one of these islands may not take ill until night so the helicopter could not possibly land without some kind of flare.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are plenty of places in the islands generally where a landing flare or a fire at night would guide the pilot of a helicopter and enable him to pick up a patient and bring him to the mainland.  When the helicopter reaches the mainland it can land anywhere provided there are no high tension wires.  There are many barracks in the west and it could be arranged that a helicopter could land at any one of them.</P>
    <P>The refuelling of helicopters is another problem.  A helicopter can refuel in Dublin, I understand, travel to an island off the west coast with a tank of fuel and can then return to the mainland.  Of course, it may not be possible to stay out for long.  I feel, that in a barracks, such as Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, a reserve fuel tank should be kept in readiness.  As far as I know, there is one in Castlebar at the moment but that is a bit far north, to my mind, for the Aran Islands and other islands to the south.  If such a reserve fuel tank were kept in all the barracks it would be a good thing.  A reserve fuel tank should be available so that it could be employed in case a helicopter had to come down.</P>
    <P>There are many barracks scattered all over the west of Ireland.  The Army should find out if there are landing places on the islands where a flare could be lit in the case of an emergency. The helicopter could land there and then return to the mainland.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow I shall be leaving for the USA.  In the course <Col N="1580" /> of my tour, I shall have the privilege of addressing Senators and members of the Legislature in Des Moines, Iowa. In the course of that address, I shall take great pride in referring to the very high status and respect that our soldiers have gained in serving overseas. I shall not be slow to remind them, as the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy reminded us in this House, that 26 of our soldiers gave their lives in the cause of freedom and liberty in the Congo.  I shall not be slow to remind them that our soldiers are now serving in the cause of liberty and freedom in Cyprus; that all are volunteers; that all, poorly paid as I think they are, not given the status and recognition which I consider they should get, will still volunteer and offer, if necessary, their lives in the cause of defending peace, in the cause of liberty and in the cause of everything every true Irishman must stand for.  Certainly, the activities of our soldiers abroad have given every Irish public representative something he can proudly talk about.  Their contribution to the work of the United Nations, in proportion to the size of our country, has been a very great one.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers that the pay afforded to the officers, NCOs and men in the regular forces is inadequate. I believe, in our buoyant economy where we are spending more and more money in very many fields of activity, that we are not providing sufficient money to recompense these men, whose status has increased, whose responsibilities have increased and who continue to fulfil the great role they are being called upon to play in modern international circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When our newly appointed Cardinal came back from Rome, it was made clear that we in Ireland have the same role to fulfil today as we had to fulfil after the fall of the Roman Empire when Europe was without authority or proper central administration and when order was restored as a result of the labour of our Irish missionaries who went abroad.  We have such a role to play still in bringing unity and peace, not only to Europe but also to the world. <Col N="1581" /> Our voice in the United Nations, as a result of the service of these soldiers, is far stronger and far more effective than we could ever dream of having regard to the size of our country.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the grant for officers, NCOs and men in the Reserve.  As far as I know this grant has not been increased since the creation of the Reserve.  I know also that officers of the Reserve, the men and NCOs cannot hope to get promotion no matter how hard they devote themselves to keeping themselves up to date with modern techniques and modern methods of leadership.  If they retire with the rank of Captain they will serve their reserve period as captain only and never hope to become a commandant. They cannot hope for any increase in pay according to the practice in force heretofore.  I should like to ask the Minister, in particular, to consider increasing the Reserve grant.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to electric plugs in Cathal Brugha Barracks in my constituency.  These references were made by men very familiar with plugging.  I shall not pay too much attention to them because the references were made by men who would plug any Republican 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider the set-up in the Army barracks in the city.  Those barracks are now so situated that one atomic bomb could kill every soldier living in them.  I should like the Minister to consider taking a site in County Dublin, and building a new barracks with clubs and modern accommodation, at Palmerstown, shall we say, or somewhere outside the immediate city limits. I am quite sure Cathal Brugha Barracks in my constituency, if sold as a development site, would pay for the construction of a new modern barracks on the outskirts of the city.  I seriously believe that the facilities afforded to the soldiers in these old barracks are such that no matter how much money is spent on improving them, they will never make decent quarters for good soldiers.</P>
    <P>I was told on this Estimate about two years ago that some study was <Col N="1582" /> made of our atomic defences, our defences against nuclear weapons.  The Minister said he had considered publishing a booklet on this type of defence.  Apparently in his wisdom he has decided&mdash;or he has been advised&mdash; that the publication of such a booklet would not be in the best interests of the community.  I should like him to tell me, and to tell the House, what brought about the decision not to publish this booklet.  I seriously believe that the public in general should be educated on what they should do in the event of a nuclear war.  We hope we will not be a target, but in the event that we are a target, no doubt Dublin city will be on the aggressor's plans. What are the people of Dublin city to do in the event of a nuclear war? I am informed that if Liverpool were a target, the people in Dublin city could easily find themselves victims of the bomb dropped there.  Should the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary householder, take any precautions to protect himself and his family in the event of such a nuclear conflict?</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Booth and other Deputies in saying that with the new agreement on territorial limits so far as fisheries are concerned, the Minister must give very serious consideration to extending the fishery protection services we have at the moment.  I am aware of the difficulties with which the Minister is faced but, there again, as in the case of the Army, if the money were right, I think we would get the men.  Furthermore, if a proper scheme of apprenticeship were established, under which recruits to the Naval Service could be qualified as fully qualified seamen to join any of the merchant fishing fleets, this might help the situation, and it would be like the scheme under which pilots are trained by the Irish Air Force to fly for commercial airlines.</P>
    <P>I should like to go on record as agreeing with other Deputies who said that now that extended territorial limits are coming into operation, fishery protection must play a much more important part in the programme of the Department of Defence in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a good deal enlightened by the debate on this Estimate as to what public thinking there is on this question in general.  A number of Deputies, and particularly those who served during the Emergency, seemed to lay much more stress on the short-comings than on the advantages of our Army organisation.  For the second occasion in succession, one Deputy has asked me to state why there is never what he terms a statement of general Army policy.  He said:</P>
      <P>An excuse is made from time to time that it would not be in the public interest for us to disclose State secrets but, when the whole question of Army policy is discussed in Washington, Westminster, Paris, Bonn and everywhere else without anybody's feeling that something frightfully secret is being discussed, I do not think we need be so shy about it.</P>
      <P>Certainly we are being put in very good company in that list.  I did not know that our defence position was quite so important, and in future I must have more regard to what this Deputy says than I have had in the past.</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
      <P>I have never yet heard a statement of general Army policy.  First of all, is the Army really a defence force and, if so, what in the name of all that is wonderful is it defending us against or against whom are we being defended?  I believe that the thinking is still that, at some period in the future, there may yet be a danger of an airborne or a seaborne invasion.</P>
      <P>As against that thinking on our defence problem, I have to place the statements made this evening by Deputy Dillon and Deputy de Valera who took what I would say is the exact opposite point of view.  In between those two points of view, I should say lies the kernel of our defence problems in Ireland.  We should have regard to whatever element of reality is contained in those two opposing points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> Having begun with that introduction, perhaps I might go back and start with the old soldiers, as Deputy MacEoin led off the debate on that particular responsibility of the Department of Defence.  I know Deputy MacEoin's interest in those who served, and who were not backed by annual defence budgets, but who nevertheless managed to create and equip an Army, and put up a reasonably good fight with very poor material indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was <i>ad hoc.</i> Mark you, the <i>ad hoc</i> thinking was not always wrong.  I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy MacEoin in the particular case he mentioned, both by question a few days ago and again in his remarks on the Estimate.  I know there was a transfer in that case from one company to another and, between these two stools, the applicant seems to have fallen.  All I could do was examine the evidence put before me and, as I have said on former occasions, if there is a reasonably plausible case, I am certainly in favour of giving the benefit of whatever doubt there may be to the applicant, but I do not think the evidence in this case enabled me to do that.  I am telling the Deputy now that I shall personally look into the case again in view of what he has said about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to stress the fact that there is as much of an obligation on me to ensure that people who have no claim to these medals or this recognition should not get it because that takes a good deal from the value of the prestige and merit of the recognition which good soldiers have earned.  Deputy Sherwin suggested that medals awarded under the old system of verification should be re-investigated because, if we wait to investigate until the holders apply for special allowances, it may be too late as there may be no verifying officers alive. That is true, but the difficulty about acceding to the Deputy's request is that there are more than 40,000 medallists and perhaps 7,000 or 8,000 of these have been re-investigated under the new system for special <Col N="1585" /> allowances.  Of the balance, we do not know how many are still alive; we do not know whether a man is alive until he applies for a special allowance but it can be taken that a very large number of them are still alive.  Many of them will never apply for special allowances. To re-investigate all cases now would require a huge staff and is not feasible from a practical point of view.  I am sorry to have to reply to the Deputy in these terms but we must recognise the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry commented on men dying before their special allowances are awarded.  He suggested the Department was remiss in dealing with claims.  The special allowances scheme has been operating for 22 years and in that time only 540 applicants have died before their claims were decided. These cases were very carefully watched to see if there was any avoidable departmental delay and our records show that the majority of them are cases in which the applicants died in a very short time, sometimes within weeks or even days, of making their application or were cases which bogged down because of difficulty in establishing medal entitlement or even cases where there may have been avoidable delay but these were very much the exception.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also complained about prosecutions on the ground of concealment of means.  I dislike prosecuting old IRA men as much as Deputy Tully does for reasons such as this and I can assure him that I try to avoid it whenever possible.  I cannot identify the case of which he spoke but I think his statement that only a very small amount was involved can hardly be true.  The case is usually serious before we go to the length of prosecution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> I do not think any other Deputy dilated very much on the question of the treatment of the old IRA so I shall pass on to other matters.  Deputy Tully suggested I had failed to give particulars of the actual strength of the Army.  This allegation of concealing information about the Defence Forces seems to have been a bee in the bonnet of one or two Deputies. Deputy Booth was critical of what he called the lack of information.  Deputy Tully complained about information concerning Army strength.  I think he can get that information in published form, but if he has not seen it, these are the figures: 1,143 officers; 82 cadets and 7,000 other ranks.  These are the figures on which we are basing the Estimate now before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have the particulars in tomorrow's papers. I hope the recipients and the members of the forces will be pleased.  In that connection, if Deputies examine the composition of the demand for the Department of Defence, they will see that practically threefourths of the demand represents personal payments. When Deputy Booth talks about the tools not being equal to the job, perhaps the tools, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, can be very expensive and if a preference must be exercised, then, in present circumstances, there is some excuse for exercising it in favour of the personal payment.</P>
      <P>In this particular connection, of course, it is hardly fair for any Deputy to quote merely the spending pay which a soldier gets and compare it with the wages of a man in outside employment, without mentioning the other perquisites which a soldier has. Deputy Tully, as an old soldier, might have made some reference to the value of rations.</P>

Here are some of them: rations or ration allowances, accommodation, <Col N="1588" /> clothing, marriage and children's allowances, and such factors.  I admit that there are children's allowances payable outside.  These things cost money to the man who has to provide them himself and, in fairness, should be reckoned in any such comparison.</P>
      <P>With regard to the pension the Deputy has just mentioned, again there is a factor which he might have brought into the reckoning.  It is that a young man can join the Army at the age of 17 and certainly at 18 without anybody's consent and can get a pension after 21 years' service.  That leaves him aged 38.  A man of 38 who has had the benefit of Army training and Army life should be fairly in his prime when he comes out on pension and it is reasonable to assume that he will be drawing that pension for a much longer period than he has served in the Army.  Anybody in outside employment who earns a pension earns it in the evening of his life and does not enjoy it for so very long.  That is a factor in relation to the pension which the Deputy might have borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I do not think I could possibly agree with Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Tully in their recommendation of the abolition of courtmartial proceedings in cases of desertion or, in fact, in any case.  It does seem to me that the fairest way to treat a soldier who has been a delinquent is to let him be dealt with by the Army.  I think he will get a better deal from them than from any other sort of tribunal.  These cases come to me only very rarely and my experience of them is that these <Col N="1589" /> courts deal very fairly indeed with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke on the question of equitation and Deputy de Valera spoke on it this evening also.  There is a fair amount to be said for the viewpoint expressed by Deputy de Valera.  I know that Deputy Cosgrave is very anxious to see that our Army Equitation Team should shine both at home and abroad as much as possible.  They are not inhibited in any way by the Department of Defence.  The Horse Purchasing Board has practically <i>carte blanche</i> to buy horses and if the Army have not got all the horses or the quality horses needed for success, then it is not due to any limiting factors which the Department of Defence as such has created.  It is quite true, as Deputy de Valera said, that the horse for all practical purposes has no longer any significance in an army.  We are, I think, the only country in Europe with an Army Equitation Team at the present time, although I am not absolutely sure about that&mdash;there may be others.  Certainly, there are not more than two or three.  All the countries seem to have got out of it. The Americans have got out of it also, and the British.  Civilian equitation interests have taken over control of all these international competitions and they seem to be doing much better than any of the military establishments.</P>
      <P>There is, as Deputies know, an investigation on foot under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture at the present time and that investigation will take within its scope the Army Equitation School and perhaps Deputy de Valera's recommendation may have results.  I do not know.  If the maintenance of the Army Equitation School is for the purpose of providing a shop window for the Irish horse, then what Deputy de Valera said is quite opposite. It is a job more suited to some other State agency than the Army.  If, however, horse riding is only a sport, then I suppose we could look at it the way Deputy de Valera recommended and have it treated as such but there would be need, I imagine, in that kind of thinking, to democratise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are quite a large number of lesser points which I do not think I <Col N="1590" /> should take up the time of the Dáil with now.  I will give consideration to everything that has been said, no matter how trivial.</P>
    <P>With regard to recruiting, I do not think it was quite fair for Deputy Booth to have said that the operation of a bonus system for the obtaining of recruits is nauseating.  I think that is the word he used.  The principle of a bonus did not originate with the fixing of the payment of £5.  It has been, in fact, in operation for the past 13 years. About two years ago the amount was increased and other types of advertising for recruits were dropped.  Somebody may ask: why not have carried on both in order to get better results? The answer to that is that we wanted to make a comparison between the type of advertising in practice formerly and this method.  This has proved somewhat better but has not been altogether satisfactory, not from my point of view anyway.  In reply to Deputy Booth's comment about proper advertising&mdash;&ldquo;proper&rdquo; is a word that Deputy Booth used very often&mdash;all I can say it that it was as proper as we could make it.  We got advertising experts to do it and I do not think we failed in that respect.</P>
    <P>With regard to what was said about district justices assigning delinquents to the Army, the Army does not accept anybody sent out of a district court.  The very appearance of such an expression of opinion in a newspaper from a district justice gives the applicant a very poor prospect, indeed, of being accepted.</P>

      <P>I resent it as much as Deputy Tully does.  Our Army is not an Army for jailbirds.  A person cannot become an Irish soldier unless he is a man of known good character, and as soon as he is found out to be otherwise he is dispatched from the Army. I want district justices and all others <Col N="1591" /> concerned to note that.  The very mention of the Army in connection with delinquency damns the prospective recruit's chances straight away.</P>
      <P>With regard to the purchase of these two boats for Spike Island, all I can say is that we have conceded the need for this permanent connection between the mainland and Haulbowline in the interests of the steel industry.  That necessitates the provision of two new boats to maintain contact with Spike Island.  The launches we have cannot go under the proposed fixed bridge.  I have no comment to make on that.  I regret that it is so but the defence forces must be co-operative where industry is to be promoted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth had a great deal to say about many things.  Most of them were disparaging and a number of them were quite untrue.  For instance, he spoke about our equipment.  I admit that our equipment is not as up to date as one would see in one of the involved countries&mdash;I put it no further.  He mentioned that we sent with our troops to the Congo anti-aircraft guns that were of no use what-soever and that were quite incapable of protecting the men on the ground even against low-flying aircraft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a correction? The Minister might quote me accurately.  What I said was that we were asked for an anti-aircraft detachment; we could supply men but we could not and did not supply guns because the guns we had were ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I shall accept the Deputy's explanation but I want to stress the fact that we did not send out any anti-aircraft guns to the Congo.</P>

      <P>As regards those who are pro and anti-Deputy Booth, on the one hand, and Deputy de Valera and Deputy Dillon, on the other, it is an ironic fact, with all this fine talk about equipment, that many of the 26 casualties in the Congo were caused by bows and arrows.</P>

      <P>We have not, as Deputy Booth said, a great deal of capital tied up in antiquated equipment. We have antiquated equipment all right, but we have not invested nearly as much money in equipment as I should like to see done.  However, as I mentioned earlier on we like to see the men get at much as possible out of Department of Defence expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also complained that a regular officer will not salute a superior officer of the FCA.  I have enquired about this and have been told that there is no evidence of any such transgression, that the hierarchy of precedence applies in the FCA as well as in the permanent Defence Force. Perhaps notice will be taken of the Deputy's remarks in the matter by all concerned and there will be no further cause for complaint, if there has been any.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth also referred to my reticence in regard to the Canada peace-keeping Conference.  I did not feel that there was any obligation on me to make any reference to the Canada Conference for the reason that the matter was appropriate to the Estimate for External Affairs and that it had been dealt with in November. The Minister for External Affairs had given full information regarding the conference in reply to a question here on the 18th November last.  The question of the Canada Conference was as much political as military and, in any event, where it would be a matter of the provision of overseas forces, such discussions are carried on by the Department of External Affairs on its own behalf and on behalf of the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>On the question of Army organisation, I do not know exactly what the Deputy means by using the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.  It did seem to suggest to me that the Deputy had in mind that Irish defence policy in future would mean supplying a police force to the United Nations for overseas service.  I take it that his use of the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; in that connection was to indicate the method whereby such forces would be organised.  I do not accept that simplified view of the obligations of the Department of Defence in Ireland yet.  It may be that is the way the world is shaping, but I do not think that we should, particularly at our own expense, maintain forces here for no other purpose than to maintain peace all over the world. Several Deputies on both sides have given expression to that viewpoint here in the last few days.  There is a great deal of substance, I think, in what they say, and the Irish people will be prepared, I am sure, to support and there will be sufficient young Irishmen to join Deputy Booth's flying columns, if the United Nations finds the money for them, but I do not think our small country ought to maintain a defence force for that one purpose alone.  We have, I think, demonstrated quite well that we are prepared to make a fair contribution and, in fact, we have made more than our fair contribution, if one bases it on populations, both in the Congo and in Cyprus.</P>

      <P>These figures show a distinct improvement.  In the six months from 30th June, 1964, to 31st December, 1964, the figure increased by 131 from 72 to a total of 203 volunteers.  Training activities in the <Col N="1595" /> county have been intensified and extended. Exercises were held recently at two centres in the county &mdash; on 1st March, 1965, at Ceanannus Mór, which was just a few days ago and at which 63 volunteers attended, and exercises were also held at An Uaimh on 2nd March at which there was an attendance of 61.  I think that is very creditable for the Deputy's county and he should think twice before he casts any aspersion on a fine body of men and women who are giving their services quite free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  The Deputy goes on record now as charging local authorities with supplying false information.</P>
      <P>One of the hottest subjects at the moment is the question of sea fisheries protection.  There has been quite a genuine interest, I admit, shown by everybody in this particular matter.  I am quite prepared to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of Deputies who supply me with certain technical information but, nevertheless, I must also have regard to people whose business it is to advise me and who must be presumed to know something about the job they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have not got a Navy in the accepted sense of the word we do have a naval service inasmuch as we have armed boats which we employ for duties other than fishery protection, quite contrary to the trend of opinion expressed so often in relation to these boats.  Let me specify.  I have here eight duties mentioned, including fishery protection. The first is fishery protection; <Col N="1596" /> then there are air-sea rescue; marine rescue co-ordination; hydrographic survey; mine destruction and removal of wrecks and floating dangers to navigation; Air Corps Army cooperation; training of Irish merchant seamen and merchant shipping defence; training of fishermen in basic seamanship.  Should there be a condition of hostilities these extra duties would fall on this unit; first, anti-submarine patrol of territorial seas; mine sweeping in territorial seas; the naval side of seaward defence of defended ports; control of maritime activities within the territorial seas; protection of fishing, etc; provision of protection for Irish merchant ships. For these duties the type of ship required would be anti-submarine vessels, coastal mine sweepers, in-shore mine sweepers and seaward defence boats.  I have a note here from my naval advisers that an anti-submarine vessel for this role fits in with that of an all-weather vessel for fishery protection and the corvettes were, in fact, so designed for this purpose.  I think it was Deputy Booth that put a figure of £1½ million on acceptable vessels. Deputy T. Lynch told me we can get a boat suitable for this purpose for about £150,000.  Let me compromise and say we could get a vessel at £1 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>My advisers tell me that for the extended limits we would require no fewer than ten vessels.  That would mean a capital sum of £10 million. If we were to take into account a number of other things, mainly outlined by Deputy Booth, we would have a nice round figure of about £35 million or £40 million.</P>

When eight of these countries have ratified this Convention, it will come into force; but the required number of countries&mdash;eight&mdash;have not done so yet.  Assuming they do&mdash;and I presume they will seeing that they signed it&mdash;we cannot conclude that that will, in fact, guarantee us 12 miles of exclusive fisheries or, if you like to come down to precise details, six miles.  There will be an outer band of six miles available for those countries that have been traditionally fishing around our coasts.  That will leave us six exclusive miles.</P>

To prove it he quoted a remark published in some of the papers by the skipper of a foreign trawler, who said he did not mind the corvettes being around but he got very frightened when he saw the helicopter.  If I was naïve enough to let the cat out of the bag, I do not think this skipper let any cat out of the bag.  If he was afraid of the helicopter, he would not have told the newspapers that.  In fact, his statement of comparison as between the protective qualities of the helicopter and the corvette shows that it is the corvette he fears.  Deputy Booth should read something about Napoleon's famous courier, Brigadier-General Gerard, and he will be able to assess the truth of that skipper's statement about the helicopter.</P>

      <P>In the last analysis Napoleon was not a success.  For years we were asking the Minister to get a helicopter and after years he eventually did so.  Now we are asking him to get coastal defence boats, and I suppose he will get them eventually also.</P>

      <P>I would like to see a motor torpedo boat with 13 knots dealing with one of these big boats.  The Deputy knows from the fishery returns that we have not been losing at all.

      <P>It has not dropped.  I think we can do in relation to this matter what we have been doing in relation to wheat production.  We can quite easily do with somewhat less than the completely adequate protection necessary for 15,000 square miles of fishery until we develop our fisheries. I had this problem when I was Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Fisheries.  I bought three steel-clad boats.  We know what the Deputy's Party did about them.  These boats dealt effectively with the Continental poaching bullies.</P>

They stopped the Spanish and French bullying our boats on the west coast, but the Deputy's Party tied them up below in Ringsend and would not put a coat of paint on them.  They had to be sold.  One of them, for its power and length, has turned out to be the best boat that has ever fished out of an English port.  These are the boats you ballyragged because you made them a football between two political Parties.</P>
