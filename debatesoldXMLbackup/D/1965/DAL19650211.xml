    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes it clear that the defence available to mine and quarry workers under section 135 of proving that responsibility had been expressly imposed on a responsible official does not absolve such mine or quarry owner from the obligation to pay damages in respect of a breach of a statutory duty by an employee.  It makes it clear that in certain circumstances the mine or quarry owner cannot absolve himself by placing responsibility on his official.  As to its being new I am not quite certain, except that it is not in previous legislation. Previous legislation provided that it would be a defence for a quarry owner to prove that the responsibility had been expressly imposed on another person.  This section is new in that it seeks to remove any doubts there may be about a person seeking to absolve himself from his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 137 is new. The section makes it clear that the defence available under section 135 will not automatically absolve mine or quarry owners from liabilities to pay damages in respect of breaches of statutory duties by employees.  A breach of a statutory duty imposes a much greater responsibility on the person on whom that statutory duty lies.  The section makes it clear that while certain responsibilities may be imposed on an employee, if there is a statutory duty involved a person will <Col N="176" /> not be able to rely on section 135 in respect of a breach of that statutory duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more familiar with the Factory Acts in which, if a person puts a competent manager in charge of a floor in a factory and if the manager does not see fit to fence off a piece of dangerous machinery in that floor, the competency of the manager will not absolve the owner of the factory from the effects of that breach of a statutory duty.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimate, 1964-65.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will see, the total sum required in this Supplementary Estimate is £68,000 but by reason of savings in other subheads, the net sum required is £10.  There are two main purposes: (1) the grant-in-aid to Córas Tráchtála, and (2) the grant-in-aid to the Irish National Productivity Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, in introducing the Supplementary Estimate for assistance to industry to offset the effects of the British temporary charge on imports, the Taoiseach stated that the finances of Córas Tráchtála would be increased so as to enable a more intensive market development programme to be organised in countries other than Britain.  The activities which Córas Tráchtála propose to extend to assist exporters in developing markets other than Britain include <Col N="179" /> schemes for exhibitions and window displays in department stores in major cities abroad as well as press conferences and receptions; for contributions towards a form of co-operative advertising of particular products in foreign markets; for grants to encourage senior executives of firms producing merchandise with export potential to visit overseas markets; for grants to firms participating in specialised overseas trade fairs, fairs open to trade buyers rather than the general public.  The Board have also brought forward the opening of an office on the west coast of the United States to help in opening up markets in that area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate in so far as Córas Tráchtála is concerned is to provide funds for these extended activities.  I should perhaps also mention at this stage that the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council on measures to promote exports of manufactured goods stressed the importance of providing adequate funds for Córas Tráchtála work in promoting exports generally.  An increase in the funds required for the Board arises also from the fact that, when the Estimate for the current year was being prepared, provision was not made for salary increases which have since been granted as a result of the ninth round.</P>
    <P>There is also provision for increased expenditure on the Kilkenny Design Workshops which are being developed more rapidly than was intended.  These workshops are intended to assist in improving the standard of design in Irish industry by producing specially designed goods and by providing industry with prototypes of first-class design.  It is hardly necessary for me to stress the importance of design in the effort to increase our exports.  With the emphasis on new markets this factor assumes even greater importance than heretofore.  I commend the Estimate to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>So much for Córas Tráchtála.  I come now to the Supplementary Estimate for the Irish National Productivity Committee.  The Irish National Productivity Committee, <Col N="180" /> which was established early in 1959, expanded its activities considerably in 1963-64.  It was financed in that year by a grant of £40,000 from the technical assistance subhead of the vote for my Department.  A Grant-in-Aid of £50,000 was approved to the Committee for 1964-65.  The Committee now requires a further sum of £8,000 for 1964-65.</P>
    <P>The Committee was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in December, 1963.  Membership is representative of the Federation of Irish Industries, the Federated Union of Employers, the Irish Management Institute, State sponsored bodies, Federation of Trade Associations, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Universities and the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The Committee is governed and directed by the representatives of its constituent organisations.</P>
    <P>In its early stages the Committee formed the liaison between the European Productivity Agency and bodies interested in productivity in this country. It also organised joint labour/ management functions designed to promote productivity.  The Committee now operates an advisory service for medium and small-sized firms and an information service designed to provide information of a non-technical nature relating to productivity.  Through the Human Sciences Committee, the Committee carries out research into problems involving the human factors in industry.  It has fostered the organisation of joint productivity committees within industries and continues to develop its promotional work generally.</P>
    <P>The increased sum required by the Committee for 1964-65 is due to the expansion of the services provided by the Committee and the increasing demand by business firms for those services.  I am satisfied that the services provided by the Irish National Productivity Committee are essential to the achievement of increased productivity. I recommend that the House should approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Estimate, I think we may overlook the <Col N="181" /> fact that initially when Córas Tráchtála was developed, it arose out of the decision taken by the first Inter-Party Government when it established the Committee to consider the problem of dollar exports, or rather exports to the dollar area.  That Committee was established on the basis of views expressed by representatives who were sent here under the Marshall Aid Scheme and part of the recommendations which the experts made in consultation with the Committee was to the effect that efforts should be made to develop and expand trade in the dollar areas.</P>
      <P>A very representative Committee was established and I have no doubt that the many benefits which have flowed since then to industry and trade as a result of the work of Córas Tráchtála were due to the attention and interest which the Committee gave to the problem, and the wide variety of interests reflected in the Committee, in making the recommendation that a dollar export board as it was originally thought up should be established. Subsequently the activities of CTT were extended to Britain and the Continent and there is no doubt that considerable benefits have flowed to traders and industrialists as a result of their efforts.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister referred to the announcement made when the 15 per cent levy was imposed that it was proposed to embark on a more intensive market development programme in Britain.  In that connection, I believe some firms are concerned to some extent about delays which have occurred in respect of the refund of part of the levy. While one can understand that adequate documentation is necessary in order to substantiate a claim for repayment, nevertheless, I consider that excessive inquiries or excessive documentation and substantiating of cases may cause unnecessary friction and trouble for traders and business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe people are familiar with the fact that they are liable, if they contravene the terms of the arrangement, to heavy penalties.  The general view in the House at the time the proposal <Col N="182" /> was introduced was that that was an appropriate weapon to apply in cases of individuals or firms making a case for assistance which was not warranted. When those penalties may be invoked against them, it is obvious that very few firms will endeavour to seek assistance to which they are not properly entitled.  It seems, therefore, that every effort should be made to expedite and to simplify, so far as possible, the procedure for the making of such payments.</P>
    <P>In connection with the work of the Productivity Committee, I think there is general recognition that this has served a useful function, in particular in the case of small firms.  One of the problems which small firms have is that it is imposible for them, either from their own resources or from the point of view of personnel, to have available either the financial means or the technically qualified personnel to provide information of a particular character which is essential for development and expansion.  These services are more readily available and can be sought by larger units or larger firms.  They have both the resources and the personnel.</P>
    <P>This service, in the main, provides a benefit to smaller units, of which there are many in this country, who have made commendable efforts and are capable of considerable development. They just lack the personnel or the necessary capital to provide and develop certain aspects of their work. I believe the particular service which this Committee can provide is of considerable benefit to the smaller firms and units.</P>
    <P>The other problem is the question of human factors in industry, a matter which requires constant attention even in an age in which there is a more enlightened approach to many of the problems and in which technical and other developments make some of the difficulties and problems which exist in other firms remote.  Nevertheless, there is, in spite of all these developments, a constant human problem involved in industrial work and in trade and commerce generally.  The research which the Productivity Committee has devoted to that aspect of the matter will undoubtedly provide those who are <Col N="183" /> involved in it with information and I have no doubt, in many respects, remedies for some of the problems which exist.  We agree to the Supplementary Estimate in respect of both of these items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first item, I should like some information from the Minister with regard to what expansion has taken place in exports as a result of the activities of Córas Tráchtála.  This year the figure of almost £500,000 is the amount voted by this House for the activities of Córas Tráchtála for the purpose of helping industrialists and others to expand and increase their exports in foreign markets.  I should like to hear from the Minister &mdash; he should be able to give it &mdash; an assessment of what, in terms of money, that grant has meant to this country?  Is he satisfied that the return is sufficient to warrant such expenditure, especially in view of the way some of those moneys are being spent at the present time by Córas Tráchtála?</P>
      <P>The one point I would make to the Minister in that regard is that Córas Tráchtála seek to concentrate on what I would call an extensive publicity drive, a scattered shotgun type of publicity, with the money available to them.  I wonder is this the proper type of publicity to go for?  Would it not be better to use a more intensive method of advertising and select the areas and make sure that when the activities are initiated they are followed through?  I consider the greatest mistake made so far is to try too many things together, to try to cover the west coast of the USA and various cities and in a very light fashion.  It would be much better to concentrate the limited funds we have on certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this House decide to give money to enable a higher executive of a firm to go abroad and investigate the possibility of a market, they have a certain responsibility to ensure that if a market is obtained as a result of the grant given, it is not allowed to die within six months or 12 months. <Col N="184" /> The great mistake so far has been that in the first flush of enthusiasm we feel that great success is going to attend the efforts of a particular industry.  We see in a short space of time the enthusiasm wanes and the particular items or goods are not delivered, either on time, or to the standard guaranteed when the order was given.  That is where Córas Tráchtála should be very critical and careful in their dealings with certain firms.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use this debate to widen the scope of the discussion on the Supplementary Estimate but I want to know from the Minister whether portion of this money will go to defray any extra cost for the World Fair Exhibition.  I do not know whether that has anything to do with it.  The Minister might let us know, because I am not aware at the moment whether Córas Tráchtála have handled any grants for exhibitions there, or whether that comes out of separate funds.  I should like to know if there is any connection between the extra money required now and the situation in the World Fair in New York.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to emphasise this point when dealing with grants of this nature.  Many of the groups who have access to these grants, and who are anxious to obtain grants, spend their time criticising Government and State interference in enterprise.  These are the very people who over the years have said that our success and future as a nation in the industrial field depends on the initiative of private enterprise.  If ever there was proof of how lacking in initiative private enterprise is, it is in the fact that the Irish taxpayers have to spend £½ million to help big, wealthy, Irish industrialists to go abroad, and to pay their travelling expenses to see if there is a market for their goods.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that those people cannot have it both ways.  If they insist on running down State enterprise and decrying Government action, they cannot expect the State to come to their aid, to pamper and pet them all along the line, as is being done at present.  We should be quite open with the public on this issue.  It is the taxpayers' money that is being spent on <Col N="185" /> what I call a socialist venture, that is, the State giving aid in a big way to private enterprise which has failed in the most extravagant fashion.  Big grants and loans have proved insufficient to wake up private enterprise, and, in addition, the taxpayers have to provide money to enable private enterprise to go abroad to meet buyers, and so forth, at various trade fairs.</P>
    <P>So long as we know where we stand in these matters, I think the public will realise that it is absolutely essential for the future, if the expansion which we all desire to see taking place is to occur, for the State to interfere more and more in the activities of those people.  They cannot expect this House to vote £½ million and have that money handed over by Córas Tráchtála to private industrialists without some control by this House over its expenditure.</P>
    <P>When I say I believe Córas Tráchtála is the body charged with the spending of that money, I realise that the aim is to build up over a period of years, to expand and increase our market, and not just arouse a certain amount of publicity by Press conferences and cocktail parties in half a dozen cities in America, with a big show today and nothing tomorrow.  I have seen that happening already in quite an amount of Córas Tráchtála activities.  I do not want to blame Córas Tráchtála for the activities of some of the people who were helped in the past, but that has happened and should be a warning to this State body that many of these groups will use and exploit Córas Tráchtála without any sense of responsibility for the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the second Supplementary Estimate.  I have no objection to it in regard to productivity, but the point has been made that sufficient attention is not given to the human factor in industrial relations.  The late industrial development here in Ireland has, in a sense, given us an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of other countries which had quite a start on us in industrial development.  We should be in a position to learn from the mistakes and failures of those countries.  It is in that field our investigations should take <Col N="186" /> place.  Our problems are very similar to the problems in the countries where industrial development has taken place, but when we talk in Ireland of relations between management and worker, and the human factor, if we are really a Christian society those problems should not exist, or at least should be smaller than they are in the countries where it is suggested that the human dignity of the human being does not count for as much as it should, and where the individual is not respected.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, in Ireland those problems should arise only in a minor way.  It is dreadful to think that in the small units we have in Ireland any problem of human relations could arise.  After all, there is no such thing as a managing director, or a company director, or the boss of a firm, not knowing the majority of those working for him.  It is not the same as in a big international concern which might employ thousands of people.  We have very few such groups in this country and, in fact, in the few such units we have, relations are excellent.  I do not think these problems should arise in the smaller units.</P>
    <P>I would say that the main problem which is likely to arise in any unit, small or big, is the problem not so much of human relations as of pay and allowances for work done.  In that regard I should like the Minister to be on the alert in relation to the inflow of people who are attracted by the idea of cheap labour.  That is a human problem and one this Government will have to face.  We all know some people are attracted here to start industries mainly by the fact that labour is supposed to be plentiful and cheap.  That is a shocking way to attract people.  In fact we have sent people outside the country to speak in France, Germany and elsewhere to suggest that is one of the attractions of Ireland.  I know of firms which have subsidiary bodies here and what they are manufacturing here could be manufactured in an annexe of their establishments abroad.  I know for a fact that when they heard about the grants available here &mdash; this is where I am bringing in the human factor &mdash; they said: &ldquo;This is a wonderful <Col N="187" /> chance to make money.  Why should we pay £10 or £12 to workers in our parent factory when we can go to Ireland, get a large grant and pay the same workers one-third of what they are getting at home.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These are people between the ages of 18 and 21, male labour.  The same mentality applies to female labour.  I can put the Minister in touch with factories that are paying £2 10s. to £3 constantly to female employees.  Is there not a human problem there?  Do we need any productivity council to investigate and see that &ldquo;there is something rotten in the State of Denmark&rdquo; when that is allowed to continue?</P>
      <P>If we are anxious to deal with problems such as those to which I refer and the human factors involved, the Minister has an opportunity of insisting, shall we say, in conjunction with trade unions, that proper payment for work done is given by all industrialists, whether they come as a result of grants or are natives.  That is one of the factors to which I think the Productivity Committee should direct its attention because the human factor counts there just as much as the question of whether a manager should be called &ldquo;Mr. &rdquo; and whether he should consult members of the staff on various changes that are to take place.  The factors I have mentioned are equally important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would refer to the premises that are being acquired in London for the central activities of all our organisations. I understand CTT is one of the contributing groups and I had hoped to hear something about whether the costs are in proportion to the advantages anticipated.  It is a <Col N="188" /> very good idea that we should have in a city such as London a centre in which all our activities can be conducted and that premises should be impressive.</P>
      <P>I do not share the opinions of the previous speaker on many matters and I certainly say that CTT has been a remarkably successful institution, much more successful than I thought it would be when it was formed.  It certainly seems to work; it is producing results.  Its public relations are good and if they are good at selling themselves to me as a public representative, I am sure they are pretty good at the job of selling Irish products to foreigners.  The various directors have been very efficient and the members of the staff I have met abroad have been young Irishmen of very attractive calibre completely devoted to their work.  I have no criticism whatever to offer in respect of this organisation, which I think is doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that CTT is doing an excellent job but that its work is very much hampered by the fact that when it succeeds in getting a market for certain Irish products, that product is not delivered in time, in many cases, and not delivered up to the standard claimed for it when trying to sell it.  It must be extremely frustrating for anybody trying to sell our products abroad, especially in a new market, to find when they have succeeded in getting the market that the product when delivered is not up to standard and they themselves have no control in ensuring that the required standard is met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the cost of the activities of Córas Tráchtála in marketing its products.  We must accept that selling is a very expensive business and I think it would be far better not to attempt to sell in any market unless we do a really good job. The cost of putting a product on the market, especially on a new market, will be very high and we should realise that in advance.  If we have an exhibition anywhere and do a sort of half job on it, it would be better to stay at home because we are simply portraying our ability to produce certain <Col N="189" /> commodities in a way that is anything but favourable.  We must accept that the business is expensive and that CTT, with the limited resources at its disposal and the limited authority it has afterwards to ensure that commodities are delivered up to standard and on time is, on the whole, doing an excellent job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point made by Deputy Cosgrave in opening the debate was in regard to suggested delays in procuring assistance under the market development grants which were made available following the imposition of the 15 per cent surcharge by the British Government.  I think it will be conceded on all sides that the expedition with which this scheme was got going was far beyond the expectations of even industrialists and exporters.</P>
      <P>Immediately the scheme was announced, representatives of industrialists and exporters were interviewed at a fairly exhaustive conference in my Department and a simple and ready method of making these grants available was evolved.  The making of the grants available naturally depended on certain documents but even that was reduced to the actual minimum.  I believe there have been delays but they have been due to the difficulty on the part of some exporters in getting necessary documents, for example, receipts from British customs for the payment of the levy.  Where that arises, we have been in touch with these exporters to see if different forms of verification could be made available to avoid any undue delay.  Generally speaking, the exercise has been done in a very expeditious way and if there are complaints about delays, they are very few, and they arise in the main from delays in getting verification documents from the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Cosgrave referred to the activities of the National Productivity Committee in relation to its advisory services to small firms.  It is true that for these firms it performs a particularly beneficial task.  Being small, they cannot afford, or, if they can, they feel they would be unable to undertake, the expense of industrial <Col N="190" /> consultancy services.  Special teams of the INPC go into these small firms and advise them how best they can improve their production and kindred matters pertaining to their activities. This is, I think, one of the most valuable services of the INPC.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy McQuillan that even though the aspect he discussed in relation to the INPC, that is, labour relations, is not primarily their responsibility &mdash; labour relations are mainly the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; but, in so far as the Human Sciences Committee forms a subsidiary of the INPC, there is of course in the INPC that degree of relationship generally in industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any truth in the Deputy's suggestion &mdash; I do not want to introduce the word &ldquo;truth&rdquo; as against &ldquo;untruth&rdquo;, but I am sure he will appreciate the context in which I use it &mdash; that we go abroad deliberately suggesting that we have cheap labour here.  The IDA, which is the main promotional body for attracting industry to this country, tell the world that we have intelligent and adaptable labour.  When asked about wages, the IDA tell inquirers that they compare favourably with the rates of wages in neighbouring countries.  No attempt whatever is made to induce industrialists to come here on the basis of cheap labour and, as far as wage rates are concerned, these are negotiated in the ordinary way between the representatives of the workers employed and the industrialists who come in here.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked at the outset of his remarks what was the net contribution that Córas Tráchtála made to our export expansion and whether the amount of money we are voting to it is justified in the light of that contribution.  It is difficult to segregate &mdash; in fact it is an impossible task &mdash; from the overall figures the amount represented by the contribution made by Córas Tráchtála activities. The total figures for 1964 are not yet available but the estimated figures for our exports amounted to over £220 million in 1964 as against £196 million <Col N="191" /> in 1963.  Again, I cannot say what contribution the efforts of Córas Tráchtála made to this increase but, in the main, I think its efforts have been devoted to expanding our industrial exports.  The industrial export figures for 1964 are not complete but, if I take the nine months January to October 1963 and compare them with a similar period in 1964, our industrial exports increased from a total of £34 million in 1963 to £44.5 million in 1964.  That represents an increase of some 31 per cent.</P>
    <P>These manufactured goods, I should explain, exclude such items as processed foods, to which Córas Tráchtála also paid particular attention.  Suffice it to say that there is a very significant increase in the export of commodities of the type in which Córas Tráchtála take a special interest.  As I said, while I cannot segregate the amount of that increase due to the work of Córas Tráchtála, certainly there must be represented in that increase a considerable amount due to its promotional efforts.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan it is wrong to diffuse one's efforts too much in this field and Córas Tráchtála does not do that.  In the first place, as the House is aware, Córas Tráchtála is not an exporting body.  It neither makes nor sells goods.  Its main purpose is to help industrialists and exporters to seek out markets and to overcome difficulties in relation to shipping and other matters.  These difficulties can be very numerous indeed.  Above all, it advises industrialists to ensure that the goods they make for export are of the quality required in the particular market in which they seek to sell them and, as well as that, ensure that the follow up of delivery will meet the orders likely to come in.  I was myself associated with one of the special promotions of CTT.  I was in at the planning stage and I was consulted right through until such time as the special display took place.  I attended it.  That was the Lord and Taylor promotion in New York in 1963.  Right through the planning of that, it was impressed on those showing goods that there was no point in exhibiting unless they were <Col N="192" /> prepared to follow up repeat orders, up to standard and delivered on time. I think we can safely claim that that promotion was a success from all aspects, from the point of view of opening up a wide new field of overseas customers to the quality of Irish goods and ensuring that Irish manufacturers could live up to and meet delivery orders and standards of quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been a steady increase since the display on that occasion in the USA in the exports of these commodities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy £ for £ of value but I can assure him that overall there has been a steady increase.  As well as that, there have been similar promotions in other cities in the United States and in Europe.  Córas Tráchtála does not diffuse its efforts to the extent that it seeks to encourage everybody to export.  It emphasises the preference for the export of quality goods.  Having regard to the scale of our production, we realise we cannot compete in mass produced goods with exporters from other countries.  For that reason CTT has taken great pains to emphasise quality and design and it was for this purpose that the functions of industrial design were reposed in Córas Tráchtála.  It might appear from the diversity of representation of Córas Tráchtála that it diffuses its efforts, but that is not so.  Some Deputy referred to the fact that very few State bodies have been as successful in their promotional efforts as Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked about the London premises.  The financing of these premises is not, of course, included in this Supplementary Estimate.  I should say in passing that it was realised for a long time that there was a great need for a central premises in London situated in a prominent place.  Up to now the premises in which CTT could hold trade displays has been in Regent Street.  Because of the conditions of the lease, it was not possible to put up even a plate outside the door.  One has to go down a long hall eventually <Col N="193" /> reaching what are reasonably spacious premises, but the great disability is that there is no shop front.  It lacks the shop front attraction.  Originally it was proposed to get premises on what was to be known as the Monaco site in London.</P>

It would have been necessary at that time to let the portions of the premises not required.  In that case a considerable portion would have to be let.

I gcomháireamh na suime sin táim ag cuíneamh ar an mhéadú ar líon na gComthionól Eadarnáisiúnta&mdash;rud a thaithníonn linn&mdash;atá beartaithe le bheith annseo i rith na bliana seo chughainn.

    <P>Provision of £39,000 is being made under Subhead F in respect of the activities of the Information Section of my Department.  The sum is £15,000 more than that originally provided for in last year's Estimate.  Of the total <Col N="197" /> of £39,000, £15,200 is required for the commissioning of films, £5,800 for the publication of the Department's Weekly Bulletin and £2,500 for the purchase of films on Ireland for use by our missions abroad.  £8,400 is in respect of a reprinting of the booklet &ldquo;Facts about Ireland&rdquo; and £3,600 is in respect of facilities for foreign journalists.</P>
    <P>Developments in recent years such as the visit of President Kennedy and other Heads of State and Government to Ireland, our activities in the United Nations and its peace-keeping operations, the recent upsurge in the economy as well as a growing awareness of the contributions of Irish writers and dramatists to world literature have created greater interest in Ireland abroad.  This interest has in turn brought about an increasing demand for information material from the Department and its Missions. Catering for this demand increases expenditure but it is productive expenditure for any improvement of our information and public relations work abroad makes a contribution to the development of exports and tourism.</P>
    <P>I referred on previous occasions to the difficulties encountered in commissioning two films on modern Ireland, one on economic progress and the other on social progress.  I am glad to report that the film on social progress is now nearing completion and will be available for distribution in the coming months.  Arrangements have been made for the making of the film on economic progress this summer and for its widespread distribution in foreign countries.  Because of the centenary of the birth of W. B. Yeats which falls in June of this year, my Department last year commissioned a short colour film on the Yeats country to commemorate the occasion.  This film will be available for distribution in the near future.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are at present being conducted with major international distributors of school films for the production and distribution of two school films for geography classes, one for secondary schools and the other for elementary schools.  Under the arrangements envisaged the Department <Col N="198" /> would be responsible for the production of the films and the distributors would purchase the films or share the royalties on sales of copies. It is intended that soundtracks in several different languages will be provided.</P>
    <P>The growing interest abroad in Ireland and Irish affairs is reflected in the increasing number of foreign journalists, radio, TV and film publicists who visit Ireland and on whose behalf the Information Section of my Department in co-operation with the Government Information Bureau, Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies makes arrangements and supplies material to facilitate them in carrying out their assignments.</P>
    <P>Last year my Department in conjunction with interested Departments and State-sponsored bodies invited 18 prominent United States and Canadian journalists to visit this country for a week to observe modern developments here.  This was a very satisfactory project and the subsequent reportage in the United States and Canada was extensive and fair.  I want to express warm appreciation to the private firms and individuals throughout the country who co-operated to make the visits a success.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to play an active part in the Council of Europe.  In the context of the movement towards economic integration in Europe the role of the Council has assumed an enhanced importance.  It provides a valuable forum for the exchange of ideas between the two major economic groupings and the other Western European countries, including ourselves. Indeed the problems and prospects of European economic and political unification have occupied a major position in the deliberations of the Consultative Assembly and the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Third Conference of European Ministers of Justice was held in Dublin last May.  The then Minister for Justice was elected Chairman of the Conference and presented a report on measures designed to promote and facilitate the comparative study of <Col N="199" /> laws and jurists.  The Conference reviewed the Council of Europe's activities in the legal field since the last Conference and considered measures for further co-operation in regard to problems of international law and penological questions.</P>
    <P>Irish experts have continued to participate actively in the work of the Social Committee of the Council.  I am happy to say that Ireland was once again offered and accepted six fellowships for personnel in social welfare and a number of training grants for vocational instructors.  As in former years, Ireland was again well represented in the allocation of Council of Europe Medical Fellowships, twelve of these Fellowships being awarded to Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Council of Europe's work is its activity in the cultural field.  The work of the Council for Cultural Co-operation during its first three years was reviewed early last year.  The Council has been continuing its important work in a broad range of cultural subjects. There will be general agreement, I feel sure, that efforts directed towards the preservation of the common European cultural heritage, to which Ireland has contributed and from which she continues to draw inspiration, are of the greatest value.</P>
    <P>The period which has elapsed since the Estimate for the Department was debated here last year has been marked by some encouraging developments on the international scene, but also by events giving grounds for concern.</P>
    <P>The essential character of the détente which has taken place between the East European and Western countries evidenced by the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the communications link between Washington and Moscow and United Nations Resolution prohibiting nuclear weapons in space, has not been changed despite recurrent clashes of interest in different parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The great nuclear powers appear to be fully aware that if nuclear war is to be avoided and if further progress is to be made towards stable peace the further spread of nuclear weapons must be prevented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> But their slowness in negotiating the non-dissemination agreement called for by the United Nations left the way open for another power to become nuclear and has added to the danger of others taking the same road.</P>
    <P>At the current Session of the United Nations General Assembly I emphasised that the acquisition by the People's Republic of China of nuclear weapons capability has made the conclusion of a non-dissemination agreement all the more urgent.  I pointed out that the chances of securing the conclusion of an effective non-dissemination agreement would be greatly enhanced if all the existing nuclear powers were to conclude among themselves an agreement that they would go to the assistance of a non-nuclear State attacked by a nuclear power. The responsibility for securing a non-dissemination agreement is clearly on the shoulders of the nuclear powers. Let us hope they will face up to their responsibilities before other States begin to make nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the current financial crisis of the United Nations has not yet been resolved.  Thirteen member States have now come within the operation of Article 19.  Their continued refusal to accept the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the costs of the United Nations peace-keeping operations strikes a blow not only at the principle of collective financial responsibility but also at the ability of the organisation to mount and maintain a peace-keeping operation when the Security Council has been unable to take action.</P>
    <P>It is important that an early and satisfactory conclusion should be reached on the financial issue if the authority and effectiveness of the organisation is not to be destroyed. But to my mind no solution would be acceptable which would ignore the principle of collective financial responsibility for the expenses of the United Nations activities including its vital peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <P>Our participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus has taken place during the dispute on Article 19, <Col N="201" /> and the present basis of financing that operation is highly unsatisfactory.  As Deputies are aware, the Cyprus peace-keeping operation is being financed by a voluntary fund, and we have declined to accept reimbursement from it for the customary United Nations allowances for our troops.  All told these allowances amount to £500,000 since the first Irish contingent went to Cyprus in April of last year.  This is a heavy financial burden for a country of our size and resources, but we regard it as vital that when our soldiers serve in a United Nations Force their status within it should be clear and unequivocal and that they should be paid and equipped only out of Irish public funds and funds contributed by all the member States of the United Nations as part of their regular assessments.  We regard the £500,000 as a debt due to us by the United Nations and we intend to keep pressing for its repayment.</P>
    <P>I should like here to pay tribute to the high standards which our troops in Cyprus have established and continue to maintain.  We can all be justly proud of them for carrying out their difficult task with courage and tact. They are doing honour to their country and making a vital contribution to the cause of world peace.</P>
    <P>The continuing financial crisis in the United Nations has by no means diminished worldwide awareness of the intrinsic value of United Nations peace-keeping operations.  Last November we attended, in response to an invitation from the Canadian Government, a meeting of military experts who considered the technical aspects of United Nations peace-keeping operations. Representatives from 22 other countries attended and the exchange of views made possible by the meeting served well the general purpose of improving the efficiency of national planning for contingents to be contributed towards United Nations peace-keeping operations.  The value of United Nations peace-keeping forces was, indeed, demonstrated by events in the Congo subsequent to 30th June, 1964, when the last United Nations contingent left the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to attendance at the <Col N="202" /> United Nations General Assembly, Ireland was represented during 1964 on the Committee for International Co-operation Year, the Statistical Commission of the Economic and Social Council, the Economic Commission of Europe and the Special Committee on Technical Assistance to promote the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law, and was represented by an Observer at the 37th Session of the Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, at which Ireland was also represented, recommended that it be established as a permanent organ of the General Assembly in order to provide continuing machinery to deal with trade and development problems on a worldwide basis.  The General Assembly accepted this proposal but left unresolved for the present many practical questions concerning its operation.  The creation of this permanent machinery is likely to have great significance for the future of world trade and of development programmes.</P>
    <P>Our existing commitments towards two joint UN/FAO programmes which have received our support are now nearing completion&mdash;the experimental Three Year World Food Programme to which the Government are contributing £300,000 and the Freedom from Hunger Campaign which was entrusted by the Government to the Irish Red Cross Society and which has realised £132,000 to date earmarked to promote agricultural development in Tanzania.  In general, it appears that both programmes are proving extremely successful.</P>
    <P>This year, 1965, has been designated by the General Assembly as International Co-operation Year and in this country we, as will many other countries, shall be rededicating ourselves to the cause of peace and progress through peaceful collaboration among nations and peoples.  Yesterday, as Deputies are aware, the Taoiseach formally opened this International Co-operation Year when he spoke under the chairmanship of Chief Justice Ó <Col N="203" /> Dálaigh.  The conflicts and dissensions which continually arise to plague mankind should not cause us to forget the very real but little-publicised co-operation that is carried on every day between all nations of the world, even those separated by acute differences.  To bring to the notice of the peoples of the world all that is being done in this field is one of the major objectives of the International Co-operation Year.  We shall endeavour, with the help of Government Departments, the State-sponsored bodies, the Irish United Nations Association and other voluntary bodies, to see to it that this objective is achieved so far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen the provisional figures for our commodity exports for 1964 which show an increase of some £26 million, or 13 per cent approximately over 1963.  This continuing growth in our export trade is encouraging.  I need hardly say that my Department is fully conscious of the necessity to do everything possible to promote exports and other foreign earnings in order to help realise the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> I am satisfied that our diplomatic and consular missions abroad are fully alive to their responsibilities in this field.</P>
    <P>As part of the general effort to redress our trading imbalances with a number of countries, my Department is at present engaged with the other interested Departments in a review of our other existing bilateral trade agreements.  Our Trade Agreements with France, Germany and Finland were successfully renewed during 1964 and negotiations for a further renewal of the Agreement with France are at present in progress in Paris between official delegations from the two countries.  Negotiations for a renewal of the Agreement with Finland for 1965 will commence shortly.  As Deputies are aware, the possibilities of improving our permanent trading arrangements with Britain are the subject of consultation between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to participate fully <Col N="204" /> in the activities of the OECD.  Several of the groups within the Organisation meet at Ministerial level and during 1964 meetings of the Conference of Ministers of Science and the European Conference of Ministers of Transport were attended respectively by the Ministers for Education and Transport and Power.  The meeting of the OECD Council at Ministerial level which I normally attend was held in December, 1964, and, in my absence at the United Nations General Assembly, was attended by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Government Departments concerned and certain interested organisations, such as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Productivity Committee, participate, as necessary, in the Committees of the Organisation.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the pilot study on the long-term needs for educational resources and on that on scientific research and technology in relation to economic growth, both of which were undertaken here under the aegis of OECD.  Deputies will be pleased to know that the study group on the long-term needs for educational resources has now completed its programme and will be presenting its Report shortly. I understand that it is hoped to complete the second project by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the OECD has arranged to hold two Conferences under its auspices in Dublin during 1965, namely, a meeting of Heads of European National Productivity Committees, and a Conference on Operational Research.</P>
    <P>In September, 1960, the Government indicated to the GATT authorities its desire to discuss the terms on which Ireland could accede to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  It was subsequently decided, pending the outcome of our application for membership of the Common Market, to postpone action on our approach to the GATT.  Following the breakdown of the British negotiations with the EEC, our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the GATT was kept under examination by the Government.  The Kennedy Round <Col N="205" /> negotiations afforded an opportunity to renew discussions for the accession of new members to the General Agreement and, in response to an enquiry from the Executive Secretary of the Organisation, the Government informed him that they would be glad to avail of this opportunity to renew discussions on the terms on which we may accede to the General Agreement. It is expected that these discussions will commence in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>We continue to follow closely the various developments in the European Economic Community through the Embassy in Brussels and by occasional visits by Ministers and officials to the Headquarters of the Organisation. Ireland's application for membership of the Community still stands and it is the intention of the Government to proceed with it at the earliest appropriate moment.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to our increased voluntary contributions to various United Nations' agencies which are concerned mainly with programmes affecting developing countries.  Apart from these, we have on a bilateral basis, provided training programmes both for groups and individuals from the developing countries.  The largest group so far received consisted of 38 trainees from Zambia who underwent a year's course in central and local administration, organised by the Institute of Public Administration.  This programme was very successful and has led to the establishment of two further schemes under which four of the original trainees are remaining in this country for further study in the Graduate School of Public Administration and a new group of 12 students has arrived here for another course in administrative training.  In addition, we continue to receive individual trainees sponsored by the United Nations and its specialised agencies for training in a variety of fields.  My Department also continues to act as a national technical assistance recruitment centre for the purpose of co-operating with the United Nations and other specialised agencies in finding qualified Irish experts to assist the developing countries in a wide variety of activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been usual over the past few years in debates of this Estimate, our criticisms of the Minister's statement must be directed towards what is omitted from the statement rather than to what it contains.  It is treating this House and the public almost with derision merely to state in this statement which has been read to the House that it is the Government's intention to proceed at the earliest appropriate moment with our application for membership of the European Economic Community.  It is merely a banal statement which is of little significance.  The public is entitled to know what the Government's policy is with regard to our relations towards the European Economic Community. For many years we have been pressing the Government to indicate what they intend to do and I do not think we are wrong in expressing our dissatisfaction with the way this House and the country are being treated in this regard.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind that the Government's whole economic programme is based on a number of assumptions. One of the strange assumptions is that we are to get a four per cent growth rate each year and by a series of mathematical calculations how this four per cent is to be arrived at is worked out.  It is one of the basic assumptions of the Second Programme, as stated in page 10, that Ireland will be in the Community before 1970.  We are now in 1965.  Anybody with any knowledge of European affairs, and in particular recent developments in England, knows that the likelihood of a British initiative in this regard is very remote and the likelihood of British membership by 1970 is remoter still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Programme goes further than that because, having discussed the paper targets for agriculture that are set out in the programme, it states specifically that these targets can be reached only in the context of our participation in international agreements in regard to basic foodstuffs.  The statement is made that these targets are based on the assumption that we will be in the European Economic Community in the second half of the 1960s. <Col N="207" /> We therefore have a Government whose economic programme is to a considerable extent based on the fact that we are going to be in the EEC by 1970, and now in 1965 its Minister for External Affairs refuses to say anything with regard to the position with which this country is now faced.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have informed the House what he thinks our chances are of furthering our economic co-operation with the European Economic Community.  We have in the past, with justification, criticised the Government for failing to grasp the opportunities which were there for building up goodwill for this country in the EEC.  As long as we are regarded as a pale appendage to Britain, we are not going to get very far with our application to the European Economic Community. I appreciate the considerable difficulties involved in this problem.  I fully appreciate the fact that our close proximity to the British markets and our trading arrangements with England raise matters of great difficulty but the fact remains there are areas of independent initiative available to us.</P>
    <P>The situation in the EEC has changed.  At one time the opinion seemed to be that the applications to the EEC would have to be in the form of applications for full membership but as the years have developed new forms of arrangements have also been developed.  The two countries, Greece and Turkey, have treaties of association which involve, over 20 years, the countries coming closer to the EEC and the anticipation of customs unions at the end of the period.  Iran and Israel have entered into trade agreements with the EEC.  I want to suggest to the Minister that I believe the climate is suitable at present for Ireland's initiative towards endeavouring to make a trade agreement with the EEC.  I fully appreciate that the areas of this agreement might be small initially but the important thing is the contacts that can be made between this country and the European Economic Community and equally important is the goodwill we can build up and the interest we <Col N="208" /> can show in this important development in Europe.</P>
    <P>Attached to the agreements which Iran and Israel have entered into are joint committees, and if we were to enter into a trade agreement, even though initially it might be confined to a small amount of products, the establishment of a joint Irish-EEC committee would bring about these sorts of contacts in the initial stages which are necessary to bring about eventual association and, in the long run, membership of the EEC.  It seems to me that the Minister should inform us and inform the country not merely that our application still stands and that we will move at the appropriate time, but what it is proposed to do in regard to our relations with the EEC and whether or not he believes it possible to take the initiative on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Another remarkable omission from the Minister's speech has been any reference to the recent development of the meetings between our Government and the Government of Northern Ireland.  It seems to me extraordinary in a debate like this, where from time to time it has been customary to discuss our relations with Northern Ireland, that there should be no information about these very significant developments.  We on this side of the House have been urging co-operation between the two parts of the country for many years past.  We regard such co-operation as being one of the principal means by which the prejudices and antagonisms between Irishmen can be broken down.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile recalling that we not only urged co-operation but brought about co-operation.  It is worthwhile recalling that the inter-Party Government co-operated on the Great Northern Railway problem and also the Foyle Fisheries for which there were counterparts in Northern Ireland. It is many years since I suggested a form of co-operation which could be carried on between the two parts of the country.  This is in the legal field. We treat Northern Ireland as a foreign Government for the purpose of serving writs out of the jurisdiction, and <Col N="209" /> Northern Ireland treats this part of the country as a foreign country, and one must apply to the courts for liberty to serve on a resident of Northern Ireland.  Surely there could be an arrangement here to treat the two parts as one?  The question of enforcing judgments is another area in which we could undertake to enforce judgments of the courts in each part of the country.  There are many areas in which co-operation in the legal and other fields could come about and we would welcome a statement from the Minister as to what concrete proposals he would suggest as to how the desired co-operation can be effected.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in the Minister's speech to which I want to refer, that is, the proposed film on social and economic progress.  Is this to be a propaganda film or an honest film? Will it have photographs of happy children in playgrounds or in new houses or in hospitals with fine sunshine or will it contain the truth?  If we are to have the truth, I could bring the camera team to a house in Finglas in which 20 people are living in a threebedroom Corporation dwelling, or show them a mentally handicapped child who cannot get accommodation because we have not got proper facilities for mentally handicapped children, or I could bring the Minister and the team of photographers to Griffith Barracks.  I suspect that the film will be largely a propaganda one.  Presumably this will be for foreign consumption but I would advise the Minister that people are becoming more sophisticated and if it is to be a film to demonstrate social progress, with little reality about the social conditions, it is likely to do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>One of the matters to which we have referred in previous years has been the China policy of the Government.  This policy has been characterised by vacillation, by lack of principle, or by pure expediency.  There is a case made for admitting Red China to the United Nations.  There is a case to be made against keeping her out of the United Nations at present.  Those in favour of the admission of Red China will say that it is necessary for international <Col N="210" /> organisations such as the United Nations to reflect the realities of the world and bringing her in may be some help in disciplining and educating China in the realities of world politics. Those against her admission point to the fantastic difficulties that would arise if you had another large communist state in the organisation, and to the fact that you are going to admit China to the organisation without getting any <i>quid pro quo.</i> I am perfectly satisfied where the balance of the arguments lie.  I think the balance lies against admitting China at present unless very specific forms of <i>quid pro quo</i>, which at present will not be obtained, are forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I said that there is a case to be made in favour of the admission of Red China and that there is a case to be made against the admission of China to the United Nations but there is no case for the way in which this Government have handled the problem.  First of all, we had the Minister stating in a short speech when he went there first that we were voting in favour of a discussion of the problem.  This was a legal quibble on the Minister's part.  As anybody who reads the debates of the General Assembly knows, although these debates took place on the purely procedural point, the merits of the case were fully debated and all the speakers dealt with the question of whether or not they were in favour of the admission of Red China.  To speak on the basis that he was interested in whether the matter should be discussed was to ignore the realities of the situation and the debate and left the impression that he was either not aware of what was going on or that he was not being completely honest when he said he was interested only in the procedural issue.</P>
    <P>One will realise the realities of the situation if one reads Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien's book but the Government's attitude was made clearer in the events that followed.  In 1961, the Minister stated that he was not in favour of the admission of Communist China unless he got specific undertakings with regard to freedom of elections and the restoration of freedom in its own <Col N="211" /> country.  On 11th September the Minister told the Assembly:</P>
    <P>On an earlier occasion, I suggested here in the Assembly that before any substantive decisions were taken, an effort should be made through negotiation to secure from the Peiping Government an undertaking to refrain from the use of force against any of their neighbours, to respect the personal rights and liberties of the Chinese people and to allow the people of all Korea to decide their own destiny freely in an internationally supervised election. As I indicated in previous years, the nature of the assurances forthcoming regarding these vital matters which are already covered by the principles of the Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights, must determine the final decision of the Irish Government on the issue before us.</P>
    <P>This statement can be criticised as being rather <i>jejeune</i> on the Minister's part.  To think that he was going to get an undertaking from the Peiping Government that they would not use force, that they would restore freedom to their own people and that they would agree to free elections in Korea was definitely naive.</P>
    <P>However, this was the policy, that they required these undertakings, and that if they got them, it would determine the final decision of the Irish Government.  That was in 1961.  But in 1962 we voted against the admission of Red China.  A few weeks ago, the matter came up again and there has been a significant change in the attitude of the Minister to the problem. His speech on this occasion reads:</P>
    <P>Though we are all inclined, from time to time, to cavil at the right of veto possessed by the members of the Security Council, I think we should accept the present division of power and responsibility between them and the rest of our members as a realistic division and a reasonable compromise in the circumstances of the world today.  The whole constitutional position would, of course, be greatly clarified and strengthened if the five nuclear powers occupied <Col N="212" /> the five permanent seats in the Security Council.  But, however desirable it might be to have the People's Republic of China as a member of the Security Council, particularly now that it has become the fifth nuclear power, it would, in my opinion, be intolerable that this should be done by denying Taiwan and its twelve million people a right to membership of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputies should note where the shift has been.  It is now desirable that China should have a seat on the Security Council; it would strengthen and clarify the whole constitutional position if the five nuclear powers occupied the five permanent seats in the Security Council.  It is then suggested that the interests of Taiwan should be protected in some way.  Of course they should be, but the realities of the situation are that probably within the next year or two years the requisite two-thirds majority for the admission of Red China will be obtained and the problem of securing the protection of the Taiwan Government and of Formosa will be a real one.</P>
    <P>The point is that the required undertaking has not been obtained, the undertaking that there should be free elections in Korea, the undertaking that there should be freedom for their own people and the undertaking that they would not use force against their neighbours.  It is now desirable that China should be a member of the Security Council but that there must be protection for Taiwan.  The Government have now changed their policy on Red China, a policy they considered for years past to be the right one but a policy which got the support of neither of the protagonists.  The Government's attitude has indicated so many shifts that it cannot have done any good to our reputation in the United Nations Assembly.</P>
    <P>In previous years, we have discussed on this Estimate the plight of our emigrants in Great Britain.  I do not want to go over all this again, but we, as a community, have a responsibility for our people in Britain.  I do not accept <Col N="213" /> the view that the majority of our people go to Britain because they like it.  The majority of our emigrants go to Britain because they cannot get a decent standard of living at home and some of the conditions in which they live are appalling.  We have got to use what resources we have in the way that justice demands.  I know it is a case of limited resources but I think that we are justified in helping our emigrants. I think it is the duty of our Embassy in London to have a welfare and probation service and also to assist financially the voluntary organisations working there.  The fact that the problem is such a great one is no excuse for doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>These are the principal matters to which I wish to refer on this Estimate but there is one final matter on which we should have more information.  We, and the troops in Cyprus, would like to know how long they are to be there. I join with the Minister in the praise he has given to the manner in which our troops have conducted themselves in very delicate circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have a very considerable interest in this matter.  We are paying these troops and, while we are a small country with limited resources, we are playing a considerable part in the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.  In this way we are entitled to have a say in these matters.  The Government must have some information as to the situation in Cyprus and as to whether we have passed the flash point, whether it would now be safe to reduce or withdraw our troops. These are matters on which we should get more information and I regret that on this and other matters to which I have referred the Minister's speech has been so lacking in the information to which the House is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to open my remarks on this Estimate by joining with Deputy Costello in asking the Minister to give the House some information about the position in Cyprus.  I do so for somewhat different reasons from those given by Deputy Costello.  The Minister has referred to the wonderful work done by the Irish <Col N="214" /> troops in the Congo and the excellent way they have comported themselves both there and in Cyprus.  I agree completely with his remarks in that regard but there is a wider matter, a more fundamental matter, which has not been mentioned here for a considerable time.  The last time it was mentioned was when Irish troops were &mdash; shall we describe it &mdash; murdered in the course of duty in the Congo.  There was a sudden flurry of interest then amongst politicians and the public as to how the troops were being looked after and on what basis they were sent to particular places.</P>
      <P>I want to put clearly to the Minister that he has a responsibility to the country to clarify his own position in this regard.  The Irish contingent, both in the Congo and in Cyprus, are part of a peace-keeping force sent there by the United Nations. It is accepted as beyond contradiction that only a limited number of countries were considered suitable from all points of view to allow their troops into these troubled areas.  Ireland, India, Sweden and Ghana were the principal countries involved.</P>
      <P>The main reason Ireland was selected was that the Minister for External Affairs himself had said, and repeated, in the United Nations that Ireland was a neutral country, that we did not belong to any power <i>bloc</i> in Europe, that we were not tied to the Americans' tail or the Russians, that we were not part of any power <i>bloc</i> in the world and were free to make our own decisions, irrespective of pressure brought on us by any country in the world, big or small.  That was a brave and highly admirable attitude to adopt in the United Nations and one with which I agree and I still believe it is the correct one for this country to adopt and pursue.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say here before this debate concludes why the Government are altering their decision in that regard and where the Minister himself stands with the Government on the change of policy which has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated &mdash; I do <Col N="215" /> not want to bore the House by rehashing discussions that have taken place here before &mdash; that we are no longer neutral and that it is our most ardent desire to take part in a west European power <i>bloc</i>; that we are prepared to accept in that <i>bloc</i> all the defence and military commitments which membership of the group would entail.  The Government are entitled to change their mind and alter their course but, while the Government have altered their course on such a fundamental matter as neutrality, at the same time we are sending our young boys to Cyprus, where I sincerely hope nothing will happen.  We are still sending them to Cyprus on the assumption of the United Nations that Ireland is uncommitted and, because she is uncommitted, she is acceptable in the peace-keeping force.</P>
    <P>The reason we hear no talk at the moment is that no really serious problems regarding the lives or security of our young men has come up in recent months.  I hope that position continues.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot pretend to the world we are uncommitted, that we are prepared to take a completely free and independent stand in the United Nations, that we are prepared to allow our boys to be sacrificed or killed on that basis while, at the same time, the Government show a second face to Europe in saying that we are prepared to accept the defence and political commitments of a west European power <i>bloc.</i></P>
    <P>I should like to know whether this is the stand of the Minister for External Affairs on Government policy.  After all, this House supported, to my knowledge, the stand he took in the United Nations.  Has he altered his view and agreed with the present attitude and decision taken by his Taoiseach?  That is something we should be told in this debate.  I want to get a comment on the position of our troops.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this, apart from the neutrality end of it, which I think should be clarified.  I think the present occupant of Áras an Uachtaráin is still of the opinion that the Party to <Col N="216" /> which he belonged is still committed to the idea that neutrality was a good idea and should still be pursued.  In his words of sympathy very recently on the death of a statesman in the next country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very arguable and some opportunity should be given to discuss it, but I am using it only in this context of saying that the present Government, who are his kind, are evidently changing from that position.

      <P>They pretended they were neutral but, as far as Government policy was concerned, even the final honours were paid to the then Füehrer by this Government.  All of a sudden, we have this change.  We are no longer neutral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to this question of Ireland's application in the economic sense for admission to the EEC. According to the Minister's remarks in his opening statement, Ireland's application still stands for full membership. I do not know what sense of reality the Minister had in this at all or did he put this in just because the Taoiseach expected him to do it?  I do know the people are expected, and believed by some political Parties, to have short memories, that you can say something and in two or three years time the public will have forgotten it.  How many of us here remember when the <Col N="217" /> present Taoiseach took his bag with the deeds of this country in it and hawked them around every European country to see if he would get a buyer? I want to make it clear, when he did that, the two major Parties in this House were committed, not to any question of associate membership of the EEC but to full membership.  We were saved from disaster in that regard by the decision of de Gaulle of France at that particular time.  This country was completely unready to face the highly skilled European industrial groups.  Our Irish industries and our Irish farmers were not in a position to stand up to the full blast of competition which they would have to face as members of that Community.  That was a highly irresponsible attitude to take.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that many of those people are now changing their view and saying that some form of associate membership is desirable.  When people said that in this House, the Taoiseach stood out against it.  He said there was no such possibility of a link of that character.  We had his Minister for Agriculture coming back last week from Europe and the first statement he made was that he was misquoted in the papers.  When he had discussions abroad, he put his foot in it and said he was attracted to the idea of some form of link or trade agreement with the EEC countries.  When he returned, he said we were interested only in full membership.  Why are the Government not honest and say the idea of full membership has gone by the board?</P>
    <P>We had this Minister and his Taoiseach telling us we are Europeans, we were always Europeans.  If this Government were serious about closer association with Europe, is it not a fact the greatest attention would be paid by the Department of External Affairs and other bodies responsible to the study of European languages?  Is it not a fact that the initial rush or burst of enthusiasm two years ago, in relation to the Common Market, to study European languages has all gone by the board now?  I remember in parts of rural Ireland the ludicrous position of people going two hours a week to learn French because they thought we <Col N="218" /> were going into the Common Market in a few months.  That has all gone by the board now.  The Government and the Minister for External Affairs tell us our application for full membership still stands.  It would not be unfair to say that as far as we are concerned at the present time the greatest danger in Ireland is that we are going to become a pleasure ground for the wealthy people in Western Europe in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against the idea of welcoming all these people as tourists and encouraging them to spend their money here.  What is the position with regard to these people with whom we are so anxious to join?  In fact they are joining us here by buying us up, buying our hotels, cities, towns, pleasure resorts and buying our scenic areas throughout the country.  That is the membership we are getting at the moment.  As I said, I consider we are entitled to a statement from the Minister as to where he stands on this question of the Irish position in the United Nations and of the Irish troops in Cyprus?  Are we, as the Minister has said before, uncommitted, no part of a particular <i>bloc</i> in any part of the world?  Is that still the position?</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to mention is the question of Partition.  It is extraordinary that in the debate each year on the Department of External Affairs there has been a pious reference to Partition but that significantly this year this is no longer looked upon as a matter for External Affairs.  It would appear that the Government are fully accepting the idea that Partition now is purely a matter for the two parts of Ireland.  Other years the Department of External Affairs carried a reference to what the Government were doing about Partition but that is left out this year.  We had the Taoiseach telling me yesterday that it was a question, to a great extent, for Irishmen themselves. Have the Government taken the view that the stepping stones which they helped to remove many years ago will now be replaced by them and that that is something which should have been done a long time ago?</P>
    <P>We all welcome the idea of co-operation and we all welcome the idea <Col N="219" /> of Irishmen being able to sit down as civilised persons, no matter which part of the country they come from and hammer out their differences.  I want to know from the Minister, at this stage, especially in view of the Taoiseach's ability to change his policy overnight on so many issues, is he prepared to take a stand on any particular line?  Was it on his advice, or on the advice of the Minister for External Affairs, that those in the Six Counties who call themselves Nationalists, should become the formal Opposition in the Six Counties Parliament?  We are entitled to know following the discussions which have taken place if the advice to these socalled Nationalists was to go in now as the formal Opposition up there? Was that advice given?  The House and the people are entitled to know what that advice was.  The belief at the moment at any rate is that the group in the North, who now constitute themselves what is known as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, were told to take up that position by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should clarify that situation.</P>
    <P>I shall move now to another matter, to which reference was made by Deputy D. Costello, that is, the two films mentioned in the Minister's Estimate.  I shall refer briefly to only one, the film on social conditions. Under Subhead F, there is an increased provision of £15,000 for film projects.  The Minister and his Department are about to make a film on social progress here in Ireland.  I should like to join with Deputy D. Costello in asking what is the theme of this film?  What is it hoped to portray?  Will it attempt to say we have gone much further in the field of social progress since the original pension of 5/- was given, under an earlier Government?  We should forget about a film of that nature at this stage because, if it is honest, it will shock the people.  Perhaps that would be a good thing.  If it gives facts, there will be many people in Ireland, and outside, depressed to learn things can be so bad.  If it shows that considerable progress has been made, then it <Col N="220" /> would do an injury all round and would be a source of embarrassment.</P>
    <P>If we want to measure the social progress that has been made, we need only look at our county homes.  There has been no change in many of them for the past 50 years.  They are still gloomy, damp structures to which old people are consigned and forgotten about, as if they were sent to concentration camps.  Where is the social progress there?  What social progress can be pointed to when we come to deal with children who are physically and mentally handicapped? Every Deputy from rural Ireland has to try to get at least two or three such children into an institution or establishment each week.  I have known children who had to wait two, three, or even four years, for admission to an institution for treatment.  Then they reach an age at which they are no longer acceptable because they are over the age limit. Those children are consigned to a life of misery, with no hope.  Is that social progress?  The Minister tells us about a film that is to be made here.  Will it deal with the health services, the old age pensioners, the sick?  I think that expenditure should be scrapped.  I disapprove of the idea of such a film unless the stark facts are given.</P>
    <P>The Department of External Affairs have been interesting themselves in matters of trade, commerce and industry, and in getting markets for our produce.  That is highly desirable but we could go a good bit further in that field.  It is high time we had representatives in all the countries with which we trade.  If we trade in a big way with other countries, we should have representatives in those countries.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I should like to deal has been raised on other occasions.  The Minister has a responsibility to dovetail and bring together all the groups working in England, and particularly in London.  The short-sighted policy which has not secured suitable premises which could be described as an Irish House deserves the greatest criticism.  We had another Minister a few moments ago telling us the premises that could have been <Col N="221" /> obtained by Córas Tráchtála were too big for their purposes.  In fact, the Department of External Affairs should have had the responsibility of taking a decision in that regard, not Córas Tráchtála.  The Finnish Government have allowed their section dealing with external affairs in London to set up a Finnish House where cultural and economic activities are dovetailed, tourist facilities are made known, and where there is a display centre for their produce, all under one roof.  I appreciate that that would be a very expensive proposition but the outlay would be recouped in no time at all.  We would save the rent of the various separate establishments which are there at the moment and which, to my mind, are not suitable from the point of view of people who are interested in coming to Ireland.  There should be no such thing as having to go from one house to another to find out what you want to know about Ireland, or the different aspects of the country in the industrial or tourist fields.  The Department of External Affairs should have all those things under their wing in one centre.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal in a very brief manner with the position of Irish emigrants.  I do not know what the Minister's view is on helping our people in England, but I think one of the most effective ways of solving the problem of emigration would be to give the vote to the Irish emigrant. Let him vote while he is residing over there.  Give him a postal vote in Ireland. The majority of our Irish boys and girls were driven out by economic necessity, and they are entitled to show their approval or disapproval of the Government who are responsible, through not providing employment for them, for sending them abroad.  They are entitled to express their views whether they are abroad or at home. Americans in Europe are allowed a postal vote or can vote in the Embassies.  The same thing could be arranged for Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>We would soon find that our emigrants would exercise a very valuable influence here.  By expressing their views in the ballot box, they would <Col N="222" /> alter the situation in this Chamber to such an extent that it would soon be possible to close the ballot boxes in London because we would have a Government here who were ready to listen to them and prepared to take the necessary steps to provide employment here.  That would solve the problems of the Irish emigrants in Britain today.  That is a first step and a most effective way to help our emigrants. They are not interested in the paternalistic do-gooders.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of visiting various Irish centres in London and it is a well-known fact that the majority of our people will not go there because they feel they are being looked down on.  Some people have good intentions but they are inclined to say: &ldquo;We will save your souls and give you a fortnight's shelter in this place or that hostel.&rdquo;  I want to make it clear that I have talked to Irish people in London on many occasions and they turn away and say: &ldquo;We are not going near that place.&rdquo;  They must be left their independence and the feeling that they are regarded as human beings.  They would like to have the power to express their views in a way that would count, that is, through the ballot boxes, and I would ask the Minister to give consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I see in the Estimate a small item of £200 for the repatriation and maintenance of destitute persons abroad.  I should like to know to whom that refers.  Does it refer to students who, as students do, run out of funds, or to people who, through no fault of their own, lose their money while travelling abroad?  I do not know what it means. If it means the persons to whom I have referred, I think that is not the proper description of funds to help people to pay their fare back home.  They should not be described in those terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed his views on many matters.  He has spoken on the issue of apartheid and condemned it.  I should like him to use his very valuable influence as soon as possible to discourage a visit here by a South African rugby team.  I want to make it clear when I speak on this matter that I <Col N="223" /> have seldom played the game of rugby. I hope it will not be looked upon as impertinence on my part, and that it will not be said that, because I played another code, I should not comment on activities in the rugby sphere.  Personally, I never supported the idea of the ban in the Gaelic code and in any little activities I had, or any association I had with officials of the GAA, I always said there should never be a ban.  I mention that so that, when I do comment on this rugby team coming from South Africa, it will be quite clear that I think it is a horrifying thing to find the discrimination that exists.</P>
    <P>Let us not be misled by people who say politics should not be brought into sport; the fact is that politics have been brought into sport by the South African people.  They are out to demean the human being and therefore they should not be given the Irish céad míle fáilte.  A message should be sent to them telling them to stay at home.  I ask the Minister for External Affairs to make these views known. After all, I am not asking the House to give further consideration to the idea of sanctions against South Africa; I am merely asking the Minister to show in a very practical way that this Government disapprove of the idea of apartheid.  There is a very practical way of expressing this view in a very short time if the Minister takes the action I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister for External Affairs that in the context of the world situation in which we are at present living, his statement here today was grossly inadequate. It is the kind of statement that Samuel Hoare was making about 1936, bland, treacly, soothing, breathing the atmosphere of <i>détente</i> in a world in which the realities are very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some minor matters and matters of purely local interest to which I should like to refer before returning to that theme.  I concede the right of the Government Party to make all the propaganda they can but now that the tea parties in Stormont and the lunches at Iveagh House are over, <Col N="224" /> all the photographs taken and all the publicity releases put out, I think it astonishing that the Minister for External Affairs should approach Dáil Éireann and, having made the welkin ring through every medium of publicity at his disposal in regard to this round of social entertainment between the Taoiseach and Captain O'Neill, the Prime Minister of Stormont, should communicate not one word to Dáil Éireann as to where we are hoping to go from here.</P>
    <P>There have been vague assertions that we are going to embark on a programme of co-operation.  I am often bewildered by the ability of the Government not only to indulge in self-deception but to attempt the deception of and fraudulent misrepresentation on the people.  Does anybody really imagine that for the past 20 years there has been no contact between the Government of Northern Ireland and the Government here?  I do not suppose when I was Minister for Agriculture at two different periods that a day ever passed when we were not in telephonic communication with the Department of Agriculture in Belfast, perhaps two or three times every day. There was never an outbreak of animal disease in Northern Ireland during which they did not borrow vets from us and there was never an outbreak of animal disease in this part of the country when we did not borrow vets from them.  Does anybody imagine that the Department of Industry and Commerce is not in daily contact with the corresponding Department in Belfast and has not been every day of the past 20 years?  Does anybody pretend to ignore the fact &mdash; the legality of which I very much doubt &mdash; that the Garda Síochána dump fellows across the Border whom they know to be wanted for misdemeanours in Northern Ireland or that the RUC in the North dump fellows across the Border whom they know to be wanted in the Republic?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that the Governments in Northern Ireland and the Republic combined to purchase the Foyle Fisheries from a London company some 15 years ago <Col N="225" /> and that at this moment we own them jointly in the Six Counties and the Republic and that every alternate year there is a chairman from Northern Ireland and a chairman from the Republic.  Everybody can remember when there was a threat to close down the Great Northern Railway Company, we jointly purchased it and for some time there was a chairman from Northern Ireland and a chairman from the Republic, until a further subdivision was made and we took over those lines in our part of the country and the Northern Government took over the parts of the line operating in the Six Counties.  All this, I think, is excellent and it is an excellent thing that personal contact should be made between the Taoiseach here and the Prime Minister at Stormont and between Ministers here and Ministers in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I well remember the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland coming to visit me when I was Minister for Agriculture.  I am sure other Ministers frequently visited their opposite members here over the past 20 years.  All that is good, but I should like to know, and I think we are entitled to know, from the Minister for External Affairs what further fields of co-operation they now have in mind.</P>
    <P>So far as drainage is concerned, I believe reciprocal activity is well established. I believe reciprocal co-operation is well established in agriculture.  So far as fishery matters are concerned, I believe reciprocal activity is well established.  So far as transport is concerned, we even combined to provide a bus service from Derry and Monaghan to Dublin.  This is at present functioning as a result of collaboration between the two Ministries and transport authorities north and south.  I feel justified in asking the Minister, apart from propaganda, what additional fields of mutual co-operation has he in mind between ourselves and the people of Northern Ireland?  Any constructive advance on those lines will be heartily welcomed on this side of the House but I think it is rendered more difficult rather than easier by the excessive desire on the part of the present Government to hold themselves out as <Col N="226" /> the first authority in this country ever concerned to live in peace and harmony with our neighbours on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>A great deal of talk goes on about the European Economic Community and Ireland's relations with it.  A great deal of the confusion that has been aroused has resulted, I think, from the Government's ambiguous attitude towards the European Economic Community.  They have repeatedly emphasised that their entire policy is founded on the assumption that we will enjoy full membership before the end of this decade and, in some of their publications, they have said in the latter half of the 1960s.  Of course, that bears little relation really to reality, as we have repeatedly pointed out, because full membership of the European Economic Community by this country is out of the question if Great Britain remains outside the Community; and, if Great Britain enters the Community, membership in some form becomes indispensable to us, lest the common tariff of the Community should come between us and our access to our traditional markets in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There certainly does not seem to be much prospect, at present, in any case, of Great Britain pursuing the realisation of full membership for Great Britain of the European Economic Community.  Nevertheless, there remains in the minds of many here a belief that we can get some peculiar advantage out of a trade agreement with the European Economic Community as such, which is not available to us by the bilateral trade agreements we have at the present time with the several members of the Community.  I feel that belief is open to doubt, unless there is some clear statement to the effect that the alternatives have been examined on their merits, this kind of talk will continue, with resultant confusion in the public mind.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt whether a trade agreement with the European Economic Community will yield any more substantial benefits to this country than bilateral agreements with the <Col N="227" /> several members of the Community give, bilateral agreements which are kept under pretty constant review. But, so long as there is a belief that there is available to this country some special advantage through a trade agreement with the European Economic Community, a great many people will continue to yearn after that and say that, if we had such an agreement, many of the difficulties with which we have at present to contend would disappear.</P>
    <P>There is only one satisfactory way of disposing of that line of thought, that is, for the Government to say that we are prepared to discuss with the European Economic Community the possibility of a trade agreement and then come back to this House and say: &ldquo;We have discussed with the Authority in Brussels the possibility of a trade agreement with the European Economic Community.  Here are the terms we are offered.  We do not think they are any better than the terms we have got through the bilateral trade treaties already in existence.  We will not, therefore, proceed with any further negotiation for a trade treaty which gives us nothing more than we already have and, in some respects, perhaps less than we at present enjoy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Until the Government are in a position to say that particularly in regard to the agricultural industry, I think a great deal of confusion will continue to exist, and a vague kind of belief will continue to prevail that, through a trade agreement with the European Economic Community, vast areas of extended markets might be made available to us, markets not available at the present time for want of the existence of such an agreement, and the sooner the Government take effective measures to clarify that unsatisfactory position the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    <P>The Government are sometimes a bit loth, I think, to remind people that the present position is that more than 70 per cent of our entire trade is done with Great Britain and, so far as the output of our agricultural industry is concerned, which constitutes nearly 70 <Col N="228" /> per cent of our entire export trade, a far higher percentage of that agricultural trade is with Great Britain; and, if it were not, it would not be as profitable as it now is.  These are fundamental facts from which we cannot escape and we might as well face them.  I believe we can better face them if illusory concepts about access to the European Economic Community through a trade agreement are either dispelled or finally determined.</P>
    <P>I do not exclude the possibility that there is, perhaps, some wholly unexploited opportunity there about which I know nothing, but what is important is that certainty should be arrived at and there is no means of arriving at certainly unless we try to find out at the highest level, putting ourselves in a position to say: &ldquo;The best terms we could get in an agreement of this character are terms we could not accept.  Here they are and there are the reasons why we could not accept them.&rdquo;  Unless and until we are in a position to say that to our own people, there will continue to be a considerable volume of belief that there is something there for the asking of which we are being deprived for the lack of diligence on the part of our Government representatives.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word now about our emigrants in Britain.  I approached this matter with the utmost circumspection last year and the year before because it is a matter of considerable delicacy and my views in regard to it are not the same at all as those expressed by Deputy McQuillan.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether people in Great Britain or outside it have or have not the vote.  I do not think it matters a damn and I believe that, if they had it, they would not use it.  If they want to vote, they should come home and vote here.  I do not think their circumstances are in any way analagous to those which obtain in relation to United States nationals living abroad.  They are free men and women and those amongst them who are mature can as a rule look after themselves.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that the vast bulk of our people who go to Great Britain, the United States of America, <Col N="229" /> or elsewhere, as emigrants do extremely well and constitute a very valuable element in the society in which they find themselves.  In the United States, in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand, and wherever else they go, they are acknowledged by their adopted country to be a very valuable element in society.  It is, however, wrong for us to close our eyes, in my opinion, to the fact that there is a percentage of young boys and girls leaving this country who we ourselves feel are going to Great Britain too young, and without proper preparation, and who are being absorbed into the British urban proletariat with disastrous moral consequences to some.</P>
    <P>The reason for the disastrous character of the consequences is very largely their own innocence and the strict moral atmosphere in which they were born and reared in this country. They find themselves suddenly launched into an entirely different kind of society and, before they fully realise whither they are going, they are involved in trouble.  If, at that stage, there was some helping hand to come to their assistance the troubles might be overcome.  But once they get lost in the anonymous mass of the proletarian urban population and have acquired a record of which they are ashamed, they are very often unduly weighted by the consciousness of their own guilt at having got into trouble.</P>
    <P>If they had the maturity and wisdom to know that if they came to their friends, older people would understand their lapses and be glad and happy to help them on their feet again, then their rescue would be relatively simple. But the tragedy, in both boys and girls, is that not infrequently not only will they not look for help but those who seek to find them in order to give them help find that in their sense of guilt, confusion and shame, very often they avoid contact with their own and are more deeply lost than ever.</P>
    <P>This is not a problem to which we can conscientiously shut our eyes.  I know it involves a special form of social work which is not easy to undertake. I have suggested that possibly some sort of voluntary effort, or quasivoluntary <Col N="230" /> effort, like a peace corps, might be established in some of the bigger cities in England to work in co-operation with some of the social organisations there whose personnel are already hopelessly taxed, to go to the aid of such young people.  I believe such a service could make contact with the police courts in England to supplement the probation system of the courts whose personnel are enormously overtaxed by the ordinary run of the mill cases pouring from the police courts and which the probation officers are expected to give attention to.  Those officers naturally cannot find time to give special attention to any Irish boy or girl who has become corrupted.</P>
    <P>I do not deny the delicacy or the intricacy of this problem.  It would be a great mistake for us to create an atmosphere suggesting that the bulk of our people going abroad are quasi-criminal. At the same time, I do not think it is right to close our eyes to the fact that our boys and girls going to England are too young, too inexperienced, and as a result are getting into trouble.  We ought to concern ourselves to help them.  I fully acknowledge we cannot set up a duplicating social service system in Great Britain.  Nobody suggests we should.  What we should do is to seek ways and means of supplementing the very inadequate resources at present available for rescuing those in trouble, seeking them out, getting them home where that is the appropriate treatment, or else getting them away to a new start, if that is the most salutary procedure in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech today on the world situation, one was reminded of Sir Samuel Hoare in 1936. He said:</P>
    <P>The essential character of the <i>détente</i> which has taken place between the East European and Western countries evidenced by the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the communications link between Washington and Moscow and United Nations Resolution prohibiting nuclear weapons in space, has not been changed despite recurrent clashes of interest in different parts of the globe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Baldwin might have said that in 1936. That breathes the very atmosphere of the umbrella.  Mind you, I have great sympathy with people in a troubled world who are inclined to furl their umbrellas and say: &ldquo;So long as we have an umbrella, we can breathe an atmosphere of normality.&rdquo;  There is not any <i>détente</i> in the world.  It is the purest illusion, simply the classic doctrine of the Cominform.  There are moments when the Cominform think it wise to create a general atmosphere of relaxation until such time as they find it expedient to strike again.</P>
    <P>I imagine many elements of public opinion in America thought the <i>détente</i> atmosphere was very valuable.  I wonder if they think it is now, when the stress has been transferred from Cuba to Vietnam.  It is not so long since it was on the Indian border.  The plain and inescapable fact is &mdash; it is one free men in a country like this ought to keep constantly before their minds &mdash; that the only effective <i>détente</i> in the world is a combination of free nations, strong enough to ensure that the Cominform cannot successfully attack them.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy McQuillan speaking about the pure waters of strict neutrality. I ask if anybody in his sane senses who was reared in the atmosphere of freedom that obtains in this country seriously suggests that as between the Cominform and the free nations of the world he stands utterly neutral?  I do not believe many members of the Labour Party would give an affirmative answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He makes that nice distinction &mdash; neutral in your mind and not neutral in some other part of your anatomy.  I cannot separate my mind from the rest of my anatomy with that facility.  As between Washington and Moscow, is any sane citizen to say he is neutral?  I say that neutrality depends on the fact that Moscow shall not prevail. When I listen to people today talking about various contemporary developments, I cannot help remembering the talk that went on in 1936.</P>
      <P>I believe the only effective deterrent to war in the world today is the prospect of an effective Atlantic partnership which will present to the world's only potential aggressor, Moscow, the certainty that it cannot launch a successful war.  Once that situation is created in the world, we will have peace.  As it is, there is a perennial recurrent danger of war.  As I see the world situation, the only hope of an Atlantic partnership depends on the emergence of an effective European unity, because you cannot construct an effective Atlantic partnership without a united Europe.  When I hear the French Government talking of the <i>force de frappe</i> and expressing the hope that the rift between Peking and Moscow will paralyse the Cominform, I cannot help thinking of the days when the French Government were talking of the Maginot Line, the impenetrable barrier of Europe, until the Wehrmacht discovered it had no tail and that you could walk around the Maginot Line.  The <i>force de frappe</i> exists in the imagination of the French Government and of nobody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear them talking about the prospect of division between Moscow and Peking, I think of Mr. Chamberlain going to Rome in 1936-37 to woo Mussolini away from Hitler.  If he could only do that, the Axis would not constitute a menace to Europe any more.  But, when the chips were down, Mussolini and Hitler were on the one side fighting like tigers and the rest of the disrupted European community were in the cart.  It is well to remember that it was not until Japan attacked <Col N="233" /> America that America was drawn into the fray.</P>
    <P>The parallel that exists between the thinking in the world today and the thinking in the world of the thirties is so dramatic and so alarming that I am constantly filled with apprehension. I think the great landmark in the history of our time is the speech of President Kennedy at Philadelphia when he formulated the concept of the Atlantic community and the great catastrophe was when the French Government in January two years ago emphatically rejected that concept. The real present danger under the new administration in America is that the old forces of isolationism may reassert themselves and that America may withdraw from Europe as she looks like withdrawing from Asia.  Not in my lifetime but in the lifetime of my family and those who come after them we may see a Communist-dominated empire stretching from Calais to Vladivostock.  Great Britain will be living on the fringe of that.  It will not be a very pleasant world to live in if it comes to pass.  Unless there is created in the world in which we live an effective shield against that development its imminence may be very much greater than many of us realise.</P>
    <P>How many people when they look at Europe ask themselves the question: &ldquo;What is going to happen in France after the present President retires?&rdquo; How many people looking at Europe today realise that the most powerful political Party in Italy is the Communist Party and that, though the Christian Democratic Union of Italy could summon the votes to appoint a President of their own choice, they wound up combining with the Communist Party to elect President Sarregat?  How many people have ever reflected that, suppose you had a united Germany tomorrow, you would have the third largest Communist Party in Europe in that united Germany?  In France there is the second largest Communist Party in Europe.  In the absence of General de Gaulle, there is no other organised political Party of any kind in France.</P>
    <P>These prospects fill me with alarm. As a small nation for which survival without freedom is hard to contemplate, <Col N="234" /> it appears as crystal clear to me that our vital interest should be the promotion by every means at our disposal of a united Europe with a view to constituting as part of that united Europe an equal <i>bloc</i> with the United States to establish an Atlantic partnership for the purpose of ensuring that there will not be a war and that individual liberty in the world will survive.  Without that, there is a grim prospect, not only of what will happen in Europe but what will happen in Africa and Asia as well.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for External Affairs is always talking about nuclear powers. I think a great deal of that talk is wholly illusory.  Anybody can be a nuclear power now; anyone can make a nuclear bomb.  It is highly likely that Indonesia will make one shortly.  But there is not the least use making a nuclear bomb and then sitting on it.  It is only a hazard to one's self.  The only effective nuclear power is the power which has a nuclear bomb and the means to deliver it.  There are only two countries in the world of whom that can be said at present and they are the United States of America and the Soviet Union.  As far as I can see, there is not the slightest prospects for the next 50 years of any other power in the world having anything like the effective power to deliver an atomic weapon outside their own borders.  We are dealing with two nuclear powers.  There are only two in the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fascinated by this concept of getting five nuclear powers &mdash; France, China, Russia, United States of America and Great Britain&mdash; together to guarantee there will not be any further proliferation of atomic weapons.  There are only two of these powers of any significance. I do not believe for a single moment that any agreement of any description you make with Moscow would be kept for one hour longer than it was for the advantage of Moscow to keep it.  I do not believe anybody who has studied the literature and philosophy of Marxian materialism and of Communism based thereon can doubt they do not believe in keeping agreements and they do believe in telling lies as part of their normal armentarium of diplomacy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> Some people may ask here, in that situation are we to surrender ourselves to utter pessimism and despair?  Not at all.  We ought to face that fact realistically and say there is only one way of guaranteeing yourself against nuclear war and that is by creating a situation in which you make it quite manifest to Moscow that she cannot start a nuclear war with any hope of winning it and once you carry that conviction to her mind, the danger of nuclear war disappears.</P>
    <P>It is all nonsense to talk about China starting a nuclear war, or Sukarno starting a nuclear war, or anybody else starting a nuclear war.  They may carry some kind of nuclear device in a hand-bag and deposit it on somebody's back-door and blow a hole in the wall and injure thousands of people in the immediate neighbourhood and blow themselves up but that is not nuclear war. That is simply 20th century anarchism. It is 100 years ago that fellows were going around with black bombs and long fuses out of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;black hats and black beards &mdash; and everybody was afraid of them.  Sir Winston Churchill was depicted wearing a tophat with a stick in his hand directing operations, trying to round them up because everybody was terrorised.  That was the alarm then.  It is perfectly true that Sukarno may detonate some kind of device in Malaysia's backyard.  It would be deplorable if he did.  There is nothing you can do about it but it is not nuclear war or it is not the material of nuclear war.</P>
      <P>There are only two Powers in the world that can precipitate a nuclear war&mdash;the United States of America, on the one hand, and the USSR, on the other.  I do not believe the United States of America want nuclear war. In fact, one of the great dangers is that they are so obsessed with the idea of the horror of nuclear war that their power to defend themselves is almost paralysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My diagnosis of the world situation would be that the Americans are so <Col N="236" /> horrified of nuclear war there is the possibility that that might deceive Soviet Russia into the belief that she could get away with nuclear war and survive.</P>
    <P>All I am concerned with is, for the protection of Russia and the Russian people, to create as clear a picture as it is humanly possible to create that there is no use thinking that they can start a war which they can hope to win.  There is nothing that will convince them of that except the emergence of an Atlantic partnership which will manifestly be so powerful and strategically so distributed that its conquest by the USSR is out of the question.</P>
    <P>The Minister is always troubled with the idea of this Peking-Moscow breakup. That is a complete illusion.  Peking could not beat a cat.  They could not beat a mangy cat in the context of modern war.  They have countless millions of men but that is irrelevant to modern war.  You do not fight modern wars with men.  If there is ever a show-down between Moscow and Peking, Peking will disappear overnight because Moscow has never allowed itself to be brainwashed into the position that it could never use atomic weapons. It is always rattling them, announcing that it will be prepared to launch them. Do you imagine, if Peking crossed the path of Moscow in an effective way and threatened the safety of the USSR, that Moscow would hesitate to use atomic weapons on Peking?  It might give 48 hours notice to &ldquo;toe the line, or&rdquo;, and if they did not accept, they would eliminate Peking and the whole headquarters of the Chinese people overnight and simply enslave the 600 million or 700 million Chinese there waiting to be enslaved.</P>
    <P>To be talking about a Moscow-Peking axis is the purest nonsense. Peking simply does not count, but, so long as she can be used as an instrument of Russian policy to put the heat on the United States of America, where it is more convenient that she should do it than Russia, Russia will tolerate Peking.  Certain old gentlemen, like Khrushchev, will lose their tempers at attempts at abuse by the Chinese propaganda campaign but what happens <Col N="237" /> is that if he allows his natural feelings to get the better of him he disappears down the drain and Kosygin and somebody else comes along and now they are smiling and chortling to the Chinese again and the Chinese are being difficult. But the Chinese are serving a very useful purpose in parts of Asia in harassing the United States of America and they are also being successfully used in Africa for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Does anybody seriously believe that they would be doing those things if it did not suit Russia's purpose?  Does anybody seriously believe that they would be doing those things if they were not seriously inconveniencing the United States of America?  It is all part of the world Cominform conspiracy which is directed and always will be directed from Moscow.  It is nothing to get fussed or troubled about unless we allow the umbrella philosophy to deceive us into the belief that there is some great <i>détente</i> going on. That is the great danger.  The only danger of a war in this world today which might involve our destruction or enslavement is to surrender to the mesmerism of Cominform propaganda that a <i>détente</i> is taking place.</P>
    <P>The only basis upon which there can be a <i>détente</i> is, in the circumstances of the world, by a combination of free men so powerful in numbers and resources that the Cominform come to realise that they cannot initiate a successful war.  Our interest should be, first, to tell our people these plain and inescapable facts and, secondly, to make known quite frankly to our people that our interest as a small nation of free people is to promote the existence of such an Atlantic partnership in the world.</P>
    <P>Small as our influence may be, it is not utterly contemptible because, though we are a small island, our people are scattered all over the free world and carry some influence in the councils of the free world.  If Ireland's position were clear and cogent and effectively deployed on the side of what I conceive to be the only means to enduring peace, our influence in the world generally might make some contribution, however small &mdash; some contribution&mdash;to the preservation of <Col N="238" /> peace and freedom and these are the only two important things that international affairs can effectively serve.</P>
    <P>There is one last point on which I should like to ask for information from the Minister for External Affairs.  I think it is supererogation on our part to be congratulating ourselves on the way our troops conducted themselves both in the assignment they undertook in the Congo and in Cyprus.  They conducted themselves exactly as I expected they would conduct themselves.  They are first-class men who reflected great credit on the country and who, as a result of being decent fellows, were greatly liked by the people whom they had gone to serve and both in the Congo and in the utterly dissimilar surroundings of Cyprus managed to make themselves be received as the friends, not only of a simple primitive people like the Congolese but also of a highly sophisticated and sensitive people like the Turkish and Greek residents of the island of Cyprus.</P>
    <P>In so far as they contributed to the preservation of peace in Cyprus, I am very glad they went there but I do think we are entitled to ask how long is this to go on.  It is costing us a great deal of money.  We have taken up the position that we will not take any money from the United Nations in respect of this assignment because the funds earmarked for Cyprus have not been collected from all the members of the United Nations but have been contributed by a select few.  For reasons that the Minister has explained on previous occasions the Irish Government determined they could not accept any recoupment from that source.  That is all very well.  I understand their point of view but it is perhaps unnecessarily sensitive.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of major importance about which I wish to quarrel with them but we must ask ourselves how long will this go on.  We cannot leave troops in Cyprus forever and, over and above that, after we have done our tour of service we are entitled to say: &ldquo;Now it is time for somebody else to share in this burden with us and give our men a rest and let us go home&rdquo;.  Could the Minister say offhand <Col N="239" /> how long our troops have been in Cyprus?</P>

      <P>Are they going to be there forever?  It is a mistake that these things should be allowed to drift on, first, from the point of view of Government policy and, secondly, from the point of view of our own forces. Reasonable regard should be had to the service of these men.  Take the observers out in the Middle East.  Have they been forgotten?  Perhaps it is no harm to say they are not forgotten by us and that we are conscious of the work they are doing.  However, it ought to be possible to set some term to the several activities we undertake on behalf of the United Nations.  It is a very unsatisfactory situation if these things are allowed to dander on until they are actually forgotten by Dáil Éireann. That ought not to be allowed to happen. It is unhealthy and undesirable. It is something to which the Minister ought to turn his attention.  They ought to make it known to the United Nations that we are quite prepared to undertake a finite assignment and discharge it, given the understanding that at the end of our term we have freedom to withdraw our troops and hand over to somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If on the other hand, the United Nations is prepared to say it will set <Col N="240" /> up a permanent peace-keeping force to which its members would make an agreed contribution and that that force would be permanently at the disposal of the United Nations, I would be very happy to see our Government make their contribution to it.  That would mean we would be permanently engaged with all our fellow members in the United Nations in an assignment of that kind making our due, propertional contribution to it.  What I deprecate, however, is that a situation should arise that in perpetuity we would be given assignments and be left open to the charge that we had abandoned our post if we were not prepared to stay almost indefinitely in these troubled spots.</P>
    <P>I deprecate the Minister's umbrella approach to a world situation which I believe is fraught with very great dangers.  I deprecate the Minister's desire to create an atmosphere in this country that everything in the world is lovely and no serious dangers lie ahead.  I also deprecate the making of propaganda or Party advantage out of any discussions that take place between the Government here and the Government of Northern Ireland.  That kind of thing tends to make such delicate discussions even more difficult.  They have been carried on very successfully over the last 20 years and consequently have borne fruit progressively down through the years as the co-operation became more constant.  Do not make them the plaything of Party politics or you may do a great disservice to the ultimate objective of realising a united Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As on so many occasions I cannot help feeling now that Deputy Dillon is most fluently and eloquently wrong-headed on this most important question whether the Minister's statement is right or wrong on the genuineness or otherwise of the <i>détente.</i> There was a time when it could be said that any comment we made on world affairs was very much of the <i>Skib-bereen Eagle</i> type in its implications in so far as we could be an effective force to change the trend of world events to any significant extent.  That is still substantially true but there is this difference, that life here could be completely changed for us by any <Col N="241" /> serious alteration or deterioration in the situation between the Americans and the Russians.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has made a number of facile comparisons between the Thirties and now and I do not think they are valid comparisons.  There is the fact that having had the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and so on, mankind has now come into the Nuclear Age.  In the Nuclear Age, a different conception of human relations will have to be evolved and a completely new understanding of how we must get on and live with one another, no matter how different we may be in our ideological beliefs.</P>
      <P>Somebody said once you can do anything with a bayonet except sit on it.  The modern version of that would be you can do anything with a nuclear bomb except explode it.  That is a truism which means that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon, is wrong when he says the Russians are waiting to realise their ambitions for a Communist world with their fingers on the trigger of the nuclear bomb.  They are much too realistic to believe that anything they take over after they have exploded the nuclear bomb, with all the repercussions in the world that would follow it would be capable of being communised or Christianised.  There would be no life left in the world and that is the fabulous reality which is so difficult to assimilate.  It means that one has to take a completely different approach to the present power struggle.</P>
      <P>Of course there is a tremendous power struggle going on, a tremendous, fascinating and exciting struggle between the gradations of the western type civilisation, if you like to call it that, and the eastern type civilisation, Communism in its various forms and Christianity and these various other religions.  That is a wonderful struggle to anybody interested in the whole progress of world society towards the millennium.  It is a great thing that it is going on.  It is quite conceivable that we have got to the stage where everybody realises you cannot explode the nuclear bomb and that for the first time in the history of the world, you cannot make war seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> The struggle is on an ideological level and must be fought out in all these countries, particularly Africa, the Middle East and the East.  What I think is frightening is that where one or the other loses the ideological struggle, they may tend to try to win it by the use of the gun or the nuclear bomb now.  Deputy Dillon is desperately out of touch in this suggestion about a genuine <i>détente.</i> Peadar O'Donnell once talked about the priest-ridden laity in Ireland.  I think in terms of world power the attitude of the Vatican to this position and the extent of Communism throughout the world, is completely different.  It was different in Pope John's time and even in Pope Paul's time it is different.  He does not strike me as being a man with the same very strong views as Pope John but he is taking a comparable view to Pope John, that this is here, it has got to be lived with and in some way we can do business with it&mdash;a realistic assessment of the realities.</P>
    <P>One of the great strengths of the Catholic Church over the years, if anybody is interested in the remarkable miracle of its survival in view of the many major mistakes it has made during the centuries, is its terrific capacity for adaptation, its flexibility and its ability to compromise and, above all, its ability to face the realities of a particular situation at a particular time and then meet and deal with it.  I suppose that to a considerable extent has been the secret of its survival through all its difficulties.  One does not meet that type of flexibility with this type of laity which Deputy Dillon represents, the bigoted sectarian with doctrinaire orthodoxy.  I do not think there could be said to be any comparison in anybody's mind that there is today the same sense of danger, of imminent possible destruction or the possibility of a nuclear war as there was five years ago, or seven or eight years ago.  Those of us who live in a country like this, with our views and beliefs, should at least try to keep up with what is not, God knows, a particularly <i>avant garde</i>, radical organisation, the Vatican, with our acceptance of realities in the world and our acceptance of the sense of <Col N="243" /> relief most people feel that we are no longer glaring at one another looking for holds with which to try to pull down the enemy and strangle him.</P>
    <P>The reality is that neither side can do that any more.  I am surprised at a man whom I know to be a very humane and gentle person such as Deputy Dillon dismissing whole races of people by one word&mdash;Peking or Moscow or New York, because, of course, he is condemning them to decimation if he runs them into one of the wars he has in mind.  This misuse of a word which covers men, women and children in their tens of millions is, of course, one of Deputy Dillon's blind spots.  While he would have the greatest feeling of charity and compassion for somebody who is disabled or hurt or ill, if the person is there in front of him, he does not seem to be able to face the reality of the proposition he makes for going around armed with this bomb which he will throw at Moscow or Peking or North Vietnam. He does not hit these places; they are merely spots on the map, but they do represent human beings.  Anybody who saw the bombing of London or Liverpool during the last war saw the dreadful results &mdash; youngsters with limbs missing, people blinded or blasted and the awful effects from the destruction of houses and all that&mdash; the realities of war.</P>
    <P>There can be no question that no civilised human being could seriously visualise war of any kind, particularly nuclear war, as the solution of any grievance or difference we may have. We have to go back further all the time to the beginnings of wars and to what starts them before we get to the stage of the last war or the 1914-18 war when youngsters went out and were butchered for imperialist objectives of one kind or another between Britain and Germany and again in the last war because the Nazis were allowed to get into power by the German ruling classes.</P>
    <P>The appalling position is when these mistakes are made and allowed to go on being made, the flashpoint comes <Col N="244" /> and the clarion call goes out to the youngsters and then they man their Spitfires and Messerschmidts and they kill one another and what does it all resolve?  You see all over Europe thousands and thousands of graves of people who did not have any middle age or old age because of European statesmen during the 1930s and earlier. I do not want to dwell on it but even the present development in our relations between North and South must cause people like the Minister to examine his conscience on his actions, with the great benefit of hindsight, and wonder to what extent their solution for their terrible dilemma 40 years ago was the correct one.</P>
    <P>Even the most apparently insoluble difficulties between human beings must always end up around the conference table and the intervention of force, whether it be a revolver, a cannon or a nuclear bomb, is never the correct solution. That is always an evil and a bad thing and it is wrong of a person of the stature of Deputy Dillon to advocate that.  I cannot think of Moscow as a city.  To me it is a place with a lot of people living in it, people with wives and families, people who live together and work together, people who may dislike and quarrel with each other, but people.  You cannot talk about destroying these people in order to establish a point of view.  It always comes down to that, the establishment of a point of view, our point of view or the other point of view.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has had experience of travelling in Europe since the war will have had the dreadful experience of hearing of the bombing of these places, Hamburg, Frankfort, Cologne, where one knew there were beautiful places and where there were people, nice people, and knowing that they were destroyed because of the stupidity of man and his obsession with the idea that if he could kill or maim enough of the other side, he would be right and his position would be established.  This war psychosis is an evil and a bad thing.  It was never a valid or a good solution and it has now become an impossible solution.  Deputy Dillon must accept that fact.  Whatever we <Col N="245" /> may think of Peking or Moscow, we have to realise that they are there and that they are very powerful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that there are only two cities.  Mosgow and Washington, capable of fighting a nuclear war.  He should remember what was said about Russia 40 years ago, that this backward agricultural country was unable to do anything.  Now they are spinning men around the country in the true sense of the word.  With the advances the Chinese are making at the moment, within a relatively short time they are going to be in the same position as the Russians.  We have to accept the fact that they are growing and will keep growing in terms of strength. They have produced the nuclear bomb, a tremendous achievement by a very backward country.  How proud General de Gaulle was when he could announce that he had exploded his bomb and now this primitive backward country has produced the bomb in a very short time.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to say that this is a backward country and that we do not need to fear it.  We do need to fear it and we need to come to terms with it. In dealing with this matter, the Minister has followed a very careful and wise line.  He has suggested that these people be brought around a conference table and that suggestion is the correct one.  They are there and they must seriously be reckoned with.  They cannot be wished away.</P>
    <P>The origins of war, both in South Vietnam and in Europe, have lain in the struggle between peoples, some times nationalistic but becoming more and more ideological.  Until we are prepared to go into the developing countries with something more attractive than we have in our own societies and offer them the advantages of our way of life, whatever they may be, we will not make advances in the new emergent societies.  President Kennedy had something of the germ of the idea which was not fully developed then. The peace corps approach to the emergent countries was obviously the correct approach.  The Minister has given every assistance to these countries and supplied whatever help <Col N="246" /> he could in the way of doctors, teachers and advisers.  That is the only help these people need and that is the only help that we should export.  The export of guns and bullets for these people to kill off one another is an evil and bad thing.</P>
    <P>It is one of the difficulties of a country, even such as the United States, that having failed to solve their own social and economic problems, they have to go out to these countries and offer them a method for the solutions of their problems, illiteracy, high disease rates, bad housing accommodation, lack of internal communications and lack of industry and agricultural developments.  Unless the Western powers can go out and offer these new countries methods of building prosperous societies, they are wasting their time and they cannot complain if they are rejected when they go out and support some Tshombe-like backward individuals so that the exploitation of these countries can continue and their copper, rubber and oil be taken away from the rightful owners and brought back to bolster up the standard of living of the British, French or Belgians.</P>
    <P>You have to offer to these people a way of life which is a better way of life than that offered by the eastern powers. We are taking the view that because they will not accept our way of life our attitude is that we will use the gun and force them to take our particular side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if a health authority may provide transport to and from special day-schools for mentally handicapped children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The education of children, whether handicapped or not, is not a function of the Minister for Health and accordingly he has no statutory power which <Col N="247" /> would enable him to direct a health authority to provide transport for children to or from day schools of any description.  Under Section 104 of the Health Act, 1947, as amended, a health authority may make arrangements for providing ambulances or other means of transport but in respect of patients only.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the Minister for Education, in appropriate circumstances, makes contributions towards the cost of transport involved in the attendance of mentally handicapped children at special day schools which have been approved by his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter yesterday because I have failed to get transport for eight children in Clondalkin. Does the Minister say positively that the Minister for Education will provide it or can the Taoiseach assure me that it can be provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are eight children in Clondalkin for whom transport cannot be provided.  Dublin Health Authority say they cannot legally provide this transport.  The Department of Education can provide it only in part, through a voluntary organisation.  Is there no way in which transport can be provided as these children are supposed to be children who are suitable for admission to the day schools and are prevented from attending them through lack of transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are suitable for admission to day schools, I have no doubt, if circumstances permitted, the Minister for Education would provide transport.  So far as the Minister for Health is concerned, he is bound by the law.  I know Deputy Clinton does not have much regard for that, but I do; and I cannot provide transport except for patients and these children are not patients.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy then permit me to answer a question?  The Deputy has been talking about providing residential accommodation for children.  This is quite a different <Col N="249" /> matter.  These are children residing with their own parents and who certainly can be catered for in day schools within a reasonable distance of their own locality.  The schools are fairly wide-spread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, having regard to the very long hours that sick and injured persons have to wait for attention in the out-patient departments of Dublin hospitals, he will endeavour with the co-operation of the medical profession and hospital authorities to devise a system which will obviate delays in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly, outpatient departments may be sub-divided into two kinds, casualty departments and specialised clinics.  Only the latter are operated under the Health Acts and are, presumably, those the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Dublin hospitals are concerned, the specialist clinics operated under the Health Acts are arranged between the health authority <Col N="250" /> and the hospitals concerned and the functions of the Minister for Health in relation to them are limited to approving the financial arrangements. The formulation of a system such as the Deputy suggests is a matter for discussion between the authorities of each hospital and the health authority. I would suggest that the Deputy should take up the matter with the latter body, as the body appropriate to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the gravity of the matter in that some hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this city wait daily for two or three hours in the out-patient departments of hospitals, would the Minister consider using his good offices with the health authorities and hospitals concerned to ensure that there is an immediate and radical improvement so as to prevent a continuance of the situation where injured, maimed and ill people have to wait for two or three hours daily for medical attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that is an exaggeration such as is normally associated with the Deputy.  The Deputy is a member of an authority which provides a very large part of the finances of the Dublin Health Authority.  He is the immediate and direct representative of the people about whom he is speaking on that authority.  I suggest that he should do as I have indicated and address his questions to the Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is not a matter of finance? It costs exactly the same to give attention to a person whether the person is obliged to wait one hour or three hours.  If the Minister would devote as much energy to his duties as he does to being rude, we might get somewhere with our health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>A grant towards the cost of erection of the school was sanctioned by the Department of Education on 21st December, 1961.  A tender was accepted by the Commissioners of Public Works on 22nd February, 1963.  Subsequently, when it was found that additional accommodation was required, it was decided to erect a new type of school instead of the traditional type provided for in the plans and the negotiations with the contractor were completed in September, 1963.  Progress by the contractor has been unsatisfactory and it is unlikely that the contract will be completed for some months.  The Deputy may rest assured that all practicable steps are being taken to secure the earliest possible completion of the works.</P>

      <P>CIE operate profitable and non-profitable road passenger and freight services on the principle of providing reasonable, efficient and economical transport over the widest possible area.  This is feasible only through applying surpluses on remunerative services to cover deficiencies on other services.</P>
      <P>It is hardly to be expected that private enterprise would be prepared to take over uneconomic services from CIE and operate them satisfactorily but if any firm proposal of this kind is made I am sure CIE will be glad to examine it.</P>

      <P>The Buy Irish campaign is basically a public relations campaign and, as such, its effects are extremely difficult to measure, particularly in the short-term.  However, there has been considerable evidence of increased consumer demand for Irish goods since the campaign was launched and several manufacturers have attributed this very largely to the campaign.  Even at a later stage, when the extent of the increased demand for Irish products should be more easily measurable, it may not be possible to isolate the precise proportions which can properly be attributed to the campaign itself or to other factors, such as improved products and more intensive marketing by manufacturers or to a greater purchasing power in the community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

They hope to be in a position shortly to offer accommodation to families of six in one room but some time may elapse before accommodation can be offered to the smaller families.</P>
      <P>In the case of families who are not at present recommended for rehousing by the medical officer it is not possible to give any indication as to when any of these can be rehoused.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent increase in house prices.  I have no evidence, however, that the increases are particularly marked in the case of houses being purchased with the aid of local authority loans.  The level of the maximum loan that may be made under this scheme is kept under review by me and I would propose an increase in the maximum if I thought a solution of the problem lay in that direction. However, from inquiries I have made I consider that the main difficulty lies not in the operation of the limit of £2,250, fixed last June, but in the disparity in the price of houses and their value as determined by housing authorities.  While there may be scope for a more liberal attitude by some housing authorities in assessing valuations for loan purposes, I have no power to compel them to increase valuations.  The law, in fact, requires that they satisfy themselves that the value of the ownership of a house is sufficient to provide adequate security for the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House prices reflect the trend of conditions, costs and wages in the building industry generally and the interaction of supply and demand.  Deputies will be aware of the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to certain recent increases.  To ensure <Col N="293" /> that the supply of houses more nearly equates to the demand the Government intend, as announced in the recent White Paper, that output should virtually double by 1970 or as soon as the resources of the building industry permit.</P>
    <P>The attainment of this target will present difficulties and for this reason I have been devoting much attention to the possibility of using new methods and techniques including industrialised building and rationalised traditional building.</P>
    <P>I have also on many occasions strongly adovcated the provision by housing authorities of sites for private housing development.  This would help to meet the target and secure significant economies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicates that he hopes to see an improvement in about five years time.  Is he aware that in the meantime the average price being charged for houses of the small dwelling type is £3,800, which makes it absolutely impossible for young people to avail of the facilities which were formerly available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act? Some steps by him are necessary to stop this racket in house prices which exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully agree that these houses can only be acquired at £3,800 but at the same time I realise that the price of houses is beyond the reach of many who now want to purchase them.  While one may have all sorts of investigations, I think the real answer to the problem is the one of trying to make the supply of houses more equal to the demand.  We should try to do that by every means possible and that is the only real answer to the situation in which housing prices may be too high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger of that is that it would make available a greater number of people to outbid each other to their own disadvantage.  The records do not show that the raising of the <Col N="294" /> upper limit of the loan would help to solve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion in the Question that persons rehoused from caravans are deprived of subsidy of their rents is not correct.  The higher rate of subsidy was, however, not payable because this is confined by the Housing Acts specifically to persons displaced by the operations of the housing authority and to persons rehoused on medical or compassionate grounds.  The persons referred to by the Deputy did not qualify on these latter grounds.

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the exorbitant prices demanded by landowners for developed and undeveloped sites suitable for the provision of houses in the Dublin city and county areas resulting in a consequential big rise in the cost of new houses, he will consider introducing some measure to control the price of land so as to ease the burden on potential house purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the cost of land in the Dublin area has increased considerably in recent times and that this may be ascribed, in part at least, to the growing demand for sites for private and public housing. This trend is in keeping with experience in other countries as to the effect of expanding housing and other economic activities on land prices in the vicinity of large urban concentrations.  A system of price control or other solution to the problem, consistent with the principles of market value in land transactions is not readily devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain measures are, however, in hand or under consideration which I <Col N="296" /> expect will afford some relief in the Dublin area.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, all planning authorities are now required to relate the supply of land zoned for building to the expected development of their area to take the necessary steps, such as the provision of water and sewerage services, to facilitate such development.  Planning studies at present in progress in the Dublin region will help to establish the extent of the provision to be made for housing development and the most suitable locations for such development. Major drainage extension projects in prospect will greatly increase the supply of land which can be developed for housing and other purposes.</P>
    <P>I have for long encouraged housing authorities to make wider use of their powers to provide sites for private housing.  The authorities may purchase land by agreement or compulsorily and may sell or lease developed or undeveloped housing sites.  They may also carry out any works ancillary to the development of the land for housing purposes.  I would like to see these powers being more widely used to help in easing the present difficulties of private persons in finding suitable sites at reasonable cost.  I am glad to say that Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have the matter under active consideration at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this whole question of land values results in higher prices being charged to the small builders, some of whom are being forced out of business by being unable to purchase suitable sites. They are now finding themselves in competition with some cross-Channel organisations coming in here.  The price of land is one of the most serious factors in the high price of houses today.  Could he not envisage some measure of control or give some warning to these people that they are complicating the housing situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only logical solution is that the local authorities should acquire the land themselves and make it available to the smaller <Col N="297" /> developer who wishes to build and who may now find himself being frozen out of the market.  The local councils can acquire the land and let it or sell it to any of these people for the provision of houses for our people.</P>

The existing means of access to the site is unsatisfactory and on 1st May, 1964, the Council made a Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of land to provide alternative access, and also other lands for housing purposes elsewhere in the county.

As this review will affect speed limits on arterial routes <Col N="305" /> only, the village of Cloghan, County Offaly, will not be included in it.  A review of speed limits on non-arterial routes will be initiated later this year, and the question of reducing the speed limit from 40 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h, at this village can be considered as part of that review.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of traffic signs, other than speed limit signs, rests with the road authorities who act at the request or with the consent of the Garda Síochána.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of contributors losing the benefit of a life-time of contributions when they cease to be insurable because of the present limit.  They can continue insurance for contributory <Col N="310" /> widow's pension, and also for old age contributory pension if previously insured for that benefit, by becoming voluntary contributors.  Furthermore, title to other benefits continues for periods of up to 23 months after compulsory insurance ceases.</P>
    <P>It may be taken, moreover, that when the limit is raised, consideration will be given to the question of allowing contributions to be credited to persons who again become compulsorily insurable so as to give them immediate cover for unemployment, disability and treatment benefits, but not for benefits to which title could have been preserved on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>This estate was not taken over in 1962; in fact the estate did not vest in the Land Commission until the end of the following year, that is, on 10th December, 1963.  The necessary documentary evidence of title was not lodged in the Land Commission until about seven weeks ago.  The matter is pending for examination by an Examiner and when title has been cleared, the question of allocating the purchase money will be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not state that. I can only tell the Deputy that, so far as the Land Commission are concerned, they can do nothing until evidence of title is lodged and, in this case, evidence of title was lodged only seven weeks ago.  The examination of title is now proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is a lawyer and he can help me as an ordinary individual. Is it not very unusual for the Land Commission to take over and divide a farm before they have paid for it? Is the converse not the rule?  Generally, they do not take over a farm until they have title, presumably to ensure that those who no longer have any benefit get the money for what they sold to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into technicalities, but there is a provision, which would apply in this case, whereby the people are not without the benefit of the money.  In general a farm is not divided in the circumstances to which the Deputy refers. I doubt, however, if the Department would favour the idea of land being held undivided for a very long number of years where there is difficulty in clearing title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Parliamentary Secretary unduly because this is really <Col N="313" /> a matter for the Minister, but surely it is most unusual for the Land Commission to take over a farm before they have title?  Indeed, one of the things the Department always insist on is clear title.  In this case they seemingly did not have title, but they took over and divided the farm and the unfortunate individual, who was entitled to receive a sum of money, got nothing at all.  Is this not a precedent in Land Commission legal history?</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary receives evidence that drift net fishermen off the Donegal coast have now equipped their boats with up-to-date nets of a monofilament synthetic material and have spent between £600 and £1,000 per boat on the purchase of these nets, will he do for the Donegal fishermen what he did for those at Youghal&mdash;postpone the operation of the prohibition?</P>

      <P>That is just the point.  As the Minister for Agriculture has pointed out, a Fianna Fáil Deputy can get away with these things but a Fine Gael man can not.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, the season for the Youghal men begins much earlier than the fishing season for Donegal, which does not begin until 1st June.  In view of that, would he postpone the operation of the bye-law in Donegal until 1st November, thereby giving these men an opportunity of recouping themselves?  Will he state if the bye-law applies to nets on all types of boats, be they small seine net boats or only half-deckers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last supplementary question first, it applies to all nets used in all boats.  It is the type of net that is prohibited.  In answer to the Deputy's request for a postponement in regard to Donegal, the answer is no, and the reason is that given by himself: the season does not commence until June and therefore they will have six months' notice.  That did not apply in Youghal where fishing is going on now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that runs of salmon from the sea at Waterville since the beginning of this year have been well up to the average of recent seasons.  As to the heavy mortality from disease among salmon in the Cummeragh river system, the position is that investigations into the cause of the disease are still in progress.</P>
      <P>So far, no fish examined bacteriologically in this country have been found to be suffering from furunculosis, the common disease of salmon and trout, but another organism similar to that which causes furunculosis has been isolated and this is being investigated at present.  Confirmation of the absence of furunculosis has been reported by a Swedish scientist to whom fish were also sent for examination and he is at present examining cultures of the other bacteria isolated.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also being made to have virus tests carried out in Denmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that it is popularly believed this disease of salmon in this area is due either to the introduction into these waters of rainbow trout or, alternatively, to the effluent from a trout farm in the immediate vicinity?

Any steps that can be taken to reduce the effects of the disease will, of course, be taken, and gladly.  I want to make it quite clear that I am extremely concerned about damage to the fishery in the Cummeragh river system.  At the same time I am not entitled to take steps based merely on conjecture, steps which could be of very serious import. Any steps that can be taken to remedy the situation are being and will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to continue to increase the amount of the national resources which are being made available for education.  In fact very much increased expenditure on education is being envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Development.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the concern expressed by parents and teachers at the proposed extension of the school year by extending the summer term which is the period when a number of families find it convenient to take summer holidays; if he will consider for the future an extension of other school terms rather than the summer term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent introduction of a minimum school year of 200 days for secondary schools.  In fact, some 50 per cent of the schools were already complying with this requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> Arising out of the rule, representations were made by school associations and by individual school authorities requesting the later commencement of the Certificate Examinations.  My Department reverted, therefore, to the practice obtaining up to recent years of commencing the examinations not earlier than 10th June.  Subject to the minimum school-year requirement the length of several vacation periods is a matter for determination by individual school managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Bord Fáilte have promoted a scheme for family holidays in June and that this change to some extent conflicts with that.  Would the Minister consider extending other terms in order to fit in with that arrangement which, I understand, suits parents and teachers better than the proposals at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>My action was as a result of representations from the schools.  Balancing the representations from Bord Fáilte against those from the schools, I think I have to come down in favour of the schools.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing procedure it has been the practice to submit proposals relating to secondary school curricula, <Col N="332" /> examinations, etc., to the various recognised Associations connected with these schools.  Full consideration is then given to the views received and when the circumstances warrant it the Associations are requested to send representatives to a meeting with representatives of my Department.  These arrangements have worked very well in practice.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by the Irish Schoolmasters Association raise so many issues and affect so many interests that the consideration of them is likely to take some considerable time.</P>

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(a)  The number of special allowances on pay at the end of 1964 was 7,937.</P>
      <P>(b)  The amount provided for the payment of special allowances in 1964-65, including the increase granted as from 1st October, 1964, is £606,000.</P>
      <P>(c)  A special allowance is an annual sum of such amount as, when added to the applicant's yearly means, will not equal or exceed the &ldquo;appropriate annual sum&rdquo; laid down in the Army Pensions Acts.  At present the appropriate annual sums are those prescribed in section 26 of the Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, with the addition of £4 per annum, in each case, as a result of the 1964 Budget increases.</P>
      <P>(d)  Without re-assessing every special allowance at present being paid it would not be possible to estimate the cost of increasing the maximum appropriate annual sum to £260, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for allowances below the maximum, but it might well increase the total cost to double the present figure or even more.</P>
      <P>(e)  A person in receipt of a special allowance who is eligible for a contributory old age pension can receive such a pension without the special allowance being counted as means.  In the assessment of means for non-contributory old age pensions the first £80 of any pension or allowance under the Military Service Pensions Acts, the Army Pensions Acts or the Connaught Rangers Pensions Acts or of a combination of such pensions or allowances is disregarded.</P>
      <P>(f)  I am not in a position to furnish figures relating to the costs of old age pensions, which are a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  There is, of course, no saving on special allowances arising from the partial assessment of such allowances as means in the calculation of non-contributory old age pensions.</P>

My talks with them were of an informal nature.  I found that in EEC circles there is an active interest in Ireland and in our aspirations to join the Community, and a growing confidence that the march of events will bring about an extension of the Community in the not too distant future.

As the Deputy knows, the Austrian negotiations are for associate membership, not for full membership.  I was interested to learn how these negotiations were proceeding and I was given fairly full information on that point.  The Deputy may like to know that most of the difficulties which are being encountered in regard to the Austrian negotiations, as far as I can see, arose from the fact that the application is for associate membership and not for full membership.</P>

These recommendations were: the re-organisation of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society; the entrusting to the Society of responsibility for working out general re-organisation plans for the dairying industry; the decision, in principle by the Government, in certain circumstances, to transfer the Dairy Disposal Company to co-operative control; and the extension of the activities of the IAOS in the co-operative field.  A great deal of progress has been made in these directions.</P>

      <P>A solicitor applying for a practising certificate is required by subsection (1) of section 47 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, to deliver to the Registrar of Solicitors the prescribed declaration. The delivery must be effected by the solicitor in person or by his agent. The practice in the Registrar's office is to deliver the practising certificate in exchange for the declaration.  Normally, therefore, there is no question of a second attendance on the part of the solicitor or his agent to collect the certificate.</P>
      <P>This practice is held by the Law Society to be convenient, expeditious and satisfactory to solicitors generally. Moreover, the statutory requirement that the declaration is to be delivered by the solicitor to the Registrar in person or by his agent avoids any difficulty of establishing proof of delivery of the declaration which must contain certain averments of compliance with the Solicitors Accounts Regulations.  I am not prepared, therefore, to recommend any amendment of this particular requirement, nor do I see any case for legislating on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made already to the lack of information in the Minister's statement but there is one matter to which I should like to draw attention and about which we should have some information. It is the amount of money being spent on entertainment.  So far as my <Col N="355" /> recollection goes, when the inter-Party Government were last in power, approximately £6,000 was being spent on entertainment and that was regarded as very high for a country of this size.  That figure in seven or eight years has reached £23,000.</P>
      <P>When the Committee of Public Accounts sought some information in regard to the detailed expenditure of this money, no information was forthcoming. On December 2nd last, Deputy Dr. Browne asked a question in regard to this matter as reported in volume 213, column 303, of the Official Report, as follows:</P>
      <P>Dr. Browne asked the Minister for External Affairs what action has been taken by him in regard to the request by the Committee of Public Accounts that he should in common with practice in Great Britain and elsewhere publish the details of expenditure on entertainments; and what details he is at present unwilling to disclose lest it embarrass his guests.</P>
      <P>The reply was:</P>
      <P>The British Government merely publish a list of the global cost of each Head of State and official visit. We do not propose to follow their example in the matter and as far as we have heard the only country which has done so is South Africa.</P>
      <P>When the expenditure on entertainment in a small and poor country like ours can rocket from about £6,000 in 1957 to £23,000 at present, I think it calls for explanation, especially when I have been refused transport for eight mentally defective children at Clondalkin to go to an approved school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I am talking about the attitude to that expenditure compared with the attitude to other expenditure.  I think £23,000 is extravagant, and when the Committee of Public Accounts seek an explanation of it, I think they are entitled to get it and not be fobbed off as they were by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In 1961 we were so sure of entering into the EEC that we practically had one foot there already.  The position has radically changed since but our whole economic programme in the future is apparently geared to and dependent on our admission to the EEC by 1970.  When we came back after Christmas, it was stated that we would seek some kind of trade agreement with the EEC until we achieved full membership by 1970.  There is no information in the Minister's statement as to whether we have, in fact, attempted to clarify this position.</P>
      <P>Is it possible for us to get any such limited trade agreement with the EEC countries, on the understanding that our ambition and aspiration is to become full members in the long run? People are entitled to know where they stand.  If that is the position, we should set about investigating the possibilities and decide once and for all.  I think there are many people who foolishly believe that some action is being taken to achieve this end and are awaiting results.  As far as one can see even from replies given today by the Minister for Agriculture, the position seems to be&mdash;this is not indicated in the Minister's speech&mdash;that it is not possible to have that sort of trade agreement and that it is now undesirable that we should try to secure any form of association.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
