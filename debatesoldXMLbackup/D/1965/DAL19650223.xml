      <P>Figures of public expenditure on medical care for 1963 are not available to me for all these countries.  The most recent statistics applicable to all the countries mentioned which are available are those contained in &ldquo;The Cost of Social Security, 1958-1960&rdquo; published in 1964 by the International Labour Office.  I have had a table prepared from this publication showing total public expenditure on medical care and will, with your permission, a <Col N="832" /> Cheann Comhairle, have it included in the Official Report.  In view of the reference in the question to the Taoiseach's recent statement, I have for the Deputy's convenience included in the table the percentage of the gross national product in each case represented by this expenditure, as based on the ILO figures.</P>
      <P>As the financing of health services in most of these countries is part of the financing of general social security systems, it is not practicable to give comparative figures sub-dividing expenditure on health services alone by reference to the source of its financing, as requested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The enhanced sick leave concessions allowable to civil servants who contract tuberculosis were introduced in 1945 in the context of an intensive national campaign for the eradication of the disease.  The primary consideration in granting the concessions, which are allowed at the expense of the general taxpayer, was to protect the community at large from the infectious character of pulmonary tuberculosis by inducing those suffering from it to seek medical advice quickly and to undergo the usually lengthy treatment involved.  As this consideration does not apply in the case of the diseases which the Deputy has in mind, I am not prepared to agree to an extension of the concessions on the lines he proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister examine the position?  I am sure he knows the disease I have in mind.  I <Col N="834" /> know of a case in recent months of a person who was dying from the disease and who received notice that his salary was cut from £14 a week to £7.  This was at the height of his illness and he died a few months afterwards.  When the position was examined in years gone by in regard to tuberculosis, the disease I have in mind, cancer, was not so rampant or so recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cancer would have to be treated in the same manner as any other disease.  There is a particular case for tuberculosis or any other infectious disease because it is important to induce people suffering from such infectious disease to go for treatment as quickly as possible because they are a danger to other people.</P>

    <P>7.  Mr. Ryan asked the Minister for Finance the number of card punchers in State employment in respect of whom the Civil Service Commissioners have made orders under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956; and the reason why such persons have not been recruited in the normal way to the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of card punchers in State employment on 15 February, 1965, in respect of whom the Civil Service Commissioners have made Orders under section 5 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 or who were recruited under the First Schedule to that Act was 114.  The officers were recruited in this manner because of the uncertainty as to what extent the grade of card puncher would remain a permanent feature of the Civil Service structure, the irregular pattern of recruitment to the grade and the need to fill posts at short notice.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education sanctioned a grant on 11th February, 1965, for the erection of this school and the Commissioners of Public Works have listed the case for attention.

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary give serious consideration to the fact that this school is one of the worst in the country?  It has too many pupils for its size; it is rat infested; and the lack of sanitary facilities makes the situation there appalling.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position is that in 1961 the manager submitted a site which is much too small.  When an alternative site was approved and the sketch plans sent to the manager in September, 1964, the manager scrapped that site and offered the site of the existing school.  That is the cause of the delay but I hope to be able to make a start on the school within the next few months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to continued protests at the selection of the East Pier, and St. Michael's Wharf, Dún Laoghaire, for the siting of the car ferry terminal; and whether he is prepared to postpone his decision for a period of six months to further investigate the possibilities of the siting at Trader's Wharf, as suggested by the objectors to the present site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final decision to site the permanent terminal facilities for the car ferry <Col N="837" /> service at St. Michael's Wharf was taken in April, 1964, after full consideration of the views of all interests then concerned.  This site was chosen to obviate interference with local amenities by the erection of the terminal at the East Pier which was the best site from the navigational and engineering points of view.  There was full consultation in the matter with Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the decision was supported by that body.</P>
    <P>The facilities at the East Pier are temporary and are necessary to provide for the commencement of the service next July.  I have already given an undertaking that the East Pier will be restored to its original condition as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The siting of the terminal at Trader's Wharf was also considered but as this site is very exposed to swells from the directions North to East protective works would very probably be necessary. The nature and cost of such works would only be determined by prolonged hydraulic investigation probably involving the construction of a model.  Deepening of the harbour would also be necessary and the provision of the extensive areas required for a terminal would be difficult and costly.  There would also be operating difficulties because of the distance from the existing facilities at Carlisle Pier and Dún Laoghaire Railway Station.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that a detailed examination of the possibility of siting the terminal at Trader's Wharf would involve several years delay in the provision of the terminal; the cost could not now be determined but would very probably be substantially higher, even excessive; and there could be no assurance, at this stage, that British Railways would be prepared to use a terminal at this site.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the provision of a permanent terminal is a matter of urgency not only to permit the reversion of the East Pier to public use but to ensure the full and rapid development of the important new ferry service.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I cannot see my way to alter the decision to <Col N="838" /> build the permanent terminal at St. Michael's Wharf which was taken after the fullest consideration and in consultation with the local authorities and other interests then concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if adequate precautions can be taken to ensure that when the present terminal is sited, it will not interfere with the amenities there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from a personal point of view, the preservation of the tourist amenities at the West Pier is a matter of interest to everybody and the siting of the pier at St. Michael's Wharf concentrates the whole of the transport arrangements in one area where there is already a pier, transport lines and a railway station.</P>

      <P>and should include the following subjects:</P>

      <P>(2)  Policy in relation to special amenity areas, major open spaces, coastal, lakeside and river amenities and leisure facilities.</P>

    <P>The consultant will submit an interim report to the Minister dealing with the economic, social and technical problems of the planning of the district comprised in the Limerick city/South Clare/Shannon Industrial Estate complex. The interim report to be submitted within three months and the final report and plan within 15 months, both periods to run for one month from the date of appointment.</P>
    <P>Dr. Lichfield was appointed by me in Limerick on 15th December, 1964.</P>
    <P>The total estimated cost of the study based on scales suggested by the Chartered Town Planning Institute is in the region of £21,000, including office establishment and running costs, salaries of professional, technical and office staffs, fees for specialist studies, travelling and subsistence expenses, and incidental expenses such as stationery, printing and other office requisites.  The purpose of this type of study, which I intend will be carried out in all regions of the country, is to obtain an expert assessment of the general development needs and potential of the region in the interests of co-ordinated planning.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the study will be made available by me to the several planning authorities in the region to guide and assist them in preparing their separate development plans under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>I have decided on these regional planning studies as a special measure to assist planning authorities in the discharge of their functions under the Act and I anticipate that the specialist advice and recommendations which will be obtained will greatly contribute to balanced and integrated development in the region as a whole.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether the possible use of destructors in place of the present method of refuse collection <Col N="845" /> and disposal has been investigated by his Department; and, if so, if he will state the findings regarding the cost and efficiency of such destructors and the likelihood of revenue from the collection and utilisation of valuable waste materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind refuse disposal by means of plant involving complex processes of segregation, salvage and incineration of materials.</P>
      <P>The question of the system of refuse disposal to be adopted in any area is primarily a matter for the sanitary authority, but nevertheless, the merits of alternative methods of disposal are receiving consideration in my Department. It is felt that, while the efficiency of the system referred to by the Deputy has not given rise to doubts, the overall capital and maintenance charges involved might not warrant a change in the normal existing system in most cases.  In general, I understand that hygienically controlled tipping is less expensive than any form of incineration and is often less cause of nuisance from dust, flies, smoke and other forms of air pollution.</P>
      <P>On the information available it is clear that the increased expenditure which would be involved in the adoption of salvage and incineration plants in this country would not be offset to any appreciable degree by sale of salvaged material.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has yet sanctioned proposals for a scheme of forty-eight houses on a site at Laytown, County Meath, the layout plans of which were sent to him on 30th October, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On 7th December, 1964, Meath County Council were informed that no objection was seen to the proposed utilisation for housing purposes of a site at Laytown but that the layout plan proposed was unsatisfactory in certain respects.  I understand that a revised layout plan will be submitted to my Department shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the reason the original layout plan was considered unsuitable was that his Department were not sure how it would fit into the proposed planning under the new Planning Act and would he say how the council could fit a scheme into a plan which has not yet been prepared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be one of the related considerations that would enter into this matter.  The others are the proposed density of houses per acre.  The layout generally was quite monotonous.  No provision had been made for any car parking space.  No provision whatsoever had been made for an open space.  No contours were indicated on the plans submitted to me.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the reasons for the continued delay in vesting in the applicant (name supplied) of cottage No. 8/1 Baltinglass under the Wicklow County Council Cottage Purchase Scheme, having regard to the fact that in a reply of 3rd December, 1963 he stated that he understood that the necessary documents were being prepared and that the Council expected to be in a position to vest it in the then near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply of the 3rd December, 1963, was based on information supplied by Wicklow County Council at that time.  I am now informed that the cottage has not yet been vested and that the delay is due to a number of factors including a shortage of technical staff to deal with the considerable backlog of applications. I understand that the rate of vesting has improved during the current financial year and I have asked that the particular case to which the Deputy refers be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

I understand that the council are reasonably confident that their target will be achieved in the coming financial year.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, in reply to the Deputy's question of 3rd March last, if the housing authority are of opinion that I can be of assistance in increasing output, I shall be glad to consider any further proposals they submit to that end.</P>

      <P>There is no proposal before me for running a main sewer down the Grand Canal.  The proposal made by Dublin Corporation in this matter was referred back to the Corporation for reconsideration as regards the technical basis of the scheme itself and its general planning implications and for investigation of possible alternative solutions.  The practicability of utilising treated sewage for agricultural purposes was considered by a committee set up in 1947 by the Minister for Local Government.  This committee reported that sewage sludge recovered from sewage works has a certain manurial value but that the cost of its production in useful form from Dublin sewage would be out of proportion to its value as a fertiliser.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to announce to the Dáil that I have been informed by the British Prime Minister that his Government have recently decided to meet out request for the repatriation of the remains of Roger Casement.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, it was Casement's express wish that he should have his final resting place in Ireland, and it has long been the desire of the people of Ireland, shared by successive Irish Governments, that this wish be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Wilson has generously responded to my representations in this <Col N="867" /> matter, and I wish to record, therefore, the Government's deep satisfaction at his decision, which will render possible the fulfilment of Roger Casement's wish.  This decision, coming as it does so soon after the centenary of Roger Casement's birth, will, I am sure, be universally welcomed as yet another step towards the establishment of the closest and most friendly relations between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made with the British Government for the transfer of the remains to Dublin to-day.  The Government have decided that the remains should be re-interred in the burial plot in Glasnevin Cemetery selected by Roger Casement's sister, Mrs. Newman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I must say I assumed there would be some words of welcome of the statement from both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, and I am very pleased to welcome it on behalf of the Labour Party and the labour movement in general.  I welcome this decision by the British Government to have the remains of Sir Roger Casement repatriated.  Sir Roger Casement lived, worked and died for justice for the poor and underprivileged, not alone of this country but of many parts of the world.  It is indeed a very happy occasion for us to know that repeated requests for the return of his remains have at last been acceded to.  On an occasion such as this, one is wont to recall the words of the poet Yeats who said: &ldquo;It is high time that justice was done to this most gallant gentleman.&rdquo;  May I conclude, therefore, by saying that I trust all Irish men and women will give suitable honour to the memory of Sir Roger Casement on 1st March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are ruled now, as we have unfortunately been for 27 of the past 33 years, by men of very mean ability.  One might wonder how they have survived so long but it is a well-known factor in the laws of physics that even the weakest structure will remain standing as long as it is adequately propped.  This weak team who call themselves Fianna Fáil have been propped up by public officials both in the Civil Service and in local bodies.  These officials, very much like Gilbert's public officials, are men &ldquo;whose privilege and pleasure that they treasure beyond measure is to run on little errands for Ministers of State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In 1958 we had one of these Gilbertian characters running a little errand for the Ministers of State. When the Fianna Fáil Party were unable themselves to plan a policy either in Opposition or in Government, they charged one of these civil servants to prepare a policy for them.  That document appeared first of all in a Grey Book which was published over the name of the civil servant and adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party in what they chose to call the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> This Programme which was supposed to expand employment, which was supposed to provide new opportunities for the Irish people, at the same time planned for and deliberately set about cutting down the number of houses in which an expanded population would be housed. They deliberately set about ensuring that there would not be proper accommodation for the people.</P>
      <P>At paragraph 3 of this programme of so-called expansion it says:</P>
      <P>On the basis of existing policies, the capital programme of public authorities will fall in the coming years, mainly because social needs, such as houses and hospitals, will be overtaken in most of the country.</P>
      <P>Nor do they leave it at that.  In paragraph 7 of the much-vaunted Programme, they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expected decline in social <Col N="870" /> capital expenditure in the coming years will afford an opportunity... of switching resources....</P>
    <P>We have had two White Papers on housing since the war.  One was published in 1948 and the other not until 1964.  It is regrettable that there was a gap of 16 years between them.  However, it is interesting to note that the 1948 White Paper said that the immediate requirements&mdash;and those were the words used in the title of the paper and repeated several times in the body of the paper&mdash;of this country at the end of the last war were 100,000 houses.  This White Paper of 1948 said that in the course of that programme:</P>
    <P>new arrears will have accrued and a fresh batch of old houses will have crossed the dividing line between reasonably good and unhealthy accommodation.  The long-term objective of the housing programme must be achieved with a rate of house output which will not alone make good our immediate wants but will supply the deficiency arising from year to year obsolescence of existing dwellings, changes in population structure, migration, elimination of overcrowding, living standards of accommodation and other causes.</P>
    <P>That is what the 1948 White Paper stated, but in 1958, when the Government produced a policy for so-called expansion, they said there would be a decline in housing because the need for housing had been answered.</P>
    <P>Yet in 1948, only 100,452 houses had been built since ten years previously when we were told the immediate need of the country was 100,000 houses.  In 1958 we had only fulfilled the immediate requirements of the post-war years and no consideration was given in 1958, and no proper consideration given since by this so-called expansionist Government, to the housing needs which the 1948 White Paper said were bound to arise because of the deficiency stemming from year to year, obsolescence of dwellings, <i>et cetera.</i> No consideration was given to population structure; no consideration was given to migration from country to cities and towns; no consideration was given to <Col N="871" /> the overcrowding which existed in 1948 and since; and no consideration given to the question of the living standards of accommodation and the other causes.</P>
    <P>They were all ignored by the Government when they deliberately set about their published plan of cutting down on the social needs of our people.  I shall give credit where credit is due. They referred in their plan to the expected decline in social capital expenditure.  They fulfilled their expectations gloriously, beyond the wildest dreams of their political opponents. Never in the history of housing in this country has there been such a miserable record.  This occurred not alone in Dublin city and county but throughout the length and breadth of the nation.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael were last in power, the annual output of local authorities was 4,700 houses for the whole country. Since then, the number for the whole country has declined to 1,600 a year.  If that does not underline the fact that this was national policy, Government policy, policy set out in the White Paper, formulated and controlled by the Custom House, I do not know what it indicates.  We are familiar with the character, now disappearing from the sophisticated world in which we live, the circus barker or the commercial barker who stands outside a shop to draw attention to his wares, in the case of the shop barker, or to the allegation that his show is the greatest on earth in the case of the circus barker.  However, there are one or two still left.  There is one man whose power of voice, whose content of speech and gesticulation remind one of a barker.  It is my friend Deputy Sherwin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Committee does not exist in the county where Deputy Burke lives.  It is said to be a good thing to mind one's own business because then one is not dependent on public funds for support or maintenance, and when one has a wife and family to look after, there is a moral obligation on one to mind his own business. This reminds me of the advice given to me by my father who in turn had it from his father.  My grandfather in County Cavan told my father that up in Dublin a man had got £500 the previous year for minding his own business. There is a lot to be said for it but if Dublin Corporation and those members who have a particular line of business which does not require attention during the hours normal people work can arrange to have meetings at 3 o'clock, in the middle of the working day, it is natural they will not get a full attendance.  It is no wonder Deputy Sherwin could complain last Thursday that only three out of 18 members might attend a meeting of the Housing Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in Dublin City Council, some of the people who could contribute most to municipal affairs are unable to attend meetings held at a particular hour of day.  What is wrong with my good friend Deputy Sherwin and others is that they are not able to see the wood for the trees.  They see problems which they think are <Col N="873" /> peculiar to themselves, not realising that the policy of national social investment in housing or anything else of the sort is primarily dictated in other places.  What Deputy Sherwin and others like him do not yet realise is that their experience is identical with the experience of members of corporations throughout the country because the Government, in the White Paper, determined, declared and promised to cut down on the number of houses our people required.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the housing of our people.  In the White Paper published last November, we were told their assessment of the number of unfit dwellings at the <Col N="874" /> present time is 50,000 and they added that a survey which was finished in 1960 would find out the number of unfit houses yet to be completed.  The interesting thing is that in 1958 they said they had answered the housing needs.  Two years later they have to start to find out what the housing needs are.  In the decade up to 1958, they continued to cut down on the number of houses and we were told last week by several Government spokesmen that housing was a fair barometer of Government policy, and that investment in housing was a fair measure of whether or not the Government were fulfilling their social obligations. We accept that measure and applying it to the record of this administration over the past seven years, we see there never has been a worse record of social investment by any Government since the commencement of the State.  Even in the worst years we never had such an appalling record. As a result of all this we have in Dublin, we were told by the chairman of the Housing Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some would have us believe that the Dublin Corporation allowed only a small number of dangerous buildings to be demolished in the past two years but the number of dangerous buildings demolished was about 900 odd and the number of families affected was something less than 3,000 so that if you accepted that crisis as being of the proportions a certain spokesman would have us believe, you would have over seven thousand people on the waiting list for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tests to decide qualifications of applicants can of course be fixed at a very low level.  Before a person is housed, you can provide that he must have a child every year, that he must be living in overcrowded conditions or that he must be suffering from an infectious disease.  You can fix all <Col N="875" /> these things to decide how many will qualify but where you have people clamouring for houses, people who are prepared to pay the outgoings involved, even a subsidised house, it is fair to assume there is a demand there.</P>
      <P>We are told also that the demand for houses fell off between 1957 and 1963-64 but the number of private houses being built remained almost static.  There was a small variation up and down, as there is invariably, for one year is never the same as another due to the multitude of influences that determine the number of houses being built or required.  But while the number of SDA houses remained more or less static, the number of houses built by local authorities was cut by two-thirds. Are we to understand that one section of the population remained more or less static and still required houses, while people less well off did not require houses, that they had fled from the land or had emigrated?  I do not think there was a class distinction in the matter of houses.</P>
      <P>I know that emigration continued at a growing rate up to 1960 but as long as there was a demand for houses reflected in the private housing figures, it was unpardonable to cut down on what we call the working-class houses. Even if we accept the argument that there was a lesser demand for houses on the part of the working classes, there was an obligation to deal with the dangerous buildings situation. There was a magnificent opportunity to provide houses for the 50,000 families now accepted as being in unfit houses but again the Government failed to oblige local authorities, who were unconcerned about the matter, to do anything about it.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Corporation Act of 1890 imposed serious obligations on Dublin Corporation to carry out continual inspections of old properties to ascertain whether or not they were dangerous.  The Housing Act of 1931, passed by the Cosgrave Government, renewed those obligations and spelled them out in greater detail. They required constant inspections and obliged the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities to keep a register of old houses, to keep a watch on them and to provide for replacements in time.  The object was to provide for the replacements before they became dangerous, before they collapsed on people, old or young.</P>
      <P>The report of the inquiry into the collapse of houses in Fenian Street and Bolton Street pointed out that this obligation had never been discharged by Dublin Corporation.  There are councillors in Dublin and many TDs who have from time to time complained about houses being dangerous and they have been put off by being told that they were not as yet condemned and not as yet officially accepted as dangerous.  That attitude reminds one of the fact that you cannot call a man a madman until he has been certified as such by a doctor, but we know there are many people who are mentally disturbed who would be certified if they were examined but who never are examined.  The fact remains that they are still mentally disturbed and mentally ill.  The same situation has existed in relation to houses for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still a vast number of houses that should be taken down before they collapse and because we as a society have failed in our duty in that respect, <Col N="877" /> we have at present, according to the Government's conservative estimate, 50,000 families in dwellings which they regard as unfit, on the basis of their own poor standards.  Again there are something like 160,000 houses which were built more than a century ago and they represent between one-quarter and one-third of the houses in the country. Housing standards in 1865 were much below those which people can reasonably require and demand at present; yet we have between one-quarter and one-third of the houses built a century ago.</P>
    <P>We feel that a policy which has resulted, in the past seven years, in cutting down on housing investment is unpardonable.  We accept that the 1958 White Paper was published in ignorance, without an assessment of housing requirements because that only started in 1960 and has not yet been finished. The same cannot be said as an apologia for the 1964 programme of so-called expansion but that at least is clever because it avoids mention of social investment in housing at all, realising the mistake made in being frank and honest about the intentions of 1958. We in Fine Gael believe there is something radically wrong with a Government or a Party who conceive a notion of an expansion in economic affairs, in financial wealth, and have the intention of expanding industrial employment and fail to make a housing policy to enable that expansion to take place.</P>
    <P>Exception has been taken to my reference to the ballyhoo about Ballymun and a gloss has been put on my remark, as I expected it would, by saying it was a peculiar outlook if I regarded 3,000 houses as ballyhoo. That is an inaccurate gloss and is taking my remark out of its context. We are told that it will take four years to complete Ballymun.  It may be less and we hope it will be less.  The number of units to be provided is just over 3,000 but this number of units, to be provided over four years, is no more than two years of the normal output of houses by Dublin Corporation when Fine Gael were in power.  We are going to take four years, with unknown materials and at a still unascertained <Col N="878" /> cost to build the number of houses that were built by Fine Gael in two years.  The number of houses to be built represents no more than the number of houses lost to the people of Dublin in three years under the present administration.  Anybody who gets the key of a house or a flat in Ballymun need not thank the present administration for it.  He would have got it at half the cost five years earlier if the disastrous housing policy of the Government had not been applied over the past half decade.</P>
    <P>Families whose children have been reared in unhealthy surroundings, young children who will grow into adulthood weak and in bad health and old people who have suffered misery can have little for which to thank the Government who deliberately set about sabotaging the housing drive that was inaugurated to meet the existing demands.  That is why I referred to cocktail parties and consortiums of foreign builders and to the press conferences used to present Ballymun as ballyhoo.  Ballymun, which will rise to ten, 12 or 14 storeys high, will be a monument to seven years gross neglect of housing matters by the present administration.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael were in power, we allocated, applied and used one-third of national capital development for housing alone; one-third of the amount for capital development every year was devoted to housing in an effort to meet the housing requirements of our people. What we were doing was in accordance with accepted international standards. The percentage which is applied in most countries for housing is one-third of the amount for national capital development and we, alone in OECD, cut down our percentage for housing to one-sixth.  When some people boast that they had no difficulty in getting money for housing, they should remember that it is a lot easier to get money to build 270 houses a year than it is to get money to build 1,600 a year.</P>
    <P>Now we have a sense of panic.  We have 10,000 people in Dublin alone looking for houses.  We have many families in Dublin who, for the past year, have received from society a common night's shelter.  In the year of <Col N="879" /> the local elections, when there is a crisis in housing, we have the Government making some effort to overtake their neglect of the past seven years. This is being done at a time when money is scarce and dear, when the labour market is hopelessly and completely disorganised, when we have lost forever some of the best tradesmen ever in this country, when we have diverted a labour force to the building of blocks of luxury flats and unnecessary office buildings.  When we have the whole labour market disorganised and when money is dear and scarce is the time the Government decide to do something about housing.</P>
    <P>One wonders what steps the Government propose to take to grapple with the present property racketeering in Dublin.  We have seen the flow of hot money into the country and the unhealthy speculation in property values. I have no doubt that the Minister, when considering what aspects of income should be taxed, will meet criticism with the statement that no suggestion as to how money should be raised has come from the Opposition. Let me say that the time has now come when it is nationally desirable, socially necessary and financially justifiable to tax capital gains in land and in housing property.</P>
    <P>To give an instance, I have in mind a property which was sold in Dublin for £18,000 a little over two years ago. It was put up for auction a year after that and fetched £25,000.  The same property was again offered for sale at public auction and was withdrawn at £45,000.  In another part of the city, seven houses in a row were sought as an investment by a foreign speculator. He bought out the first house at £7,000, increased his price until the others sold and the final price paid was £34,500. That is the kind of money which is making land here too dear for use for the normal housing of our people.</P>
    <P>Where private personal profit is being made because of the social needs of our people, where considerable profit is being made by a small section who have the money and because land and property are becoming scarce, I think the Minister has a social obligation to <Col N="880" /> divert some of these increased values and profits back to use for the social needs of our people.  Some of these large increases in values have come about because services have been put in adjoining the property by the local authorities and instead of the public sector getting back the added value, private persons are getting the total profit on them.  It seems a peculiar activity in our national life and it seems difficult to justify a system under which £10 million may be spent from public sources to provide services which can be used to provide private profits of the same or a greater amount.  Where we have such a development, the Minister has a duty to see that some of the increased value is brought back to pay for the social advantages and amenities provided.</P>
    <P>We have not yet here accepted the moral obligation which lies on us to provide housing for our people.  We have not yet accepted the fundamental principle that we must provide housing for our people.  We have to some extent accepted that health services ought to be provided, though we have not yet provided them in a proper way.  We have also accepted that we should provide people with at least the necessaries of life in the form of food and clothing.  We have not yet, as I have said, conceived it to be our duty to provide housing and shelter in the same way.  I want to remind this Government, because I think they have forgotten it, of the words of the good Pope John in <i>Pacem in Terris</i> when speaking of the rights of man, the simple and fundamental rights of man, and what he described as a worthy standard of living.  He said:</P>
    <P>...every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity, and to the means which are necessary and suitable for the proper development of life; these are primarily food, clothing, shelter, rest, medical care, and finally the necessary social services.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the third fundamental in human rights is shelter.  I do not think that what the Pope had in mind then was the kind of shelter being provided in Griffith Barracks and in Island Street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> Again, the same great Pope, in <i>Mater et Magister,</i> had this to say:</P>
    <P>Now, if ever, is the time to insist on a more widespread distribution of property, in view of the rapid economic development of an increasing number of States.  It will not be difficult for the body politic, by the adoption of various techniques of proved efficiency, to pursue an economic and social policy which facilitates the widest possible distribution of private property in terms of durable consumer goods, houses, land...</P>

      <P>We have failed to use the techniques of proved efficiency.  We have failed to pursue an economic and social policy which would provide our people with houses&mdash;houses, according to Christian teaching, being a fundamental necessity of man and a fundamental right.  In my opinion, this indicates above all else this Government's most disastrous failure.  We have had a number of lectures in the course of this debate on the cost of living. Government spokesman after Government spokesman has sought to justify a policy of inactivity and neglect.  We have had declarations of inability to control prices.  We have had statements that price control is a myth, that price control is unobtainable.  Because absolute price control is not obtainable, the Government make no effort at all to ensure that prices keep in step with the incomes of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power loves to lecture us on various statistics.  I am waiting for the day when we will hear him lecture us on price control measures in other countries.  It should be most interesting. He is usually very fascinating when he takes us on a world tour.  I sincerely hope he will soon devote his attention to controlling the cost of living.  Many countries are using devices of one kind or another to keep the cost of living within bounds.  I should like to hear the Minister for Transport and Power lecture this Assembly and the Government on how the cost of living is controlled in Norway, Holland, Belgium and Austria.  The cost of living <Col N="882" /> is controlled in these countries, and the OECD has pointed out that, while it may be difficult to control the cost of living in large countries, because of the variations between one area and another and because of the differences in outlook and in demand as between one sector of the economy and another, in small homogeneous countries, like Norway, Holland and Belgium, it is possible to control costs to a degree not feasible in large countries with complicated economies.</P>
    <P>If we are to have here what the Government are recommending the trade unions to adopt&mdash;a wages policy &mdash;then, in fairness to the trade unions and to salary earners, and in justice to people whose incomes are to be controlled, we must have side by side with such a policy, a price control policy and a non-wages incomes policy.  That is necessary for two reasons.  First of all, if there is to be a wages policy, such as the Government were hoping for when the last National Wage Agreement came, one cannot expect the wage earner to have confidence in such an agreement unless he knows that non-wage incomes are also going to move <i>pari passu</i> and that there will not be restrictions on one section of the community and no restriction whatsoever on another.  The Government must also ensure that when one section of the community gets a certain increase in income, by agreement, all other sections of the community get a like increase.  Otherwise, we shall have the situation this Government have allowed to develop with increasing speed, the situation in which farming incomes and those of the self-employed and the incomes of pensioners and of people on fixed incomes will fall, and fall by a serious and inconvenient amount relative to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why there must be price control if there are wage agreements or, as I would prefer to see, incomes agreements.  If you want to have a national incomes agreement respected, then you must control prices. There are many elements in prices which have nothing to do with wages, but, from the way this Government act, one would think the only factor in <Col N="883" /> increasing costs is the wage factor.  Our people, particularly in the city of Dublin, have suffered greatly increasing outgoings.  Since 1960-61 there has been a relaxation of rent control.  There was a time when accommodation was available at reasonable prices.  The Government in 1961 released a great deal of property from rent control, and rising rents have been a considerable factor in the cost of living and the cost of housing for many of our people. Housing accommodation is one of the most fundamental needs in any climate, and particularly in our climate.  Yet, as a result of Government policy, costs have been sent spiralling upwards.</P>
    <P>The removal of food subsidies is another factor which has increased the cost which has to be borne by people here.  The removal of direct price control has also been a factor in increasing prices.  Increases in indirect taxes have also multiplied prices here.  Even in a relatively free economy such as ours, there have been plenty of opportunities for price fixing and arranging. It is only lately the Government have made any conscious effort to stop this and they have only done it in relation to some of the more essential goods. It goes on day in and day out, and, we believe, is increasing because of the large number of mergers in, for instance, the food processing industry, the drink industry and so on.  It is undoubtedly certain that there is price arranging and fixing here.  It is clear that the Government and various Government agencies are making no real effort to prevent that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Acting in price matters only when there is a crisis is not good enough. Acting in industrial matters only when disputes have already arisen is insufficient in this sophisticated and complicated age.  In their White Paper <i>Closing the Gap,</i> which so many people have forgotten but which was at one time the be-all and end-all of Government policy, when wages were supposed to be kept down, the Government ignored prices and non-wage incomes. We think it is an extraordinarily limited and biased outlook which says wages must be kept down but there must be no control at all over non-wage <Col N="884" /> incomes and over prices in general.</P>
    <P>We see an eruption from time to time of the real Fianna Fáil outlook. We had it in <i>Closing the Gap.</i> We had it last autumn when we had a Government crisis, when, after several months of an unnecessary and artificially promulgated dispute in the building trade in Dublin, we had a Minister resigning from the Government.  Why?  Because his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has a statutory and moral obligation to keep industrial peace, moved in only after three months inactivity.  There is this much to be said for Deputy Smith, who resigned. He stood by his policy and did not vary it.  We know there are other members of the Government, such as the Minister for Health and the Minister for Transport and Power, who agreed and sided with Deputy Smith in regard to that industrial dispute. The Government at that time were anxious to break the back of the trade unions in this country.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that there are some other members of the Government who agreed with Deputy Smith, and with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Transport and Power, but we do not know who they are. There was clearly a majority in the Government for breaking the trade unions at that time and teaching the wage earners a lesson.  It was only when things reached crisis proportions, when one man infuriated by the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce stepped out of line, that we realised the serious cleavage there was in the Fianna Fáil Party and on the Government Benches.  It seems to be extraordinary that there should be such a large degree of support within the Fianna Fáil Party against the workers and wage earners.</P>

      <P>I know it is all too true. I would not put Deputy Burke in the same category in public, but goodness knows what he does in private.  I would not encourage him to ask me to analyse all his political activities, both in private and outside.  I am just looking <Col N="885" /> at the overall position.  Where you have a Government exhorting wage earners not to make demands, implying that some Government action may be necessary to restrict wages, and at the same time that Government doing nothing about prices and non-wage incomes, I am deeply suspicious.</P>
      <P>Why should prices be controlled? Because prices contain an element of profit.  If you do not watch over prices, you allow the people who charge those prices to have an uncontrolled income. At the same time, you are exhorting other people to accept control.  That is unfair.  Nationally, it is a disastrous policy.  It is possible, as Norway, Holland, Belgium, Austria and other countries have shown&mdash;I hope the Minister for Transport and Power is aware of what is going on abroad; he usually is&mdash;by setting guide posts and by indicating the pattern for future years, to control prices.  By control, I do not mean absolute, rigid control so that the thousand and one factors which influence prices cannot be considered. I mean that one takes into confidence the worker, the employer, the farmer, the self-employed, the wage earner, the non-wage earner and all sections of the community in plenty of time before a crisis commences.  One also tries to get full advance information, and to make available such information, on economic trends, labour requirements, future rates of growth, prices movements, and so on, to the community at large, so that future price increases can be agreed and increases in incomes, both for the non-wage earner and the wage earner, can be worked out according to pattern.  I suppose it is encouraging that at least some consideration is being given to a common pattern for the whole country, but we do not think the Government have gone nearly far enough in working out the general overall pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never take particular pleasure in saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; whenever something goes wrong; but I am reminded by the Taoiseach, who referred at some length to the Health Committee last week, of words I spoke in 1961, at column 853 and subsequently, volume 192 of the Dáil <Col N="886" /> Debates.  Last week the Taoiseach referred to the workings of the Select Committee on the Health Services.  We were told this Committee so far has been unable to find anything wrong with our health services.  The Taoiseach disclosed some of the business of that Committee.  At present one can only rely on hearsay as to what has occurred at that Committee, but as to what the outcome has been, I was prophetic in 1961.</P>
    <P>At that time I asked the House to consider what this Health Committee amounted to. I said:</P>
    <P>It asks 19 backbenchers of this House to sit down and do the work of the Minister for Health and his Department.  Never, I believe, in the history of parliamentary democracy, of democratic government, has any Minister had the cheek of the Minister for Health to abdicate his responsibilities while holding on to the crown and the throne and the profits of office.</P>
    <P>I said it was an effort by a dyed-in-thewool Tory, with no respect for the ordinary decencies of debate, who insists on interrupting people who are driving points home, particularly when they hurt him, to prevent this country getting from any Party or any Government the health services which any decent democracy would long since have had.</P>

      <P>I will just, if I may, finish with this one.  I should like to <Col N="887" /> go much further but will have respect for your views by not quoting myself extensively.  Now that Members opposite have the reference, I have no doubt that they will look it up for themselves. I said, Sir, that people who would sit on that Committee would, perhaps unwittingly, find themselves as the 19 selected stooges who would be embarrassed into silence by this mischievous plan of the Minister for Health.  I said I regretted the fact that the Labour Party had at the time, to the extent of putting down an amendment which was in support of the Committee, assisted the setting up of that Committee.  But is it not all very sad that here, four years later, we have the Taoiseach of the same Government reminding the Irish people of the failure of this Committee?</P>
      <P>I wonder can we recall the atmosphere in which this Committee was set up?  It was set up at a time when the Government expected they would be out of office in a matter of a year or so and this Committee was established with the intention of postponing until after the following general election any consideration of health matters. But we have had most peculiar support given to the present Administration in their anti-social policies and they have been enabled by various devices, some of them extremely costly nationally, some of them extremely damaging nationally, to remain in office.  Here, four years later, we have the Taoiseach proceeding to attack the Fine Gael Party because they made submissions to the Select Committee on Health Services to which the Minister for Health has been unable for almost a year to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be an extraordinary admission of failure.  These taunts come from a Party who like to jeer the Fine Gael Party, saying that they have not got a policy.  As I pointed out four years ago, there would be no need for a Committee on the Health Services of this House or any other body in the country if the Government had a policy in health matters.  There would be no need for the panic in housing matters in 1965 if the Government <Col N="888" /> had had a proper policy on housing matters and social investment over the past seven years and there would be no need for the appalling Vote on Account which we have at the present time, which has not improved the real standards of our people and which has not answered the needs of our people, if the Government had made a serious effort to control the cost of living and to have a sensible incomes policy in this matter over the past seven years.</P>
    <P>It is because the Government, assisted by their Gilbertian advisers who run their little errands for them, have been unable to produce for this country a policy in accordance with the needs of the second half of the twentieth century that we on this side of the House say they are a Government that Ireland cannot afford and the sooner we are rid of them the better for this country and, strangely enough, the better for Fianna Fáil because, then, even the Minister for Transport and Power would be able to do his homework and would find that there are abroad plenty of examples of the kind of way in which we ought to be developing our economy and, unless he does it, we will never become, as Pope John said, either a socially or economically advanced nation because we will not be applying the multitudinous techniques which are available to those who are not just sitting, as the Government are doing, but who sit and think and act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main answer to Deputy Ryan is that the real incomes of the people have expanded at a faster rate in the past five years than they have at any time since the ending of World War II.  Nobody can deny&mdash; the figures are not questioned by any member of the Opposition&mdash;that that is the essential fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, first of all, to deal with some points made by Deputy Ryan just when I came in in regard to an alleged confusion of thinking about the issue of wages and prices in this country.  The present Government set up the National Industrial Economic Council with the hope that in time to come <Col N="889" /> and as they drew strength from their endeavours, they would be able to present a general guide to the community independent of political influence as to what progress was being made and to give certain guides in relation to the levels of prices and wages and profits in connection with the growth of the national income.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that Deputies of this party have been concerned more with talking about a national wages policy as distinct from a national incomes policy.  We have made it clear at all times that if we want to have an acceptance of a national incomes policy, the workers must be satisfied as to their income growth compared with the total income growth of the whole community and I have stated, and others on this side of the House have stated, that in the northern countries referred to by Deputy Ryan has grown up a tradition that the workers are given some information on the collective profits made in various industries so that they can measure the growth of profits and dividends to shareholders against the increases that they receive in remuneration over a five-year period or over a single-year period, and so establish how far they are gaining their due share of national prosperity.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in persuading the interested groups that there must be that kind of understanding but it is a pleasure to me to point out that there are a certain number of industries, including one industry that I am not going to name publicly at this moment, which already present to the workers an absolutely clear statement in a form that they can understand, of the profit received by shareholders for various periods, the amount of profit put back into new equipment, into new machinery, for the development of the business and the amount the workers have received in increases of wages during a specific period.</P>
    <P>In that case, because it was an isolated instance, one could hardly expect the workers in a particular industry to pay any particular heed to a statement presented to them which is not one common to industry as a whole <Col N="890" /> and we have frequently stated that in our effort to secure a general acceptance of the national incomes principle there may have to be changes on both sides, both among employers and workers, in regard to their thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the more rigid control of prices that can be seen in certain northern European countries. Those countries have established for a considerable number of years over-full employment and so the danger of inflation in connection with wages and profits may be greater there than it is here where, although we have established full employment in certain industries, over the country as a whole it cannot yet be said that we have achieved that objective.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is equally true to say that the great majority of industries here are protected by tariffs and that the tariffs have been reduced by two reductions of ten per cent. There has been an increase in the quota of imported goods.  These changes have created more competitive conditions.  It is equally true to say that, as the House well knows, a number of prices have been investigated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and on a number of occasions he has listed the enquiries which he has undertaken, showing that we do not take the view that no prices should be investigated.  We take the view that, when it is required, price enquiries can be instituted and a number of reports have been published in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>When we talk about a national incomes policy, again, there are all sorts of complicated factors which are of particular interest to the workers themselves. For example, if the National Industrial and Economic Council are able to announce a specific growth in the national income or if the Government make such an announcement and it is published as part of the statistics of the country, it may be possible to give only a general guide to the community because if all wages in a particular industry are increased by the same percentage, there may be distortions arising as between the wages <Col N="891" /> of one grade and another and that is a matter that has to be considered in these northern countries where the national incomes policy is accepted. Equally, a question arises sometimes in relation to particularly low paid workers where it might be felt that wherever it is possible they should receive a slightly greater increase than the rest of the community.  That itself may have some effect on prices so that it may not always be to their advantage. That also has to be studied. Again there is this question&mdash;and this has occurred in some northern countries where they have a minimum wage concept&mdash;that very low paid workers may have to be specially considered in relation to a national incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Then there are always the exceptional cases of industries with very low productivity where the need for reequipment is great, where the managements should exert themselves to modernise and where for the time being, until the unions can persuade the management and until the general effect of modernisation of the industry can be felt, it may not be possible for wages to increase at the national level.</P>
    <P>Again there have been cases where there has been a startling growth in productivity through the use of machinery, through automation, through computers, where because of that the duties of workers have changed from being less skilled to more skilled and where in particular circumstances the application of the general increase must have some relation to the changes in the structure of the industry itself because of the very great growth in productivity that has been seen to take place in that particular field.</P>
    <P>These matters are common knowledge and members of the House who wish to study the matter further should consult, for example, the Journal for Industrial Relations where in the number published for November, 1964, there was an elaborate examination of this whole problem.  It is true to say that it is very difficult to operate a national incomes policy with complete success and occasionally the system <Col N="892" /> breaks down as has been the case in Northern Europe recently owing to money pressure, owing to imported labour and other circumstances.  Sometimes the system breaks down and sometimes the government has to take mild anti-inflationery measures as were taken in the Netherlands recently to correct the effect of the breakdown in the pursuit of a national incomes policy.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to illustrate we have a very intelligent appreciation of this most difficult problem. Members of the Government and members of this Party have been moving gradually and steadily towards encouraging sound thinking on this question.  The ninth round of wages did indicate a kind of acceptance of the principle through its duration and it would be interesting to have more intelligent thinking on it on both sides, on the employers' side and the workers' side and we may be able to achieve further progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>Let nobody have any idea that the members of our Party are divided into two groups, those who might imagine vainly that this kind of process can be accepted by the trade union movement without all the implications being examined and those who are able to see clearly the difficulties in advance of getting a general concept of a national incomes policy.  The members of my Party are all together in regard to this most difficult problem.  Let me say further that there are some things in which the English set us an example. I do not think industrial relations are one of them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more effort put into this question.  There already has been some effort on the part of the trade union movement.  Various members have been to the Netherlands and Denmark and have pointed out the difficulty of applying the system here in our circumstances.  However, I should like to hope there will be more effort to examine the system in the northern part of Europe and in Switzerland where the real wages of workers have risen steadily and mightily since the War, where there is no general complaint that the application <Col N="893" /> of this principle has resulted in the depression of the worker and in the making of excessive profits.</P>
    <P>In regard to profits, there is a lot of foolish talk as if the growth of profits was an indication that there is something wrong with an industry, whereas if one makes an examination of the great industries of the world one will find the higher the profits in the industry the more satisfactory is the position of the workers, particularly if there is a well organised trade union within that industry and if those within the trade union catering for that industry have learned to accept the idea of productivity, the idea of modernisation.  If all these factors are present it will not be found that industries making great profits are industries which depress workers, at least not the modern kind of industry of which I am talking.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is absolutely essential to deal with the extraordinary nonsense that has been talked by the Fine Gael Party in regard to there being 73,000 fewer people at work now than in 1956.  The nauseating hypocrisy associated with these statements is almost impossible to endure. We endure it and indeed we can smile because it is simply the result of not presenting the true facts.  The Coalition Government held dominion over the affairs of this country for six of the nine years subsequent to World War II. During that period the national income rose by a very minimum amount every year, nothing of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>This figure of 73,000 is obtained by subtracting the number of people at work in April, 1963, from the number of people at work in April, 1956.  The two figures are 1,125,000 and 1,052,000, respectively.  It is, therefore, correct to say that there were 73,000 fewer at work between one period and the other.  Here is the important point. The Fine Gael Party and the other Coalition Parties remained in office until they scuttled out in March, 1957. We are surely entitled to ask how many people were disemployed when Fianna Fáil came back to office.  Why should Fianna Fáil be blamed for what happened effectively during the last twelve months of the Coalition Government?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> The fact is that 41,000 people lost their jobs between April, 1956, and April, 1957.  I have already mentioned that the number of people at work in 1956 was 1,125,000, and the number at work in April, 1957, had dropped to 1,084,000.  Subtracting these two figures one finds that 41,000 people lost their jobs during that last, single year of the Coalition Government.  So much for the Coalition Parties' effort to blame Fianna Fáil for the loss of those 41,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>There is another deception in the statement of the Coalition Parties.  The latest date covered by them is April, 1963.  They relate the figure of the 73,000 drop in jobs to the date April, 1963.  Of course the position since then has been steadily improving and now roughly 7,000 to 9,000 new jobs are being provided each year.</P>
    <P>Another way of looking at the position is through the official figures for the numbers employed in the manufacturing industry and in the transportable goods industry.  In March, 1958, the number was 140,000.  In December, 1963, it was 171,000, a clear gain of 31,600.  Then, having dealt with that nonsense as though we were responsible for the decline in the number of people at work which has now been arrested, we may deal with the next problem, the clear suggestion by the Coalition groups that 250,000 people have emigrated since 1956 due to our policies.  The fact of the matter is that during the last 12 months of the last Coalition Government's period of office, emigration was higher than at any time since the Famine, more than 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>Naturally, this could not be stopped at once.  There was emigration by farmers from their holdings, followed successively by emigration of their children.  It is impossible to arrest such a tide, particularly in view of the fact that it has been a continuing factor in our economy since the Famine that our people venture abroad and have done well abroad.  It has become a habit of thought almost endemic in the community.  Therefore, to arrest immediately the result of the mess caused by the Coalition in 1957 would have been difficult.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> At long last the population is actually increasing, as reflected in the returns of the Registrar General: the population has grown by about 30,000 in the last three years.  That is not very much, but nevertheless it is at least a turn of the tide.  In addition, nobody can question the facts that have been announced by the Central Statistics Office that, generally speaking, as many new jobs are being created in the non-agricultural field as cease in the agricultural field as a result of migration from the land which proceeds here, unfortunately, but at a lower rate than in many European countries during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Up to recently, it has been impossible to stimulate dynamic thinking among our people and put into operation a programme which would ensure the possibility of providing employment in the non-agricultural field to compensate for the numbers leaving the land.  We have been able to do that during the past six years.  The only mistake, possibly, we made is that though in October, 1956, the Taoiseach made a very considerable statement pointing out that everything he had said a year previously in regard to the possibilities of finding employment had to be reviewed in the light of the grave financial situation the country found itself in during 1955 and 1956, he made two very elaborate statements showing how, for the investment of more capital, more employment could be given.  Those statements clearly presaged the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> clearly showed that the Fianna Fáil Party, let by the Taoiseach, were thinking along lines of planning.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need to read the conclusion of the second statement of the Taoiseach in 1956, the last six paragraphs of which indicated clearly that we were thinking along those lines &mdash;planning for growth in every sector and working out a plan in which, by the investment of capital, we could ensure eventually greater agricultural and industrial production.  In October, 1956, this statement was quite clearly made by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>It was made by Deputy Lemass, who quite clearly stated that the very optimistic statement a year before would have to be reviewed in the light of existing circumstances. It relieves Deputy Lemass and this Party from the charge levelled against us that we specifically promised to find employment for 100,000 persons.  This statement, given considerable publicity, is not mentioned by the Opposition or is discarded as they have discarded the facts concerning the woeful emigration, the woeful reduction in employment which took place in 1956 and 1957 and which makes hay and nonsense of their statistics which tried to prove that we have caused the total loss of employment in this country.</P>
      <P>It would be a good thing if this document were laid on the Table of the House, but in actual fact it is too well known to anybody who troubled to study the political history of the time.  If Deputy Lemass had not made that statement in October, 1956, we would have been guilty of making a promise which was quite obviously at the time completely impossible of fulfilment. We corrected our statement and now at last we can say we are making progress, that more employment is being given every year.  The employment figures are very much better than in 1957 and emigration has at last been restricted to a reasonable figure.</P>

      <P>The next thing I wish to refer to are statements made recently by a number of Opposition speakers about the colossal increase in Government expenditure.  No statement is made as to how those people would reduce it.  The implication is that somehow or other expenditure on the Government's services could be brought back to the figure of Coalition days. All one gets are statements about the growth in Government expenditure and we have all sorts of statements on television by Fine Gael Deputies calling for new policies, all of which would cost many millions of pounds, all of which are fancy additions to what is already Fianna Fáil policy without stating where the money is to come from.</P>
      <P>It is important that our people should be told the truth.  The truth is that there is no government in northern Europe with either a developed or an undeveloped economy which can any longer say to people that the more prosperous they get the less taxation they will have to pay as a percentage of their income.  At one time there was a suggestion of this.  It was felt by quite a number of people from the conservatives, from the liberals and very rarely from Labour, that that was the kind of thing they could promise &mdash;that the more prosperous people got the less people would be required to pay as a percentage of their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now know from a study of the history of many countries in Northern Europe which had made greater progress than we have up to the time our economy started to improve that no such thing holds any more.  All now face the situation that, the more prosperous the country gets, the more the demands grow for Government expenditure. It is entirely wrong to tell the public about the increase in the cost of Government without at the same time relating them to the incomes of the people.  Luckily for us there is a general acceptance internationally of a standard by which taxation in relation to incomes can be judged.  No doubt there may be imperfections there because it is impossible to have absolute consistency <Col N="898" /> in the analysis.  It is, however, acceptable as a guide.</P>
    <P>The position is that the gross national product of the country is taken and the total cost of government, both national and local, is calculated and a percentage made, one of the other.  Now the latest figures which I have for a number of European countries are for 1962.  So far as I know, there were no changes of note since that date.  In 1962 general Government and local taxation as a percentage of gross national product was, in Ireland, 22.4 per cent, and in Belgium, 27.2 per cent; in France, 35.1 per cent; in Germany, 35.3 per cent; in Italy, 29.7 per cent; in Luxembourg, 30.4 per cent; the Netherlands, 31.6 per cent; and in the United Kingdom, 30.4 per cent.  It meant that in our country people were working on average one-fifth of their time either for the Government or the local authority.  In respect of their expenditure and their incomes they had to work one-fifth.  The rich had to work more and the poor people had to work less.  In actual fact I have the figures for 1956-57, the end of the period of Coalition Government.  The percentage at that time was something in the region of 22 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that since 1962 there had been very little change but since then did the turnover tax not come into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. For the year 1964-65, which includes the turnover tax, if the total amount that is reckoned as local taxation and central taxation are added together the result is 24.3 per cent of the gross national product.  Of course people will say: &ldquo;But you increased tax levels.&rdquo; and the answer is that if incomes continue to grow in order to preserve the percentage of taxation and rates collected in relation to gross national product, it may be necessary to raise taxation <Col N="899" /> simply because the increases in income that take place with a given level of taxes do not necessarily produce the same percentage of tax revenues.  I am quite sure an expert could give the reasons for that.</P>
      <P>Between 1956-57 and the present year, we were collecting just a little more than 24 per cent of the gross national product of the country in taxes and in rates.  We have been perfectly honest with the people about this.  We have published in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> particulars up to 1970 of the kind of levels which we think taxation will have to measure up to both for current expenditure and in relation to capital expenditure.  We made it clear that we can see no hope of departing from the traditional experience of other Northern European countries although there may be exceptions in certain years.  Although one may adjust taxation as between classes, although one may increase allowances in one direction and reduce them in another, or may make temporary reductions in certain forms of taxation, or alter the relationship of direct taxation to indirect taxation, we see no hope of being able to say to people we can reduce the percentage of the gross national product taken from the people as taxes or rates.</P>
      <P>We have been perfectly honest about it and it is true to say that when the report of the Commission on Higher Education is published, when the full plans for education announced by the Minister for Education have been considered and when the decisions are examined the increases in the cost of education alone in the next five years would make it by itself utterly impossible to bring down the percentage of the national income taken in taxation. There are other matters which press upon us in respect of the level of social services and to find sufficient money for all the other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for the increase in Government expenditure has been a very great increase in Government remuneration. The increase in the past five years has been no less than £27 <Col N="900" /> million a year.  That was as a result of negotiations, arbitration and the examination of the levels of pay in various branches of the Civil Service. No one questioned it on the opposite side; no one questioned the necessity for it.  No doubt this was partly related to the growth of opportunities in employment other than the Civil Service, but if the £27 million is subtracted from the total Budget that is coming along now, or if the difference between £27 million and what would be represented by an increase in Government remuneration, were strictly proportional to the increase in the cost of living, there would be a considerable difference in the Estimates.  As I said, the increases in remuneration have been accepted generally throughout the community.  Naturally there may be some limits in regard to this.  I merely mention this to show that it could never have been foreseen by any Government that this would enter into the picture in the total Estimates as compared with what they were in the past five years.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make that matter clear because there is no use thinking about taxation in an old fashioned way. Whatever may happen in the Budget I believe that in the financial year 1965-66, there will not be a noticeable increase in the proportion of taxation, local or central, taken as a percentage of the gross national product which I believe will eventuate during the year 1965.  It might go up one per cent or two per cent, or it might remain where it is, but it is perfectly certain that the percentage will still be lower than in most European countries and will not show any signs of violent change in the attitude of the Government as to how much of the great volume of income can be taken to pay for the many services required both by the Government and the local authority.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if we were to argue about this in an intelligent way. It is ridiculous in this day to frighten the people at a time of a by-election, or even when there is no by-election, about the increase in the cost of Government when everybody knows that the cost of living has gone up, when the earnings of workers, both <Col N="901" /> agricultural and industrial, have gone up far more than the increased cost of living, and when the incomes of people have increased, and when everybody is screaming for more and more Government services, most of all the Opposition, and when everybody knows that the kind of economies that could be made by another Government coming in and examining the Estimates could not make any measurable alteration in the great volume of money that is required if this country is to go ahead and make progress in the way we would like it.  If the Opposition were to make a promise and if by any unhappy chance they were to succeed in getting into office they would not find it possible to take less from the pool of income.  It would be quite impossible for them to do that if they were to go ahead with the national expansion programme in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the question of rates. As everybody knows, the Government made a considerable contribution towards relieving farmers of the rates on agricultural land.  I thought it would be interesting to quote the case of one particular constituency in respect of the relief in rates of agricultural land.  In County Monaghan, in 1956-57, the rates were £167,000 and the net amount to be paid in the year now passing is £144,000, a reduction of £23,000.  That is an illustration of the serious contribution we have made towards the rating position of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>When we hear complaints of the increase in rates everywhere, we have to bear in mind the fact that there is at present sitting a committee which is examining the whole incidence of rates and, secondly, to give another example from County Monaghan, of the total amount spent by all the local authorities in that county, the Government contributed 64 per cent.  It is completely dishonest for people to go about talking about the incidence of the rates without relating such statements to the amount the Government are contributing. The percentage is not the same in all the counties.  I have not got the figure for the entire country but it would be in that region and it shows the great extent to which the Government <Col N="902" /> have contributed to the rates problem.</P>
    <P>Every time people advocate a reduction in the rates, they must equally be prepared to say what form of increased central taxation they advocate for future subvention of the local rates.  If they want to change the incidence of the rates, it can be done only after a very searching inquiry or by an increase in general taxation.  In the meantime, some proposal will have to be made for an increase in the taxation which will be necessary centrally to pay for the rates that are being relieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the growth of the economy, I thought the House would like to have some comparisons made between the growth in exports in 1964 as compared with 1963 as between this country and some other countries. They show that we had been making real progress in the last year.  Our estimated increase in domestic exports in 1963-64 was 14.7 per cent.  The increase in exports from a number of other European countries as between 1963 and 1964 were in the region of 8 per cent, 11 per cent, 11 per cent, 8 per cent, 1½ per cent, 10 per cent and 11 per cent.  These figures show that last year we made undoubted progress in our exports.  Some of the increase was due to the higher price for cattle and some of the increase in exports of manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>The figures for the increase in the exports of clothing are most interesting. In 1950 exports of women's clothing were valued at £50,000 and last year they were well over £5 million, if they were not £6 million.  I relate that to a statement made by Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Opposition, on 15 May, 1952, when he said that the tariffed industries set up by Fianna Fáil were mere relief works.  That statement showed a lack of real belief in the industrial potential of this country. This is an industry which was very heavily protected in its initial phases. It was protected to the extent of about 50 to 70 per cent.  The results of that protection for an industry which had a reasonably good home market was the development of a very lively export industry which we all hope will survive the levies imposed by the British <Col N="903" /> Government.  I mentioned that in relation to the dynamic thought of some of the leaders of industry in this country and the extent to which they took advantage of the protection, the grants and other services offered to industry by the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the growth of farm incomes in 1964.  One of the difficulties we face, in common with other countries, has been the difference between the growth of farm and non-farm incomes.  That difference is referred to by every national farmers' organisation in Europe.  One of the reasons for the setting up of the complicated marketing machinery of EEC was to find some competent method to ensure that farm incomes would increase at the same rate as non-farm incomes.  Between 1956 and 1963, farm incomes in this country per head of farm population went up by 41 per cent and in the same period, non-farm incomes went up by 58 per cent, showing that the differential is still there, but if we examine what has been happening in Europe, the position is not completely unsatisfactory.  There are countries where the differential is much greater than it is here and there are some countries where they have done slightly better than we have.  We are not in an unsatisfactory position on that list of European countries.</P>
    <P>It is very good to know that the position here is that last year farm incomes rose by an estimated £20 million, or an increase of 16 per cent in one year. The indications are that in the coming year there will also be a satisfactory increase in farm income.  It is estimated that the volume of milk production will rise this year by something between 20 and 30 million gallons.  The heifer calf scheme has been an enormous success and there has been a record growth in the numbers of heifers-in-calf as a result.</P>
    <P>It is particularly interesting to illustrate to the House the growth in the value of milk supplied to creameries over a period.  Here we hear that nothing is being done to help the dairy farmers, that they are being neglected by the Government, and I think it <Col N="904" /> necessary to examine the position over a considerable period to show the progress made.  We would like to see more progress being made but at least we are now making progress at a rate never made before.  The value of milk supplied to creameries in 1960 was £25 million and the Exchequer assistance in that year was £2,350,000.  That figure was less in the time of the Coalition Government.  By 1965, the total value of milk supplied to creameries had gone up to £40 million and the Exchequer assistance will be nearly £11 million.  In 1964, the value of milk supplied to creameries was £36,500,000 and the Exchequer assistance was nearly £9 million.  In other words, of the increase of £50 million in milk incomes between 1960 and what we think it will be in 1965, the Exchequer will have contributed more than half. I do not think we could give any better example of the manifold increase in the aids afforded by the Government to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Another illustration of the effort to assist the farmer to increase production and to have a satisfactory income is found by relating the total budget for 1964-65 for agriculture.  Excluding the contribution to rates, excluding the Land Commission work, excluding forestry work, excluding employment afforded by Bord na Móna, the total gross estimated expenditure was some £25 million.  It was offset by receipts of nearly £1½ million.  On the basis of there being 250,000 farmers, people who called themselves farmers according to the census, that is nearly £100 for every farmer in the country.  There, again, we would all of us like to do the very maximum to assist the farmers, particularly the small farmers, but that at least illustrates the extent to which they are at present being assisted.</P>
    <P>That, of course, includes aid in other forms&mdash;research and education, advisory services, subsidies on dairy products.  It includes bacon price support and the improvement of livestock and livestock products.  It includes bovine tuberculosis eradication.  It includes special schemes; it includes lime and fertiliser subsidy which are this year in the region of some £5 million <Col N="905" /> compared with some £400,000 in the last year of the Coalition Government. It includes general administration expenses which, incidentally, are only 3.7 per cent of the total.  It includes the schemes for the improvement of lands and buildings.</P>
    <P>May I mention in passing that among the many things the Fine Gael Party were supposed to have done was to have put into operation the farm building scheme.  They did put it into operation in 1949 but the scheme was published by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture on December 31st, 1947, in sufficient detail for it to be said that the plan in general principle lay waiting for any Government elected after that time.  I merely mention that in passing because it is frequently regarded as a cast-iron Fine Gael or Coalition Government scheme. It was not so, any more than the land reclamation scheme, which was started by Fianna Fáil in 1939, and which was the predecessor of the mechanised scheme introduced by the Coalition Government when machinery was available, when fertilisers were available and when the scheme was obviously ready for expansion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the difficulty of increasing agricultural aid to farmers, we have always to bear in mind the number of non-farm workers from whom the taxation can be extracted to assist farmers.  We have stated many times that the burden of taxation imposed on the community to raise the position of the farmer must relate in some degree to the number of people engaged in non-farming activity.  I should like to point out here that for every 100 Irish non-farming workers available to subsidise farm prices through general taxation, there are in the United States of America over 4½ times as many workers and in the United kingdom 1,472 non-farm workers as compared with 100, here, so that for us to be able to achieve some of the measures of subsidy and price support possible in other countries is extremely difficult, until such time as industry grows in strength as a proportion of the total national income.  Then we can see what can be done to further decrease <Col N="906" /> the differential between non-farming incomes and farming incomes, but, at least, on that basis it can be seen we are making very considerable progress.</P>
    <P>More evidence of the effort we are making to assist agriculture can be seen in the fact that each year that passes new schemes are put into operation or existing schemes are extended and improved.  I do not need to go into detail in regard to that but the increase in the grant for cattle byres and the increase in the grants for ordinary dry cattle houses are illustrations of the extent to which the Government do their best each year to contribute towards greater agricultural production. An increase in pig numbers took place last year and the Department of Agriculture is constantly spending more and more money on providing the finest breeding stock possible.  Every year there is evidence of lively activity on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, examining the current situation, examining how far the price of grains needs to be increased, examining how far the characteristics of each departmental scheme needs to be improved or amended, and, as I have said, no one could possibly say that this Government are not investing very large amounts in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is equally true to say that the farmers are responding and that everywhere can be seen the growth in stock density, in the number of sheep and cattle and pigs, in the number of sows and in the number of heifers in calf. Indeed, in some constituencies it will be found, if the growth continues at the rate it did in the past four years, in the years that lie ahead the Second Programme of Economic Expansion target will definitely be achieved.  There may be some areas where more progress may be needed.  In some of the small farm areas, such as Galway and my own constituency of Monaghan, the rate of progress is such that we can be reasonably certain that, if the level of growth is maintained at the same rate between now and 1970 as it was between 1960 and now, the Second Programme will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I should like to close by saying that I do hope we will have some realistic talking now about such important <Col N="907" /> matters as taxation and that we will hear more from the Opposition of how they propose to pay for the fancy schemes they announced over television or, alternatively, by how much they want to reduce the really important Votes in order to fulfil the promises they appeared to be making to various electorates both now and in the previous months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be quite short but I should like, briefly, to thank the Minister for Transport and Power for his tributes to what he is pleased to call the Coalition Government. He did not intend them to be tributes.  While I was listening to him, I asked myself, if the Coalition Government were so bad as he made it out to be and as, perhaps, some other speakers hinted, why did he bother to waste his time with it?  He has been in office now for the past eight years.  All he need do is produce evidence of progress during that time under this Administration to establish the thesis he sought to establish here this evening that everything in the country is prosperous, everything is going well and the people are happier now at the end of eight years of Fianna Fáil Government than they ever thought they would be and there is nothing in front of them but a stretch of increasing prosperity.</P>
      <P>When I got the White Paper showing the several services for which a Vote on Account was required for the year ending 31st March, 1966, the first thing I did was something the Minister for Transport and Power said, in effect, I should not have done.  I looked at the last page of this White Paper to find out whether or not there was any increase or reduction in the total of the estimated sum required for the service of the following financial year.  I found that on the figures there was an increase of £20,238,746 over last year's Estimate, to which were to be added, I think, the various Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance when moving this Vote on Account said, at column 381 of the Dáil Debates of 16th February:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Supply Services expenditure <Col N="908" /> of £220.8 million proposed next year is £20.9 million greater than the figure of £199.9 million provided in last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>I deduce that the difference between my calculation and the Minister's statement is explained by the fact that the White Paper contains the Supplementary Estimates.  That is a pretty substantial figure.  That is a figure in regard to which the people are entitled to ask themselves: what justifies its imposition?  Are we so prosperous?  Is unemployment so well on its way to being, if not eliminated, at least brought to a point where we can say we have almost full employment?  Are old-aged pensioners satisfied?  Are health services adequate?  Where is the wealth that should have been produced by this extraordinary expenditure last year and which is proposed to be increased by £20¼ millions next year?  Where is the wealth going that must have come from that? That is the first question one must ask. Then, when one finds that in fact the proportion of our resources attributed to social welfare in Ireland is exceptionally low, one asks what sort of evidence has been produced for the Minister for Transport and Power to suggest the thesis he proposed to-day &mdash;that the country is prosperous, that there is a greater mood of prosperity and that, but for Fine Gael and all their works and pomps, we would be even more prosperous in the future?</P>
    <P>When moving this Vote on Account, the Minister for Finance also said, at columns 382 and 383 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients benefited from the 1964 Budget to the extent of £¾ million in this financial year. The full-year cost of that benefit is included in the figure of £35½ million for the Social Welfare Estimate&mdash;the largest single estimate in the Supply Services.</P>
    <P>I shall come back to that later on.  I want to comment on another statement by the Minister for Transport and Power.  He exhorted the people of this country and, I suppose, particularly Deputies, to stop their oldfashioned thinking about taxation.  He <Col N="909" /> left it at that: &ldquo;old-fashioned thinking&rdquo;. As far as old-fashioned or new-fashioned thinking about taxation is concerned, all the people on whom the burden of taxation falls&mdash;be it national taxation or local taxation in the way of rates&mdash;know about it is that they have to pay it, that it is increasing year by year and that there is no reason why it should ever stop. The Minister says you are not to take that into account, that it is bad and bold of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to point out all the expenditure being incurred or that it is proposed to incur in the future.</P>
    <P>That was my first action in connection with the White Paper.  I found there was this very great increase and, appreciating the enormous increase in rates, the question arose: where are we going?  As a second action, I looked at the figures for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I found in the White Paper that last year the total Estimate for that Department, including the Supplementary Estimates, was £15,066,000.  This year's Estimate is £18,727,000.  According to those figures, the expenditure for next year in connection with that Department is increased by the sum of £3,661,000.  The Minister for Finance made this observation at column 383 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs, at £18.7 million, is another outstanding item in the White Paper. Large as it is, this figure does not represent the full extent of expenditure on the postal, telephone and telegraph services since the cost of telephone development is met from non-voted moneys.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Minister was justified in describing that item as an outstanding item in the Estimates.  It is all the more outstanding when I recall that the Taoiseach during the debate on the General Budget Resolution last year. dealt with the criticisms he anticipated would be made of the increases in postage, parcel post, telephone, telegraph and all the rest of the postal charges, which were being increased, not by means of ordinary taxation imposed <Col N="910" /> by this House but by decree or by whatever machinery the Minister for Posts and telegraphs increases these charges.  A vast increase in the cost of telephone and other postal services was made in that year and was criticised.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said at that time, at column 1781, Volume 208 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>The principle that the Post Office should pay for itself and not be subsidised from taxation is not merely sound but, as far as I know, has never heretofore been questioned in the Dáil.  There is, I agree, an obligation on the Government to ensure that the cost of these Services is not unduly inflated and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is now about to initiate a drive for economies in the Post Office by the adjustment of the services to the reasonable needs of the people and by changes in procedures which will, it is hoped, increase individual productivity.</P>
    <P>I criticised that statement in the observations I made on the Budget and I took as the basis of my criticism of the charges that these economies ought to have been sought and found before the charges were increased and that it was wrong to seek economies after the charges had been imposed.  It was not apparently, until the Taoiseach came in to speak in the debate on the Budget that he said he directed these economies.</P>
    <P>Now, I look at this year's Estimate and find the position to be as I have just stated.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs has a budget largely exceeding what it was last year and, large as it was, according to the Minister's phrase, it does not represent the full extent of expenditure.  From that we can only deduce either that these economies were not sought or, if sought, were not found and that no real effort was made to carry out any sort of retrenchment in that service to offset the very heavy expenditure imposed last year.  From that I again deduce this proposition, based as it is <Col N="911" /> on another feature of this debate, that no real effort has been made by the Government to see that the costs of the services have been properly regarded and economies properly sought.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Economies&rdquo;, in the context and the interpretation I give the word, does not merely mean cutting down for the sake of cutting down.  It means taking out expenditure that may not be required at the moment, that can be postponed in deference to urgent requirements for the present.  But it is significant&mdash;this is an element I referred to a moment ago&mdash;that in the entire of the speech of the Taoiseach, the word &ldquo;economies&rdquo; does not occur.  Neither did it occur in the speech of the Minister for Justice, nor in the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister for Finance at the end of his speech did say that the Estimates have been carefully examined at departmental level and submitted to further rigorous pruning by the Government.  Having had some considerable experience and knowing what happens when you start at departmental level in trying to do anything about the Estimates and also having had the experience of trying to do it at Government level, I have very little confidence in and pass little heed to that remark of the Minister for Finance as to what was done in an effort to take away unproductive expenditure, to cut down waste, to see that the Estimates were cut to the bone, and above all, to see that economies were effected.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;economies&rdquo; does not occur in the Minister's speech, nor in the Taoiseach's speech, nor anywhere else and we therefore, have this position that when you examine all the speeches that have been made, including the one we heard today, the theme of the Government case here and the theme of their speeches consists if three or four things: expenditure, taxation, and budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave promise of further expenditure to be met by taxation and he said that he had presented what he called the budgetary <Col N="912" /> difficulties&mdash;column 586, volume 214. He said:</P>
    <P>Against the background of budgetary difficulties the growing cost of public services, the need to provide a wider basis for public finance if the national economic and social progress is to continue ...</P>
    <P>We had there expenditure adumbrated by the Taoiseach.  It is clearly to be on a pretty vast scale, according to the White Paper.  We had budgetary difficulties to anticipate, the growing cost of public services and then we had this somewhat cryptic phrase, &ldquo;the need to provide a wider basis for public finance&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  Does it mean what the Minister for Transport and Power said this afternoon, that we must get away from old-fashioned taxation?  Neither of them said what he means by &ldquo;providing a wider basis for public finance&rdquo; or &ldquo;old-fashioned taxation&rdquo; but, it would seem that the country is certainly facing additional taxation of a pretty serious character, or else the Government may be playing a game because both the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach indicated there were going to be budgetary difficulties and they both were corroborated by the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice elaborately made comments on the various people who will not face up to the necessity for taxation in order to pay for the increases in expenditure.</P>
    <P>At all events, that is the picture which, according to the Minister for Transport and Power today, we are wrong in bringing before the public but I want to paint the picture in a rather different way from what has been done by the various speakers on behalf of the Government.  The Taoiseach had certain sombre hues in his picture.  That is all part of the way he gets on in order to show how responsible he and his Government are.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a very great increase in the public wealth of this country and in the amount of money that is floating around.  There cannot be any doubt about that.  That cannot cause any surprise.  The Government could not possibly have avoided doing <Col N="913" /> it.  In the year 1958, the first year after the change of Government when they had control of the finances of this country, the amount on the face of the Book of Estimates was £112,570,620. According to the White Paper, it is now the figure that I have given here earlier this afternoon.  It has gone up and up all the time.  With that vast increase in expenditure in that period from £112 million to the present figure of £220 million&mdash;going up and up every year&mdash;how could they avoid having an increase in the money floating around? But where is it going?  It is relevant to inquire into that.  What sort of society have we as a result of those eight years and of all that vast expenditure of money?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt there are many people richer than they were years ago.  There is no doubt there are many people better off.  There is no doubt, in my mind at all events, that the position we have here now as a result of that wealth, as a result of the prosperity that is boasted of here, is not quite what the Minister for Transport and Power would have us believe &mdash;a prosperous society, everything well, everything getting better.  This, in my view, is the era of the expense account. It is the era of the expensive restaurant. It is the era of the motorcar of a particular type as the status symbol and it is the era in which such an announcement could be made as we read in the press just a short time ago where a trader on behalf of a restaurant proprietor paid the sum of £135 for a salmon.  That such a thing could happen in this Christian country is indicative of the kind of society we have and of the infirmities and weaknesses that exist in it.</P>
    <P>I cannot do any better than repeat certain phrases in a letter that appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the following Monday, after this announcement was made:</P>
    <P>We must be returning to the age of Nero ... when such an outrageous price for one fish can be recorded.  Who are the emulators of the Caesars and their courtiers now living amongst us who can eat at such a cost in this time of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> That is the kind of position that is avoided here by Government spokesmen. That such a thing could happen is no doubt indicative of wealth in somebody but we see the other side of the story, that there are people looking for houses in the city of Dublin.  At the same time as there are these expense accounts, not merely for restaurants but for expensive hotels and the other places that are supposed to be attracting tourists, the housing situation is of such a character that it is almost impossible to describe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave gave the housing figures in his speech.  Deputy Ryan in much more detail referred to the conditions in Dublin, and in general, and they are pretty bad.  I can only speak from what I know and I have quoted one case which is typical of the position in the city here.  Any trouble I have as a Deputy comes from people coming to me looking for houses.  I say to them: &ldquo;I can help you to get you into Heaven but I cannot get you a house from the Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had a case which I quoted twice recently in public speeches.  I saw a similar instance on Telefís Éireann. This latter instance was not a political broad cast but it was shown on Telefís Éireann on the very night that Deputy Ryan was on Telefís Éireann in a political broadcast when he dealt with housing.  This shows that there must be many similar cases.  There is the case in my own constituency, of a family of six, four young children, the eldest of whom is only about five or six; they are living in one room without any method of cooking, without any toilet facilities, some of the youngest sleeping in a cot, some of them in chairs and some of them in the one bed.</P>
    <P>I brought this case before Dublin Corporation and I got the standard reply, that there was no possible chance of accommodation.  I kept pressing it and finally I got indirectly a message that it was hoped that in a few months time, the cases of people in Dublin with six in family would be reached.  Cases of six in family have not been reached. That is the position here now in regard to housing in Dublin and there is no <Col N="915" /> use in anybody talking about the number of houses that are being or will be built.</P>
    <P>There have been sneers at what is called the Coalition Government.  At all events, we made it absolutely clear that no question of finance would interfere with our housing programme, not merely in the city of Dublin but in general, and in the last year of the last period of our office when everything was going wrong&mdash;the terms of trade were against us; the balance of payments was against us; and, on top of that, the Suez incident came, bringing with it unemployment; and the bankers were against us&mdash;we gave the Dublin Corporation the full measure of their requirements, the same measure of their requirements as they got the previous year.  Deputy Cosgrave has given the figures for the Dublin Corporation since that time.</P>
    <P>I get annoyed with official replies from the Dublin Corporation but in fairness to these officials, I have always to say and to remember that they are only doing their duty and they could not give houses because the Government did not let them give houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to the social service recipients, I have already quoted the remark made by the Minister that the Social Welfare Estimate was the largest single Estimate in the Supply Services. To go back to what the Minister for Transport and Power said, or what I thought him to have said, he said it is an old-fashioned idea to imagine that the more prosperous you become, the less taxation will be required to finance public services and he said the reason for that was the need for financing these social security requirements. According to the Minister, everything is going grand; this famous Second Programme of the Government is riding high, wide and handsome but we must put up with taxation.  That is always in the background.  Provided you get enough money from taxation, everything is grand.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to quote from a publication by the Economic Research Institute which cannot be said to be favourable to any political Party, <Col N="916" /> much less the Fine Gael Party.  It is entitled &ldquo;Social Security in Ireland and Western Europe&rdquo; by P.R. KaimCaudle, published in June, 1964. There is this pregnant observation in page 11 in regard to expenditure on social security in Western Europe:</P>
    <P>A comparison of social security benefits in cash and kind expressed as percentages of Gross National Product and market prices brings out a number of interesting facts....</P>
    <P>There is a table setting out the figures for Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, U.K., N. Ireland and Ireland.  I quote again:</P>
    <P>Germany's expenditure on benefits is much the highest, about two-fifths above the average of the other countries&mdash;UK, Belgium and France &mdash;which have similar incomes per head.  The Italian expenditure on benefits is remarkably high, up to the standard of the other EEC countries in spite of Italy's distinctly lower income per head.  Ireland's expenditure is least, a quarter less than Italy's which has the same income per head.</P>
    <P>I wish to expand that very slightly in relation to the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> As I said before, the proportion of resources allocated to social welfare is low.  The payments made by various countries have been given in the table to which I have referred in this paper by the Economic Research Institute.</P>
    <P>This publication continues:</P>
    <P>However, far from proposing any such improvement in the social services, the Government's Second Economic Programme involves a further decline in the proportion of resources devoted to transfer payments&mdash;which was slightly lower in 1963 than in 1957.  On the basis of the Irish definition of transfer of people in institutions (items not included in the figures used for international comparisons) the proportion of resources devoted to transfer payments actually declined fractionally from 6.5 per cent to 6.4 per cent in <Col N="917" /> 1963 (2) and is projected to decline to 6.2 per cent in 1970.</P>
    <P>Even if over the period of the Second Programme we moved only half-way towards the ratio of social expenditure to national output that at present exists in similarly-placed European countries such as Austria and Italy, this would involve an increase of over 70 per cent in the volume of social expenditure in constant money terms between 1963 and 1970&mdash;as against the government's proposed increase of 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>So much for social security.  We know the position of the old age pensioners. I have spoken here again and again on a way in which possibly the lot of the old age pensioners might be improved. We know, because we have had experience of it, that to give even a paltry sum of 2/6 extra to old age pensioners costs a very large sum of money.</P>
    <P>I remember soon after I was first elected to the House listening to the Budget speech of the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and being horrified&mdash;I was young at the time&mdash;at one phrase in which he indicated that he proposed to save by what he called administrative methods a certain amount of money&mdash;the precise figure I forget, but it was a very large amount. In other words, he was to harry the old age pensioners to the point where he would prevent them from earning a few shillings extra and thereby he would balance his Budget.</P>
    <P>That has been going on ever since. Widows who have uncovenanted benefits, those who have not got a pension as of right, have given up trying to work because they were so harried and worried by Government officials asking them about where and when they earned a shilling or sixpence.  It would certainly help the old age pensioners and cost the taxpayers nothing and the Government very little if an effort were made to cut down on that sort of inquiry into the means tests of pensioners and let them get help from the St. Vincent de Paul Society or from daughters or sons or some other source to supplement their income by small amounts.  At the moment they are not <Col N="918" /> allowed to do this and are finding it almost impossible to live.</P>
    <P>That is an addition to the picture to offset this prosperous society we are supposed to have.  It is not as healthy a society as Government spokesmen would have us believe.  I do not wish to decry the economy.  I do not wish to put any obstacles in the way of the country's progress but there is no use in the Minister for Transport and Power telling us we have no right to talk about increased Government expenditure or to believe in old-fashioned systems of taxation.  Have the Government, in the processes of collection and expenditure of taxation, in mind the obligation to spend the money properly, to distribute the wealth that exists in the proper proportions among worthy objects?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice last week came back to the question of taxation after the Taoiseach had dwelt on the necessity for taxation.  As reported at column 415, volume 214 of the Official Reports, the Minister for Justice said that progress, expansion and further improvements have a price, and taxation is the price.  I interpret that as meaning that the only policy the Government have is increased expenditure but that if you increase expenditure, you must have taxation.  They say they are prepared to increase expenditure and they challenge anybody to say where they are wrong.</P>
    <P>Surely there is something more than the simple proposition of expenditure and then taxation?  The Government I happened to belong to from 1948 to 1951, when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance, acted on the principle, which produced results, that more money could be spent while taxation was reduced.  It was done on the basis that if you have an expansionist programme, properly ordered and properly directed, you will get more revenue from the same or less taxation.  That is how Deputy McGilligan increased expenditure on social services particularly, and at the same time reduced taxation.  There was implicit in that programme the creation of wealth by the promotion of public capital expenditure for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> There has been much talk about the money spent by the Government in the past seven or eight years on capital projects.  They forget that when the inter-Party, or Coalition Government as they liked to call it, are being criticised by Fianna Fáil, neither truth nor Christian charity has any place. I am answering now what has been said here by various speakers, particularly in reference to taxation, and I say it is not as simple a proposition as the Taoiseach would like to make out: expenditure and then taxation.</P>
    <P>There is, or ought to be, some method of producing wealth in times of prosperity other than merely taking the lines of least resistance by increasing direct taxation.  There was another principle in Deputy McGilligan's thoughts and actions in the running of the finances of the country.  The inter-Party Government were the first to divide the housekeeping accounts into capital services and other services and I have here in front of me the volume of Estimates for Public Services up to 31st March, 1951, in which capital services and other services were set out separately.  I certainly do not want to waste the time of the House in attempting to justify the actions of the inter-Party Governments&mdash;that can be done by history or by anybody who likes to do it&mdash;or in answering criticisms in this House, and were it not for the various sneers about the inter-Party Government, I would not have referred to this.  At that time it was a source of constant criticism, before the change of Government in 1948, that Fianna Fáil did not know anything about capital services.  We increased those and we showed them how to do it and we put on the cover of the Book of Estimates what was capital to be paid by borrowed moneys and serviced as part of the national debt, and what were the ordinary housekeeping moneys.  Not merely did we show them that but it was pointed out again and again by Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, and apparently Fianna Fáil do not know this principle, that in addition to getting more for less taxation, the very subject matter of capital projects, the <Col N="920" /> productive objects you produce as a result of capital expenditure, are themselves a source of additional taxation.</P>
    <P>When we are asked: &ldquo;Do you object to expenditure on education?&rdquo; or expenditure on this, that or the other, it is nonsense to ask us to say because we cannot say until we know whether the matter has been properly considered and that every possible economy has been effected, not economies in the sense of economy for economy's sake but economising for the purpose of getting at first things first.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice made a remark which provoked me and I cannot possibly let it stand on the records of the House without controverting it. At column 415 of the same volume to which I have referred, he said:</P>
    <P>I believe that in their heart of hearts the Fine Gael Party are a Party of reactionaries, fundamentally anti-progress, and, if they really spelled out their feelings, they would be against any expenditure on education, against any expenditure on social welfare services, against any expenditure in the social and economic fields because, fundamentally, they believe in reduced taxes and reduced rates and a cut-back in Government expenditure in these essential fields.  In their heart of hearts, that is their mentality and that has been their traditional attitude, but, from the political point of view, they will not say that because they know that in the democracy in which we live, our people will not tolerate any cut-back in expansion, our people will not tolerate any cut-back in Government expenditure....</P>
    <P>I am not going to waste time justifying anything and everything the inter-Party Government did, but so long as I am here, I will allow nobody to say that either I or anybody concerned in Government with me was a reactionary. Younger people who are now voting were hardly born then.  Certainly they were not born in 1948 and those voters do not know what happened at that time and they are not let know, but as <Col N="921" /> far as we are concerned I want to repudiate that charge.</P>
    <P>We were the people who first framed a policy, and put it into action, for the development of our exports.  The Minister for Transport and Power spoke with great pride today about our exports.  We were the first to do this and we did it at a time of extreme difficulty when the terms of trade had gone against us and when the necessity arose for doing what the British had to do in the past few months, to put on these export taxes.  When the Suez crisis was looming ahead, we announced the incentives for exports. That had never been thought of by Fianna Fáil in 19 years of office.  Our exports have gone up and up because of the beginning we made at that time and this policy, and other policies to which I shall refer, were thought out by our own people and by our own supporters, and not by civil servants. Those incentives to exports were announced for the first time by me in October, 1956, in the Engineers' Hall and were taken up by the next Government and by the Governments ever since.  As I say, however, justice, truth and Christian charity do not come into politics as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.</P>
    <P>Arbitration in the Civil Service was mentioned.  We brought in arbitration for the Civil Service, the Garda, the Army and others.  I want to remind those who have forgotten that Fianna Fáil were defeated by a motion in this House by Judge Lavery and myself calling on the Government to give arbitration to the Civil Service.  The then Taoiseach went to the Park that night and had the Dáil dissolved because he did not want to have anything to do with the Civil Service.  In the subsequent campaign, Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Finance, went around from Haddington Road to Irishtown, to Rathgar and other places addressing three or four people but giving complete scripts to the newspapers, raising the hair on the heads of the taxpayers about the amount of money and taxes it would be necessary to raise in order to finance a scheme of arbitration for the Civil Service. They were returned to office but it <Col N="922" /> was not until the inter-Party Government, or the Coalition Government, if you like to call it that, were returned to office that arbitration was brought into operation.  They are now very fond of it.  We also brought in the capital Budget scheme and other schemes which I shall not waste the time of the House referring to, but I am giving these as examples of what was done, not to justify the inter-Party Government but to repudiate this charge that this Party are reactionary.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, for every moment that I belonged to the Fine Gael Party and from the first time I went into active politics, it was my effort, and when I got the opportunity I put it into practice, to show that we were not reactionary.  I hope to do so again.  I do not think it does anybody any good to hear the type of speech which came from the Minister for Transport and Power&mdash;and even from the Taoiseach on certain occasions and the Minister for Justice&mdash;about Coalition Governments and the reactionary Fine Gael.  Stand on your own record and prove your own case from your own facts and what you have done and you will get every help from this side of the House when anything is being voted to help the people secure prosperity, and particularly to bring further relief to those sections who have not yet got their due.</P>
    <P>I thought there was a certain sombre note in the speech of the Taoiseach's.  I think he referred to, but I could not verify it in the actual report in the Dáil Debates, the fact that while everything was beautiful, there was no saying what would happen and the terms of trade next year might go against us.  In 1956 on the Taoiseach's Estimate, I took figures as the Taoiseach took them the other day, from the statisticians and from the financial records and all the economic indicators at that time were shown as set fair.  That was in July, 1956.  In March of the following year, everything was going wrong and we had to bring in these levies.  That may happen&mdash;I hope it does not.  Is there any indication of everything not being as good as the Minister for Transport <Col N="923" /> and Power would have us think in the announcement that appeared in the Press quite recently?</P>
    <P>I would like to take the liberty to quote the <i>Irish Times</i> even after the attack made on it by the Taoiseach.  I quote from the issue of Saturday, 20th February.  There is a big heading&mdash;&ldquo;Advances only for productive aims&rdquo;, followed by a smaller heading of &ldquo;Deposits harder to come by&rdquo;.  The writer goes on to quote: &ldquo;We are having to restrict advances only to those of a productive nature,&rdquo; said Mr. G. Francis, Klingner, Chairman of the Royal Bank of Ireland at the annual general meeting.  The writer adds &ldquo;This is the sorry story moulded on the lips of Irish bankers today.&rdquo; Deposits are becoming harder to come by, or rather, they are totally inadequate to cope with the demands on the bank's resources, or in Mr. Klingner's words &ldquo;it is difficult for banks to increase deposits as they used to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is that not an indication of the ageold device of the bankers, that they are going to restrict credit?  They did it to us.  Now we have an indication that something is going to happen.  I warn the Government against complacency in announcements such as those made by the Minister for Transport and Power this afternoon.  There is an indication of the banks' intention to restrict credit and that they have entered into an agreement that if a customer is refused credit by one bank, no other bank will make an advance to that customer.  It happened to us and we were given the length and breadth of the vituperating tongues of Fianna Fáil on the attitude of the banks at that time.</P>
    <P>Everything is not as good as it is supposed to be.  We want this country to be prosperous but we think that other methods might secure better results.  Above all, we think that there must be a wider field of obligation and a greater sense of duty in doing far more for the poorer sections of the community and those who fall within the category of social welfare recipients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to say anything new on the Vote on Account at this stage.  The discussion has been going on for a long time and my opinion is that the Government have come rather badly out of it.  They are obviously on the defensive.  They realise that they have failed to make the progress the nation is entitled to expect from them during their past seven or eight years in office.  I listened to the Minister for Justice saying that the Government's success could be measured by the employment figures.  He went on to tell the House that in the past three years for which there are records the Government have been putting into non-agricultural employment 8,000 or 9,000 people a year.  He failed to tell the House the number of people who have been disemployed on the land.  He failed to say that it is estimated by the Government that 64,000 people will leave the land by 1970 and that the estimate also was that the Government would be able to find 8,000 additional jobs each year.  What is to happen to the remainder?  Are they to be exported as in the past or are they to swell the already enormous figure of unemployed at present, 60,000 odd?</P>
      <P>I have heard many attempts made by Government speakers to argue against statements made by Members of the Opposition that there were 73,000 more in employment in 1956 than there are today.  Nobody can contradict that.  Even if we agree that there was an unusual situation in 1956 and that we had an enormous drop in employment between then and 1957, if we take the 1957 figure, we still have 32,000 people fewer in employment today than we had in 1957.  If the success of the Government's policy is to be measured by the employment figures, it has obviously fallen down and during those seven or eight years emigration went on continuously side by side with unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on the failure of Government policy to provide the many essential services our people require.  As I am most familiar with what has happened in my own constituency of County Dublin, I would like to comment on the Government's <Col N="925" /> failure to anticipate the population trends or the needs of the people there. I mention the people's housing needs, their health needs, educational needs and employment needs.  The Minister for Education gave us a detailed account of the progress made by his Department.  I know he is trying hard to improve the educational facilities for our people but all I will say is that after 27 years in office, it is deplorable to find that we have in County Dublin enormous numbers of children who, last September, failed completely to secure entry to primary schools.  There was absolute panic in some districts.</P>
    <P>I know that this has been overcome to some extent by the provision of temporary schools but the Minister has made a rule that 50 children is the maximum in a class and many schools have been compelled to cut the numbers in their classes down to that figure.  I still hold that a teacher has no hope of imparting anything to a class of 50.  His whole time is occupied in trying to keep some sort of discipline. If the nation depends on the youth of the country, it augurs badly for the future if this is the best it can provide in 1965.</P>
    <P>We had a school opened in Clondalkin in 1963.  I had many arguments about the size of the school.  It was built to accommodate 120.  There are 132 pupils on average on the rolls today.  They are sitting on the floor. That is the general picture throughout the whole of County Dublin.  There has been an absolute failure by the Government to anticipate the movement of the people away from the land into the urban areas.  The people have been fleeing from the land because the rewards are much more favourable from the point of view of employment in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>With regard to health services, we have now the same health services, but they are costing vastly more.  There has been practically no improvement that I am aware of in the health services during all these years.  A Select Committee was set up and it appears to be producing absolutely nothing. Indeed, I am afraid it is being used as an excuse to prevent any improvement <Col N="926" /> taking place in the health services.  This is an experience we all have where the Government are concerned.  They set up committees and commissions and very little is done.  These commissions and committees are used to delay progress.  They are used to pretend that the Government are inhibited from making any improvements until these bodies report.</P>
    <P>Only this evening, when rates were being discussed by the Minister for Transport and Power, he gave as the excuse that there was a special committee sitting to inquire into the incidence of rates and said that we could not, in effect, change the system until that committee reports.  It is again a question of putting it on the long finger.  Everybody knows the rates are rocketing throughout the country. There appears to be a sit-down strike on the way in Mayo, and I do not blame them.</P>
    <P>A commission sat to inquire into the problem of itinerants.  It reported. Absolutely nothing is being done to solve the problem.  Local authorities are recommended to provide sites, but nothing is being done.  This problem will have to be tackled by the Government and some serious policy will have to be put into operation if the problem is to be solved.  It is a very serious problem at the moment in certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the establishment of industry and the importance of making every effort to ensure that more and more industries are established and that existing industries are expanded.  I have argued from time to time that the machinery set up for the establishing of industries is, for its size, doing good work.  I think, however, that it is completely inadequate, having regard to the need for rapid expansion in employment opportunities and in exports, if the present prosperity is to be maintained, not to speak of expanding industry in the way we all wish to see it expanded.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged by impartial economists everywhere that the greatest factor in expanding exports in recent years has been the relief of taxation provided in the 1956 Finance Act brought in by Deputy Sweetman <Col N="927" /> as Minister for Finance.  I want to say something now about the operation and application of that Act.  About 12 months ago, I urged the Minister for Finance to apply the provisions of this Act to the industry engaged in hatching and exporting day-old chicks, and he refused.  I warned him that, if it were not done, we would be in danger of losing a fairly sizeable and worthwhile industry, an industry giving employment to a considerable number of small farmers in the west of Ireland and other farmers in other parts of the country.  These were getting tired because they came into the industry believing they would be entitled to tax reliefs on exports.  This is wholly an export industry.  Tax relief is provided for the export of mushrooms. Last year the export of day-old chicks amounted to £370,000 worth.</P>

I listened to the minutest detail in relation to the Department of Education and to the minutest details being discussed by the Taoiseach in relation to health and I think I should be allowed to expand on this because it has a very definite effect on the economy of the country.  It is an industry that is being pushed out and I think I should be allowed to develop this because this is Government policy and it is also discrimination against a worthwhile industry.</P>

      <P>The Vote on Account provides an opportunity for a Deputy to come in here and air his grievances against Government policy.  If it is Government policy not to allow tax relief to a particular industry, which we are likely to lose as a result, I think, with all due respect, I am entitled to <Col N="928" /> refer to it.  The industry is worth £370,000.  There is no taxation relief. In the other industry, in which no processing is involved and in which the export volume is much lower, there is taxation relief.  That kind of policy is killing the former industry and those engaged in it have decided to get out. They have been discriminated against in many other ways.  There are no grants available to the principal producer who provides 80 per cent of the total exports.  There is discrimination not only against the industry but against the principal producer in the industry.  If that is Government policy, then it is Government policy which should be criticised and I have no hesitation in criticising it.</P>
      <P>With regard to housing, leading questions were put down on the Order Paper today by a member of the Government Party in relation to the amount of land being purchased for housing and the amount of money being provided during the past couple of years for the expansion of services in County Dublin.  All I can say is that I have been ten years in a local authority and during those ten years, every member of that local authority has been pleading and pressing for houses for the people.  The position today is that there are some 1,200 people in County Dublin living in deplorable housing conditions, with very poor prospects of having their housing needs met in the near future. The same situation obtains in the city. There is not a day&mdash;I represent part of the city as well&mdash;that there is not someone on the phone to me telling me he is being evicted or has been evicted, and there is no alternative accommodation offered.  At the last minute, someone offers alternative accommodation&mdash;it may be Griffith Barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the weekend, a Government Minister boasted about the housing progress made by the Government and tried to decry the efforts of the inter-Party Government during their years of office in relation to housing.  Now I regard that as the height of hypocrisy. Everybody knows that in the last three years of the inter-Party they assisted the building of over 31,000 houses, and <Col N="929" /> from 1959 to 1962, 17,000 houses were assisted by this Government.  Their housing history in recent years is so deplorable that I do not know how they are not ashamed to talk about housing.</P>
    <P>I see no improvement in the health services and no prospect of one while this Government are in power.  In spite of that, we were confronted in Dublin County Council with an increase of about 5/11d. in the present year.  We adjusted that by using a device we can only use once and reducing the rates by 10/-.  We are fortunate in County Dublin in that we have an expanding product from 1d. in the £ all the time. Unfortunately, other counties have not got that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power referred to the increased rates relief given to farmers in respect of their agricultural land.  He did not refer to the enormous increase in the rates on their buildings during these years.  That is the big snag.  The overall rate being paid by these farmers is much greater than in the past.  Today we all received a circular in relation to stamp duty.  In that circular the position in regard to stamp duty here is contrasted with the position existing in Northern Ireland and England. The contrast is anything but in our favour.  In Northern Ireland and England, on a house costing £4,000 or £5,000, there is no stamp duty, and my recollection is that the stamp duty on such a house here is about £130 or £150.  This is merely a means of collecting revenue.  It is deplorable. The cost of housing has rocketed in recent years.  Many of the people I know who have been striving to build their own houses are not able to meet their present commitments.  When this stamp duty is thrown in, it puts the cost up another £150.  This is something in which the Government should assist instead of adding to the load.</P>
    <P>There are many obstacles in the way of these unfortunate people making an effort to provide houses for themselves.  There have been no increases in the upper limits qualifying a person for a loan or grant.  Because of this, the number of successful <Col N="930" /> applicants for SDA loans has fallen fantastically in the city and county. These unfortunate people cannot provide the amount of deposit money they are required to have.  Now it is anything from £500 to £800.  A few years ago £200 was probably the maximum.  As I said, the cost of houses has rocketed generally.  This is due in no small measure to the effects of the turnover tax, and the general increases which have occurred as a direct result.  This turnover tax has affected not only the cost of houses but the cost of all sorts of essential services, the cost of running hospitals and so on.  The cost of being sick at present is unbearable.  That is coupled also with the failure of the Government to provide any additional assistance to meet these costs.</P>

      <P>Not only was it a Fianna Fáil proposal, but, be it to the credit of Deputy Sweetman, when he was Minister for Finance he implemented the Fianna Fáil suggestion.  We will see where the rubbish was.  Speaking on 11th May, 1955, at column 1264 of the Dáil Debates, I said <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no incentive whatsoever to industrialists in this Budget such <Col N="931" /> as some tax concession.  I am not speaking specifically now about the wear and tear allowance.  I have in mind some tax concession for those who might be engaged in industry in the export line.  I do not see any concession given....  Where is there any remission in tax by the Government to exporters?  I say that such a remission could be given.  The Minister may say it would be a complicated issue to differentiate between the proportion manufactured by the concern for home consumption and the proportion manufactured by the same concern for export.  There is the hope that this body which is examining industrial profits, and so forth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>At this point Deputy Seán Collins intervened to say &ldquo;Is the Deputy looking for an export subsidy?&rdquo; and I continued:</P>
    <P>All Governments are agreed that in this country it is necessary to bring down as much as possible the cost of commodities for export in order that we may become competitive in the export market.  I am suggesting that, in order to encourage exports, the Minister should give such a concern a reduction in taxation or some such thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins again intervened to say: &ldquo;Does the Deputy want us to sell dearer to our own people and cheaper to people abroad?&rdquo; I replied:</P>
    <P>No.  I have in mind a tax concession such as an income tax concession for people manufacturing goods for export.  I have in mind something that will encourage export.  I am not suggesting a dual price.</P>
    <P>So much for that.</P>
    <P>I will not be baited by Deputy O'Higgins to refer to Trinity College. Every member of the National Union of Journalists knows exactly the whole background to that attempt to plant. However, as he has brought it up, I will read a letter I got this morning, which anyone who wishes can examine:</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>You are like the man whistling passing the graveyard at midnight.  We had the extraordinary experience that the Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Dillon, made no reference in his major statement on the Vote on Account to a general election.  Perhaps he was wise.  Perhaps he realised that the Irish public, which is becoming more mature as the years go on, appreciates that a bad Opposition would make a bad Government and Fine Gael were one of the worst Oppositions ever in this House.  They would not do their homework.  They came into this House and, for the first time, glanced at the Order of Business and matters which were before the House on the particular day.  They were a bad Opposition and if ever the day came that they were voted into power, they would be a bad Government.  But, as <Col N="933" /> I say, the Irish electorate is becoming much more mature, more discerning and I do not think that fate will befall us.</P>
      <P>Let us have some clear thinking on this.  The only chance that Fine Gael would ever have to become the Government as a result of a general election would be if Deputy Corish and his Party were to vote for a Fine Gael Government.  I have the gravest doubts that that would happen.  I have the gravest doubts that certain members of the Labour Party could ever bring themselves to do such a thing but, purely for the record, I am pointing out that this is the only chance that Fine Gael would ever have but I do not think it will happen.  A bad Opposition would make a bad Government and when they could not do their homework in Opposition, they are hardly likely to emerge as a Government of workers.</P>
      <P>We saw last week that Deputy Declan Costello promised shortly the Fine Gael policy.  Talk about 46 men in search of an author.  The Fine Gael Party are in search of a leader and in search of a policy.  It is an extraordinary reflection&mdash;and there are intelligent men in the Party&mdash;that at this stage of their career they should be still seeking a policy to put before the Irish people.  Have they not some neck to contemplate fighting a general election without a policy?</P>
      <P>It is well known that the eight points to which Deputy Declan Costello has referred on many occasions have caused a certain amount of consternation within the ranks of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  These eight points of Deputy Delcan Costello were announced with great <i>eclat</i> many months ago and is it not well known that one of the bones of contention is the suggestion of some type of tinkering with the finances of the Central Bank and the banks of this country, that some type of interference should take place and is it not a fact that there are conservatives and diehards in the Fine Gael Party who are resisting Deputy Declan Costello's proposal in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> All I will say, <i>en passant</i>, is that there can be no interference with financial institutions based on such sound foundations as those which exist in this country, and if I criticise them in this instance as being conservative and diehard, perhaps there is a lot of wisdom in their mentality and outlook.  I am simply making this statement for Deputy O'Higgins's edification and perhaps he would enlighten us when replying, as he is a member of the shadow Cabinet, as to where these so-called eight points of the Fine Gael policy are which we have been awaiting for so many months.  Where is the policy of the Fine Gael Party which we have been promised?  Does Deputy O'Higgins suggest it is a reasonable thing to go before the Irish people as a Party seeking election and expect the electorate to give them their support without knowing what their policy is?  As I said before, a bad Opposition, as Fine Gael have been, would make a deplorable Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton and other speakers, including the Leader of the Opposition, chose to refer to housing.  I thought the last person to deal with housing in this House would be a Fine Gael spokesman. It is not so far back to January 1957, when there were 97,000 persons unemployed.  That was serious enough. But there is not in Ireland today a person connected with the building trade, whether a building contractor, an architect, a civil engineer, quantity surveyor, local authority official, a person in the hardware business or working in the docks or timber yards, who does not recall with a shudder the death blow which Deputy Sweetman and his supporters dealt to the building industry.  They say now that Fianna Fáil are falling down on the job of providing houses, but it would be as well for the record if we appreciated that in 1963/64 21,000 houses were built, reconstructed or improved, the highest figure on record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Costello was speaking a short time ago, I took a few notes of his observations with which I shall deal.  He referred to the fact that a <Col N="935" /> certain gentleman in the city of Dublin gave an exorbitant price for the first salmon caught this year.  He made the point that if there was extra money, it is being spent by people of that kind and not by the ordinary people.  This sort of thing is going on all the time. For as long as I can remember, the beast that gets the highest price at the fat cattle show in Dublin always gets a price that is three or four times its value.  Obviously it is a matter of advertising.  The butcher who buys that beast is mentioned in the newspapers and people get the idea that he buys the best of meat.  He expects to get more custom as a result.  I suppose the same occurred in regard to the salmon. I would find it very difficult to deal with that matter by legislation.  I myself think it silly that anyone should pay that price for a salmon and I would not be in favour of it but what can the Government do about it?</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that if there is more money in the country, the lowly-paid people are no better off.  I was looking through some figures of wages of lowly-paid people a few weeks ago. They are about 100 per cent. higher paid now than they were in 1957.  That does not apply to everybody, I admit, but it does apply to some of the lowly-paid people.  I might be answered by a member from the opposite benches that they have to pay more for what they buy.  Roughly speaking, the cost of living has gone up by 25 or 26 per cent.  Therefore, if the person had, say, £4 per week at that time and has £8 a week now, he buys as much for £5 a week as he did for £4 at that time and he has £3 as well.  He is better off to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another category mentioned by Deputy Costello was the old age pensioner.  Nobody can argue with any conviction that old age pensioners are well off.  They will never be any better off than we can afford to keep them, but even the non-contributory old age pensioner is getting 55 per cent more than he got in 1957.  Therefore if he pays 25 per cent more now than he did at that time for the same type of goods, he has 30 per cent over and <Col N="936" /> above what he had in 1957 to buy something extra.  To that extent, he is better off.  Of course, the contributory pensioners are much better off than they were at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also referred to the question of the dividing of finance into capital and current expenditure.  He tried to give the impression that we did not know anything about capital expendiure until they came in in 1948. As far as I remember, around 1948 they had a great deal of talk about segregating current and capital expenditure. There will always be capital expenditure, and when Mr. Blythe was Minister for Finance some time before 1932, I myself criticised him for some item or two that he placed on the capital side rather than on the current side.  That was a very common method of attack at that time and went on for many years with Ministers for Finance being criticised for putting things over to the capital side that they should not put over, thus escaping the necessity for raising more taxation.  The attack is usually the other way around now but I mention that to show that we had an idea, at least, long before 1948 of what capital expenditure meant.</P>
    <P>The first point made by Deputy Sweetman in speaking in this debate related to the ninth round increase in wages, the 12 per cent.  He made the usual introduction of Fine Gael speakers.  He said that the Taoiseach, having the Cork and Kildare elections in mind, arranged to have this 12 per cent made to all the workers.  Unfortunately, we do not get an intelligent debate in this House because it is impossible to get the Fine Gael Party to recognise or to believe that a Party do things like that because they think it is best in all the circumstances and not with an eye to Party advantage. As long as Fine Gael see only the one side of the matter, that a Party does nothing unless it is for Party advantage, then it will be very hard to have an intelligent debate here at all.</P>
    <P>The fact is, as Deputy Corish pointed out, that the Taoiseach was not responsible for the 12 per cent. He did suggest that the employers and the employees might meet.  We all knew <Col N="937" /> at the time that there was a demand coming from the unions for an increase in wages.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Corish, in his speech here last Wednesday, confirmed that.  He told us it was well known at the time that the unions were about to move.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had the idea very strongly, and we all had the same idea, that it would be a very good thing if we could have a regulated increase, that the employers and employees should meet and try to agree on a percentage increase to be applied all round, that as a result of that we would not have a long drawn out agitation by workers here and workers there, and perhaps strikes in many cases, but in any event, a lot of industrial trouble, where there would always be leapfrogging: the first people come along and get an increase and then when all the other groups have got an increase, the first people must come back to get level with the others.</P>
    <P>To avoid all that, the Taoiseach suggested that the employers and employees should meet and try to arrange for some uniform increase.  They did meet and they agreed on 12 per cent. Everybody agreed&mdash;at least everybody I came across agreed&mdash;that the idea of a uniform increase was a good one. As well as avoiding industrial trouble, it meant that it would be possible to lay down a certain period before another adjustment in wages would be made.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt&mdash;and I think we made it very plain at the time, in spite of the Cork and Kildare by-elections&mdash; that we thought 12 per cent was too high.  The Taoiseach said it at the time.  I remember distinctly he said he thought about eight per cent would be a better figure, that the economy of the country could not stand 12 per cent. If expenditure is made which is higher than output, there is bound to be trouble.  I remember speaking in the Seanad at the time and expressing the same opinion, that 12 per cent was probably too high and might cause trouble.  There is no doubt that if they had agreed to an eight per cent increase and made the waiting period shorter&mdash; one and a half years instead of two <Col N="938" /> years&mdash;we would have fared much better.  An eight per cent increase could have been more easily absorbed by increasing production.  It would have gone a long way towards relieving us of some of the increased prices that took place.  I do not say all of the increased prices were due to the increased wages: some of the increased prices were due to costs other than wages.  Not only would the workers themselves have been better off had there been an increase of only eight per cent, but those on fixed incomes and those who did not benefit by the agreement would have been better off. Generally speaking, therefore, the country would have fared better.</P>
    <P>One thing about the National Wage Agreement is that it became possible for employers and employees to meet and agree on certain matters.  When they meet again, as I hope they will this time next year, I trust they will have in mind the disadvantages, shall I say, that accrued from the agreement last time, and will be able to make a better agreement on the next round.  It is not so important that the labour side should press or compel the employers to give more than the employers think they can give, but that both sides should try to assess together the ideal increase the economy can absorb.  With their knowledge of the various output levels and the gross national product, it should be possible for them to have expert advice when negotiating future agreements.</P>
    <P>Some speakers associated the cost of living with this matter.  I suppose a person who is unguarded in his speech can associate wage increases with an increase in the cost of living.  We all know wages are only one of the causes of increases in the cost of living.  We must also try to find out the contribution of manufacturers.  Certain manufacturers whose productivity is improving satisfactorily can absorb certain wage increases without any trouble whatsoever.  Other manufacturers cannot exactly meet the increase, but can postpone its effect by deferring expenditure on plans until an improvement in productivity permits them to absorb wage increases.  There is a third group <Col N="939" /> who cannot meet the increased costs and they, naturally, have to put up their prices if they are to survive.</P>
    <P>There were various increased costs to be met by industry during the year and it is obvious that certain manufacturers had to put up their prices. That, in itself, was a cause of an increase in the price of essentials during the year.  Another contributory factor was the increase of two per cent in imports.  Many manufacturers rely on imported materials and, if the price of those materials went up by two per cent, prices had to follow, possibly by a little more than two per cent.</P>
    <P>We were told that the increased cost of living was due to a great extent to the turnover tax.  It was the first point raised in this connection.  Anybody who examines these figures objectively and tries to find out exactly what caused the increase in the cost of living during the year will see it was not all due to the turnover tax.  Take the cost of living in August, 1963.  The turnover tax came in on 1st November of that year.  Then we can take the cost of living figure in the following February and in May.  From August to May the increase in the cost of living was 3 per cent.  When introducing the turnover tax, we tried to persuade the Dáil that the increased cost of living would be in or around 2½ per cent.  We were nearer to the truth than those opposed to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Altogether, it has.  I am talking about the turnover tax.  Before the introduction of the turnover tax, taking the figure in August and again in February and May, the increase in the cost of living was 3 per cent for the entire period and the turnover tax was absorbed in that 3 per cent.  Therefore, the turnover tax could not be claimed to be responsible for more than a 3 per cent increase, though there was a 10 per cent increase for the 18 months.  Another contributory item was the increased price for farm produce.  Nobody, I think, will object <Col N="940" /> to that.  Farmers get increased prices for cattle, potatoes and milk.</P>
      <P>Milk went up because there was a budgetary decision to increase its price all round.  Of course the price of liquid milk went up parallel with that of creamery milk.  Therefore, meat, potatoes and milk were responsible for a 3 per cent increase in the cost of living.  Nobody suggested that there was any way of dealing with these three items.  Nobody would suggest we should try to reduce the price of cattle, go back on the price of milk or control the price of potatoes.  If the farmers are getting more for these items, we must bear the consequences: consumers must pay more.  Farmers got a good increase of 16 per cent in their incomes last year, but, even so, the farmers still lag behind workers in cities and towns.  Farmers are now coming nearer the position of such workers.  That accounts for 3 per cent. I have already mentioned the 2 per cent increase in the cost of imports.</P>
      <P>There is a small increase&mdash;I do not know how much, but it would not be significant&mdash;in the price of drink and tobacco as a result of the last Budget. We should remember that when the prices of drink and tobacco go up, the rise is clouted to the cost of living.  I have often thought it wrong to have tobacco and drink tied to the cost of living because they can rightly be regarded as luxuries.  It is not altogether right that they have been taken into account in calculating how a person who has a fixed or small income can live when prices go up.</P>
      <P>Probably the remainder of this ten per cent is made up by increased prices all round and these increased prices are due to various causes.  As I mentioned already, the increase in the price of imported goods, the increase in salaries and wages, and all the other increases that not only manufacturers but those in the distributive trade and in the wholesale and retail trades had to meet, were responsible for retail prices going up and in the end we had a sum total of ten per cent during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always interesting and instructive to try to see how we fared as compared with other countries.  Is it <Col N="941" /> true, for instance, as some people might think, that prices are going up here unlike other countries and that we are unfortunate in that respect?  It is not true, and there is a table issued by the OECD which gives us a very useful figure, the increase between 1958 and 1964.  It is instructive in that we find Ireland amongst European countries is by no means the greatest sufferer in this regard.  As a matter of fact, there are some countries above it, some of them with a very much increased cost of living than we have.</P>
    <P>During that period, according to the OECD, and which I think is correct, the figure for Ireland is 16.7 per cent.  Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are higher, on the 18 per cent level.  Norway was 19 and Italy, Denmark and France were up in the 20 to 28 per cent. range.  Spain was 34 per cent. and Iceland 60.9 per cent. Below us is the United Kingdom at 14.8 per cent.  We, as I said, are 16.7 per cent. and this is a very important item because we export most of our goods to the United Kingdom and in our manufactured goods we are competing with manufacturers in the United Kingdom.  If the United Kingdom can keep their increase in the cost of living below us, they are getting an advantage over us in the manufacting industry and we want to watch carefully to see that we do not exceed the cost of living in Great Britain by more than a small fraction.</P>
    <P>Then you have Portugal, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium.  Portugal and Switzerland are only of academic interest to us and both are 14 per cent.  Germany is 13.6 per cent., and we do of course send some goods to Germany and we have to compete there.  Belgium is the lowest at ten per cent.  That is the picture, and while I am not pleading that we should be complacent about the whole matter, I want to assure Deputies that other countries have their difficulties also and that we have not done too badly over the last seven or eight years in keeping the cost of living even at its present level.  I should like to repeat that in particular we must watch the cost of living in the United Kingdom because we have to compete in that <Col N="942" /> market in respect of the greater part of our exports.</P>
    <P>If we think over the matter, we find there are certain instances where it is obvious the cost of living must go up if costs in an industry go up.  Recently we had a demand from the sugar beet growers for a higher price for beet. If we assume that the beet factory is being worked as efficiently as any factory can be, it is obvious the only way the company could pay for the increased price is by putting up the price of sugar.  As a matter of fact, the increase was only marginal and it is possible that the Sugar Company will get over it without putting up their prices.  They will have to cut their profits perhaps, or improve productivity, but if there were a larger increase in the price of beet, it is obvious that sugar prices would have to be increased.</P>
    <P>Another instance is to be found in the railways.  The biggest cost in railways is wages and salaries.  If there is an increase, we are almost immediately faced with an increase in fares.  It appears to be the only way of meeting it and that of course means there is an increase in the cost of living.  We have to keep in mind in all these things that there is a relationship between costs and prices charged and there may be no way out of the dilemma except to put up the prices.</P>
    <P>We had a good deal of criticism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government generally for not taking strong measures to control prices.  We believe that the method we are adopting is the best in the end. Take for instance clothes.  We believe that the best way to regulate in that matter is to allow competition.  It is extremely difficult to do it by fixed prices.  We had the experience during the war and we all found as we went along that prices were fixed which were too high but there appeared to be no way out.  What happened was that although there was a good deal of care by people who knew the value of figures and so on, to find out what should be charged, those who were trading appeared to be getting exorbitantly high profits.  We should have a residual power to deal with certain <Col N="943" /> commodities and we have done that. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has successfully intervened on more than one occasion and he will certainly intervene again, if necessary.  We do not propose to be complacent about this and we intend to watch the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan gave us the impression that he was present at the Cabinet meeting when we were discussing the building strike.  We have to be realistic about these things.  The Labour Court was set up some years ago to try to maintain industrial peace.  That is the Court's job but it cannot intervene unless both sides are agreeable to talk. That states the position as far as the building strike was concerned.  The Labour Court were not asked by both sides to come along.  They knew there was no use intervening until a feeler was sent out to them to come along, and when that feeler came, they immediately intervened and after some parleying, an agreement was reached. That is all we can hope to do in any strike of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan talked about two publications on which he said there was extravagant expenditure.  One of them was <i>Know Ireland</i>, published by the Minister for External Affairs and which the Deputy said cost £10,000. Of course the net cost would not be anything like that.  I do not know what the figure is and I do not suppose anybody knows at the moment.</P>
    <P>He went on to the Minister for Agriculture who sent out a Christmas greeting in the interest of co-operation to every farmer in Ireland.  I got one and thought it very kind of him to send it.  He sent out 250,000 of them but it did not cost anything like £20,000.  It was a good experiment. Some Deputies listening to me know what was in it.  The Minister said he was going to do his best to get agricultural production brought up and he asked every farmer in the country to help.  That was a fair enough statement. If only one farmer in every thousand started thinking about the thing and said to himself: &ldquo;There is something I could do to increase production&rdquo;, the cost of that endeavour by the <Col N="944" /> Minister would be repaid one hundredfold.</P>
    <P>That Christmas greeting was not offensive to anybody.  The Minister did not try to offend anyone.  When Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture in 1948, he put a most offensive advertisement in all the newspapers telling the farmers to go on to barley and oats and not to bother about wheat.  The end of it was: &ldquo;We will show them.&rdquo; That was a most offensive advertisement to a Government who had just gone out of office.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his Christmas greeting, appealed for increased production on the part of every farmer for the sake of the country and of the farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said the Pensions Abatement Bill was too long delayed. I agree that there has been a long delay.  It has created a number of rather difficult problems, although it is not a very long Bill, but I hope it will be in the hands of Deputies by the end of the coming months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also blamed the Government for allowing too much office building to go on and he said we should have the building industry devoted more to housebuilding.  I agree with what he said but there is one very big office building that went up in the city centre in respect of which he would have more influence than I.  The Government had intended building a fairly big office building because, at the moment, our staffs are scattered all over the city and it would be more economic to have them in one building than to have them working the way they are at the present time. We could get better work out of them if we had them all in the one building but when I saw the amount of office building that is going on, I approached the Government and the Government agreed that we postpone our own building and try to get lettings in the new buildings.  We are not adding to the trouble but I do not think we can do much about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also said that we should tackle the question of education. We have tackled it and I do not think anyone who studies the situation <Col N="945" /> can say that we have not tackled it and tackled it well.  In the year before we came into office, the Book of Estimates provided £12½ million for education and this year we are providing £27.7 million, more than double, £15.2 million more.  We would like to do more and we are moving as fast as we can.  It is hard to get schools built.  It is hard to get the builders and contractors to do the work and it is hard to get the teachers.  We are not allowed to proceed in certain directions because we have not got the builders or the teachers.  We could spend more money by way of scholarships but we have gone a long way in that direction in the past few years, and we mean to go further.  I would like to say in passing that we had a terrible job to get the £15.2 million extra out of the Dáil.  Every time we looked for money the House was divided; some people went in one direction and some in another, saying: &ldquo;We will not give it to them.&rdquo; That was the attitude all the time.</P>
    <P>The three Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Education are grouped together in many countries and some of the information given by OECD is grouped in that way.  In 1956-57, £43½ million was provided for these three and in this year £82 million is provided, almost double. I think we have not done too badly in that direction and I only hope that Fine Gael and Labour will soften their hearts to me when I come looking for money and say: &ldquo;You are welcome to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked about some of the trade negotiations going on at the moment and about the GATT. The position is that at the moment our trade relations with Britain are being reviewed.  Deputies will recollect that the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs had a meeting with the Prime Minister on the other side and with some of his Ministers.  As a result of that, officials from both Governments have had meetings.  They are exploring the possibility of getting a better trade treaty than before for this country.  Although it is hard to say at this stage what the outcome will <Col N="946" /> be, I could say that things look better than in any talks we have had in the past but I would not like to say for certain how they will turn out.</P>
    <P>We have been thinking for some time about entering GATT.  There will be an opportunity, before the Kennedy Round is considered by GATT, for new countries to join and we are considering whether we should join when that opportunity comes.  We probably would do better by going into it when the Kennedy Round comes.  There are advantages and disadvantages in going in, but I think the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages.</P>
    <P>We have had negotiations with certain other countries on bilateral trade agreements.  The Committee dealing with these matters had a meeting with France and they have made a better agreement with the French than we have had in the past.  They are now about to meet Finland and other countries will follow.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke a great deal about housing and I must say that Deputy Sherwin gave a very interesting figure.  I must, when I have time, look into it and see what the implications are, and whether these figures are an indication of any trend one way or the other.  Deputy Sherwin said, and none of us can deny it, that you cannot build houses in 1965 unless all the preparations have been completed, and the preparations take a considerable time.  The site must be acquired.  It must then be cleared.  Tenders must be advertised and accepted and everything must be ready to start if one intends to build houses in 1965. One cannot go into a field and start putting in water and sewerage, followed by building, all inside of twelve months.  Some years have to be spent in the necessary preliminaries.  Whatever Government are in Office in 1964 then will be responsible for the houses built in 1965.</P>
    <P>Let us go back now to 1954 when Fianna Fáil were in office.  They had made preparations for building in the following year.  The Coalition Government came in.  They pride themselves now on their building abilities.  In that year 1,922 houses were built.  They went out in 1957 and we continued <Col N="947" /> with the programme that was there when we returned to office.  There was certainly no cutting down.  The number built was 1,021.  That is almost half the number built in 1954.  It is quite obvious from that there was a downward trend.  It is quite obvious from that that preparations had not been made for building in the time ahead. We can come to no other conclusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde talked about the national income.  He said it was £550 million.  Even at constant prices, it would be better than that, but, in any case, when talking of the percentage of expenditure, both central and local, it is current prices one should take.  After all, we have to raise our money at current prices and we spend it at current prices and we should, therefore, take the current national income.  The figure would be £900 million in 1964.  I have not got the exact figures, but, taking central and local income against that, I think they are about 25 or 26 per cent and not 50 per cent, as Deputy Esmonde said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth talked about gross national product.  He said in the 'fifties, it was rather low and had, in fact, gone much lower in the time of the Coalition, which Deputy Sweetman contested.  I thought it well to get the figures to find out who was right.  In 1951, 1952 and 1953&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Government were in office&mdash;it went up by 6.7 per cent, that is, an average of 2.2 per cent.  In the next few years, 1954, 1955 and 1956&mdash;the inter-Party Government were in office&mdash;it went up by 1.7 per cent altogether, an average of .56 per cent.  In the three years 1957, 1958 and 1959&mdash;Fianna Fáil were in office&mdash;it went up by an average of 2.7 per cent or 9 per cent altogether, which is a little better than when the Coalition were there.  In the past five years, it has gone up by 4.25 per cent each year on average, giving a total of 21.15 per cent altogether. That is a very good figure.  It is a fairly good figure from the point of view of international comparisons.  We have, as Deputies are aware, forecast in the Second Programme that we should reach about 4.4 per cent for <Col N="948" /> each year up to 1970.  Now in the year 1964 we had 4¾ per cent so that we have lived up to our forecast already so far as that year is concerned.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion about population.  Somebody said the population is increasing.  That is true.  It is also true that it has been increasing steadily for the past four years for the first time since the Famine back in the middle of the last century.  From time to time, a great many figures are thrown at us in relation to population, emigration, unemployment and so on. It is just as well to know what the facts are.  In the three years April 1954 to April 1951, the population fell by 56,000.  In the past four years the population has gone up by 39,500. There you have a complete reversal of the earlier situation.  For the first time for more than a century, we have an increasing population.  I hope that will continue.  There are ups and downs. From April 1962 to April 1963, the increase was 17,000.  For the past two years, the increase has been round about 8,000.  All we can hope is that the figure will go up again to the good figure we had in 1963.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the increase in rates and said we were unfair to the local councils because we delayed payment of the money from the Central Exchequer.  He said a great deal of money was not paid until 31st March.  That is not true.  I should like to tell the House in detail how these various grants are paid.  They are spread out fairly evenly over the year. There are exceptions to that.  In the case of health, the grants are paid in four quarterly instalments&mdash;June, September, December and March, four equal quarterly instalments of 95 per cent.  Five per cent is held back.  That is necessary in order to make the adjustments when the year is over. When the adjustments are made, the balance is paid after a month or two.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, water supply and sewerage charges payments are made in May and November because these are the times at which the local authorities have to make payments and, therefore, May and November are very suitable.  They have half their <Col N="949" /> money in the beginning of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Agricultural grants are paid in quarterly instalments.  The final payment is made in the March quarter.  A sum of £11.2 million has to be paid for 1964-65.  Of that, £8.22 million has already been paid and the remainder will be paid before the end of March. As a matter of fact, we shall have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate before we complete the job.</P>
    <P>With regard to Road Fund grants, as everybody knows they come in principally in the last quarter.  Nearly everybody registers his car round 1st January.  As far as possible, the grants are paid out during the year and the big proportion is paid out at the end of the year.  At the moment £7 million has been paid out of £9 million.  That is fairly good, considering that nearly all the money is collected in January.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman talked about a revision of the Estimate for Universities and Colleges and gave the impression that we had cut down on the amount we proposed to give the universities in the coming year.  That was not, of course, a deliberate cutting down. The Science Faculty will not be building this year and there is, therefore, £500,000 less this year as compared with last year.  That is the only difference. Otherwise, the grants are the same as last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also thought that in my provision for the agricultural grant for the coming year, I had visualised something like a 30 per cent increase in rates.  That is not true. There is still a Supplementary Estimate to come there.  A sum of £1.4 million was voted at Budget time but that actually has amounted to £1.78 million.  If that is added to the amount in the Estimate last year of £9.42 million, it means a total of £11.2 million.  If you compare that with what is put in in the coming year, I think you will get an increase of about 13 per cent in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan was puzzled somewhat about what we meant about an increase in agricultural incomes for the year.  What is meant is that there is an increase of 16 per cent in the net <Col N="950" /> agricultural incomes in 1964 over 1963, that is, having taken the farmer's costs for farming, such as seeds, manures and feeding stuffs, rates, maintenance of machinery or anything that can be put down as costs of farming.  That is deducted from the gross income and then the net income is taken.  On that basis the farmer had an increase of 16 per cent in his net income in 1964 over 1963.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish made the point that the gross national product here did not compare very favourably with European countries in 1964.  First, there are a number of countries not given in the 1964 table.  We do not know whether they are below us or above us.  Invariably, a number of them are below us. Therefore, we conclude that some of them at least are below us.  Denmark, Greece, Iceland, Portugal and Turkey are not in the table.  Taking the two years, in 1963 there were only seven above us and seven were listed as below us, including such very strong countries economically as the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Germany and Denmark.  This year, nine are above us and only two are listed below us.  As I mentioned, a number of countries are not listed here at all. The two below us are the United Kingdom and Italy.  It will be seen, if you take the average for the two years, that Ireland has done better in gross national product than either the United States or the United Kingdom, which is indeed a very good achievement.</P>

      <P>A greater measure of Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade has for long been an important objective of Government policy and has been the subject of debate and questions in the Dáil.  Possible measures to achieve this objective were considered as long ago as 1938 but there have been certain fundamental difficulties.  The trade was carried on by long established undertakings who possessed all the necessary docking and other facilities at both sides of the Irish Sea as well as the important business connections. It was obvious that for a new Irish company to break into this trade on a competitive basis would be a hazardous and costly undertaking even if they could secure satisfactory portal facilities.  The alternative to setting up a new undertaking was to buy an existing undertaking or take a share in one and this was the solution which the Government saw to be inevitable from an early date.  Possible arrangements of this kind were explored on a number of occasions over the years but for one reason or another did not come to fruition.</P>

    <P>The agreement to purchase the B. &amp; I. from Coast Lines is the result of exploratory contacts which commenced as long ago as 1960 and of detailed negotiations on the purchase which commenced in September, 1963. These negotiations have been carried on by officers of my Department in consultation with officers of the Department of Finance.  A tribute is due to the senior officers of my Department for their labours in carrying out the negotiations involving many complex matters. They have advised me that throughout the protracted discussions they were met in a fair and reasonable way by the Coast Lines representatives, to whom a tribute is also due.  The secrecy of the negotiations had to be preserved for many reasons, including the need to avoid <Col N="953" /> speculation on the Stock Exchange and I think it fair to say that the secret was well kept.  We have also had the benefit of the advice as consultant of a distinguished accountant, Dr. Howard Robinson of the firm, Polden Robinson &amp; Co. Ltd., Dublin.</P>
    <P>The B. &amp; I. with its subsidiary, the City of Cork Steampacket Co. Ltd., is one of the two major cross-Channel companies, the other being British Railways.  The company has a fleet of nine motor vessels including the large passenger/cargo/cattle vessels, the <i>Munster</i>, the <i>Leinster</i> and the <i>Innisfallen.</i> It operates regular passenger cargo and cattle services daily, except Sundays, between Dublin and Liverpool and thrice weekly between Cork and Fishguard as well as cargo or cattle services between Dublin and Liverpool, Dublin/Preston, Dublin/ Manchester, Cork/Fishguard, Cork/ Liverpool, Dundalk/Liverpool, and Drogheda/Liverpool.</P>
    <P>The B. &amp; I. carries a very substantial proportion of the regular cross-Channel trade.  The report of the tribunal of inquiry into cross-Channel freight rates published in 1959 showed that the B. &amp; I. carried about 45 per cent of the livestock traffic and, together with Coast Lines and Burns and Laird, carried some 56 per cent of total traffic.  The B. &amp; I. Dublin/ Liverpool service alone carried 24 per cent of total liner traffic.  Broadly, the company's share of regular cross-Channel liner trade at that time appeared to be of the order of some 40 per cent.  Up to date estimates of the proportions of traffic carried by the different companies are not available.</P>
    <P>Apart from freight the company's passenger services between Dublin and Liverpool which handle about 250,000 passengers per annum and Cork and Fishguard which handle about 80,000 per annum are of considerable importance to our tourist trade as are the facilities provided for tourist cars on the Dublin/Liverpool route.  The company employs about 800 regular staff ashore and 320 afloat, as well as giving employment to an average of over 300 dockers in Dublin and 50 in Cork <Col N="954" /> and to a further 20 to 30 each at Dundalk and Drogheda on days when a vessel is loading or discharging there.  The purchase will, therefore, assure complete Irish control over a very substantial sector of total cross-Channel trade.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the agreement to purchase the B. &amp; I. is the result of protracted negotiations and very hard bargaining.  Coast Lines Ltd. were prepared to enter into negotiations only on the firm understanding that the B. &amp; I., if acquired by the Government, would continue to be operated on strictly commercial lines.  Coast Lines have been given a firm assurance in writing that the B. &amp; I. will be managed on commercial lines as a self-supporting commercial entity without special Government measures which would place it in an advantageous position as compared with Coast Lines other liner services and generally that it will not be operated in such a manner as to damage the legitimate interests of the Coast Lines Group.  Coast Lines similarly have given an assurance that the companies of the Coast Lines Group will not be managed in such a way as to be detrimental to the interests of the B. &amp; I.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable also that other cross-Channel shipping companies whether Irish owned or otherwise should be assured that the company will be run on sound commercial lines and that they will not be exposed to unfair competition by a State-subsidised concern.</P>
    <P>The Agreement scheduled to the Bill provides for the purchase of the entire issued share capital at a price of £3,606,922.  This price is based on a valuation of the assets.  The fleet was valued by a leading firm of ship brokers and valuers, Tamplin &amp; Co. Ltd., London, who were commissioned by my Department, with the agreement of Coast Lines.  Their valuation represents their estimate of the open market value of the ships of the fleet. The company's real property in Dublin was valued by Montgomery &amp; Son Ltd., a Dublin firm of surveyors and valuers, who were commissioned by Coast Lines and the Commissioners of Valuation advised me that <Col N="955" /> their valuation was acceptable.  Other movable assets, such as cranes, etc. were taken over at book value.</P>
    <P>The price of £3,606,922 also includes a sum of approximately £650,000 owing by Coast Lines to the B. &amp; I. This sum represents the depreciation reserves of the B. &amp; I. which have up to now been placed on loan at the disposal of the parent company.  This sum will be repaid to the B. &amp; I. by Coast Lines as soon as the exact amount is determined when the acounts for the year 1964 have been completed and audited.  Certain assets listed in the Schedule to the Agreement have been excluded from the purchase and the value of these as shown in the books of the company at £202,277 must also be paid by Coast Lines to the B. &amp; I. The purchase price, therefore, includes in all some £850,000 in liquid assets. No sum is included in respect of goodwill and the company is, therefore, being taken over at the estimated market value of the assets.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal commercial practice, interest is payable on the purchase price as from the date of Agreement, 2nd February, 1965 until the purchase moneys have been paid to Coast Lines.  This cannot be done until this Bill has been enacted and the transaction completed.  In the interval Coast Lines have agreed to appoint nominees of the Government to vacancies on the Board of the B. &amp; I. so as to ensure that Irish interests will be represented until the transaction is completed.</P>
    <P>The Agreement also provides for the conclusion of an Agency Agreement between the companies under which Coast Lines will be appointed the sole agent of the B. &amp; I. in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Similarly, there is provision for the conclusion in due course of corresponding agreements between the B. &amp; I. on the one hand and constituent companies of the Coast Lines group on the other under which the B. &amp; I. will continue to have the sole agency in the State for these companies.  These agreements provide in effect for the continuation of the present commercial arrangements <Col N="956" /> which exist between the companies subject only to such changes as necessarily arise out of the change of ownership of the B. &amp; I.  They provide for rates and terms of commission, etc. and specify the services to be performed by each company for the other.  They ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that the important passenger and cargo terminal facilities controlled by Coast Lines at Liverpool and elsewhere will be available to the B. &amp; I. and that the B. &amp; I. in its turn will continue to make corresponding facilities available to the Coast Lines group of companies including the passenger terminal and other facilities for the Burns &amp; Laird Line at Dublin.</P>
    <P>Among other arrangements provided for in the Agreement are the provision of relief vessels by Coast Lines to the B. &amp; I. on the same terms as to the constituent members of the Coast Lines group.  The availability of satisfactory relief vessels for the large passenger/cargo/cattle vessels the <i>Munster, Leinster</i> and <i>Innisfallen</i> is most important to the maintenance of the regular B. &amp; I. services and such specialised vessels could not readily be chartered for temporary periods in the open market.  The agreements are mutually beneficial commercial agreements between the companies and in accordance with normal commercial practice the detailed terms are being treated as confidential.</P>
    <P>The purchase will be effective as from 1st January, 1965, and profits after that date will accrue to the Government. Profits up to 31st December, 1964, will, of course, accrue to Coast Lines. The Agreement provides for the payment of a dividend to Coast Lines in respect of the year 1964 limited to the net profit earned after deduction of all expenses properly chargeable to revenue and payment of tax.</P>
    <P>Turning to the future, I must quite frankly dispose of any idea that the ownership of the B. &amp; I. will result in dramatic changes in the cross-Channel freight rate structure.  The accounts of the B. &amp; I. have hitherto been incorporated in those of the Coast Lines group and have not been published <Col N="957" /> separately.  In connection with the negotiations, however, we had to get the separate audited accounts of the B. &amp; I. for a number of years past. These reveal that the net profits of the company have been falling steadily. Profits after taxation which amounted to £184,000 in 1952 had fallen to £124,000 in 1956 at the time of the investigation into cross-Channel freight rates and to barely £2,600 in 1963. This was a particularly bad year for a number of reasons, however, and the profits for the year 1964 are expected to be of the order of £77,000 before taxation.</P>
    <P>These profits are calculated on the basis of depreciation on historic cost and, in view of the very substantial increases in shipbuilding costs, depreciation at this level does not provide nearly sufficient reserves to finance the replacement of the company's vessels in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  Do these figures include the figures for the subsidiary, the City of Cork Steampacket Company?  They are amalgamated figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  For instance, one of the large passenger/cargo/cattle vessels like the <i>Munster</i> which cost in the neighbourhood of £650,000 in 1948 would now be likely to cost from £1½ to £2 million to replace.  The Dáil will appreciate therefore why it was that the Government were able to drive a hard bargain for the purchase of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point it is desirable to summarise the general economics of cross-Channel sea transport, particularly in relation to the low profits of the B. &amp; I. Deputies who have read the report of the tribunal of inquiry into cross-Channel freight rates will recollect the analysis made by the tribunal of the effect on conventional shipping services of the new specialised container and ferry services.  The conventional services like the railways have operated a rates structure based largely on the value of the goods.  The container and ferry services on the other hand have adopted the road transport <Col N="958" /> system of charging according to the size and weight and loadability of the goods irrespective of their value.  This has enabled the specialised services to compete with lower rates for the high value goods which the conventional shipping companies had hitherto carried at high rates.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the container services do not compete for low value goods on which conventional shipping freights are much lower and which in general are not in any case suitable for containerisation.  Neither do the container or ferry services compete for the carriage of cattle or of passengers. While, in an effort to meet increased costs, there have been a number of increases in the general rate book levels of cross-Channel freights, actual rates charged on goods passing in regular and reasonably substantial quantities have generally been at exceptional rates settled with the shippers on a bargaining basis.  In effect, the shipping companies carrying mixed cargoes have had to reduce rates in order to compete with the container services.  They have also provided container services of their own, using either the conventional vessels or specialised vessels, but all these specialised services whether independent or not are inevitably in competition with the regular liner freight services. This competition from specialised container services has grown steadily in recent years.  At present independent container services are operated daily between Dublin and Preston, twice weekly between Drogheda and Preston and thrice weekly between Greenore and Preston.  The B. &amp; I. itself operates a specialised container service between Dublin and Liverpool five times weekly and British Railways carry containers to a growing extent on their regular services.</P>
    <P>The cross-Channel companies have had to face very substantial increase in costs which because of competition, customer resistance and public pressures, they have been unable to recoup fully by increased charges.  Net freight revenue of the B. &amp; I. which amounted to £547,000 in 1952 had declined to £396,000 by 1963.  Over <Col N="959" /> the same period expenditure had increased from £233,000 in 1952 to £493,000 in 1963.  These increases in costs were largely determined by factors outside the control of the Company.  Labour costs at sea follow international standards and for shore staff have been determined by national increases in levels of remuneration. Loading and unloading charges which amount to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the Company's total expenses are also to a considerable extent outside their control.</P>
    <P>It will be well to recall the general conclusions of the Tribunal who reported in 1959 on the subject of cross-Channel freight rates that from the standpoint of the trading results it could not be said that the level of rates had been unjustifiably high but that a major criticism of the conference arose from its tendency to create a situation in which innovation entailing a possible disturbance of the existing pattern of traffic was discouraged so that its introduction might be gravely delayed.  As I have already indicated, this is no longer the position and the rapid development of container traffic has precipitated a period of rapid change in the cross-Channel trade and of difficulties for the major shipping companies operating regular liner services.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful to Deputies if I make it clear that comparisons between individual freight rates on different routes are in general most unrewarding.  In comparing individual freight rates on the cross-Channel services with rates for similar goods on routes elsewhere the following factors have to be taken into account:</P>
    <P>(1)  The overall costs of maintaining regular services on the route including such factors as seasonality, balance of trade in each direction and the cost of terminal facilities at the particular ports used.</P>
    <P>(2)  The rate structure obtaining on the route, i.e. whether rates are determined by class or by such factors as cubic weight and loadability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> (3)  The quantities of particular goods and the regularity with which they pass over the services and whether a package deal or exceptional rate has been negotiated with the particular shippers because of the volume of business.</P>
    <P>Examination by my Department of complaints made from time to time did not establish that rates in any particular case could be regarded as excessive.  Even where comparisons with other routes showed lower rates for particular commodities than on the cross-Channel services, it was found that differences in circumstances arising out of one or more of the factors I have mentioned made the comparison invalid.  The only valid comparison that can be made between freight rates on the cross-Channel services and comparable services abroad is on the basis of the profitability of the undertakings, assuming reasonably efficient operation in both cases.  The trading results of the B. &amp; I. which are now available to us make it clear that on this criterion it cannot be argued that the freight rates charged by the company have been excessive.</P>
    <P>The cross-Channel shipping trade is in fact at present in the throes of a period of rapid evolutionary change which in some respects is comparable to the position which was brought about in inland transport by the competition of road with rail.  On the one hand the conventional shipping companies operate regular liner services for passenger/cargo and cattle which must operate on a regular basis irrespective of short-term variations in the volume of traffic.  They likewise carry all goods offered just like the railway.  On the other hand, the specialised container services compete only for what is to a great extent the cream of the traffic and do not provide services for other goods.  While the analogy with road and rail competition is helpful in understanding the nature of the changes that are going on it should not be carried too far.  Shipping companies will fortunately not have to cope with competition from small units comparable to privately owned lorries or motor cars.  The prospect is that over <Col N="961" /> a period of some years the character of the cross-Channel shipping services and the freight rates structure will be modified by the various factors I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Our ownership of a substantial part of the cross-Channel services over these critical and formative years will help to ensure that the changes carried out and the ultimate structure of the services which emerge will be such as to reflect Irish interests.  The B. &amp; I. will in these matters be the watch dog of Irish interests.</P>
    <P>A further important consideration is that in a situation in which the B. &amp; I. profits were diminishing rapidly outside interests might not be prepared either to meet heavy temporary losses or to incur substantial new capital expenditure, if that were necessary, in order to maintain and improve the services so as to ensure their adequacy for our trade.  The services operated by the B. &amp; I. are most important ones, both for our trade and for tourism, and it is essential to our interests that they should not be run down or disappear. Were that to happen, the Government would in any case have no alternative but to step in and measures taken at a later stage might be much less effective or more expensive than taking over the company now.</P>
    <P>The company will be run on commercial lines and there can, of course, be no question of substantial freight reductions or discriminatory action in favour of Irish trade which would in any case be contrary to our international commitments.  Moreover, it should be remembered that shipping is an important business in its own right and that freight earnings are the precise economic equivalent of export earnings.  Even if it were possible to do so, it would not make economic sense to accept heavy losses on our shipping services merely to provide a general and unselective subsidy for a part of the cross-Channel trade carried by the services and over the routes of one particular company.</P>
    <P>The Irish company will be requested to examine all the factors and elements which together constitute the basis for a nationally orientated commercial policy.  Since this old-established <Col N="962" /> company is coming under new management and control, it will be desirable to outline them briefly:</P>
    <P>(1)  An analysis of the cross-Channel merchandise freight market. This involves some assumptions as to the growth of trade over the next ten years&mdash;its content, related to the detailed analysis prepared for the economic programme; its division between merchandise suitable for containers or pallet and for other means.</P>
    <P>(2)  The same examination in relation to livestock and a critical analysis of the cycles in cattle exports&mdash;the possibility of smoothing out the cycles and of changes in the volume of exports.</P>
    <P>(3)  An analysis of the present-day traffic and its content related to method of packing, use of unit loads, the available cargo space, the frequencies of sailings, onward road and rail services and destinations.</P>
    <P>(4)  The evalaution of efficiency and productivity in regard to all the above elements of study, in turn related to the handling at the ports, movement of merchandise from port to ship, the stowage of cargo and utilisation of space, the costs of ship operation, the costs of maintenance, the keeping of clerical records, accountancy, stock control and so forth.</P>
    <P>(5)  The examination of the passenger traffic facilities in respect of tourists and Irish people coming on family visits, both in relation to amenities and to future potential. This study would, of course, extend to the very vital contribution of the B. &amp; I. to motor car traffic to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>(6)  The examination of the sales organisation.</P>
    <P>There is a whole complex series of problems, referred to by consultants and by experts, connected with joint marketing, the amount, size of consignment, packaging, and how exporters can secure lower transport costs by more careful examination of their procedures under every head.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> (7)  Those elements having been examined, the company would base its conclusions and decisions on the following general principles:</P>
    <P>(i)  The provision of the most economical, efficient service to advance the trade of the country.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The assessment of commercial viability.</P>
    <P>(iii) The continuation and further development of the best possible communications and relations with the staff at all levels in order that growth of productivity may be fully understood and linked with conditions of employment and monetary reward.</P>
    <P>May I make it absolutely clear that the new Board will inherit a respectable tradition of competence in freight handling.  Relatively few complaints have come my way on the freight side. A few complaints have been evident in regard to the second-class passenger facilities.  Considerable improvements have been made in the last two years and this year further improvements.</P>
    <P>The new Board will, I am certain, be able to effect progress, although quick results cannot be expected.  The staff will, I am sure, work together with the object of demonstrating that a wholly Irish owned and managed cross-Channel shipping company can show the same spirit of endeavour as, for example, the cross-Channel national airline has already done.  For this there must be enthusiasm on all sides.</P>
    <P>I have thought it well to give a realistic report on the present shipping position so as to dispel all talk of subsidies.  On the other hand, I should like to affirm my confidence and that of the Government that under wholly Irish direction and management, and with the assistance of modern management and other techniques and the support of the trading community, the B. &amp; I. can render services to the community with greater efficiency and satisfaction and, in due course, provide a reasonable return on the investment we are now making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not propose to oppose this Bill.  It is better, I suppose, <Col N="964" /> if the shipping company has to be purchased, that it be purchased into Irish control than as so frequently happens in respect to other enterprises in this country which pass into foreign hands. At the present time a great many activities which heretofore have been controlled here in Ireland are passing under foreign control and essential transport facilities between this country and Great Britain cannot, with any degree of satisfaction, be seen to pass under foreign control owing to its indispensable character from the point of view of the entire trade of this country not only in industrial but in agricultural exports as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his introductory speech, has offered us a variety of bases for valuing the assets we have taken over.  There are two matters to which I hope he will return when concluding. One is the reference he has made to the profit record of the company. When you are buying a shipping company, you do not buy a parcel of scrap; you buy a business.  It is no use having a fleet of ships if the company that supplies them consistently loses money on them.  The company is worth very little in those circumstances from the point of view of a correct valuation for fixing a reasonable purchase price.</P>
      <P>The attention of the House should be very specifically directed to what the Minister has said on page 6 of his introductory speech.  The profits of this company have been falling steadily and though they amounted to £184,000 in 1952 and to £124,000 in 1956, they were barely £2,600 in 1963.  Those figures must be read in the context of the statement that these profits were calculated on a basis of depreciation on historic costs and in view of the very substantial increases in shipbuilding costs.  The Minister's statement is that depreciation at this level does not provide nearly sufficient reserves to finance the replacement of the company's vessels in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister points out that the valuation of a ship like the <i>Munster</i> has been based on a figure of £650,000 as its historic cost, whereas its replacement cost today would be between £1½ million and £2 million. <Col N="965" /> Therefore, it would be franker of the Minister to say that on the basis of depreciation, the losses sustained in recent years are probably far higher than the alleged profit of £2,600 which he speaks of for 1963.  On the figures in this statement, it is apparently true that this company, on a realistic basis, has been losing very large sums of money during the past few years, if correct depreciation had been provided for in the accounts.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us the ships have been valued by a firm of ship valuers, the name of which he gave us.  Their valuation exceeds the open market value of the ships of the fleet.  I remember when our Government were in office, the question of the acquisition of this line arose and I think an opportunity was offered to us to acquire it.  At that time our capital commitments were mainly directed to the building of houses, schools, and to other social investments of that kind, and, as we considered these matters had a high priority over all others, we devoted the capital at our disposal at that time to such social investments.  I do not remember what the price was at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had the advantage of consultation with his valuers and so forth and assures us that the price of £3,606,922 is an advantageous price. He describes it as a hard bargain. There are many people in the world who, if they had a company which was losing on a realistic basis a growing annual sum, would not consider they had been made the subject of a hard bargain if they got £3,600,000 for an enterprise which was in fact a heavy drain on their resources.</P>
    <P>This company, the B. &amp; I., is, I understand, a subsidiary of the Head Line who are getting out of shipping and going into other transport activities in Great Britain.  This £3,606,000 which they are getting for the assets fits very well into their programme of activities in Great Britain.  I hope that our experience in operating this property will give us some return for the money we are investing in it.  I think I am right in saying that if we were to meet the <Col N="966" /> interest charges on this capital investment, we would have to earn approximately £200,000 a year at six per cent. At present the company is losing a substantial amount of money every year, so while the Minister says no question of a subsidy can possibly arise, I hope that does not suggest that our purchase of this line is a signal for an increase in freight charges between here and Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounting has been done in the conventional way and the company has not been losing money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that the account keeping has not made provision for depreciation on a replacement basis and that it has been making provision for depreciation and arriving at a profit and loss figure on an historic basis. The Minister pointed out that in respect of one ship the basis on which depreciation has been calculated hitherto was on £650,000, whereas its replacement will cost between £1½ million and £2 million.  These are not realistic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The depreciation figures are based on the usual conventions for shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the conventions may be, the Minister will agree with me that if you proceed on the basis that your replacement cost is £600,000 when you know it to be somewhere between £1½ million and £2 million, then whatever convention demands, realism suggests that what appears to be a profit of £2,306 is in fact a very substantial annual loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that just prior to the announcement of this bargain, the B. &amp; I. made an announcement that they proposed to raise freight rates by 7½ per cent on all freight except livestock. The Minister would up his statement tonight by saying that there must be no question of a subsidy and that this line must be operated on an ordinary profit and loss basis.  I do not think that operating a State enterprise of this kind need necessarily <Col N="967" /> involve the earning of a profit but the price paid for it ought to permit of its earning at least a realistic depreciation on its assets and such sum as will at least pay the interest on the capital borrowed to effect the purchase.</P>
    <P>That is a very moderate standard.  It is unreasonable to ask a State corporation of this kind, operating an essential service such as a cross-Channel transport service, to pay not only the interest on the capital borrowed but to provide a sinking fund and depreciation fund at the same time. So far as I am concerned, if the line is in a position to obtain a realistic depreciation provision and pay the interest on the capital borrowed it will be doing what was required and what was essential for it to do, but if it does less, there is no use talking about not providing a subsidy because every year it makes a loss involves a subsidy from the Exchequer&mdash;if the line is not paying the interest on the capital invested in it, having made depreciation suitable for the replacement of the ships as that necessity may from time to time arise.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to emphasise to the Minister how vital it is that the cost of freight between here and Great Britain be kept at the minimum. The livestock industry is particularly susceptible to any serious alteration in the freight rates for livestock between here and Britain.  Of course, the same is true of all our industrial exports.  A great many people forget one of the very material and substantial handicaps under which our industrial exports operate.  If you are operating an export industry in a country like Great Britain which has immense shipping facilities of a regular scheduled type to all ports of the world, you can ship your goods to the appropriate port and thence they can proceed to almost any part of the world.  If you manufacture on the continent of Europe, you have at your disposal the same portal facilities as are available in Great Britain but you have the immense additional advantage, if you want to ship any parcel of goods, large or small to any place <Col N="968" /> between Calais and Vladivostok, that you only have to stop a train and attach a wagon to it and it threads its way over the rail systems that operate over the whole continent of Europe to its ultimate destination.  And that is not having regard at all to the vast waterways of Europe which provide the same kind of convenience in duplicate for those who are fortunate enough to have ready access to them.</P>
    <P>I often remember in my time as Minister for Agriculture one of our great difficulties, if we wanted to send livestock or a variety of other commodities abroad, was that it was not infrequently necessary to arrange our shipment on the basis of a chartered ship.  I remember when we used try to send seed potatoes to destinations on the Continent or in Africa, they had to be assembled in Derry or in County Donegal, and sometimes from more distant places, and the chartered ship would arrive on a particular day and the potatoes would be loaded aboard and sent to their ultimate destination. I also remember the extraordinary complications that attended the shipment of meat.  You had to charter a refrigerated ship in order to take meat from this country to a continental destination and not infrequently to get the ship was in itself a very formidable problem and almost always the chartered party had to provide not only for the ship proceeding to the destination whither you wished it to go but due allowance had to be made for it to return to whatever area it habitually traded in.  All these problems arise from our peculiar geographical position.  If we were in a position to say that every industrial producer could quote his goods for foreign markets at an f.o.b. price Liverpool the advantage to industrial exports from Ireland would be incalculable.</P>
    <P>So far as the livestock trade is concerned, that is fated to be mainly with Great Britain for forseeable time but it is a matter of immense importance to us that we have a rapid and satisfactory service to expedite the delivery of our livestock to the British market.  By and large, the character of the service <Col N="969" /> provided up to now by the steamship line has been reasonably satisfactory. It has not always been true that the subsequent transport available in Britain for our livestock has corresponded in quality with that made available by the shipping line.  I hope the company now being established will concern itself with the provision of transport and with seeing that a corresponding transport will be available at ports in Britain for our Irish livestock.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that a valuation has actually been made of the ships, and of the freehold and leasehold property of the company we now acquire.  There is not set out in the Minister's statement a schedule showing precisely what these assets are.  It would be of material interest to the House if the Minister could provide a schedule describing the assets we have acquired.  On the face of the Minister's statement, it does not appear, from the actual assets of the company or from its earning capacity, that the bargain we have made represents as many advantages as the Minister appears to think.  The company is losing money at a pretty substantial rate.  The ships have had a long life and some will soon fall due for replacement which will involve a substantial additional capital investment if we are to make the company viable.  Has the Minister any realistic hope or belief that this company will be able to pay its way without increasing freight rates to provide realistic depreciation on its assets?</P>
    <P>I do not think it unreasonable to remind the Minister of the innumerable occasions on which he assured us that they had fine schemes for the development of Córas Iompair Éireann on a strictly economic basis into a viable enterprise that would pay its way.  All these optimistic forecasts have fallen by the wayside and we are now told that an annual subsidy of £2 million is necessary to keep Córas Iompair Éireann in existence.  That experience imposes on this House the duty of seeking to extract from the Minister an honest estimate of what he contemplates the real experience of this company is going to be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> However, we recognise on this side of the House that the Minister's estimates of the profits of the company are such that an assessment of the possibility of the line being carried on for very long on that basis would have to be made.  They would scarcely continue to operate at a loss but it is recognised that if the ownership of the line is to change, it should change into Irish hands rather than into foreign control over which we here would have no control and which might involve us in a burden of freight rates which would be extremely inimical to the vital interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has sought to give us certain forecasts with regard to the assets of the company but I would be obliged if he could schedule these assets and let us know what they amount to.  It is not clear to me whether the B. &amp; I., as at present constituted, has any freehold or leasehold property in Britain or whether the port facilities belong to the parent company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are complex matters and it is not possible for me to give any informed forecast as to what the economic position of the company will be but it looks to me that if the Minister's estimate is correct, the last profit margin in 1963 was £2,600 and that it has since improved to £77,000 before taxation, but, on the basis of historic depreciation rather than replacement depreciation, we are buying a company which is losing money heavily annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we propose to meet the interest charges on £3,600,000 out of a company which is already losing money heavily without a subsidy is a complete mystery to me.  I am utterly at a <Col N="971" /> loss to understand how the Minister founded his peroration honestly on the facts he set out in his opening paragraphs. Before the debate concludes, he ought to tell us how he expects to meet the interest charges out of the profit and loss account of a company which, according to his own figures, has been losing a very large sum of money every year for the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this move.  It is one we have long considered desirable.  We have always believed that there should be at least part Irish control of the services we need between Great Britain and this country.  The Minister made a lengthy, detailed Second Reading speech and it is almost impossible for anyone to come to any hard and fast conclusion so quickly after such a long speech.  Indeed, we must take on trust what the Minister said because it is impossible to determine whether it is completely accurate.  I am sure it is as accurate as he could make it but it would take a good deal of time and consideration for us to make up our minds as to whether we have got half a bargain or no bargain at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the railways ceased to be profitable, those who were running them got rid of them, even though the needs of the country demanded the service.  The railways were still essential to the industrial and agricultural life of the country and we had no option but to take them over.  If the situation here is identical, then again we have no option.  In the national interest, we must take over the service. Our record in Irish Shipping&mdash;we had to go hastily into shipbuilding during the war years&mdash;has been a good one. We have held our own in competition and that should give us confidence in our ability to find the people necessary to service the ship or manage shipping in general.  I believe we can do the job as well as, if not better than, the B. &amp; I. did it.  Whether or not we will show a profit is another matter.  We will have to do the best we can.  There is plenty of scope, if not for reducing freight rates, certainly for improved services in relation to passengers.  As far as second-class <Col N="972" /> passengers are concerned, the situation has been lamentable.  I have said before in this House that cattle are transported under better conditions between Great Britain and Ireland than human beings are, particularly at peak periods.  With very little extra expense, we should be able to provide deck chairs at least during peak periods so that women and children will no longer be required to sit on the deck or on their personal luggage.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not advert to an increase in air freight between Great Britain and Ireland.  It is pretty clear that lack of passenger traffic has been one of the reasons for the failure of the B. &amp; I. service.  The Minister made no reference to air freight traffic or to how that traffic has affected the position or may affect it very seriously in the future.  It would be interesting to know if his Department have made any inquiries in that direction as a guide to them on this question of whether or not we are right to purchase, or whether, in fact, sea transport will decline to a point at which it would be absolutely necessary for us to secure some line to safeguard our national interests.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Labour Party welcome the Bill because we feel it is time we held these things in the hands of the Irish people to be utilised in the interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear we must have a good freight and passenger sea service between Great Britain and Ireland.  We know now that this company was running down.  It would be unwise of us to denigrate the company but we must be realistic in our approach to this matter.  The company was running down largely because of the greatly increased costs of shipbuilding. It was not possible to set aside reserves to ensure replacement. One may take it, I suppose, that the company were glad to sell; but, if they were glad to sell, there was a necessity for us to buy.  I am glad we bought this line because I believe this will give us an opportunity to bend this company to the good of the country and to the good of our exporters, both agricultural and industrial. <Col N="973" /> We now have an instrument we can bend to our will and that will is represented in the will of the people of Ireland and their good.</P>
      <P>I was rather disappointed by the Minister's statement that he must, quite frankly, dispose of any idea that the ownership of the B. &amp; I. will result in dramatic changes in the cross-Channel freight rate structure.  First of all, I think the House must agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says he will be quite satisfied if the service is bent to the good of the country.  That would certainly achieve the best result.  We must take it from the Minister's statement, however, that in the foreseeable future, there will be no dramatic changes.</P>
      <P>I should like a situation to develop in which certain traffic would be encouraged, traffic which might be uneconomic in the first six months but which would become economic, or almost economic, after a certain period, the whole purpose of the exercise being to expand our exports. I am visualising a situation in which vegetables grown in North Dublin and along the east coast would be transported to centres such as Lancashire and Northern England generally.  That would create a market for goods we can produce in great profusion.  Agricultural production represents 80 or 90 per cent of our net exports, calling for no imports in return other than perhaps fertilisers and such goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has been sweeping enough in his approach.  He should have been more sweeping.  He should have said he would invoke the co-operation of every Department of State so that every opportunity for placing our industrial and agricultural goods, particularly perishable agricultural goods, on the vast British market would be a primary consideration in the development of this company. There is necessity for change.  The difficulties the company has had to face show that there is necessity for change.  These people had a duty to their shareholders to produce the greatest net profit in any financial year. Towards that aim their efforts had, of necessity, to be bent.  It was not their <Col N="974" /> job to go out and try to create traffic, to think of industrial and agricultural expansion, to charge a rate for a particular li = "2" fli = "-1"service which they knew was too low but which they hoped would by volume pay for itself.</P>
    <P>If we examine what has happened over the past few financial years and look at it from the point of view of the Irish producer, we see there must be an opportunity for change.  I hope this opportunity will be taken by the Minister.  It is far too early for anybody to be hypercritical about it or to say in relation to the Minister's speech that he has not got this in mind.  I am sure he has and we wish him well. However, it is our job to remind him that these opportunities are there and that it is his duty to take full advantage of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne, on behalf of the Labour Party, has already welcomed this move to acquire the B. &amp; I. Company and I merely want to endorse what he said.  However, there are a few remarks I should like to make on the Bill and on the Minister's speech.  It is a good thing the B. &amp; I. is now in Irish hands. Deputy Dillon did not wax eloquent on it, but he reminded us that there were far too many foreigners buying land and public firms in this country. I trust this will be one of the first moves by the people of Ireland to begin to own a substantial portion of it again.  The Minister may have his difficulties, but I cannot see why this venture should not be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne referred to the awkward period during the war when, due to the initiative of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and some of his officials, and particularly other individuals engaged in the shipping industry, Irish Shipping was established.  The whole House will agree that has been a very successful venture. As far as I know, Irish Shipping can complete all over the world.  Of course, it has its peak and valley periods, but, by and large, we should all be extremely proud of Irish Shipping and of the people associated with them for the past 25 years. <Col N="975" /> There is one aspect of this matter about which I am somewhat concerned, but I trust the Minister will be able to allay the fears I have.  As the Second Reading speeches of Ministers are wont to do, the Minister's speech did not deal with the Bill in detail.  I do not think the section needs explanation, but, before I go on, I should like to know a little more about section 4, which reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister for Finance may hold for so long as he thinks fit the shares of the Company acquired by him under this Act and, after consultation with the Minister, may, as and when he thinks fit, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of such shares.</P>
    <P>(2)  The net proceeds of a sale by the Minister for Finance of shares of the Company shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There are many Acts of Parliament in respect of the establishment of the Irish Sugar Company, CIE, Bord na Móna and the 40 or 50 other semi-State companies we have.  Is there any similar section in any other Act of Parliament establishing a semi-State body?  I hope this is not the thin end of the wedge the Minister for Finance spoke about 12 months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This clause is put in in respect of Irish Shipping and Irish Steel, for example.  It is a conventional phrase and gives the Minister for Finance ultimate power of disposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives him ultimate power to put the B. &amp; I. on the public market.  Is that interpretation correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This says specifically that the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, may in another six months' or six years' time put the company on the Irish market and sell it again.  If that interpretation is <Col N="976" /> correct, I would be violently opposed to it.  The Minister for Finance indicated to the House that the Government were thinking in terms of putting on the public market shares of the other successful semi-State companies. That is not good enough.  We are taking over the B. &amp; I. at a time of adversity, at a time when it is assumed the profits will not be as high as they were in the past five or ten years; but if this company is to be a success in the future and make a profit, the State should hold on to it and any profit accruing should be for the benefit of the State.</P>

      <P>There is no intention to sell the company in a short time. This is a provision that apparently is generally inserted in this kind of Bill.

      <P>The fear the Labour Party have is that the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, could just dispose of this without any reference to the Dáil.  I do not say all our semi-State companies have been a success, but, by and large, they have been, <Col N="977" /> and we are all proud of them.  There should not be any clause by which the State could relinquish its interest in these companies without reference to the Dáil.  The Minister says there is no intention to do this, but so long as this is contained in an Act of Parliament, and particularly in view of the stated intentions of the Minister for Finance&mdash;which we presume are the intentions of the Government&mdash; there is a danger.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we should like to be assured on Committee Stage that the fears I have expressed are groundless.</P>
      <P>The Minister has appointed a number of directors.  Perhaps he would be able to tell us when he will appoint the remaining directors&mdash;I think there are three.  All the semi-State bodies in recent times have got Irish names&mdash; some of them unpronounceable, not alone for the Minister but for me as well.  I am wondering whether or not the new company will continue to be called the B. &amp; I. Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I think the Government are right to try to get into cross-Channel shipping.  Even though they have bought a company of which I shall have some criticism to make later on, at least we have got into the pool and will be in a position from now on to have some say in regard to freight charges.  Heretofore the position has been that, in proportion to other charges, cross-Channel rates have been the highest in the world.  I was told recently by an industrialist that he could ship a machine to the Far East at a rate only 20 per cent higher than the rate charged to take it to England.  Therefore, it is a sensible move the Government have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister's statement and he read it clearly and distinctly.  He always speaks distinctly, which is not the case with all Ministers.  He gave us a long statement pointing out the advantages and the assets we were taking over from the company but there is a tremendous amount of information missing.  We are told that we are getting three major ships, the <i>Munster</i>, <Col N="978" /> the <i>Leinster</i> and the <i>Innisfallen.</i> We are not told the age of these ships.  I take it that they were laid down some time about 1948.  We are told that a certain value was included for them in the assets of the company.  It must be borne in mind, when assessing the value of an asset, that maintenance often costs a great deal of money.  We have no information from the Minister as to whether or not these ships have had a recent refitting.  I suggest that if those three ships have to be refitted, that in itself will place a considerable burden on the new company.  These are matters on which the House will require information.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite frank in regard to the trading figures.  These figures are not completely divorced from the trading figures of the Coast Lines Company as a whole.  Of course, Coast Lines Company is an enormous shipping company.  The statistics that have been produced for us give the figures for the B. &amp; I. in association with the whole shipping company and it may very well be that Coast Lines may have been subsidising the B. &amp; I. Company.  We have no information on that point.  That may or may not be the case.  The Minister has stated that separate figures were not kept for the B. &amp; I. Company.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the purchase price is reasonable or not.  I am sure the Government struck as hard a bargain as possible but it is true to say that we are purchasing at a time when shipping companies find it almost impossible to make a profit.  It is possible that with the reorganisation necessary to meet the needs of this country, profits will show an increase.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous number of Irish emigrants working in the north of England.  In view of the fact that they have a five-day week, these people would like to return to Ireland for weekends to be with their families.  It would be necessary for them to make the return journey on Sunday night so as to be at work on Monday morning. The B. &amp; I. have never run a Sunday night service.  If the workers to whom I refer returned for the week-end, as we hope they will from now on, they would lose a day's work if they were <Col N="979" /> unable to return to England on the Sunday.  Cross-Channel traffic could be built up if facilities were made available for week-end travel, not only at peak seasons but throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The B. &amp; I. will now be a State company.  Deputy Corish had qualms that the Government might sell the company.  I hasten to reassure him. There is no chance of their selling this company for the money they paid for it.  I am not saying that they made a bad bargain.  I am saying that it is only the State that could afford to buy a losing concern.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in its present financial state, this company will have to be subsidised by the State.  Possibly, in time, profits may accrue.  I have already made one suggestion as to how passenger traffic might be developed and it is possible that the major part of our cargo shipping will be transferred as far as possible to an Irish shipping company.  Against that, it is quite possible that the Minister may find that he will have to come back to the House for the next few years for more money to keep this company going.  While saying that, I would reiterate that the Government have done the right thing, something which should have been done a long time ago.  For a long time I have had the view that we were completely at the mercy of those providing cross-Channel shipping and in view of the fact that so much of our trade&mdash;far too much, in my opinion&mdash;is with the United Kingdom, it was essential that we should acquire a shipping service.</P>
    <P>The B. &amp; I. will be a State-controlled company, even though a board of directors will be appointed.  Will we have, in this case, the same situation as we have in the case of other State companies, that if Deputies conceive it to be their duty to raise questions in the House if they consider that things are not being done as they should be done, they will be debarred from doing so?  In view of the heavy State investment of nearly £4 million, will we be in a position to ask questions here if we consider that things are not being done that should be done or that certain <Col N="980" /> transactions are being carried out? I should like the Minister to reply to that point and satisfy the qualms I have.  I wish the company luck.  As I have said, its purchase by the Government is something that should have been done years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I welcome this move on the part of the Government because it will provide an Irish-controlled cross-Channel service.  The speech the Minister made this evening was very limited. It did not give a very clear picture. The facts set out may be quite true but the statement is significant rather for its omissions than for the information it contains.  As Deputy Esmonde has said, no business concern would have purchased this service in the hope of making a profit from it but it was a good set-up and, from the national point of view, it seems to have been good business to purchase the B. &amp; I. Company, lock, stock and barrel, as has been done.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's statement that Coast Lines Ltd. was the fairy godmother of the B. &amp; I. Company and that it was on Coast Lines that the company relied for its continued existence.  So long as it had the support of Coast Lines Ltd., it had some prospect of continuing but without Coast Lines, Ltd., it cannot be operated as a profitable unit.  However, it has, in my view, a great potential. We have a considerable livestock export trade and we have not reached the stage when livestock will be transported by air and we must depend on ships for the transport of livestock. There may be a movement from the shipping of livestock to the shipping of carcase meat but then again it is the heavy type of commodity and it will probably be a better paying proposition to send it by ship rather than by air.  Therefore, if we set up this service for the transport of our livestock on an efficient basis, there is a lot in its favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our livestock traffic on this service is almost 50 per cent of the total livestock traffic from this country and it is possible with some adjustments <Col N="981" /> and some improvements in the service, that a higher percentage, or almost 100 per cent of the livestock traffic will be sent out by this new shipping service.  This essential cross-Channel service is unlike the trading service provided by Irish Shipping Ltd. which trades around the world from port to port and is not limited to service between this country and Great Britain as it appears this service will be.</P>
    <P>The purchase of this concern at a price of £3,600,000 means that it will be essentially a nationalised concern, that the State will have a big say in the financing of its operations.  I had hoped that when the Minister and the Government begin to get full control of this service and put it on an efficient basis, they will not allow it to get into the situation which CIE is in at the moment, coming to the taxpayers every year for approximately £2 million in order to keep it going.  When a service is nationalised, it means that a public service must be made available, whether it is profitable or not.  That is why CIE is losing.  It is compelled to provide services which are not paying their way in relation to those services which do.  We should try to avoid that if we can, because, if not, the taxpayers will be subscribing towards maintaining this cross-Channel service, in addition to CIE.</P>
    <P>There is a limit which could be applied in the form of freight rates.  If the freight rates rise beyond an economic level, then the exporters will probably find other ways of avoiding the heavy cost of these freight rates. Freight rates should be on a competitive basis, first of all, and, secondly, limited to the loading capacity of the existing fleet of ships.</P>
    <P>We have seen here that the profits of this concern dropped from £184,000 in 1952 to a mere £2,600 in 1963, a drop of over £180,000 in the space of 11 years.  For some reason not explained in this statement, there has been a rise in the profits between 1963 and 1964.  No doubt we shall be able to get that information from the Minister at a later stage, but if there is an upward trend now and things go back to the level of 1952 where there <Col N="982" /> was a profit of £184,000 on operations, that is very much in its favour.  On the other hand, if there was something unusual which caused the profits to rise from £2,600 up to £77,000 from 1963 to 1964, it should be made known.</P>
    <P>The ships we have taken over with this service, generally speaking, are not suitable for container traffic and it may be necessary to adapt them for that purpose, because that is the trend.  There is a movement more and more towards container traffic because of the efficient handling and loading, apart from other considerations arising in this connection.  Therefore, we must face the fact that if the existing ships are not suitable for container traffic, they should be adapted as far as possible so that it will be possible to deal with this traffic on an everexpanding basis.</P>
    <P>This purchase has been made in the face of the fact that there is a very big surplus of shipping tonnage in the world at present.  However, the advantage of having an Irish cross-Channel service is very important and it strengthens the case to be made in favour of its acquisition.</P>
    <P>I notice also that in the space of 11 years the net freight revenue fell from £547,000 to £396,000 in 1963. That again was a fall of approximately £150,000.  I have no doubt that the losses there could be shown in the increases in freight revenue from air traffic.  I think the trend in the future will be air transport of goods which are suitable for that type of transport. On the other hand, we cannot see that in the future air transport of heavy goods will be a profitable occupation and we must fall back on shipping for this purpose.  Air freight will be selective. Certain classes of goods will be suitable for air transport and others will not.  Our shipping service can take advantage of the type of goods which cannot be appropriately transported by air.  We must face the fact that if exporters find it economic to use air transport, they will switch over to it and move away from the shipping service.  The shipping service will find it necessary to be efficient and competitive and to be ready to <Col N="983" /> deal with the heavy goods traffic which will be offered to it instead.</P>
    <P>A very useful suggestion was made by Deputy Esmonde when he said that an attractive passenger service should now be made available.  I agree with him that if transport across the water were cheap, it would attract our Irish emigrants, approximately a million of them, to bring revenue to this country by coming in for a week-end or part of a week, now that they are working a five-day week in Britain.  Irish Shipping Limited is mainly a trading concern and would not be affected to any extent by the operation of this service.  It is strictly a cross-Channel service.</P>
    <P>As a nationalised service, the B. &amp; I. will be offered the non-profitable type of traffic, in addition to the type of traffic which will give a profit.  That aspect of it will make it difficult for the company to make ends meet.  On the other hand, the exporters themselves decide on the profitability of sending goods by air.  The selection in this regard is made by the exporters rather than by the people operating the air freight services.</P>
    <P>The Minister, while he has not got a modern outfit of modern ships, has at least got a viable set-up which it will be within his power, and the power of those appointed to the new board, to put on a profit-making basis.  There seems to be a large staff involved here &mdash;1,200 people, in addition to about 300 dockers.  That gives an idea of the magnitude of the service with which we now have to cope and it would be a good idea if the operating tactics and business methods used by Irish Shipping Limited were adopted by the new company.  Irish Shipping has proved itself to be a very efficient undertaking and if we could bring to the B. &amp; I. the tradition of Irish Shipping and its approach to the services provided, it would provide a good working basis.</P>
    <P>At the very outset consideration should be given to the provision of an extremely cheap passenger service.  In the past good travelling conditions for passengers were not available in these boats.  We ought now to be able to provide a good passenger service within the framework of this new company. <Col N="984" /> It is all very well to have passenger accommodation available in cattle boats but we should try to swing over to modern conditions and modern accommodation in certain of them and, on the other hand, to adapt the other boats so that they can deal with heavy goods traffic and livestock freight.  I welcome the Bill but I feel that the Minister's statement was brief in relation to the implications with which we will find ourselves faced when we come to consider the Bill at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good thing that we should get into the cross-Channel shipping business and this was the only way in which we could have done so. It was well known that we were anxious to get in and it was well known that this was the only course open to us.  Consequently we have got into it in the most expensive way. Deputy Rooney has referred to the fact that the ships are not particularly suitable for container traffic and the whole trend now is towards container traffic and that type of quickly transported traffic.  We probably have got ourselves a number of Model Ts but that was not avoidable and we will find ourselves in the near future confronted with heavy expenses in re-equipping these vessels or replacing them if we are to keep up with modern trends in the transport of goods, particularly perishable goods.</P>
      <P>The great advantage I see in this sphere is that it gives us complete control of the delivery of our goods to their final destinations.  We had considerable complaint in the past about delays and about our goods arriving in the British market not in the best condition. We have had endless complaints about the manner in which passengers have been treated and after all the criticisms we have levelled at the B. &amp; I. in the past, we have something to do now to show that an Irish-owned company can do much better. If we were prepared to criticise others, we should now be prepared to do something about it ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear more details regarding the agreement entered into with Coast Lines Limited.  I was not <Col N="985" /> able to follow the matter very clearly but I thought there was some clause which curtailed our activities or which curtailed the development of this shipping line.  I hope I am wrong in imagining that we are now not in a position to spend considerable sums in modernising this shipping service and bringing it up to a standard sufficiently high to enable it to compete with any other similar shipping line.  I should like to hear from the Minister that the terms of this agreement do not in any way curtail our efforts to enable this company to provide a modern and competitive shipping service.</P>

      <P>Apart from the unwarranted intervention by Deputy Coogan, I want to thank Deputies for the very kindly and warm welcome they have given this Bill.  Before I proceed any further, I should like to make it clear in case there is a wrong impression created in regard to the increase in cross-Channel freight rates that the company has announced limited increases.  In the case of the B. &amp; I., their port to port rates are being increased by 7½ per cent and their through rates by four per cent. This will not apply to cattle, motor cars or unit load container services. British Railways are also increasing through rates by four per cent but a decision has not been taken about port to port rates.  I understand that the other steamship companies are keeping more or less in line with what the B. &amp; I. have been doing.  I wanted to make quite sure that nobody will say that the B. &amp; I., which is not yet under the control of this country, are putting a straight across the board 7½ per cent increase on freight rates.  It would be unfair to them if that were not made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I want to deal with Deputy Dillon's observations.  I am glad he asked me these questions because I think I should elaborate further on what I have said already. Under present commercial practice, the extra depreciation required in order to meet current replacement costs has to be met with capital; in other words, <Col N="987" /> by the difference between historic depreciation and replacement costs.  The B. &amp; I. allowed for replacements at historic costs and that is the conventional pattern of accountancy for shipping companies as far as I know all over the world.  It would be unfortunate if it went out from this House that the B. &amp; I. has in fact been making a commercial loss in the ordinary sense of that term understood by rival shipping companies and by shipping companies of all kinds.  That is not to say that the B. &amp; I. will not have a problem in the future of providing the extra capital of replacement costs.  We must keep to some conventions in respect to accountancy in connection with shipping companies.  That still does not take away from the difficulty that when the B. &amp; I.'s new Board have examined the fleet, they will have to consider what modernising is required in what period and what capital will have to be raised somehow for the provision of any new ships or the improvement of existing ships.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked whether I could give the price of individual ships.  I do not think that would be wise because it would affect the future saleability of these assets if the Board decided to dispose of some and replace them, or even not replace them.  If I were pressed, I could give the total valuation of the fleet and the valuation of the remaining property but I would prefer not to.  All these matters relate to a company that has to operate commercially but if the Deputy wishes, I will send him details of the difference of the valuation of the ships and the valuation of the remaining property if he thinks it would be of use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Minister but information given confidentially is of no value to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  In regard to the price we have paid, I do not think we could do much better than to buy the B. &amp; I. for what is, in fact, reckoned by a very reputable firm of valuers as its break-up value.  Even with a company making heavy losses, <Col N="988" /> let alone a company merely earning low profits, we could hardly hope to purchase at less than the break-up value of the assets.  I think it can be said we made the very best bargain we could for a company that has had fluctuating fortunes and has recently been affected by the change-over to containerisation and palletisation and which had to adapt itself to new circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon posed a very interesting question.  He asked whether I was prepared to say that the B. &amp; I. would be able to earn the interest on the capital invested in it.  I really think I must depart from the precedents set by my distinguished predecessors, on both sides of the House, who have been prepared, in matters involving transport economics, to make very optimistic prophecies in regard to what a State company can do.  The Deputy referred to the optimistic predictions made in connection with CIE in 1944, again in 1950, again in 1955, and the reasonably optimistic predictions made in 1958, though the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time covered himself to a considerable degree.  I prefer to say that because of the revolutionary change that has taken place in the pattern of transport across the Channel and because B. &amp; I. have not undertaken the very elaborate inquiry into the whole operation of the company which will be carried out by the new directors, I would not like to make a prediction in regard to this.</P>
      <P>I have appointed directors.  I shall appoint three others, who are the very best I can find and I hope they will exercise the same initiative, the same understanding of their job as has been the case with Aer Lingus and Bord na Móna, and will examine all matters affecting the company to the utmost of their ability to see it through the changes taking place and evolve a freight rate system which is commercially viable and that as a result we will have a profitable company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot guarantee they will succeed. I simply say I wish them every luck. The pattern of cross-Channel transport is changing considerably, the methods by which goods are taken across the Channel will change through the use of container traffic and unit loads. <Col N="989" /> There are changes in the character of our cattle exports which I hope will improve as time goes on, if the present demand for beef continues.  It will be impossible to predict whether by a certain date the profits of this company will provide sufficient depreciation to buy new ships and a sufficient profit to discharge the sum the Minister for Finance will have to find in interest for the purchase of the shares.</P>
    <P>Maybe the B. &amp; I. will have better luck if I wish them luck and direct them to undertake in very great detail and with great assiduity all the obligations I outlined in paragraphs 1 to 7 of my statement.  That is a mountainous job for a new company.  I am not saying some of that work has not already been done by B. &amp; I.  Some of it, in relation to certain procedures, has been undertaken.  Now the company will be owned by the people of this country, it will have to consider exclusively Irish needs for imports and exports.  It will not be just one branch of a very large British company.  Some policy decisions of the new directorate will undoubtedly be different from those reached if the old board were in existence and, quite rightly, were working in the interests of a large company embracing a wide range of activities.  There should be changes to the advantage of importers and exporters and also to the advantage of the financial position of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that leave any meaning at all in the Minister's statement in the last page of his speech that there can be no talk of subsidies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how you use the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo;.  What I meant by &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; was that under the terms of our agreement with Coast Lines and as a member of OECD, we are absolutely prohibited from deliberately undercutting rates for the sake of assisting a particular export, knowing we would have no hope of paying depreciation or interest on capital. The shipping companies know what it means&mdash;that you can engage in package deals with individual companies for regular dispatch of guaranteed sets of commodities.  It means you could <Col N="990" /> make allowance for special situations that might arise in the case of a given export where the freight rate is of critical importance.  That is distinct from absolutely frank rate cutting.  I cannot go into it in any greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's observation is addressed more to OECD than to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply that we are members of the OECD and as such do not indulge in specific rate discrimination.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked for the age of the three large ships.  They were built in 1948.  He also asked about the relationship between the accountancy of the B. &amp; I. branch of Coast Lines and Coast Lines themselves.  We had a very expert accountant examine the position of B. &amp; I. and we have found no evidence that Coast Lines either subsidised or milked B. &amp; I.  The company operated on its own strict basis and Coast Lines neither milked away the profits nor did they subsidise the company.</P>
      <P>He also asked what would be the position in regard to questions asked on the general conduct of B. &amp; I.  It is quite obvious that I could not disclose in the House the rates offered by B. &amp; I. for any specific commodity because that could be of direct assistance to their many competitors on the route.</P>
      <P>I can give all the information possible to reflect the progress of the company and, on the occasion of the annual Estimate, I shall give as far as I can answers in a general way to questions which might be regarded marginally as concerning day to day administration which will help Deputies to understand the problems of the company.  I shall also take account of any complaints made to me and refer them to the company in the usual way.  This company, as I have said, is in heavy competition with other companies in the Channel and to have detailed discussion in the House, involving the giving of detailed information to members of the House, would obviously be most unwise.  The company must be left to run along strictly commercial lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> In further reply to Deputy Esmonde, the value of the ships took into account their age, their condition and the value they might be expected to fetch on the open market.  Therefore, the question of whether they had a major refit or otherwise at the time of purchase does not enter into the picture in the sense that it would be included in the valuation made by the valuers.  If a ship had been refitted and a sum of £37,000 or £40,000 had been spent, that would be taken into account in the prevailing market rate for the ship as calculated by the valuers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked about the clause in the Bill whereby the Minister for Finance can dispose of the shares as he thinks fit.  I agree with his views.  This is a conventional phrase being put into a number of Acts such as those governing Irish Shipping and Irish Steel Holdings and I agree it is inconceivable that the Minister for Finance could, in spite of what is in the Bill, sell the B. &amp; I. over the heads of the Oireachtas, without the consent of the Oireachtas.  It is a conventional section and I will ask the Minister for Finance whether, possibly on Committee Stage, we might have some amendment to indicate that in connection with the disposition of the shares the Dáil would naturally be given full information in regard to the matter.  I think the Minister for Finance the other day, if I remember rightly, said he would not make use of the Act which enables him to dispose of State companies without giving a full account to the Dáil, and I am sure that will equally apply in this case.  I shall inquire with regard to the position.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Corish, the remaining directors will be appointed after the enactment of this legislation. Three still remain to be appointed when this legislation is enacted. Deputy Corish also asked whether we intended to give an Irish name to the company.  That might be considered later on but, for the moment at least, because the B. &amp; I. is so widely known, it would be a disadvantage, I <Col N="992" /> think, to make use of the change of ownership in order to change its name. That is a matter that would more properly arise later on for consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan raised the question of whether the new B. &amp; I. could engage in what might be termed speculative low rates for certain classes of goods in the hope that their production might increase.  It would be very difficult to answer that question.  The Irish company would, I think, be entitled to examine the position in regard to any commodity in which there was quite clear evidence that a very high rate was curtailing its export; if they genuinely felt they could get a very good package deal, which would call for a lower rate and result in further development of the product and, therefore, increased exports, they might be entitled to consider that.  I must, however, make it quite clear at the same time that they cannot deliberately cut rates and lose money on specific transactions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan also asked whether the various State organisations can help the B. &amp; I.  The answer is, of course, that the B. &amp; I. has got to make its own evaluation of its position, as I have already indicated, but the exporters of this country can discuss problems with the B. &amp; I., if they so wish, all sorts of measures designed to enable them to transport their goods at a lower cost because the company are making use of new procedures in regard to containerisation and palletisation in relation to the volume of a consignment sent at a particular time and that, no doubt, will aid the B. &amp; I. because very often what is cheaper for the exporter will also be more economic for the B. &amp; I.  It all relates, as I have said, to the marshalling of the goods and the size of the consignments, the method of packing, the carriage of unit loads and so forth. Changes in procedure are possible as a result of collaboration between the B. &amp; I. and the exporters of this country. Córas Tráchtála is, of course, always available to give such advice as it can on this matter.  Advice is also given by Shipping Services Ltd., which <Col N="993" /> is an ancillary body to Córas Tráchtála and which has offices in Liverpool and helps some 150 shippers here to obtain the best possible rates.  There are a number of institutions all engaged in this technical examination at present in relation to the dispatch of goods.  I hope, as a result of the B. &amp; I. becoming an Irish company, all these organisations or institutions will spring into even greater activity, now that they know there is this new company which will devote its activities to providing the very best possible service for Irish exporters and Irish importers and which already has a huge proportion of the total trade and should, therefore, be able to make even greater progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney asked whether the B. &amp; I. had adapted the fleet to containerisation. The answer is that the <i>Meath</i> was built with a view to taking both cattle and containers.  Some other ships have been adapted for this purpose and the question of further adaptation will arise for the new board to consider.  The B. &amp; I. carry containers to Manchester and Liverpool.  Deputy Rooney also asked about air freight. That is expanding very rapidly but it is still a very insignificant proportion of the total weight of goods coming from and going to Great Britain.  So far as passengers are concerned, I think the air companies, BEA, Aer Lingus and the others, carry something between 35 and 40 per cent of the total passengers across the Irish Sea.  There is ho and growing competition and the B. &amp; I. will have to look to its laurels and see what can be done in the way of modernisation.  Deputy Rooney suggested, too, that there should be a cut in fares in the second class to encourage more of our people who work in England to come back here on holidays. The position is that cross-Channel vessels are absolutely packed to capacity during the time at which most people like to take their holidays. There would be no point in reducing fares during that period but it would be up to the B. &amp; I. to consider what they could do to encourage people, by making such changes in the fares as as they think worthwhile, to travel mid-week and in the periods of low <Col N="994" /> pressure.  They can undertake experiments to see if a reduction in fares would encourage people to travel not on Fridays and Saturdays to the country and Mondays and Tuesdays from the country.  That has been the pattern in regard to people taking holidays here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton had some sharp criticism to offer of the conditions under which cattle travel on the B. &amp; I. boats.  I do not know whether he was really referring to conditions on the boat or elsewhere, but I must say I have not had much complaint, as Minister for Transport, in regard to the conditions under which cattle have been transported by the B. &amp; I. and I was glad to learn that Deputy Dillon had not heard any such criticisms either.  I hope the conditions can be improved and further modernised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton asked about the agreements made with Coast Lines in relation to their agency for the B. &amp; I. in Liverpool and so forth.  I must make it clear these agreements are absolutely private.  Coast Lines insisted on that.  I am satisfied the agreements are good ones.  There are satisfactory arrangements for revision of the agreements.  There are arrangements for arbitration in certain cases. But these are private agreements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton asked also about our competing with Coast Lines.  I made it perfectly clear in my speech that we would continue to operate the B. &amp; I. on strictly commercial lines.  That means we will not deliberately cut rates in a way that could not be regarded as on a commercial basis. We have also agreed we cannot compete with Coast Lines on the routes on which they run ships at the moment. That was another part of the agreement. As Deputy Clinton knows, however, the B. &amp; I. has a number of different services.  It has a number of different ports to which the ships travel and it certainly offers plenty of scope for developing trade, certainly plenty of scope if the services can be modernised and attuned to Irish needs for the purpose of assisting exports and also developing the economy of the company itself. <Col N="995" /> I have, I think, answered all the questions that were asked.  Once more, I thank the House for the welcome Deputies have extended to the decision of the Government to purchase the B. &amp; I.</P>
