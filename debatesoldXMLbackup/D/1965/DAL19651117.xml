      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the receipts from visitors to the State, which are entered in the Balance of Payments statement.  The method used to estimate these receipts and the corresponding expenditure outside the country by Irish residents was described in the article &ldquo;Numbers and Expenditure of Visitors to Ireland and Irish Visitors Abroad&mdash;Methods of Estimation used in the Annual Enquiries&rdquo;, published in the December, 1959, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin,</i> to which I would refer the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>We regret that the recent declaration of independence in Rhodesia should be a device for the perpetuation of minority rule, and we have expressed the hope that the pressure of world opinion will compel those who at present exercise power in that territory to accept the justice and inevitability of majority rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are naturally mindful of the position of Irish citizens in <Col N="1799" /> Southern Rhodesia at the present time. The only general advice the Government could give them at the present time is that they should refrain in so far as may be possible from taking any action which would help to promote any unlawful objectives of the present regime in the territory.</P>
    <P>There have been no reports so far of any of our citizens experiencing difficulties as a result of recent developments and no special measures of protection have been requested or seem at this stage to be necessary.  The Government are, however, giving close attention to events in Southern Rhodesia with a view to determining if any measures may become necessary as the situation develops.</P>
    <P>I might add that, in order to expedite the handling of applications from Irish citizens in Southern Rhodesia for the issue or renewal of passports, special instructions have been issued to the Honorary Consul in Johannesburg, who is the Irish representative located nearest to Southern Rhodesia.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not made representations to the authorities in Southern Rhodesia.</P>
      <P>As regards the final part of the question, the Irish delegation to the Twentieth Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations voted for two Resolutions adopted on 12th October and 11th November, 1965, respectively, both of which condemned a unilateral declaration of independence by the Southern Rhodesian authorities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what functions Bord Fáilte have in relation to ensuring the retention of the scenic beauty of any area before permission for the establishment of a factory is given, where such development can possibly do harm to the tourist industry as in the establishment of a fertiliser factory on the Shelton Estate, Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 (Permission) Regulations, 1964, a planning authority is required to give notice to Bord Fáilte where it appears that development is proposed in an area of special amenity or would obstruct any view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest, or would detract from the value of any tourist amenity works or from any feature of particular interest. It is open to Bord Fáilte to make representations to the planning authority on any proposal and the Board may appeal to the Minister for Local Government against the decision of the planning authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time said he had received no representations from Bord Fáilte against the establishment of the factory.  There was some confusion.  Bord Fáilte claimed they had not in fact a specific scheme before them.  In any event, no representations had been received.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it far more important to look forward to the future and to get what help we can from the National Institute for Physical Planning established by the Minister for Local Government, which is initiating surveys of a regional character into the preservation of tourist amenities.  Under the new Planning Act, it should be possible to devise general principles which will apply everywhere.  It is much better to look forward to the future in regard to that than look back to something which, in any event, was done when the planning legislation was inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of allottees is a matter that is exclusively reserved to the Commissioners.  I gather, however, that Mr. James P. O'Reilly has been taking substantial areas of land for grazing, etc.&mdash;mostly on the McGarry estate, which is now in possession of the Land Commission. Mr. O'Reilly has no land of his own and having regard to the overall number of already existing small farms in need of enlargement, the land is not available to set up new farms for applicants in Mr. O'Reilly's circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that people who, by no stretch of the imagination, would be entitled to land were, in fact, given land by the Land Commission over the last few years?  That type of case has occurred again and again. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary should recommend to the Land Commission that they should have a bit of sense and the people who work on the land should be entitled to holdings when land is being divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that what the Deputy has just stated is the fact, but surely the Deputy does not suggest that the claims of very small farmers, who are trying to rear families on uneconomic holdings, and who can neither buy land nor rent land, should be excluded to accommodate those who are obviously in such a big way of business as this gentleman appears to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates that this man has been put out of business because of the activities of the Land Commission.  Does he not agree that, since the Land Commission have taken over all the lands that this man was in the habit of renting, he will now have to emigrate unless the Land Commission make some provision for him?  Is not that clear?</P>

A fuller discussion on this matter, remembering that the individual in question is identified, would entail discussing the private affairs of an individual and I do not think I should go any further in my reply.</P>

The results of these investigations were made available generally through the CIO reports.</P>
      <P>Through its overseas offices, through its schemes of export market research grants and through its publications Córas Tráchtála is continuing to provide Irish exporters with a full market intelligence service.  If there are any additional services which the Deputy thinks should be provided, I should be glad to pass on his suggestions to Córas Tráchtála.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Fair Trade Commission have under consideration at the present time representations made by RGDATA and by a number of other trade organisations in regard to various matters relating to the grocery trade.  An examination of these questions has involved a review of the Restrictive Trade Practices (Groceries) Order, 1956 and the Restrictive Trade Practices (Groceries) Order, 1956 (Amendment) Order, 1958, and has necessitated detailed discussions with the different sectors of the trade.  I am informed that the Commission hope to complete their review of the grocery trade in the near future.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question there is no evidence before me to show that the spread of supermarkets has given rise to monopolistic conditions in the distributive trade or that any situation exists in this connection which calls for action by me.</P>

      <P>If cattle production were restricted, there would, I suppose, be some conflict of interest between the store trade, on the one hand, and the dead meat trade, on the other, in so far as both trades would be competing for limited supply, but the whole purpose of our livestock policy at the moment is to increase cattle production so that sufficient supplies will be available to meet the demands of both the store trade and the dead meat trade.  This policy is proving very successful.  The total numbers of cattle have increased substantially.  As a matter of fact, in so far as the two trades are concerned, the recent picture is that exports of stores have declined somewhat this year as against last year, whereas slaughterings in meat factories are increasing fairly satisfactorily.</P>

The survey carried out by the vocational committee is a survey of requirements for vocational education in County Dublin. The survey being carried out by the Department of Education is a survey of requirements of post-primary education in the whole country, and as far as County Dublin is concerned, it relates to post-primary education, which brings in factors other than those taken in by the survey of the committee of which Deputy Clinton is a member.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will have learned with deep regret of the sudden death of Mr. William T. Cosgrave.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.  The Deputies will not need to be reminded of the prominent part played by the late Mr. Cosgrave in national affairs from his earliest days&mdash;as a member of Dublin Corporation, a founder member of the Irish Volunteers and a participant in the Rising of Easter Week.  Elected a member of the first Dáil, he was placed in charge of the Dáil Department of Local Government, which he organised to such good effect that local affairs were soon controlled almost entirely by the Government of the Republic.  In 1922 he was called on to assume the leadership of the Government and held that office for ten years.  In subsequent years, <Col N="1839" /> until he relinquished the leadership of his Party in 1944, he played a prominent and distinguished role in the affairs of the Dáil and of the country.</P>
      <P>I have thought it fitting, on this occasion, a Cheann Comhairle, to depart from Parliamentary precedent in order to give the Dáil an opportunity of marking appreciation of the work and influence of the late Mr. Cosgrave in the history of the State. For, although William T. Cosgrave has left us, the work he has done for Ireland endures.  The generosity of his youthful response to the call to serve Ireland, the privations and the sacrifices which he endured so that national freedom might be ours, the capacity he displayed in presiding over the administration while responsibility was his, the grace with which he handed over responsibility when the people so willed, the dignity with which he carried out his duties as Leader of the Opposition and later as a private member of this House, the generosity of spirit with which he lent his hand to the defence of the State in a time of national danger, the readiness with which, even in retirement from active public life, he gave of his counsel in the sphere of national development which was dear to him, and finally, the exemplary character of his long life, these are the elements of a legacy which we in Ireland, and indeed people who value freedom and democracy everywhere, will forever cherish.</P>
      <P>I would ask you, Sir, to convey to his son, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, and to the other members of his family, the very sincere sympathy of the Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, to the Taoiseach and to the members of the Dáil for giving me this opportunity of paying my tribute, however inadequate it may be, to Mr. William Cosgrave.  I appreciate more than anything else that it has become my privilege to pay that inadequate tribute in Dáil Éireann because to Mr. William Cosgrave more than any other person is due the fact that we are here today in the Dáil.  He was a <Col N="1840" /> great parliamentarian.  Many parliamentarians have come since to the Dáil but he was the first and, in my view, the greatest.  It was through his efforts, through his sacrifice, through his courage, tact and determination, that this Dáil and the Parliament of this State were laid on firm and unassailable foundations.</P>
      <P>It would be proper certainly that I should, without reference to or in any way hinting at the stormy and difficult times he went through from 1922 to 1932, dwell for a moment on the help he got, the invaluable help without which his own work would have been unavailing, from the late Mr. Tom Johnson, the Leader of the Labour Party.  Between them, in the difficult conditions then existing&mdash;with Mr. Johnson as Leader of the Opposition at that time&mdash;and the work they did together here in full co-operation, they laid the foundations of this Dáil and Parliament of this State strongly and very firmly indeed.  Without that co-operation, it is very doubtful if we would be here today.  They were matters all associated with the leadership and the headlines set by the late Mr. Cosgrave, and with the assistance of other persons, some of whom are still with us, the traditions of this Dáil were laid and have since been maintained and are still being maintained today.  For that reason, in the very few words I have time to say in tribute to his memory, I should like to point to that, his principal achievement, his main contribution to his country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the years, when difficult decisions had to be made, he made them with determination, with calmness and always without bitterness, and in those difficult days, during the time when he had very many strange and difficult tasks to fulfil, he did them from the faith that was in him and from the belief that he had in this country&mdash;that this country would emerge as it has, triumphant, able to take its place, as it has, with its head high among the nations of the world. Through those years it was my privilege to be closely associated with him in practically all his activities.  I was his adviser and, as I said in a statement <Col N="1841" /> to the Press last night, his colleague, but above all, what I regard as most valuable from my point of view, I was his friend, and I can therefore pay tribute and give testimony today&mdash;perhaps it is not needed&mdash;to any of his colleagues still here but also to the younger people who perhaps do not know and will not know for some time until the records of his achievements are available.</P>
    <P>He led successive Governments of this State during a very stormy period; he had to command a group of people, to keep them together in a manner that has never been surpassed and perhaps never will be surpassed.  He led that team of strong personalities. You can imagine what it is to have a driver driving a team of high-spirited horses.  He led that team with determination along the paths that have brought us to our present position. Among other things, he laid down the most valuable national basis, the conditions of parliamentary institutions. He founded the Civil Service, the judiciary, the rule of law in this country, and in all that time there was nobody you could meet anywhere who was so simple, so sincere, so completely oblivious and forgetful of and not caring about his own political future and advancement.  He was ready to give up his life in the times before the Treaty&mdash;the 1916 period. That was courage of a high order.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in his subsequent career as Leader of the Government and later in Opposition, he had to take decisions which required far more courage, physical and moral, than are required to lay down one's life for one's country. It would be impossible for me to say all I should like to say to put on the records of this House what I know to be his achievements, but I think it will be recognised throughout the country in the years to come that here was a simple man, a man who did not want Government, who did not want political advancement but felt the call of duty and accepted it at whatever risk to his political life or to his own fortunes was involved in it.</P>
    <P>This tribute can only be very inadequate.  The late Mr. Cosgrave did many things for this country which I <Col N="1842" /> believe will be recognised in the years to come and more and more appreciated as the bitterness and the feelings of the past go into much wished for oblivion.  He wanted all past bitterness wiped out.  He wanted the people to work for Ireland and in the cause of Ireland and he gave them great example in his own life and achievements.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party and on my own behalf, I wish to be associated with the tributes paid to the late William T. Cosgrave, former President of the Executive Council, and to express our deep sympathy with Deputy Liam Cosgrave and with the other members of the family on their sad loss.  I had not the pleasure and experience of membership in Dáil Éireann with the late Mr. Cosgrave but, as one of a younger generation, recognised him for his courage and nobility of character&mdash; a man devoted to the freedom and building of our nation.</P>
      <P>He presided over our affairs at a time of great national stress and though he had constantly to take responsibility for serious and unpopular decisions, he made neither political nor personal enemies.  This is perhaps the greatest tribute to his great integrity and his strength of character.  During a difficult period in our recent history, he laid the foundations of many of our national institutions while at the same time he lifted the country's prestige so high that Ireland won international recognition and respect in a short time.</P>
      <P>As a young man, he served unselfishly in the fight that was to secure our independence and in subsequent years he strove to ensure that the nation would grow and prosper. On his death, we remember him and all those brave men who sacrificed much in order that Ireland might take her place among the nations of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The losses sustained annually by Irish farmers through diseases and pests in their herds and flocks, whether from deaths, reductions in milk yields and condition, poor food conversion rates and so on, are almost certainly not less than £25 million.  This is equivalent to £100 a year for every farmer in the country.  In addition, the existence of certain animal diseases can be a barrier to international trade in livestock and livestock products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in this context that the campaign for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, which has now reached a successful conclusion, was launched 11 years ago and that last year a comprehensive programme for the eradication and control of such further diseases and conditions as brucellosis in cattle, sheep scab, warble fly infestation, liver fluke, mastitis, etc., was set forth as a major objective of veterinary policy in the Brown Book dealing with <Col N="1844" /> Agriculture in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of this Bill is to provide a suitable up-to-date statutory basis for this programme. The Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, which has been the basic enactment governing the control of animal disease in this country was an excellent measure, and by and large, it stood the test of time very well.  Amendments of the Act were, however, necessary over the years and many sections have been repealed, altered, become obsolete or are inapplicable to our circumstances here.  The Act is also in a number of respects rigid and inflexible and, as can be understood, does not give suitable powers for the control and treatment of diseases that were not of public concern when it became law. The Act applied also to Britain and Northern Ireland, but in both these areas, it has been repealed and replaced by consolidated legislation; in Britain by an Act of 1950 and in Northern Ireland by an Act of 1958.</P>
    <P>Including the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, there are at present 15 separate enactments dealing with animal health and disease.  Several of these measures amend previous legislation and it is becoming increasingly difficult to ascertain readily the precise legal position when the many animal disease problems confronting my Department and the general public come to be considered.  In my view, the time has come for this corpus of legislation to be consolidated in a single Act and this among other things, the Bill at present before the House seeks to do.</P>
    <P>In consolidating the existing legislation, many of the excellent provisions of the earlier enactments have been retained as, indeed, they have also been in the consolidating legislation passed in Britain and Northern Ireland. Deputies will note that it is proposed to repeal the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Tuberculosis) Act, 1957, which was the statutory basis for the campaign for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  All the provisions of this Act have been incorporated in the present measure which also includes certain useful provisions of the consolidated <Col N="1845" /> legislation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, however, to go much further than a mere consolidation of existing legislation.  It is designed to provide not only for the specific diseases and conditions I mentioned earlier, whose control or eradication is the immediate objective of veterinary policy, but also, so far as can be foreseen, for future developments in the veterinary field.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies gives particulars of the new provisions and except for the more important proposals, I do not intend to go into them in very great detail.  I should like, in particular, to refer to the list of animals and diseases to which the Bill applies as indicated in the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>In the Diseases of Animals Acts applicable to this country up to 1957, specific provision for slaughter and compensation in the case of epizootic diseases was mode for each particular disease and in the 1957 Bovine Tuberculosis Act, the treatment of affected animals and the conditions under which they could be taken up under compensation were spelled out in detail in the statute.  The Consolidated Acts of 1950 and 1958 in Britain and Northern Ireland, adopted the same practice.  Both of these enactments contain detailed provisions dealing with the different diseases separately.</P>
    <P>A simpler and more straightforward method is adopted in the present Bill. Parts 1 and 11 of the First Schedule contain a list of 25 different species of animals and poultry to which the Bill may be applied and Part 111 is divided into two classes, one, Class A, indicating 11 epizootic diseases to which compulsory slaughter and compensation provisions may be applied, and the other, Class B, listing four enzootic diseases, for which this method of treatment would not be suitable. Any other animal or bird or any other diseases may be added to the Schedule by Statutory Order and, indeed, any particular disease scheduled under Class A may, should the need arise, be removed from that class and scheduled under Class B and <i>vice versa.</i> The eradication measures set out in section <Col N="1846" /> 19 and the following sections, may, as in the case, for instance, of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, be applied to Class B diseases, but this does not mean that these measures will be automatically applied to all diseases scheduled under this class.  The Second Schedule to the Bill contains very wide powers under which Orders may be made applying specific provisions to particular diseases.  The eradication provisions relating to Class B diseases will be applied only if, having regard to the characteristics of the particular disease and other relevant considerations, such a course of action would be advisable.  The effect of these provisions is that virtually all diseases and adverse conditions that can at present be foreseen, may be expeditiously dealt with by means of an appropriate Statutory Order.</P>
    <P>Statutory Orders under the Act are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as they are made and they may be annulled if either House so wishes.  Deputies will appreciate that outbreaks of animal and poultry disease may occur without prior warning and, notwithstanding the utmost vigilance, freedom from diseases and conditions hitherto unknown cannot be guaranteed.  It is, therefore, essential that machinery should be at all times available to provide adequate powers to deal with any such emergency with the least possible delay.  This is the main reason why, throughout the Bill, as indeed in the 1894 Act also it is proposed to take power to prescribe by Statutory Order for conditions that members of the House might otherwise consider could more appropriately be covered by legislation.</P>
    <P>Because of the necessity to provide for a wide variety of animals and birds and for several diseases, it seems to me advisable that the compensation provisions, both for animals slaughtered and animals taken possession of by the Minister, should be covered by Statutory Order and not, as hitherto, by express provision of the statute.  Deputies will note, however, that, whereas under the Acts of 1894 and 1957 the Minister was empowered to withhold compensation either in <Col N="1847" /> whole or in part when in his judgment the person concerned was guilty of an offence under the Act, or did not take adequate precautions to prevent the spread of disease, section 58 provides that, while a person may be disentitled to compensation where he is convicted of an offence under the Act and payment of compensation may be deferred if a prosecution is pending, where these circumstances do not obtain the amount of compensation may be settled by agreement between the claimaint and the Minister and, in the event of failure to agree, the dispute may be referred to arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Bill contains a number of important extensions of the Minister's general powers to make Orders for the prevention or checking of animal or poultry disease. The Schedule repeats the corresponding provisions of section 22 of the 1894 Act and certain powers included in the 1957 Bovine Tuberculosis Act.  When this Bill becomes law, these powers may, as appropriate, be extended to all animals and poultry and to all diseases.  It is proposed also to take additional powers for several other purposes.  It may, for instance, be necessary or advisable in the future to make the use of a particular remedy for a disease compulsory&mdash;the treatment of cattle for warbles comes to mind in this context&mdash;and power is being sought accordingly; with a view to the possible future introduction of a scheme to control liver fluke, it is proposed that the treatment of land, ponds, streams and watercourses may be compulsorily regulated and, with brucellosis in mind, it is proposed to seek power to control the taking of samples, the making of tests and the application of any treatment and the use of sera and vaccines.  I think I should make it clear at this stage that with the exception of the measures necessary for the operation of a scheme to eradicate brucellosis, no concrete proposals of the kind I have just mentioned have as yet been formulated. The powers in question are included in the Bill to meet possible future contingencies.</P>
    <P>The revised controls on the importation <Col N="1848" /> of animals and birds appearing in section 30 simplify the procedures laid down in the 1894 Act and the legal position regarding importation under licence is being clarified.  Provision is made in section 33 for the appropriate treatment of animals, birds and other things illegally imported and in sections 29 and 30 the provisions of the 1894 Act in relation to ships and ports are extended to aircraft and aerodromes.</P>
    <P>An important recent development is the establishment of our own quarantine station at Spike Island which enables us to import high class breeding stock in pursuance of our programme of live stock improvement. Provision for the exercise of control over the quarantine arrangements is contained in section 31.</P>
    <P>I have thought it advisable to make a relatively minor alteration in the provisions relating to penalties for offences.  The present penalty of a fine not exceeding £100 is being retained, but for the more serious offences set out in section 49, it is proposed that the court may at its discretion impose as an alternative a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding two months. The offences set out in section 48 will also be punishable by fine not exceeding £100, unless the offence is repeated within 12 months, when a term of imprisonment not exceeding one month may be imposed in lieu of the fine.  The 1894 Act also provided for a prison sentence as an alternative to a fine in certain cases, but this was repealed in an amending Act of 1945.</P>
    <P>The powers and functions of local authorities as indicated in sections 36 to 41 correspond with the existing provisions of the 1894 Act, except that the powers and functions of these bodies and their officers may be curtailed to such extent as may be specified in the disease control order concerned.</P>
    <P>Included in Part IV of the Bill are two items which I regard as being of special importance.  The first of these, section 54, deals with the dehorning of cattle and will enable us to bring in controls at the same time as similar controls are imposed in Northern Ireland.  Agreement in principle has <Col N="1849" /> already been reached with the Northern authorities in this matter.  Adequate notice of the introduction of these controls will be given to producers.  The second item to which I refer, section 55, is intended to enable a distinctive colouring agent to be incorporated in sheep dips.  This should be read in the context of the current campaign for the eradication of sheep scab.  The certification of sheep dippings has always been somewhat of a problem and the incorporation of a suitable dye, which is at present being developed by the staff of my Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory, would enable dipped sheep to be easily distinguished from undipped animals. To proceed with this proposal, it is necessary to remove from the Clean Wool Act, 1947, a provision which prohibits the incorporation of colouring matter in sheep dips.  The experiments being carried out on the development of a dye for incorporation in sheep dips have reached a promising stage, but I can assure Deputies that its inclusion in dips will not be permitted if there is any danger that the quality or market price of wool might thereby be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, a Cheann Comhairle, that the measure before the House is essential to the successful implementation of the important veterinary programme at present under way in my Department.  It will contribute substantially towards our objective of achieving the highest possible standards in the health and wellbeing of our livestock, with all the immense benefits that will undoubtedly ensue not only to our farmers but also to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us will agree with the Minister when he says that we must tackle agricultural production not only from the point of view of the price for production but also from the point of view of eliminating and reducing so far as we possibly can the incidence of loss from disease.  The manner in which that has been tackled in the past deserves commendation.  It is time, indeed, that the old Acts relative to diseases of animals were <Col N="1850" /> consolidated and brought up to date. This might be described as the first function of this Bill.</P>
      <P>When one accepts that it is time to bring any body of Acts up to date in a consolidating measure, the first thing to be decided then is whether to retain the existing scheme under which the matter was dealt with or to launch out into a new scheme.  In the ordinary way, all my instincts would be against the substitution of Ministerial or Government orders for a definition in the statute itself.  In this case, however, we must look at the reality of the situation.  One of the things which we must bear in mind all the time is that veterinary medicine is changing and improving year by year, and almost month by month.  The knowledge that is being acquired in that way and that is available to us in 1965 may quite well be out of date by 1966 or 1967.  In addition, the advantages of research both in the field of veterinary medicine and preventive medicine are such that we would be foolish if we were to put ourselves in a straitjacket and prevent ourselves from taking the fullest advantage of progress in that respect.  I agree with the Minister that the only way in which one can take the fullest advantage of that progress on both sides is by dealing with the matter by Statutory Order as provided in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the orders are required to be laid before the House. There is a convention which existed no matter what Party were in Government that when anyone puts down a motion for the annulment of a Statutory Order, that motion takes precedence in Government time over virtually any other business.  So long as that convention is adhered to, I think we need have no doubt there will not be in this case any usurpation of what might otherwise be the rights of individuals.  Therefore, we are satisfied with what might be described as the scheme or the method of the Bill in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If circumstances were otherwise, I might have taken advantage of this opportunity to deal with certain matters that could arise on the Second <Col N="1851" /> Reading of this Bill, but we will have an opportunity of dealing with them on Committee Stage.  The reference made by the Minister to the quarantine station at Spike Island might perhaps have given me that opportunity. However, I do not propose to do so on this occasion.  There will be plenty of other occasions.</P>
    <P>When we accept that the scheme is to be dealt with by order, and when we accept that segregation in certain cases is desirable, I think we would all be of the opinion that the Bill is more a matter for consideration on Committee Stage than on Second Reading. However, I want to make this observation in a general way.  The Minister referred to his warble fly order and scheme and, of course, this is referred to both in the Bill itself and in the explanatory memorandum.  I do not think the approach the Minister has adopted to the elimination of the warble fly will be successful.  I do not think it is the right approach.  It seems to me that next year the percentage of cattle&mdash;be it ten, 15 or 20&mdash;which have not been brought out for sale will still be there as a problem, and we will be in the position of having to ensure compulsorily that the beasts which complied will be brought in again as part of a compulsory scheme next year. Otherwise, I fear we will not be able to get complete eradication in such a way that it will not arise again.  However, that is a matter we will have an opportunity of discussing later.</P>
    <P>I should like to confirm that the provisions in relation to section 50 of an appeal at hearing going on mean that points of law arising under the orders or in relation to the administration of the orders can, as is normal in other cases, be carried further to the circuit court.  It would be desirable, also, if the Minister would ensure that there is some easy identification of the inspector for the purpose of administration of section 42.  The position in relation to the powers of members of the Garda Síochána is clear by reason of the fact that the member of the Garda will be in uniform or, if not in uniform, there is certain defined procedure by which he is bound to identify <Col N="1852" /> himself.  I am not clear that this section provides sufficient safeguard by which a person on whose land the inspector goes can demand to see the certificate of such inspector.  I am aware that there is provision in subsection (5) by virtue of which he must set out his reasons but I do not think there is anything here, that I can find at any rate, to require that there should be a similar identification card which a member of the Garda Síochána in plain clothes carries and produces on demand, and is bound so to produce.  I refer both to the inspector of the local authority and to the inspector for the Minister in respect of which powers are given under subsection (7) of section 42.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the function and duty of a Minister when introducing a Bill in this House to ensure, either by means of its explanatory memorandum or by means of his speech, that it is fully, completely and adequately understood by all Members.  I would like to assert categorically that of the Members in this House at the moment, very few, if any, could say what all the provisions in the First Schedule apply to.  We might have had from the Minister a dissertation on some of the animals listed there and I am sure he would have liked the opportunity of explaining what an agoutis, or a capybara is, and even mustelidae.  It should not be left to the individual Deputies to get at the niceties in relation to the class of animal there. Particularly by investigation in gazetteers, and otherwise, it is sometimes impossible to discover some of them.  Before I could discover what a jerboa was, I had to look up three different dictionaries.  The gazetteers do not often mention either lories or lorikeets.  I do not know what is the correct pronounciation.  I would have liked to hear from the Minister some explanation in relation to Part II of the First Schedule of the birds with which the Minister was dealing on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome this Bill as a measure which tends towards advancing agricultural interests by eliminating, or more correctly, reducing, <Col N="1853" /> the incidence of disease in animals. I feel agriculturists generally will be very much interested in a measure such as this.  It is indeed a peculiar defect in our legislation that we cannot draft such a measure in more readable language.  It takes 29 pages to set down the terms of this Bill. There are some 58 sections and some Schedules in it and it would be very difficult indeed for any farmer, if he were to get this Bill at all, to make sense out of it.  Even the fact that an explanatory memorandum is made available does not, to any great extent, lessen that difficulty.  I hope the time will come when legislation such as this will be set out in more sensible terms so that the ordinary man in the street can understand it.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker, one of our most experienced members in the House, had to consult dictionaries to deal with some of the terms in this Bill.  If it is beyond Deputy Sweetman's capacity to deal with it, without reference to dictionaries, you can imagine the position of the small farmer around the country, and indeed some of the big ones, who have not had the education or advantages of Deputy Sweetman, when they try to interpret this measure.</P>
      <P>This measure is introduced in 1965 when the eradication of bovine tuberculosis has reached a successful conclusion, after 11 years.  This scheme has successfully concluded and great credit is due to the people who initiated it in 1954, the members of the inter-Party Government at that time. They showed great foresight in putting forward legislation at that time which has resulted, 11 years afterwards, in the complete eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first paragraph of the Minister's statement is indeed startling.  I had some idea it would contain a special reference to losses from disease, having listened to previous statements by the Minister some few weeks back, but I was startled to learn that, despite the fact that the disease of tuberculosis has now been eradicated, our losses, as a result of disease in animals, amount to £25 million annually, or an average of £100 per farm.  That is a <Col N="1854" /> huge sum and, in my opinion, it is an indictment of previous Ministers for Agriculture in this State, an indictment of the Department of Agriculture itself and, to an extent, of this House that we should have been losing back through the years this colossal amount of money annually by reason of disease in animals.  Having regard to our national economy, £25 million annually is a sizeable sum and everybody could appreciate what the Minister for Finance could have done with such a sum if he had had it at his disposal each year in the years gone by.  I do not think it was generally known that such a sum was involved.  If it had been known generally that the figure was so high, I am sure more active measures would have been taken by bodies such as the committees of agriculture and other farming organisations to bring pressure to bear on the Government and on the Department to introduce legislation which would have obviated these losses.</P>
    <P>Whilst welcoming this measure, I must also say, having regard to the Minister's statement, that it is a Bill that should have been promoted years ago so that this huge loss, which must have been known to Ministers for Agriculture, to the Department of Agriculture and their advisers, would not have been allowed to continue with little or no publicity.  I do not agree with Deputy Sweetman's statement commending the authorities for the manner in which they were dealing with the eradication of animal diseases. In view of the facts placed before us by the Minister, I could not agree with that commendation.  The Minister's speech definitely indicts the Department of Agriculture for allowing this position to continue.  It is completely out of place that we now have this situation, a situation which the Minister feels could have been dealt with over the years.  However, it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>We are pleased that we have this measure before us because undoubtedly such a measure could ensure for the farming community a big increase in their incomes if it brings about, as we hope it will, a complete eradication of animal diseases.  That will at least help <Col N="1855" /> towards substantially reducing their losses, and there is plenty of room for that, having regard to the figures. Now that bovine tuberculosis has been eradicated, the next greatest problem is brucellosis, or contagious abortion. This is a source of grave worry to many farmers because of its infectious nature, and when one farm is stricken with this disease, it is not unlikely that the adjoining farms will also be stricken to some degree.  Unfortunately, while this was a matter of concern to many farmers, veterinary advice was not able adequately to arrest it or to wipe it out. We hope that with the advances which the Minister and Deputy Sweetman mentioned, some effective cure will be found for this disease.  Now that the Department, the Minister, and the House have got down to this matter in a serious manner, we hope that some effective remedies will be available to the farming community which will provide the same effects as did the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the terms of this Bill in regard to the dehorning of cattle.  It is something which every farmer would like to do but many felt that it was a painful operation.  Now we are assured that this operation can be carried out without causing any pain to the cattle, that it is completely painless.  That being the case, and because there are no ill effects from it, I agree wholeheartedly with the suggestion that we should have a national campaign for the dehorning of cattle. I note that the Minister has set a period of three years for carrying out this work and that after the three years, it will not be permissible to expose cattle for sale unless they have been dehorned.  This is a part of the Bill which will meet with general approval because even though it is natural for cattle to have horns, as there are no ill effects from dehorning, according to the experts, then it should be done.</P>
    <P>Another part of this measure which is very important is that dealing with sheep dipping.  The position regarding sheep dipping is not at all satisfactory in many parts of the country.  It is amazing the number of people, people one would regard as intelligent and <Col N="1856" /> progressive, who neglect to have their sheep dipped, especially when one realises the loss which can be caused to the nation and to the farmer.  It is also heartening to read about the dye mentioned in the Minister's statement. Once the dye is available, then a person cannot expose for sale sheep which have not been dipped.  I understand that at present some people who tend to treat the law with disrespect can overcome the regulations easily. A man may have 200 sheep and may get about 40 of them dipped and once that person has the certificate, it will enable him to sell so many sheep at different times without fear of detection. That system unfortunately obtained in some places and court penalties, in a few cases which were brought before the courts, were extremely light.  Fines of only a few shillings were imposed, which, to my mind, were not adequate.</P>
    <P>We in Cork, in common with other counties, have now special sheep dipping committees and these committees, in conjunction with the officers of the committees of argiculture and of the Department of Agriculture, take a firm stand in regard to developing means and systems of eradicating sheep scab.  I am not quite positive about the facts but I think the annual loss from sheep scab could be as high as £2 million a year.  In Cork we have joined with Kerry County Council, as we have an extensive boundary between the two counties and in those parts of the counties which adjoin, there are big sheep-producing areas. Instead of making separate efforts in Cork, we felt we should join with Kerry and deal with the two counties as a unit.  Kerry County Council agreed and a meeting has been held between representatives of both counties with very good results and a further meeting is to be held in the not too distant future.  We hope that as a result of our joint efforts, we shall be able to carry out our part of the scheme and bring forward suggestions which we hope will help the Department.</P>
    <P>As regards sheep dipping, a big question with which the Department must concern itself arises from the <Col N="1857" /> different types of dips.  We have much advice tendered as regards the best type of dip.  Some dips that are supposed to be good are harmful to birds or other wild fowl.  The Department should provide advice for the different counties to enable people on county committees of agriculture and others concerned to know the most suitable types of dip.</P>
    <P>We also have protracted discussions on suitable times for dipping sheep. Some people feel it is wrong to have the second dipping held over until October as sheep are supposed to be in lamb at that time.  That matter will be the subject of recommendations to the Department from Cork and Kerry later on.  We should have a standard agreement on these two matters, the most suitable type of dip and the most appropriate time for dipping.</P>
    <P>The warble fly scheme has, I hope, got off to a good start but it is too early to assess its achievements at present.  Let us hope it will be successful. Some doubt has arisen as to whether this particular dressing causes ill effects in cattle.  Unless the effects are notified within 24 hours of the dressing, the Department does not hold itself responsible.  If the case should arise&mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;the Department should, if they are satisfied that the ill effects arose from warble fly dressing, accept liability for paying compensation even though the 24-hour period has elapsed.</P>
    <P>Turkey numbers are very much down.  Turkeys have been subject to a number of ailments in the past and it was a great blow to housewives to find after rearing them for four, five, or six months, in some cases up to market stage, that they began to die off.  That is not infrequent.  As a result of this measure and the thought and work put into it by the veterinary people, I hope that some effective cures will be found for turkey ailments. The same applies to poultry, but seeing the Minister is very conversant with poultry ailments, I am sure, as far as hens are concerned, there is no need to mention the subject, that he will ensure, having regard to the profits he is making from that section of his activities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree that the Bill should be approved.  Its contents can be dealt with more minutely on the Committee Stage.  I do not blame the Minister in this connection but it would be a great step forward if, when these Bills are introduced in the national Parliament, they could be set down in such a way that people could readily understand them.  I suggest that future measures dealing with agricultural matters should, if at all possible, be presented in a more concise form.  It is peculiar that even though these Bills are now set down in great detail, one often finds great controversy arising on different sections and the fact that the measures go into such great detail does not seem to make them any clearer. Some of them have had to be left to the interpretation of the courts.  I have known a number of people who bought copies of Bills from the Government Publications Sales Office thinking they would be able to absorb the contents by scanning them but they found they were just as wise after reading them as they had been beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome.  It shows how much the Department is thinking about the future and about keeping up the good name we have had over the years of being one of the few countries, if not the only country in Europe, free of some of the major diseases of farm animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An experience I had shows how thorough we are.  There was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease fairly widespread on the Continent and I was in Denmark at the time.  We were in constant touch with the Department here and the Danish Department of <Col N="1859" /> Agriculture had to notify the Irish Department where we were, whenever we were in an area in which there was foot and mouth disease.  One of the veterinary surgeons with whom we became very friendly remarked that he could not understand why we in Ireland were so worried about foot and mouth disease.  He said they were quite accustomed to it and he did not understand why we should be making so much fuss about it.  We have all seen the disastrous results of foot and mouth disease and what a plague it can be.  The policy followed here and on the continent has been complete slaughter, keeping imported cattle in isolation and keeping a check on movements of people.  That has paid handsome dividends.  In my own memory, we have had only one outbreak of the disease and we all remember how disastrous that was.</P>
    <P>The Bill carries on the good work done by the Department over the years. It is planning for the future.  In including contagious abortion, we are merely keeping step with Northern Ireland and England.  A rising standard of living will bring a rising standard of hygiene and we will have to keep abreast of the times.  Brucellosis can give humans undulant fever, which is a very distressing disease.  There is a fair amount of contagious abortion in most of the large dairy herds at present.  Therefore, the present step is a most welcome one and is not taken a moment too soon.</P>
    <P>Both the Department and the farmers are to be congratulated on the success of the bovine TB eradication scheme.  It is one sphere in which both farmers and Department worked hand in hand.  If the same approach is made to the farmers in the years ahead, we will be able to eradicate all these other diseases in an extremely short time. Most countries who faced the problem had a good deal of trouble with the stock owners in bringing them around to the idea.  But the approach of the Department here was most commendable. The farmers responded to it and helped in no uncertain manner.  It is hard to estimate the loss to the <Col N="1860" /> economy caused by contagious abortion in regard to milk yields and calves, but it is only a matter of time before we can eliminate it completely.</P>
    <P>The compulsory sheep dipping is also very welcome.  I should not use the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; because the Department have left it open, but you cannot sell sheep unless you dip them. That is a good approach.  It is very welcome also that sheep have to be dipped both for fly and scab.  Most people ignored dipping for scab but dipped for fly in the summer.  Everybody was busy in the summer and did not want to have to round up the sheep every night or morning and take the maggots out of them.  It was to save themselves trouble that they dipped in June or July, but they forgot about the scab afterwards.  Therefore, I felt all along that we were wide open to an outbreak of the disease, which can be a very distressing one.  I would suggest that next year the winter dip might be moved back to September and October instead of October and November.  A group of farmers in my own area had intended dipping yesterday, which would have been an exceptionally cold day to dip sheep.  You are always likely to have cold spells during November.  If it complies with the veterinary regulations, September and October would be a better period.</P>
    <P>The warble fly is an old problem. We tried unsuccessfully to combat it in the 1930s.  Any manufacturer will tell you the great amount of loss it entails to hides.  The most valuable part of the hide is lost.  Anybody in the dairying business will notice that the cows go back a bit in milk during July if it is particularly warm. I have seen myself that cattle put on practically no weight during July if it is warm at all, because so much is lost by their gadding around.  I understand it is quite easy to eliminate the warble fly and it could be eliminated with a joint effort over a few years. The fact that farmers joined together on a voluntary basis last year was, I am sure, an incentive to bring in a national scheme this year.  Any of us who made the effort last year know how few warbles there were around the cattle this year.  I know it was not <Col N="1861" /> a summer you could expect to see a lot of gadding but, even so, if you ran your hand along a beast's back, you found very few warbles after the dressing of last winter.</P>
    <P>There was some trouble regarding cattle dying or some slipping calves within 24 hours.  I feel that with more research a good deal of this would be eliminated.  There was some improvement even from last year.  Last year, immediately after you dressed them, they went off gadding around the fields. This year, whatever improvement there was in the dressing, there were no such distressing effects.  I feel sure that with more research, we will be able to eliminate such matters as some cattle getting sick and a few even dying. Since this is a national scheme, the Department will take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the warble fly scheme.  There was, of course, power already there to cope with this pest but the new provision is certainly very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is also heartening to learn that the control of liver fluke will be brought in on a national scale.  This year farmers would be well advised to fluke their sheep because of the wet summer through which we have passed.  The adverse weather is bound to affect our sheep and cattle quite seriously.  I should mention that I have been told by butchers that the livers of both cattle and sheep have improved considerably over the past ten years since the Department encouraged farmers to dose both cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been done through the organisations throughout the country.  Agricultural instructors are always welcome speakers at meetings. They never fail to underline the advantages of dosing for fluke and worms. They have also tactfully suggested to individual farmers that sheep and cattle should be dosed during October and November for fluke and worms because this dosing will pay a subsequent dividend.</P>
    <P>I suppose we shall always have some of these diseases but I am glad that this Bill will make provision for coping <Col N="1862" /> with so many of them.  It is good to know that, if the Department think there is need for a national effort to control certain diseases in animals, that effort can be made.  The older farmers can tell one all about the disastrous losses before dosing for fluke was introduced. In this regard there is a wide variety of preparations and people have equipped themselves with one or other of these.  Nearly every farmer now has a shoot into which cattle can be run.  This is infinitely better than the old fashioned method of trying to examine a beast in an open stable. There was always danger of bruising.</P>
    <P>With regard to sheep, the extra grants have made sheep handling facilities available to a greater number of farmers.  The Department set a headline there.  I have seen some of the sheep handling facilities on some of the Department's farms.  They are excellent.</P>
    <P>There is provision here for dealing with mastitis.  A good deal of research needs to be done, I think, before this disease can be effectively controlled. It is one of the worst plagues that can hit the dairy farmer.  Yesterday the Minister told us that losses due to mastitis can be in the region of £6 or £7 million a year.  That is the equivalent of 2d a gallon on all the milk produced. That is a sizeable sum.  If a valuable cow contracts the disease, her value as a milk producer is gone. In some cases that cow must be disposed of at the end of the lactation period.  The disease has serious repercussions in the intensive dairying areas in which farmers are engaged in producing milk for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The incidence of the disease is highest during the summer months. Generally cows are dry during June, July, August and September and it is then that they are particularly prone to infection.  Even if penicillin is used, it is not always 100 per cent effective. Dairy farmers and farmers producing milk for creameries are the biggest sufferers.  The disease knocks a cow right back in her milk.  Even though she may recover eventually, the supply in the three-quarters left is not anything like the initial supply when she was a fit cow.  The percentage number <Col N="1863" /> of effective cures is, in my opinion, under ten.  An antibiotic which would successfully cure this disease would be invaluable to the farmer and ultimately to the nation.  It is difficult to calculate the amount of money it would put into the farmers' pockets and into the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that all these provisions are included in this measure and that the provisions can be implemented at the appropriate time.  There is provision, for example, for the control of swine fever.  We all know what happened between 1956 and 1958.  Possibly it may be easier to control this disease because for the most part swine are kept indoors but there are times when they must be moved from one place to another.  Birds, too, carry the disease.  We do not want to see a recurrence of our earlier experience. Swine fever can be very serious. Indeed, any disease that upsets the agricultural industry ultimately affects the agricultural economy as a whole. Anything that upsets the agricultural economy upsets the national economy. The individual farmer who has a clean herd is affected because the market for his product is affected.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we will use Spike Island as a quarantine station.  Such a station was badly needed.  There was one in Dublin on one of the Department's farms.  Even with the best fencing available and the utmost precautions, there was always the danger of quarantine being broken.  I am glad that Spike Island has been selected as a quarantine station.  We are fortunate in having so many islands that can be used for this purpose.  The Danes also had the problem of mastitis in cows. As the disease is not transferable from cow to calf, the best strains of cows were brought to an island station and the calves were removed immediately after birth.  The selection of Spike Island as a quarantine station is particularly welcome in regard to the experiments with imported breeds of cattle such as the French Charollais and other English and continental breeds.  It is important to keep abreast of modern developments so that we may produce the best breeds of cattle for our purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> We are leading the field in the production of beef.  There is no beef produced anywhere in the world comparable with Irish beef, particularly as to flavour.  In order to maintain our position, experiments must be carried out and research undertaken so as to secure the type of cattle most suited to our climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister may make orders providing, <i>inter alia,</i> for the giving of such information by persons entering the State concerning their occupation and previous movements as the Minister may reasonably require.  That is a very important provision in view of the development of air traffic.  Nobody objects to giving information properly required to be given.  It is customary for persons entering other countries to be given a card while in the plane on which they are required to enter particulars as to destination, occupation and other relevant matters.  It is a most important provision in the context of prevention of diseases in animals.  The fact that the country is so free of animal diseases is due to the great work carried out by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in relation to the dehorning of cattle.  Dehorning is a practice that has come in gradually over the past 20 years.  Immediately after the war, the cattle market reports used to give prices for cattle and the price for polly cattle was always £2 higher than the price for horned cattle. That provided an incentive to dehorn cattle.  We have not been 100 per cent successful in introducing naturally polled cattle.  With modern methods, dehorning is a simple matter and there are no ill effects if carried out soon after birth.  It is a painless operation. If dehorning is deferred to a later time, it can be very distressing and the results may be unsightly.  This provision could have been made a number of years ago but dehorning has been done by farmers on a voluntary basis. The provision in the Bill will eliminate the last remnants of horned cattle.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an amendment of the Clean Wool Act, 1947.  I welcome the idea of introducing a dye as a test of sheep dipping.  As a result <Col N="1865" /> of the propaganda and the work carried out by the Department over a number of years, one very rarely sees tar marks on sheep at the present time.  At one time it was the practice to stamp ewes on the back with paint or some oil mixture, which injured the wool.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very welcome and will have the desired effect of keeping our livestock free of disease and of helping us to maintain our unique position of being an island on the western coast of Europe which is completely free of the major animal diseases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister was very fair to this country in his opening statement in saying that the cost of the loss of animals and so on amounts to £25 million a year.  It is generally accepted, and I have always found it to be the case at any conferences I have attended abroad in relation to agricultural and animal diseases, that we have suffered less from disease and have the position better controlled than practically any other country in Europe.  It is fair to say that every country has foot and mouth disease and that, as has been mentioned by other speakers, we have had only one outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which was stamped out after a few months, in this country. It gives a false impression for the Minister to say that that is the cost to the country annually.  I very much doubt that the cost is as high as that.  Of course if you include in the calculation the slaughter carried out during the campaign for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis it might well produce that average over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, we all accept the fact that legislation is necessary to eradicate disease as far as possible and a great deal of this legislation is already in existence.  In effect, what the Minister is doing is producing a long Bill in which he has embodied all the originial provisions and is seeking wider powers to control the farming community.  In certain circumstances, that may be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two things I should like to refer to in the Bill.  First of all, it says that when an order is made for the slaughter of an animal and <Col N="1866" /> where there is failure to agree between the Minister and the owner of the beast concerned, there will be independent arbitration.  I should like the Minister to give the House some sort of indication as to whom he has in mind as an independent arbitrator.  In practically everything in this country where an arbitrator is sought, we get a judge of the High Court or Circuit Court.  I do not think that type of individual knows the first thing about livestock.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister, if he is getting an arbitrator, that he get somebody who has some knowledge of agriculture, so that a fair decision may be taken.  I am sure Deputy Allen would be a very good arbitrator&mdash;he knows so much about everything.</P>
    <P>The other matters to which I should like to refer&mdash;and which I think are the main causes of loss in this country &mdash;are mastitis, brucellosis and fluke. The Minister is introducing a scheme for the eradication of warble fly here. I have some criticism to make on that scheme which I will deal with presently. It seems to me that the Minister will also introduce a scheme for brucellosis. I do not know whether or not he intends introducing anything in respect of fluke.  If he is, I do not see how he could do it other than advising the farmers to dose, as far as possible.  The Minister also mentioned the fact that mastitis caused considerable losses. First of all, does he intend introducing a compulsory inoculation scheme for brucellosis and, if so, will he place the charge directly on the farmers themselves, or will the State assist the farmers?</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the only treatment for mastitis is penicillin, in so far as it is effective.  Penicillin is unwholesome in milk used for the manufacture of cheese.  Has the Minister or his advisers any up to date information as to whether or not there is any modern scientific advancement with regard to mastitis, other than the treatment by penicillin?  If he or his advisers has such information it would be to the benefit of the Deputies concerned and of the farming community as a whole if he would indicate this to the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> To my mind the greatest loss is due to fluke, because of our climate. There is a very high rate of mortality amongst sheep and quite a considerable rate of mortality amongst cattle, which very often is not recognised. Does the Minister propose introducing any scheme to deal with fluke or does he propose to rely on the education of the farming community as a whole?  I do not think we have enough information on disease in relation to animals.  I suggest that fluke is one of the diseases that committees of agriculture should employ experts to lecture on so that farmers may be conversant with fluke in its early stages.  In the majority of cases when the disease is diagnosed the animal is in such a condition already that treatment has no effect whatever. What I am trying to indicate to the Minister is the prevention of fluke rather than the endeavour to cure it when it exists.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of the Minister's recent order for the eradication of warble fly.  First of all, I think the notice is too short to make it compulsory.  It is absolutely unfair to compel owners of cattle herds to have this treatment carried out, in its entirety, by the 1st December and, failing that, they are not free to sell. Secondly, it is imposing on the farming community very heavy extra clerical work in that they will have to have a separate identity card for animals treated for warble fly, as against having it simply stamped on the existing card. The Parliamentary Secretary is listening to me.  I do not know whether or not he is a farmer but we must realise that farmers have not got secretaries and filing cabinets like the ordinary individuals who devise these schemes.  To carry out a test you have got to bring the animal in.  You have got to read the number on his ear and, generally, there are two or three numbers there. At least that is what I find on most of the animals I buy.  Then you have got to search for the blue card.  If, on top of that, you have to have a card for warble fly, and another card for brucellosis, I think the Minister and his Department <Col N="1868" /> should take another look at the situation.  It is not fair to ask the farming community to do that and, perhaps, the Minister would consider that point.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the charge of 3/- per beast which the herdowner pays, in its entirety, is too much.  Why should you have to pay 3/- for a full sized bullock and pay 3/- for a calf as well?  Also, as far as I know, this treatment is being carried out by unskilled people.  What guarantee have we, when we are paying 3/- per beast, that the correct stuff is being used and is effective for the purpose for which it is used?  I should like to put that to the Minister. It is only fair to the House that these matters should be clarified and explained. Deputy Allen, who is an expert on all things, is, I am sure, an expert on this and I am sure his constituents have approached him and asked him these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Deputy been listening he would know. However, he can read the Official Report afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question I should like to raise is that of the guarantee.  The guarantee in the form I received does not make sense to me on the findings of the experts, and these are the findings&mdash;I might add&mdash;published by the British Department for Agriculture and Fisheries who are the pioneers of this scheme.  I believe they have sold this scheme&mdash;to a large extent&mdash;to the Department here and to the Minister and his officials generally.  They maintain that the stuff&mdash;which is a chlorophosphate&mdash;used at present is excreted from the animal's system in six to eight hours.  I am not inclined to agree with that from what little technical knowledge I have.  I think the danger in this case is that it is a phosphate poison and a phosphate poison, even if it is excreted from the animal's system in six to eight hours, leaves behind it deleterious effects.  Therefore, I shall read for the benefit of the Minister paragraph 3 of the circular dated <Col N="1869" /> August, 1965, on the warble fly eradication scheme, 1965 which I received:</P>
    <P>The charge to the herdowner is 3/-per animal treated.  This charge includes the cost of treatment and certification.  It also provides insurance cover for the treated animal against loss directly attributable to the treatment provided that the herdowner has consulted a veterinary surgeon within 24 hours of the treatment and has followed his advice.</P>
    <P>If, as the Department says, it is excreted from the animal's system in six to eight hours it seems to me that if a claim is made in 24 hours the Department could very well say: &ldquo;Oh, that was execreted in six to eight hours and, therefore, we are not further liable.&rdquo;  Further than that it does not make sense to me.  It appears to me that you have got to consult a veterinary surgeon within 24 hours of the treatment.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister in relation to something which has happened already in my constituency in the south.  In fact, it has happened in two or three cases.  If it happens that an animal is being treated in calf, that the calf has been born about two or three days afterwards and the animal itself has subsequently died of chlorophosphate poisoning, can the Minister say, if a claim is made, will compensation be paid in full or will the Minister, or whatever expert comes down to inspect, say it was not reported within 24 hours and, therefore, no claim can be entertained?  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he cannot have it both ways.  He must clarify the position for the farmers so that they will know where they stand.  I might say there are a considerable number of farmers who have carried out warble treatment under the old condition known as derris treatment which I gather is the treatment which was utilised in Sweden and by which Sweden eradicated the disease altogether.</P>
    <P>This year it will be hard to judge whether the lessening of the disease is due to the weather or to the treatment by derris but I know there are people who have written to the Department <Col N="1870" /> of Agriculture requesting the Department to allow them to continue the derris treatment because they are conscientious objectors, if I may put it that way, to the treatment the Minister is imposing on the Irish farmers.  I would suggest that anyone who can show&mdash;and he can do that through a local agricultural adviser&mdash;that he has consistently carried out warble fly treatment is entitled to escape this imposition which the Minister is placing on the farmers.  It would be quite easy for the Minister to administer this and he should give it his favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the warble fly scheme, I wish to point out that the cards given out in respect of treatment are most inconvenient to farmers for the simple reason, as Deputy Esmonde has already said, that the farmer has to have a blue card and then another card in connection with warble fly.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether it would be possible for the Department to issue blue cards which would incorporate the warble fly scheme.  Farmers have a great deal of trouble when it comes to selling their animals at marts.  They have the blue card but they have no warble fly card. If the inspector could stamp one card which would also cover the warble fly scheme, it would be much handier for the farmer.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned here last week in regard to the warble fly scheme the length of time within which the farmer had to claim for compensation when an animal died after treatment. The animal could have died a month or three months after being treated but he stated that the Department had to be notified within 24 hours of the animal's death.</P>

      <P>No; he did not.  Maybe I am wrong.  In connection with compulsory sheep-dipping, farmers in my constituency are very annoyed at having to dip sheep who are heavy in lamb at this time of the year and they are wondering about the consequences of dipping at a time when they have never dipped sheep before.  The Department are now sending out inspectors to look for sheep-dipping dockets from farmers at sheep sales.  The farmers do not have these dockets on them and their names and addresses are taken.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is proposed to take proceedings against these farmers, or if it is only a warning to them, and if it will become compulsory for the farmers to produce sheep-dipping papers at sales, <i>et cetera.</i> Furthermore, I would inquire whether it would be possible to have the time for sheep-dipping changed to an earlier date.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how inspectors compile the list of names from which they send out notices to farmers to dip their sheep on a certain date.  There are many farmers in my constituency who have never got such a notice from the local inspector.  The Parliamentary Secretary may be able to tell us how this list is compiled.  Another provision I welcome in the Bill is that in connection with dehorning cattle.  That is long overdue.  I should like also to welcome the provision dealing with mastitis.  All in all, I believe this Bill will go a long way towards clearing diseases.</P>

      <P>It can be said that, in general, this Bill has met with full support. <Col N="1872" /> While there have been comments about various measures being taken by the Department, it appears that the Bill in itself is acceptable to the House.  I welcome the constructive approach to the Bill by Deputies on all sides. Deputy Sweetman did say it was a Bill that lent itself more to discussion on Committee Stage than on Second Reading.  Because it is a pretty long and detailed Bill, because of the various technicalities in it, that must hold.  The reference Deputy M.P. Murphy made to the question of its being too detailed and exhaustive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My experience of the agricultural community is that they are pretty well able to assimilate all the details they require to know in connection with this sort of legislation.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to warble fly dressing.  We heard from Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Esmonde two quite conflicting views.  Deputy Sweetman was all for the compulsory approach to warble fly dressing, whereas Deputy Esmonde felt he was not sure of the facts and questioned the desirability of accepting that the Department of Agriculture knew exactly what they were doing in having this dressing applied at all.</P>

      <P>The claims made by Deputy Esmonde might not stand up to full examination.  It is recognised that we are probably ahead of most places in this respect and inquiries have come from outside the country for information, technical assistance and advice in regard to it.  It has been suggested by Deputy Esmonde that the people administering the dressing <Col N="1873" /> for warble fly control are probably doing more harm than good because they do not know their job.  Out of the huge number of cattle dressed the number of claims shows that any suggestions of its being harmful are unsubstantiated. Also dealing with the warble fly, Deputy Allen spoke of complaints about the time laid down as being too short.  There was a certain vagueness about that but it has been claimed that unless the beast shows a reaction within 24 hours, it cannot be claimed that the dressing has been harmfully effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde criticised the approach of the Minister when he outlined the difficulties the Department faced in this respect.  He stressed that we were exaggerating the amount of harm done by the various diseases and mentioned and, rightly so, that we were looked at internationally as a disease-free State.  However, it must be pointed out that we have diseases which affect our cattle, and our economy from the point of view of porductivity, and they are the diseases we are trying to combat at this stage. This Bill is aimed at maintaining our disease-free position.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of the points raised can be dealt with on Committee Stage when a more detailed investigation of some of the sections may be warranted.  Deputy Sweetman wants to have further discussion on sections 42 and 50 with regard to the identification of inspectors.  As I have already said, the Bill is one that lends itself to discussion in Committee.  I was pleased to hear Deputy M.P. Murphy referring to the awareness they have of the necessity for further sheep-dipping in Cork and Kerry.  I was glad also to know that the county committees of agriculture in these two counties have come together with a view to doing all they can to assist the Department in carrying out sheep-dipping operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see some sense in Deputy Sweetman's suggestion that we are not getting a satisfactory application of warble fly dressing through the inducement system as against compulsion but I suggest that our figures so far show we have had a big step up on last year and that, apart from a few <Col N="1875" /> isolated pockets being dealt with now, the figures by 1st December will show that the warble fly campaign has been an outstanding success on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned the desirability of having another look at the fixing of dipping periods.  In that respect I should like to point out that consultations are going on between the farmers' organisations and the Department with a view to determining whether more suitable periods for dipping could not be arranged.  We do not share the view that the periods at present are entirely unsuitable but we are most anxious to obtain the comprehensive views of farming interests so that we shall arrive at a time that will suit all concerned. I do not think there is anything further that needs to be said at this particular stage.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health service is inadequate to the needs of the people, and that in particular many injustices arise in the administration of the medical card system, and calls on the Government without further delay to establish a comprehensive no means test health service with a free choice of doctor for all sections of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Before I moved the adjournment of this debate.  I stated that it seemed to be common case that the health services <Col N="1876" /> at the present time are grossly inadequate and give rise to many injustices and hardships.  That seems to be accepted by all sides of the House, by the Government as well as by the Opposition Parties.  I was dealing in particular with the health card system. This is a system which gives rise to grave injustices and which has created a situation in which the citizens of the State do not know their rights.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to know who is entitled to a health card.  In some counties, the standard seems to be laid down that a person with the income of a roadworker is entitled to a health card and that, above that, he is not.  There does not seem to be any definite ceiling for the agricultural community and, by that, I do not mean to convey that everything is free, gratis and for nothing for the agricultural community&mdash;far from it.  However, neither a person in receipt of an income nor a farmer seems to know when he is entitled to a health card. The most disturbing factor is that health cards seem to be refused all over the place and then, when pressure is applied by a member of the county council or by a member of this or the other House, health cards are granted in some cases.  If that pressure is not applied, these people are left without health cards and are deprived of what they are automatically entitled to.</P>
      <P>I know a mother of eight or nine children whose husband was in receipt of £11 a week.  She told me she was not entitled to a health card and could not get one.  The scheme does not seem to make any allowance for children or for dependants.  I shall come back later to something the Minister said recently but, in the course of it, he promised he would send out a booklet to each householder explaining what exactly he is entitled to under the health scheme.  By that, I wonder if the Minister means under the proposed health scheme or under the existing health scheme?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I was going to say I would take off my hat to him and give him credit for <Col N="1877" /> unusual ability if he could send out a booklet telling the people what they are entitled to under the existing health scheme because it would be an utter impossibility to do so.  It is wrong that people with small incomes, and small farmers, should have to go to members of the county council or members of the Oireachtas asking them, for goodness sake, to get them a health card and that these people, in turn, should have to go cap in hand to the local authority to try to get the health card. Surely that is not a correct procedure? The people say that at the present time you do not get a doctor when you want a doctor but that you get a doctor when you can pay for a doctor. That is an unsatisfactory position.  So much for the service available under the health card system.</P>
      <P>The next matter concerns the cost of medicines, drugs, dentures and spectacles. Nobody seems to know when he is entitled to these free or when he is entitled to be assisted in procuring any of them.  In some counties, persons can have their teeth removed for nothing but cannot get any assistance towards having them replaced.  I know people who have been going around without teeth for years because they got them out in the belief that they would be replaced free or that they would get substantial assistance towards having them replaced.  Some counties have not got a dental scheme at all.  Other counties have a scheme which is limited to expectant mothers and ex-TB patients.  However, the vast majority of the lower income group in the country are not entitled to assistance towards having their teeth replaced.</P>
      <P>What is the position with insured people?  I raised this matter here with the Minister for Social Welfare.  An insured person can himself get assistance towards having his teeth attended to but there is no provision in that scheme for dependants of the insured person, and that is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently you can get spectacles in a steel frame.  They are a desperate looking outfit.  One look at unfortunate people wearing them and everybody <Col N="1878" /> immediately knows that they got their glasses under a county council scheme. They look to me just as much of a brand as the county home suit and I do not think that is desirable.  If people are getting spectacles under a health scheme or under any scheme, they should not bear the brand of poverty or the brand of home assistance or the brand of the lower-paid worker.  That is the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider people who have to avail of institutional treatment, the position is that if their income is over a certain figure, they are deemed to be able to afford institutional treatment.  If their income is over the prescribed amount or, in the case of a farmer, if his poor law valuation is over £50, then, whether or not there has been a lot of illness in the family and no matter how many children he has, they are deemed to be able to afford institutional treatment and can get some relief only if they can establish to the satisfaction of the local authority that their case is one of hardship.  In that event I think the local authority have power to accept responsibility for 25 per cent of the hospital account, but even that, in a great number of cases, is not sufficient to remove the hardship.</P>
    <P>Since this debate was adjourned, a couple of things have happened.  A couple of statements at Government level have been made on the health services.  Last evening in a television interview, the Minister stated that he proposes to get out a White Paper on health.  He very fairly said that a White Paper is a sounding instrument, a document that will get people talking and bring to him the views of the people.  I hope and trust that this is not a means of putting the question of health on the long finger or in cold storage.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister's television interview that he proposes to retain a means test.  I gathered that he is now prepared to accept what Fine Gael have been urging for a long time in some shape or form, that is, free choice of doctor.  If he assures us he will do that, I welcome his conversion to our way of thinking on that point. I want to know is he still going to <Col N="1879" /> retain the health card and the present unsatisfactory situation in which no one knows his rights or can ascertain them from the Department, the local authority or the local representative? Is that to continue?  Is he going to do anything about the provision of those necessaries&mdash;dentures, spectacles, artificial limbs and such items as expensive drugs which, as I mentioned, people cannot afford to provide for themselves at present?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if he intends to modify the means test? I urge that he should go the whole way with Fine Gael: abolish it and give a free comprehensive health service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They promised that they would introduce a new health scheme. We had the Minister for Health within the past few days promising the country a White Paper and, at the same time, we had the Taoiseach going on record as saying that the Minister's blowlamp would have to be applied to the health scheme and to education.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Are we to take it that even after these six years, the Minister will get on with his health scheme and let us see it introduced?</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Higgins introduced the voluntary health scheme, he was told it would not work.  It was ridiculed and made little of.  That scheme has now been accepted by the country and, indeed, by the Minister, as a complete success.  The scheme which Fine Gael propose is based on social insurance under which those in the present social welfare classes would be absolutely free.  Above that, there would be a contribution of one-third from the State, and a contribution from employers, employees and the self-employed.  That is a scheme which will work and under which there will be an absolutely free choice of doctor, which is the only type of medical assistance that can give satisfaction. Human nature being what it is, patients will become dissatisfied with doctors, for one reason or another, just as they will become dissatisfied with solicitors, or architects, or engineers, or any other professional men.  It is not right that they should be tied to a doctor if their personalities happen to be incompatible, if they have rows, if they do not see eye to eye, or if the patient loses confidence in the doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister's White Paper was not introduced before this motion was discussed.  I trust that we will have an early opportunity of discussing it when it is introduced. When the Minister is replying to this debate, I should like him to tell us when he proposes to implement the White Paper, or when he proposes to bring before this House a health scheme which can be discussed as a definite proposal, because White <Col N="1881" /> Papers, informative as they may be&mdash; and indeed we have had quite a few over the past 12 months&mdash;are not effective.  A White Paper will do nothing to relieve the distress which the 1953 Health Act has inflicted on the people who are forced to rely on it. While a White Paper may be all right as a talking point and may create considerable discussion in the country and bring the Minister a lot of information, in itself it is useless.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the present Minister because he has been in office for only a few months, but this question of health has been a burning question since 1961.  Irrespective of what is said here, the 1961 general election, by and large, was fought on health.  It was one of the major controversies in that election.  So controversial was it that immediately after the election a motion was put down in this House, and the first critical issue on which the Government were challenged before the end of 1961, having been elected on 4th October, 1961, was the health issue.  Indeed it looked as if the Government might have been defeated on that very motion.</P>
    <P>In order to play for time, the Government&mdash;the present Minister was not in charge then&mdash;set up a Committee of this House to deal with, and report back on, health, thereby, in my opinion, accepting as a fact that the Health Act, 1953 was so unsatisfactory that it was beyond amending, that it could not be amended, because, if it could be amended, surely the Minister would have introduced his amendments then and there.</P>
    <P>I want to make this complaint, not against the Minister but against the Government, that, having accepted as a fact in 1961 that the position was unsatisfactory and that it was beyond repair, it is not good enough after four years to come along now with a White Paper which the Minister tells us is to give the people an opportunity of expressing their views on the system. During those four years, the Government should have got down to the task and instead of coming along with a White Paper, they should be coming into the House with definite proposals <Col N="1882" /> which could be debated, amended, accepted or rejected.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have no health policy and I believe this White Paper is another effort to stall.  The Committee has successfully stalled for four years.  I sincerely hope the House and the country will not tolerate any attempt by the Government to stall for another four years.  I should like the Minister to tell us now, not when he intends to introduce his White Paper, but when he proposes to introduce in this House concrete proposals for a health scheme that will meet the needs of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy spoke on behalf of the Party&mdash;good.  I do not intend to accept the motion for <Col N="1883" /> reasons which I shall explain later.  The fact that this debate has taken place will be, and has been, of considerable interest and benefit to the Government and to me, as Minister for Health.  I have told the House on earlier occasions that since I was appointed Minister for Health about six months ago, I have been reviewing the health services and have been formulating proposals for their further development. When making this review, I have looked back on the history of how the present services developed and, more particularly, on the various proposals put forward, for several years past, for changes in them.</P>
      <P>I have studied the Labour Party policy on the health services issued earlier this year, and on which I presume the present motion is based, and the proposals in relation to the health services circulated by the Fine Gael Party.  In addition, I have had informal discussions, without commitment on either side, with some bodies especially concerned with the health services, such as the Irish Medical Association.  Some of the matters covered by my examination and dealt with in these discussions were, I may say, the possibility of introducing a choice of doctor in the general medical service for what is called the lower income group.  A further matter considered was the hardship which may be caused in the middle income group in some cases arising from the necessity to purchase expensive drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have stated at the outset that the White Paper, as such, will not alone be an invitation to comment or criticise but will set out in detail the Government's proposals for the health services.  Deputy Corish said to me, on another occasion, in a very good description&mdash; I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;that we should have a progressive policy as far as the health services are concerned and that everything cannot be done overnight.  I think everyone in this House will subscribe to that but there are certain things crying out for rectification.  With regard to medical cards, I know the position well.  I was a member of a health authority myself <Col N="1884" /> and a member of the Health Services Committee of this House and I want to say that I consider that certain aspects of the present system are practically a joke.</P>

      <P>The original concept was perhaps sound.  Anyone can come into this House with a White Paper and Bills; but it is one thing to bring them in and another to make them work.  There are some counties of which I am well aware, where the county managers, for reasons best known to themselves, decided on a very inequitable and unjust scale in determining eligibility for medical cards.  Each case should have been dealt with on its merits.</P>
      <P>Further I firmly consider that social welfare beneficiaries, the unemployed, the widows and the old age pensioners should automatically, and with no question, be given medical cards. They should not even have to ask for them but should receive them by virtue of their social welfare status. If they have not got them now I will see they will receive them in the future.</P>
      <P>Some managers have been operating this so-called scale referred to the week before last by Deputy Kyne.  I think he spoke of the year 1961 and said that wage limits were set at £5 or £6 per week.  Of course that was completely unjust.</P>

      <P>The big change in the Mental Treatment Bill will be that whereas hitherto the incomes of children were taken into account when assessing the means of the husband and wife in future it will only be the income of the husband and wife.  The incomes of the children in the house, who might be saving up to get married, will be ignored or dealt with on their merits.  That is the kind of thing I hope to achieve as far as uniformity is concerned. As regards medical cards I <Col N="1886" /> hope to wipe out of future health discussions the expression &ldquo;medical card&rdquo;.  How I am to achieve that I do not know.</P>
      <P>To get back to the White Paper, I should like to say that from time to time criticism has been expressed about Ministers making speeches at chambers of commerce or in other places and not in this House.  That as everybody knows is not a realistic approach.  The moment a Minister has certain proposals, he cannot jump up here out of the blue and start talking about them.</P>

      <P>We have to be sensible about these things and anybody indulging in that kind of criticism is being mischievous and is deceiving the people.  I am going to set out the Government's intentions and proposals and I have no objection to another motion or an opportunity for further discussion.  I would be quite prepared to have a certain amount of elasticity, in certain respects, in regard to proposals. As I said before, I do not consider that all the brains of Ireland are on the Fianna Fáil benches, nor do I think that the only people who get sick are supporters of Fianna Fáil.  I will be quite willing to listen to further constructive contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the question of drugs.  This, as far as I am concerned, is one of the grave hardships on what is now known as the middle income group, the limit for whom will be raised to £1,200.  Ill-health and sickness can be a great leveller&mdash;a person could have a very good income and have a very severe burden placed on him through sickness.  It is in those instances that I want to try to have some kind of let-out clause where people with a charitable and just disposition will adjudicate on the interpretation of what is hardship.  I hope also to have&mdash;whether I will succeed is another matter&mdash;some form of appeal, because we have had in the past, in local authorities, the little Caesars I spoke of, striking a blue pencil through a man's name without taking the whole case into consideration, <Col N="1887" /> without considering for how many months he has been unemployed, and so on.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I said at the Health Services Committee that one of the defects in the General Medical Services Scheme was that there was no space on the application form to supply details of any unusual circumstances. You just filled it up, got the employer to state whether the man was working, his wages and then the decision was arrived at, but there was no provision made for saying: &ldquo;This man was idle for two years and has had one child very seriously ill.&rdquo;  What happened?  The case came to the unfortunate local representative, he listened to his story, and then he went back and either wrote or put his case to the local official.  This should not have been necessary.</P>
    <P>My examination of the present pattern of services, and of the various ideas for changes or developments, has been made and naturally it took some time because the issues are complex and the suggested solutions to the problems were many.  The Government are satisfied that some changes should be made in the services, and the proposals for such changes should be published before Christmas.  I should be in a position to circulate them for general discussion and consideration.</P>
    <P>It has, accordingly, been decided, as announced last week by the Taoiseach, to publish this White Paper and explain our proposals in relation to the future development of the health services.  It will deal with each service in some detail: the questions of the choice of doctor, drugs for the middle income group in cases of hardship, the so-called lower income groups eligibility for the general medical service and particularly, I hope, the general financing and administration of the services.  In my opinion, the administration leaves a lot to be desired.  The White Paper, having set out our intentions, will arouse discussion.  I do not intend to anticipate its contents by giving a detailed statement of what the Government may propose in the way of changes.  I am more free to say what the Government will not propose to do.  I might as well be straight about <Col N="1888" /> it&mdash;the Government will not adopt any pattern of free-for-all services on the lines advocated in this motion.  I do not think the Labour Party are really genuine, and I do not say that in any rude or hurtful way.  I believe that individually they are a body of very courteous Deputies but collectively they can be appallingly stupid.  Because they are the Labour Party, they think this cliché of &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; must be adopted.</P>

      <P>I should say that in Britain where insurance contributions are in their nature, and in the proportion of health expenditure which they meet, closer to suggestions about the proposed contribution than continental examples, the position seems to be that the former Conservative Government in England accepted contributions as a feature of their health services financing, <Col N="1889" /> but without any enthusiasm.  The former Conservative Minister for Health when speaking on the proposal to increase the rate of weekly contribution by 1/- said:</P>
      <P>It is said, and broadly, it is rightly said, that this contribution, like the flat rate National Insurance contribution, is of the nature of a poll tax: it falls irrespective of the earnings of the person by whom it is paid.</P>
      <P>This proposal was strongly resisted in Parliament at the time and during the debate numerous references were made to the disadvantages of this form of tax from the workers' point of view.</P>

      <P>She conceded in the light of experience that there was no justification whatever for imposing a poll tax on every man and woman who happened to be an insured worker.  She said: &ldquo;We want it to be widely known that a future Labour Government will end this totally unfair practice&rdquo;.  That is in volume 634 and I commend these debates to the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A free-for-all service is neither necessary nor desirable and unless advocated purely on doctrinaire grounds such a service could not be justified so long as the people of this country can, through a combination of public and private arrangements, receive the medical care they need.  So far as hospital services are concerned, I do not think it can be contended this is not the position.  I have already mentioned the Health and Medical Treatment Act.  I am not complacent about the services and I recognise the need for changes, but to admit this is not the same as admitting that the services are inadequate and to remedy any deficiencies that exist will not call for such a drastic solution as is contained in this motion.  Indeed, to do what the <Col N="1890" /> motion proposes would not remedy the deficiencies which may exist at present but could well accentuate some of them.</P>
    <P>Replying to a Parliamentary Question last March, my predecessor indicated that the additional cost, over and above that of the present health services, of a free-for-all service would be £15 million a year excluding any capital expenditure that might be involved.  There is no indication in the motion as to how this extra cost would be met but Deputy Kyne, in introducing the motion, referred to financing improvements in the services.  He said that Labour Deputies would wish to vote the necessary money for improving the health services provided they were satisfied that the burden would be placed on the shoulders best able to bear it.  He also said it would be better to scrap the Health Act and introduce a scheme similar to the British health services on a contributory basis.</P>
    <P>The British health services are not financed by an insurance scheme; less than one-sixth of their cost is met by insurance contributions and the rest is a charge on ordinary taxation. Secondly, insurance contributions as a means of financing even this proportion of the cost of the services, are not very popular in Britain nowadays, particularly in Labour circles.  I think it would be a useful study for all of us and for Deputy Kyne and the other Labour Deputies in particular to read the reports of the debates in the British House of Commons in February, 1961 on the Bill to increase the rates of contribution.  I do not think such a scheme would satisfy Deputy Kyne's requirements that the burden of the increasing cost of the health services should be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.</P>

      <P>In supporting this motion, I want to say that I think the present health services are grossly inadequate and a disgrace to this country. The dispensary service places a stigma on the lower income group.  We have a part-time medical service.  People getting ill in the evening must wait <Col N="1891" /> until the following morning to attend a dispensary for medical attention. Workers must lose a day's pay to attend at these dispensaries.  A part-time medical service is not good enough for the lower income group. It is degrading.</P>
      <P>People have no choice of doctor.  We all like our own doctor.  We do not like being forced to attend one particular doctor if we have not faith in him or he has not got a manner which suits us.  These poor people are forced to accept a doctor they may not like.  As a result, many people with medical cards try, at great expense, to seek the services of a private doctor and obtain the medicines and drugs at the dispensary on his prescription.  The dispensaries do not provide the drugs ordered by the private doctor for these patients.  Too often they are told the drugs are not there.  They must go to the central depot and they are returned again to the dispensary.  They may have to wait two or three days for the drug which is ordered for them. Any person can become dangerously ill while awaiting the proper drugs for his or her condition.  This commonly happens in the dispensaries in Dublin city.  The proper drug ordered by the doctor is not available.</P>
      <P>We also have borderline cases, those who are not qualified to receive a medical card but who cannot afford the drugs prescribed for them.  Many a doctor has undue worry with patients about the cost of prescriptions and the number of tablets which would be within the means of a patient.  I remember one patient I saw.  She did not qualify for a medical card.  She had two children ill with bronchitis and pneumonia.  I could not prescribe an adequate quantity of the drug required because the woman could not afford it.  As a result, each child received only half the quantity of the drug necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two cases of people who have been deprived of cards.  I had a case of a woman who was deprived for five years, despite the fact that I made repeated representations on her behalf as a doctor.  I applied on no fewer than 20 occasions but was refused.  When I became a Deputy, I applied again and <Col N="1892" /> the card was granted.  For five years I had been trying on behalf of this woman who was suffering from bronchitis and asthma and was bedridden but whose means did not permit the provision of the drugs necessary. Due to my representations as a Deputy and not as a doctor, she has now got a card.  As a result, she is up and about now because she has got the proper drugs.  But she was deprived for five years.</P>
    <P>Then we have the burden imposed on people outside the medical card range.  By Wednesday they find the money is completely gone and they have to forgo medical treatment. Many a man has had to return to work prematurely because he could not afford to be out, with the cost of drugs.  The Minister has made an investigation of the cost of drugs.  In a normal illness, it costs £2 or £2 10s. to cure a patient.  For a man with a normal weekly wage, this is prohibitive and exorbitant.  Many a patient has had to tell a doctor not to call again because he could not afford the cost.  Many a doctor has had to make second and third visits social visits because he knew the patient could not afford the cost.  Many people prematurely leave hospital because they cannot face the tremendous expense of hospital treatment.  In fact, they are sued by the health authority for an amount they cannot afford.  I have seen many patients who have had four or five bills from a hospital over two or three years, who could not pay and said they could not go back to hospital because they were faced with these tremendous bills which meant they would have been in debt for the rest of their lives.  These were people with chronic illnesses who would not qualify for a medical card.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the tremendous bill?  Up to 10/- a day?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When this extends to three, four or five months, it is no joke for these people who cannot afford to pay it.  I remember writing to the health authority recently.  They said they would not waive this bill but the matter went to court and the judge waived it because he found out the <Col N="1893" /> circumstances of these people.  I have seen four or five bills in a house&mdash;two civil bills from the Dublin Health Authority.  These are chronic cases with recurring illnesses who are forced to go back again because there is no proper system in the hospitals to investigate early and act quickly.</P>
      <P>We have an ophthalmic service which, under the Health Act, is not considered a specialist service.  People are burdened with the expense of this for their children.  One case came to me recently of a woman with a five year old child.  Her husband was earning £14 a week.  She brought the child to the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.  As the child was about to be examined by the specialist, the almoner told her the child did not qualify.  She was told to attend the ophthalmologist at his private rooms.  The cost to date is £25.</P>
      <P>We have cases of children of school-leaving age or those attending secondary school, whose parents earn £12, £13 or £14 a week, who do not qualify for this service under the present Health Act.  The biggest drawback of the present health services is that the ophthalmic service is not adequate to meet the demands of the people.  We have not a proper ophthalmic service in this country.  We have a large waiting list of people in need of major eye operations who are being deferred under the present system.</P>
      <P>The dental service is totally inadequate. The number of dentists in this country is not sufficient to meet the needs of the school service alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take old age pensioners in hospital for treatment.  Who is to decide the dividing line between medical attention and institutional care?  These people have the blue card or medical card.  They are suddenly told they do not qualify for medical attention, that they are now in the institution.  Despite the fact that these people are ill, a deduction is made from their pensions. Who is to decide the dividing line? These old age pensioners who may be convalescing are charged for this service in St. Kevin's under the guise of institutional care.  An old age pensioner would prefer to have his own doctor <Col N="1894" /> and pay the cost out of his meagre pension rather than have no choice of doctor under the dispensary system.</P>
    <P>When people apply for a medical card, who does the investigating?  Unqualified people who do not know the circumstances.  Income is assessed on the total amount earned by the whole family.  Now, sons and daughters pay only for their keep at home.  They do not pay over their entire earnings.  The result is that parents are sacrificed. They do not qualify because the income earned by the children is taken into consideration.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>We have then the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme for those who do not come under national health insurance. This Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme is no answer to the problem. It does not cater as a proper insurance scheme would.  Two of the disqualification clauses are, first, that you be ill and, secondly, that, having been ill, you are debarred from having attention for a similar illness in the future. Old age is yet another barrier.  Those over 65 years of age cannot join.  The scheme is far from adequate.  Only a comprehensive health insurance scheme will serve all sections of the community. That is the only answer.  We want a service similar to that introduced originally by the Labour Government in England.  Only a similar scheme will be satisfactory here.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that the Government are satisfied that changes are necessary.  From my recollection, the Government were satisfied that our existing health services were adequate. Now they say they are satisfied changes are necessary.  I gather from the Minister that he will not substitute for the present pattern, but there will need to be radical changes before it will meet the needs of our people.  The health service in Britain is the ideal. Dare any Government try to change that service or to abolish it, it would bring about the downfall of the Government immediately.  The people are satisfied with the service.  The initial abuses have been overcome.  The people have proper attention and care. I do not know what the Minister meant when he said the Labour Party collectively are appallingly stupid over the health services.</P>

I shall judge the Minister by results and by what is achieved.  I shall not judge him by these promises. I do not think £15 million, as suggested by the former Minister, is a proper figure.  Of course, everyone who is against health services always tries to make the cost look prohibitive.  The Labour Party stand for a comprehensive service for all sections of the community. No slight extension of the medical card system will do.  We want a comprehensive service similar to that in existence in Britain.  Nothing less will satisfy the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall use my own phrases and the Minister, at his pleasure, can use his.  I shall try to explain what we mean by a comprehensive, no means test health service. At the moment there is a contribution from the workers' stamps towards the cost.  There is the division, as to 50 per cent, between the local authority, which is the rates, and the Exchequer subvention.  That means that, if the lady about whom Deputy O'Connell spoke, needs a rather expensive drug, a drug costing 50/- per week, 25/- of that will come from the rates.  I am aware that in the case of an insured person, which this lady was not, there is a contribution from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; there is a contribution from the stamp of the insured contributor.  The Minister may say &ldquo;No&rdquo; but some funds find their way in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>From the stamp for the drug?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the cost of the drug prescribed would be met as to 50 per cent from the rates and 50 per cent from the Exchequer. If the Minister wants to pick me up as I go along, he can do so.  The position is as I have stated.  The limiting factor is the rates contribution.  The person who accepted the estimate from the local authority is the same person as will decide whether or not a patient should get certain medical treatment. His aim is not to exceed the estimate already sent in and, therefore, his mind is conditioned by cost.  We cannot, of course, decide that every drug that comes on the market, irrespective of cost, must be provided for everybody.  There are, however, instances in which the use of drugs would save hospitalisation and, therefore, save money.  But all the time there is the limiting factor of the rates contribution.  That has been a deterrent <Col N="1897" /> in the provision of a decent health service under the 1953 Act for those who cannot afford one for themselves.</P>
      <P>Let me give a simple example to illustrate what I mean.  I am a member of the Louth County Council, which is the health authority for my constituency. We do not provide proper dental services because we cannot afford them.  Yet, if the Minister chooses to look up the 1953 Health Act, he will find that we are obliged to do so.  As I said in the debate on the economic situation last week, there are cases where dispensary doctors in Louth have sent people into hospital to get their teeth looked after, because, when they went into hospital, they were hospital cases and it could be done there under a different heading, whereas otherwise there was no service available in that local authority area for a person who was in extremely bad health because of the condition of his teeth.  That is a practical example of where we have fallen down.  It is a practical example that I know of as a member of the health authority and which the Minister can verify if he cares to do so.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael policy on this matter is that anything that has to be provided has to be paid for.  Fianna Fáil have been constantly assuring us of this fact.  Our idea of paying for this is that there should be for medicine outside hospital a contribution from the stamp.  I do not want to go into this in detail with the Minister because he will pick me up on one detail or another and we will probably end up at cross-purposes.  The stamp should be increased by something of the order of 2/9 a week.  We did not object to going out at the last election or the previous election and saying that in order to get a comprehensive health service for approximately 85 per cent of the population you would have to have payment for it through the insurance stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that an extension of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board idea is the only way in which the Minister or his successor will find himself able to provide the sort of service required.  The Minister may shake his head.  These things are matters of opinion and he has had short opportunity <Col N="1898" /> to look these things up.  Sitting on the Select Committee on the Health Services was a rather long opportunity, especially when Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Health, was sitting on the same Committee.</P>

      <P>From whence did the &ldquo;banana republic&rdquo; come?  There is no use in trying to get me off this: that the only way you can get this service outside hospital is by introducing this element in respect of the working man's stamp.  Anybody can produce a computation to say what that will amount to and anybody who wants to ask a Parliamentary Question can be told what is the cost of the provision of medicine outside hospital, and how much it will represent on the stamp.  We were prepared to say how much and we are prepared now to ask the same Parliamentary Questions. The Minister may not like it.  We are prepared to ask the same questions and get the same information and find out whether or not there is an increase and state how much it will cost the people.  That will remove the means test&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a man with a very fluid mind.  I will deal with his choice of patient and doctor.  The Minister instanced a figure of £15 million.  If he wants to look up the debates, he will find the extra figure quoted by his predecessor for a comprehensive health service was £30 million. His predecessor was facile with figures and was adept at making black red.  In fact, in his conservatism, nobody knows better than the Minister that he would quote just as readily £30 million or £130 million.  Our idea was that, outside hospital, there would be this extra contribution from the stamp.  Inside hospital, there would have to be a contribution from the rates.  That was a practical approach inasmuch as we all know that local authority institutions have in charge of hospitals persons who are also executives of the local authority.  The County Manager in Louth and the managers in the various counties and cities are also the executives who look after the local authority hospitals.</P>

You can subvent them in any way you like but unless you want to set up another chain of control which would be highly expensive, as it would be a new chain, you cannot divorce them from the rates but you can divorce health outside hospital from the rates and can introduce an Exchequer subvention and at the same time get every man working in this country to provide something extra in his stamp and become a paying patient and no longer a person who has to come as a suppliant to Deputy O'Connell, to me or to any other Deputy.  The Minister facetiously says: &ldquo;Choice of Deputy&rdquo;.  That is not a proper Ministerial remark.  It is just being funny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk now about the thing that is the real political effort on health of the Fianna Fáil Party over the past four years.  I do not want to go into detail as to what were the relations between the Minister's predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, and the IMA but to say they stank to high Heaven would be no exaggeration.  Then over a <Col N="1901" /> period there was the anxiety, because the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party had both produced the view that there should be choice of doctor, that this might disrupt things.  I found among my friends and the doctors in my constituency and in the country that there was this uneasiness.  Experienced practitioners&mdash;and I do not mean medical practitioners; I mean political practitioners&mdash;like Deputy MacEntee, thrive on that sort of thing.  The outcome was the marriage which was consummated on a night in Iveagh House when the entire Select Committee on the Health Services and all the IMA turned up.  There were Deputy MacEntee, the blushing bride, and the IMA and we all made it up, and then there was the situation as we approached the election where the IMA were happy that there was going to be no choice of doctor and therefore no upturning of the dispensary system, no such thing as a new look or a health policy.  They went to the election in that situation.</P>
    <P>Like the publicans, the doctors are highly influential people who wield considerable political influence.  I have many friends among them, great friends, people who vote for me, people for whom I have the greatest respect. My considered opinion is that the majority of doctors in Ireland voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election on the basis of the marriage consummated on that night in Iveagh House.  I do not care whether I lose votes or not for saying that I believe that to be true.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to say what was the truth.  What was the truth?  The truth was of course that the Labour Party were not hogtied to do anything and I am certain that Fine Gael were not either.  In fact, there are quite often two systems. There has been the panel system which exists in England and the fee for consultation system in the Antipodes. The scheme is on the basis that if you went to a doctor, you paid him a fee or signed a document and then the State repaid this.  This is what dispensary doctors would have had to compensate them had they lost money.</P>
    <P>Remember Deputy Hogan of South <Col N="1902" /> Tipperary asked questions here and proved that there are dispensary doctors in this country looking after as many as 2,500 patients and yet in Waterford there is one looking after 250.  The whole dispensary system, as I see it, is tied up not only with the salary paid, which is £1,300 a year, plus a certain allowance for a car, but with the numbers of patients existing within the dispensary district for further practice.  When a local authority wants to change a dispensary district&mdash;when houses have grown up here and there and there is a denudation in population in another place&mdash;they cannot do it without the wish of the dispensary doctor who is the incumbent.  The health authority looking after matters in Louth found they could change the area of a dispensary district only when a dispensary doctor died or retired.  That is the reason why there is a doctor in Waterford looking after 250 people and others in various parts of the country looking after as many as 2,500.</P>

      <P>If this debate did nothing else, it has produced a good result in that we know it now.  It was well hidden under the bushel by previous Ministers for Health.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with this matter of the charge of 10/- per day.  If you look across the broad spectrum of the population you will find that some of us are in hospital only when we get shot or run down by a car while others find themselves in hospital quite often from perhaps some chronic ailment.  The only way to approach this is on the basis of insurance because Deputy O'Connell is quite right when he says that a man with three or four children who has not a medical card will not get it if he is earning something of the order of £14 per week.  It is a very great imposition to find he has to pay 10/- a day for a child of his who might be in hospital for anything from six to 12 months.  A farmer in my constituency has a child who is a haemophiliac and that child has been in hospital for at least three months of the year for the entire period of its life, which is about seven years.  Now the decision as to whether or not the parent has to pay for the child or gets away with less than 10/-a day, rests absolutely with the county manager or whoever the chief executive might be.  I submit to you that whatever you do about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister I know is sincere in his effort to help and I think the Minister will accept that I am sincere in my efforts to help my constituents too. The Minister received three letters from me in the course of the past few months.  I had forgotten that we had not the right to appeal to the Minister under the 1953 Health Act.  The Minister wrote me personal letters and told me that, in fact, the decisions were wrong.

I will certainly take it up if the Minister wants to do that, but I should like to know under what legislation the Minister can remove somebody in the county council.  The Minister has posed a question of what he can do and I want to know under what legislation he can do it.

      <Col N="1906" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>Before section 75 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A housing authority may acquire by agreement any land situate within or without their functional area although the area or tract of land offered for sale by auction or by private treaty is in excess of the reasonable requirements of the authority for immediate and further need, and, having reserved sufficient land for immediate and further needs, the housing authority may dispose of any surplus land.</P>
    <P>(2)  A housing authority may acquire land which is not suitable or convenient for the purposes of this Act provided that the land is acquired with a view to an exchange of that land for suitable land.</P>
    <P>(3)  The power conferred on a housing authority under this section shall be in addition to their powers to acquire land under section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was agreed, but I can move only No. 80. I assume No. 81 cannot be moved at this stage because it belongs to a different section.  However, in order to avoid confusion, I should like it to be clear that we may speak on No. 81 when it comes to its correct place because, if we may not, we might find ourselves in the same position as we did before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is for the purpose <Col N="1907" /> of preventing a recurrence of something that happened quite recently in Dublin County Council.  Dublin County Council needed a considerable amount of land for housing.  The Land Commission acquired an estate near the area.  The county council applied to the Land commission for portion of that estate.  Within a half mile of the estate, there was a portion of land which was eminently suitable for housing but there was more land on it than was actually required at that time for housing in the area.  The advice given by the law agent of the Dublin County Council was as follows:</P>
    <P>This land comes under the scope of section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946, and the section should not give rise to any idea that the council is free to acquire by agreement land for which it has no use for reasonably foreseeable requirements.</P>
    <P>He further advised that:</P>
    <P>The council must be of opinion that it will require the land in the future for the purpose of its powers and duties, and this opinion must be no mere whim or vague idea but a practical idea based on facts which warrant its formation.</P>
    <P>Having been given that opinion, the council were left in the position that they were not able to proceed.  However, they asked the Land Commission if they would be prepared to give them a portion of the land which would be suitable.  Between the village where the houses were acquired and this land was a narrow strip of land on which trees and scrub were growing, and on the edge of this land was the portion the county council wanted.  What did the Land Commission do?  They immediately allocated that portion of land which the county council wanted for houses, and they have now created a situation that the council must either take the scrub and trees and try to clear that or, alternatively, the Land Commission must give them land which is a mile further on and which will cost very much more to develop, including the cost of providing water and sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent a recurrence of <Col N="1908" /> that, we propose this new section and we believe this will allow local authorities to acquire land which they feel they need for housing, which they may not require immediately but may use over a period of years or, if necessary, they may purchase the land, use what they want of it and dispose of the remainder.  We do not think there is anything wrong with that, nor is there any big change suggested in this amendment.  As the law stands, it appears the council may not do it and we are suggesting it is desirable that it should be done.  Therefore, we are asking that this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Labour Party have put down this amendment, because this problem has arisen in exactly the way that Deputy Tully describes.  I personally would have thought, and did think up to that point, that we had power under existing legislation to do what we are pressing should be done in the county council, that we could buy this extra land, and if it was found undesirable to keep all of it, that we could dispose of some of it when we had sufficient for our own needs and when we had picked the most suitable area of it. However, the law agent advised us as Deputy Tully says.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that if another legal opinion were sought the advice might not be the same.  There is still some doubt in my mind as to whether that power exists, in spite of what the law agent has said in this case.  It may be that the law agent advising a county council feels he has an obligation to keep the members of the council from going mad and from spending far too much of the ratepayers' money.  They are not likely to go wrong in that because they have to meet the ratepayers at an early date and will have to answer to them.  It will be appreciated that in an area like County Dublin, where there is such a demand for sites, it is extremely difficult to get suitable sites or adequate land for housing.  If we are to have houses built there in future with any speed, we must have sites and we must have every possible facility to get those sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> This is a problem which is likely to arise in many other instances.  I know another case in the county where a man has a farm and is prepared willingly to dispose of the entire farm but not of half or less than half of it.  Less than half would be sufficient for our needs.  Only that area of the farm can be serviced, the remainder being agricultural land which could beneficially be divided among existing conacre holders who would be very pleased to get it.  There again the law agent could correct us and say that it could not be done.</P>
    <P>It is the second case in which we have pressed for the purchase of the entire farm.  If we try for a compulsory purchase order on this, it is unlikely we will succeed because we cannot show that the whole area cannot be serviced and we cannot say we need the remainder urgently.  We were there in a position to get what would meet our requirements for some time to come and we would be at liberty to do so under the amendment.  We could buy the entire holding and dispose of the part that could not be serviced.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are likely to meet this type of case again and again in County Dublin and in other areas throughout the country.  The case cited by Deputy Tully is typical in areas where there is land available but an inadequacy of power, because we must purchase according to our legal advice.  Sometimes, as a result, we have to purchase the part of the holding which is least suitable, being much more expensive to service.  I advise the Minister to accept the wisdom of the amendment in the interests of getting houses built at reasonable speed when money becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments, or parts of them, do not, to my mind, appear to propose to do anything very useful or revolutionary.  Whatever about the second amendment, there is nothing to the first.  I may have missed some specific cases cited before I came in that might answer the doubts and questions in my mind about the first part of one of the amendments.  I cannot <Col N="1910" /> see a local authority wishing to acquire, by agreement or otherwise, land in excess of their reasonable needs or requirements, when you consider that the overall powers of local authorities will be such that they can acquire land for their own immediate needs, for their programmed and planned needs as to housing in the future, that they can take into account&mdash;and indeed are being urged to do so&mdash;the necessity to take land for private development, whether in individual site lots or group lots.  They can and may provide under our law lands for industry.  If you add all these things, surely you cannot see the necessity for local authorities to acquire lands beyond their reasonable requirements for all or any of these things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has often chosen a pair of shoes.  He chooses two shoes, though one of those he has already might do. He must buy two because shoes are sold in pairs, not singly.  If a local authority need ten acres of land for building houses but the farm available for sale to them for that purpose contains 15 or 20 acres, you have there your pair of shoes.  The farmer will not sell half but he will sell the whole, and if the local authority do not want the whole, he will sell it to somebody else because if he divides it, he will not get as satisfactory a price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a case where Dublin County Council could have acquired a big farm at a reasonable price, could have used some of that for their housing needs and could have sold the rest to the Land Commission, but the law agent said they could not acquire land beyond their urgent requirements.  The Land Commission could acquire it and when the county council asked the Land Commission for a site, they <Col N="1911" /> would find the portion had been divided.  The Minister may say that does not have a bearing on this case. All we ask in the amendments is that where land becomes available, the local authority should have power to acquire it, use what they need and pass on the remainder by sale or otherwise. It cannot be done now, and as a result building sites are being lost to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the Deputy up on the pair of shoes.  Of course I have bought shoes but I have certainly never asked for three shoes and if I did, I would probably be locked up for doing so.  Two shoes are one's reasonable requirements if one has the good fortune to have two feet.  Three shoes would be more in line with the demand in the first part of the amendment. Getting back to what Deputy Tully has said, I agree that where farms of 15, 16, 17 or 20 acres are concerned, they can be acquired.  Any council who abide by their law agent in such circumstances even now cannot have any complaint in this respect. There seems to be something wrong somewhere.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case cited of the 260 acres.  An official of the council indicated that the requirement of the local authority at the time would be met by approximately seven acres. There is an awful lot of difference between seven and 260 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not corrected by the councillors.  I cannot remedy that.  I have time and again indicated this should not happen.  I do not think the Deputy seriously thinks anybody is really convinced that because an unnamed official of the council says the council need only seven acres and that somebody else says the council should <Col N="1912" /> be allowed to buy 260 acres, the official was so seriously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The 260 acres would have been far too much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for the case cited to support this amendment.  It may not have been used by Deputy Clinton but he said he felt the amendment was prompted by happenings in his constituency.  If this is not an apt case, why use it?  It is a bad argument and, to my mind, damns any reasonable case that can be made for the amendments.  I am coming back again to say that where a small amount of land is available and the council can, at a fair price, by agreement and without antagonism get that land only if they take all, then there is no question, either under existing law or future law that may be created under this Bill, but that that council are quite entitled to make their deal for the whole amount rather than to offer what they know a farmer will not agree to.  Furthermore, if the offer is refused by the farmer, as undoubtedly it will be in a certain set of circumstances, then, if it is followed by a compulsory purchase order, it will not be confirmed by any sane Minister for Local Government because it will be quite obvious to him that the viability of the whole, if split in two, will go out the window.  In such a case, I can see no problem to acquire it even though it might be said that the acreage was some six or ten acres, for instance, more than what was needed.  You would have to take into consideration the circumstances in which you are placed.  In such a case, you do not have to ask me and quite candidly, I do not know why you have to ask your legal adviser either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is working back to the worst circumstances of the case.  Treble it, if you like, and still it does not make a case for this amendment.  In fact, I think it ruins it.  I do not think it is a good angle to <Col N="1913" /> quote this as a real example of what you want to prevent happening in the future.  I want to make clear my own belief about the other kind of case, where the number of acres is small, in the total, and the number required are not terribly large and agreement can be got that the viability of the holding can be split without a compulsory order.  In those circumstances, where your needs are running into half or maybe over, I can see no reason why, under the law, you cannot go ahead and get that land.  If I felt that such was the situation or that such a situation would obtain, then I certainly would wish to amend that situation but not to the degree or in the same way or to meet the case outlined by Deputy Tully.  I certainly would not want to go in any direction nearly as far as that.  I do not think we have to go any distance other than what was already provided for, as it will meet all reasonable cases.  I am only on the first part of the amendment; there are four parts.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment, I am glad to be able to tell Deputy Tully and the House, is unnecessary. Local authorities will have full powers of disposal of land under section 87 of the Bill.  This is a section we have not yet come to deal with, so that it is not something we shall not have.  It is something we are already providing for.  I merely draw the attention of the House to that particular section so that Deputies may feel satisfaction that this is so.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear in regard to the intention of the third part of the amendment.  Section 87 would give full power to exchange land.  I do not clearly understand the intention of the amendment.  From what understanding I draw from it at the moment, I feel that section 87 may answer what is sought to be done under it.  I should say, further, that there are reasons to feel, in regard to the amendment itself, as proposed, that if read in certain ways, it could give rise to certain objections which I would have to voice against it.  Perhaps I should leave that in order to find out what is behind the third part of the amendment, about which I am not quite clear.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been harping on the case which I cited. The reason I cited the case was because I wanted to prove to the Minister that when the local authority could not acquire this farm, which they wanted to acquire, it passed out of their hands completely.  They now find themselves in the position that, if they do acquire land, it will be so far away from the services that it will cost the ratepayers and the Department of Local Government and the taxpayers a considerable amount of money to service it, whereas, if the local authority had been allowed, in the start, to acquire&mdash;even though the Minister considers it unreasonable &mdash;it would have been possible to have acquired the portion they wanted and they could have passed the remainder either to the Land Commission or to some other purchaser and no loss would have been incurred.  The law agent's advice, which was sought by the manager and not by the members of the council, suggested that there was no authority to purchase any land in excess of what could be proven as required.  He was very definite that it was not because the estate was so big but because there was no authority to acquire any land in addition to what they required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows well what happens when a local authority attempts to do something which the law agent and the county manager rule is illegal.  The Minister has referred to section 87 and says that this is the cure-all.  If I read it aright, that section simply refers to the disposal of surplus land which is left over when road widening takes place or when there is a building site and there is a small corner, and so on&mdash; small sections of land&mdash;and does not relate to excess land which has been bought for the purpose of buying a site big enough and this is the surplus land attached to it and can be disposed of. If there were no necessity to introduce this section, the amendment would not have been introduced by the Labour Party.  However, because we know that this situation does arise, and that, in fact, it can and will arise again, more so now because of the recent change in planning, we believe it is essential that some type of authority should be given <Col N="1915" /> to allow local authorities to purchase suitable sites even though such land is very much in excess of the amount of land they require for housing.  If the Minister cannot see justice in that, I am afraid I cannot hope to convince him that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to know what is meant by the third part of the proposed section.  It is included because the law agent referred to section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946, and gave as his opinion that it was not strong enough to allow the council to do what they wanted.  That being so, the only way of ensuring that that position is rectified in this legislation is by including a section of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there is nothing revolutionary about it, and I agree. It is a simple, sensible proposal, and I cannot for the life of me see why the Minister is so opposed to it.  If he does not include it, we will continue with the present system under which if the local authority decide they need sites for ten houses, they attempt to buy sites for ten houses.  If it happens that there is a site which would take 12 houses, they feel they are not entitled to purchase it.  Of course, if they were doing right, they would make provision for future building and be prepared to buy sites that would take twice, three times or four times the number of houses they require at the particular time.  I think the Minister should consider this again.  I feel he has the wrong angle on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not read this proposal or any housing legislation already enacted in isolation. He should keep in mind that the local authorities have powers of land acquisition by agreement or compulsion under a number of enactments. For instance, there is section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That section provides that a local authority may acquire land <Col N="1916" /> which they will require in future, without having determined what they are going to do with it.  That is what the Act says.  What the legal adviser says is another matter.  I have no responsibility for his utterances and I would not like to have it.  They talk with divers tongues and some of them are well known for their varied views and have been since I went to the Department. That does not cure the situation and I do not suppose it will be cured. Their job is not to advise the council but to interpret the law as they see it.  Sometimes their advice may run completely counter to what the council have determined on a particular thing.  If the council do not agree with their advice, it is up to the council to take the steps open to them.  They can disagree with their legal adviser and the manager.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Clinton, Deputy Tully and other Deputies who are members of local authorities speak with their tongues in their cheeks when they talk about how councils behave when they are told something by the manager and by the legal adviser.  I know how they behave.  They continue to do exactly what they want to do, despite that advice.  Sometimes there are sham battles which are never intended to be fought to a conclusion. A council will not accept an interpretation, particularly if it is not in conformity with the interpretation that is being operated elsewhere, and may have been operated many times by councils in adjoining areas.  In those circumstances, they do not take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer, and they would be very foolish to start doing so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1946 Act is there.  We also have the Planning Act which seems to be keeping Deputy Tully awake at nights. I think he will agree that the powers in this Act are such that if complaint there was in this House during the passage of that Act, it was that they were too wide.  If we apply the terms of the Act to the purpose underlying it, I think we will find supplementary powers there adequate to supplement those of the 1946 Act and the Housing Bill which we now have before us.  If land is required for the attainment of <Col N="1917" /> planning objectives as set out or determined in an approved development plan, I think it is true to say that there is plenty of power under the Planning Act to acquire that land.  This very often entails the lay-out of towns, cities, and urban areas, housing of the people, zoning of the land, and not only are the council empowered to acquire the land but I think it is their duty to do so in order to avoid the land being put out of their reach for whatever purpose by anyone else.  That is inherent in the Planning Act.</P>
    <P>As I say, taking the Planning Act and the 1946 Local Government Act together with the provisions of this Bill, I do not think there can be any complaint that we have left uncovered any worthwhile grounds on which councils can complain about lack of power to acquire land by agreement or compulsion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably unfortunate that the example of Kenure came up because it looks like extravagant purchasing for housing purposes and other suitable purposes, but while the officials of the councils may advise that seven acres would meet the known needs at the moment, this is a very popular seaside resort and an area which will develop rapidly.  We have in that area about 40 applicants for private sites.  I think 50 acres would not be sufficient not to talk of seven acres. I think we would not be going mad if we had 100 acres.  The fact is that we could get 100 acres at a bargain price if we were allowed to buy the estate and sell the remainder.  To bring that down to a smaller case, we could get 55 acres where we want 20 acres. I think the Minister is fearful that if he accepts the amendment, the county councils all over the country will become land dealers.  I do not think any county council are particularly anxious to become land dealers.  In any case there would always be sufficient people on the council to ensure that such a proposition would not go through if it were crazy.  The number of crazy propositions that would go through would be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we could get 55 acres at a bargain price but we will not get <Col N="1918" /> the 20 acres we require at a bargain price.  I believe we could dispose of the surplus to neighbouring farmers at no loss.  This would not leave the floodgates open.  It would enable the county council, in areas where sites are difficult to acquire, to purchase sites they could not otherwise obtain, except by a long process of compulsory purchase. By the time all the machinery is geared and moving, the opportunity is gone and probably the price has increased threefold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I would like to add is this.  Kenure Park is an example in all the circumstances, but, on the other hand, as outlined by Deputy Clinton, this land or area lying along the seashore will probably become very attractive in the not too distant future when water and other services are available.  This surely comes within the jurisdiction and the calculations of the council and the housing authority to project their needs, not now but in two years or five years time.  This is what we are saying should be done under this Bill and moreover we would hope there would be some programming and planning for ten years, 15 years or even 20 years ahead.</P>
      <P>Surely this place, which is attractive, is within the scope of the local authority or the council to decide that they would want 50 acres.  Even though there is a shortage of services there at the moment, surely they should be able to see that when such services are provided in five or ten years, they will have need of 50 acres.  There is no reason why they should not do so and I hope this is the sort of exercise that will be done.  If we do not do this in the circumstances, the very thing Deputy Clinton has mentioned, and Deputy Tully is afraid of, will happen. You will not have land when you want buildings to go up.  If you cannot have land, you cannot have programming and without programming, you cannot have planning.  We cannot have any continuity in building without all these things.  We can have no security and no real progress in the industry as a whole.  I do not want to take from the argument that this Bill and our present laws are adequate.</P>

      <P>The trouble about this seems to be that the Minister is giving his interpretation here of what he says this Bill means and also what section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946, means.  According to the Minister, there appears to be ample power in section 82 of the 1946 Act to acquire in advance of need.  He says that, but the legal adviser to Dublin County Council says the direct opposite.  He further advises:</P>
      <P>that the Council must be of opinion that it will require the lands in future for the purpose of its normal duties.  This opinion must be no mere whim or vague idea but practical judgment based on facts which warrant its formation.</P>
      <P>This is the advice given by the legal adviser to Dublin County Council, of which, thank God, I am not a member. It shows that the position under the 1946 Act, which the Minister is quoting, is not clear and, for that reason, we believe that the position should be clarified.</P>
      <P>We have put down an amendment which we are asking the Minister to accept in order to clarify it.  If the main objection is that the amendment has been put down otherwise than by the Minister, it would appear that nothing is to be accepted unless it comes from the Government benches. If that is so, we have no objection at all if the Minister will agree to ensure that this is made crystal-clear, that the local authority have the right to acquire in advance of need.  If he is prepared to include that and put it down in black and white so that nobody can misinterpret it, then we are prepared to withdraw this amendment. If the Minister is not prepared to do so, we have no option but to insist on its being put.</P>

      <P>Section 76 is the section which sets out the direction in which we should be thinking in regard to this matter of acquisition for expected requirements of the future.  Let us look at it this way.  The Deputy spoke about facts and opinion given by a law adviser.  There is nothing we can do <Col N="1920" /> here, nothing we ever have done, whether it be on legal advice or court interpretation, that has not got another opinion.  We can do our best and when we have reached the last night and have passed this measure and everybody is satisfied beyond yea or nay, somebody somewhere, either by reason of the opinion of an adviser from the council, or, indeed, the long and tedious trial of a case in the Supreme Court, may be advised otherwise.  The only thing we can do, and what we have always attempted to do, is to try to provide for what we want done.</P>
      <P>We believe we are doing it in this particular case and relating it to whatever powers are in existence and, with all the powers of acquisition, there can be little doubt we have adequate powers.  Probably in some cases if we want to use them and are prepared to use them, even when we are advised to use them&mdash;this probably has an element of truth in it&mdash;we are too timid to use them.  We may have been led into the belief in the past that the interpretation by one law adviser was gospel, and that it was gospel more than the gospel of another law adviser who would have advised me or previous Ministers before I brought in this section.  These are the hazards in regard to interpretation of the law over the years.  They will continue to arise and we can never guarantee that somebody will not upset them and not conform to the law we are trying to clarify in this House.  I still refer back to section 76 of this particular measure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy instanced facts and you would have to produce facts.  I would hope that in the future when a scheme was in the course of preparation for a certain area, you would find that that area was already reserved entirely for building houses: it would be a fact that that was stated in your outlined plans for the future. This, to my mind, would be an adequate fact to answer the interpretation given by the law adviser to Dublin County Council.  If it were stated as <Col N="1921" /> part and parcel of planning under the Planning Acts that this was so, that it was a fact that it was so, it might satisfy the particular legal adviser that this fact alone was enough in regard to this matter.  Therefore this was a need which would have to be met in regard to land reservation in the future and, therefore: &ldquo;All right: buy the land.&rdquo; I am not suggesting that this is what should be done, but I would almost say that you could manufacture the facts by virtue of what would fit the bill if the legal advice runs counter to what you want to do.</P>

      <P>The people who were fighting this case in Dublin used section 82 of the 1946 Act and the advice was that that was not strong enough.  Now the Minister tells us that when we come to section 76, all this is being remedied.  In my opinion, section 76 repeats what was in section 82 and repeats the legal adviser's wording in that.  He says &ldquo;the land will be required by the authority in the future.... to have regard in preparing a building programme.&rdquo;  That, in effect, is what the legal adviser said and that is what section 76 says.  I am afraid the Minister is sticking to the point that because the idea did not come from his side of the House, it is not worth considering.  I am afraid we cannot agree that it should be dumped out in this way and we will have to insist on it.</P>

      <P>Before we part on that note&mdash;not that there is any likelihood of our parting for some time on this Bill&mdash;I should like to refer back to the circular of last May which in paragraph 4, on page 2, says:</P>
      <P>The new powers available to local authorities for forward site acquisition under the Local Government Planning and Development Acts, 1963, should be fully utilised, particularly in towns and larger villages where suitable sites should be acquired, if necessary ahead of environmental services, so that the benefit of the provision of services accrues to the local authority, its tenants or to house purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is actually advocated by me and <Col N="1922" /> I put that to the local authorities in May, along with many other suggestions as to what we could all do to try to provide for this type of forward planning and forward programming of our house building which entails surveying, the assessment of needs, the projection of future needs, the allowance one must make for improving housing standards which our people will demand, new family formations and possibly catering for, we hope, expanded industrial employment.  All these things are outlined in some detail in this circular of May, 1965.  The few lines which I have quoted from that circular are really indicative of meeting the situation which is being put forward as an argument as to why we should have an amendment to what is proposed.  if we can do all these things, there is no answer to Deputy Tully getting up and saying that the legal adviser does not agree with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can answer that.  It is there in this measure of 1963, and if our local authorities are challenged as to whether that is in it or not, the only way to find out is to pursue it to its logical end, that is, that we push it to the limit and get the highest court to interpret, if necessary, what is in the measure.  This is something that is not always necessary but it is something which as far as I see is the only possible answer to Deputy Tully.  It does not matter what one says is in a measure, or how it is operated in the greater part of the country, or how it is going to be operated, or how we feel it should be operated, if Deputy Tully gets up and says: &ldquo;I do not think so and I do not think any legal adviser will agree with you.&rdquo;  Clearly, there is no answer except to say that we think we are right. Equally, he may think he is right, and perhaps in some cases he is, but we are trying to act on the best advice available to us and we would like to continue to use the interpretations we have put on these measures in the past when we were taking them through the House.  Only when they have been duly upset should the local authority <Col N="1923" /> take lying down, as it were, any contrary advice from anybody.  I am saying that not so much as Minister for Local Government as a past member of a local authority.  I do not see why we should always take the advice we get.  In fact we do not and I am sure Deputy Tully does not always take the advice he gets, whether it is legal, technical or otherwise.</P>

I just do not see in what way one can answer the arguments being put forward by Deputy Tully.  I would not say that he does not believe what he is putting up but in a way I suspect that at times he is not fully convinced that good though the argument may sound, it is in fact really sound.  In those circumstances, it is difficult to know how to go about meeting his point of view. I would say, and perhaps I should have said this before we lost sight of the other parts of the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am referring to the four parts of the amendment; I am not talking about another amendment.  I am getting back to the question of what is or what is not contained in section 87 which we will be discussing later.  The question of exchange has been mentioned and I want to reiterate that we feel we are providing for the contingencies mentioned by Deputy Tully.  This question of exchange is covered by the proposals in section 87 and that should remove the necessity for providing for what he seeks in that part of his amendment.  Then, we have the fourth part of this amendment which proposes that this section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.  This is something I do not think is necessary at all.  We are here enacting legislation and my wish is that we enact it as quickly as we can, and if I could have a wish, it would be that we could enact it a little more quickly than it appears we are likely to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This suggestion coming from Deputy Tully is not funny.  Suffice to say that the measure before the House, if and when enacted, is intended to operate and, to put in an amendment to say that when it has been passed it will operate, is rather laying it on a bit thick.  There is probably no harm in that and indeed, when these amendments were put down, Deputy Tully may have had the feeling that it is I who would have been holding up the passage of this Bill rather than others who had views to express, including himself, and this may have been motivated by something I saw recently arising from some deliberations of the Labour Party at which, I think, it was intimated that they were going to ensure that the measure would go ahead and be got through the House. As it turned out, either we listened to the Labour Party and acted accordingly because we have discussed practically nothing else but housing since the Recess or perhaps there was a feeling <Col N="1925" /> that this was necessary and that we should not only get the measure moving but that we should actually operate it from the date it was passed.</P>
    <P>It should be evident to the House that so far as I am concerned no spur is needed to get this measure into operation but that is not to say that we should not discuss it fully and completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that we all want to accomplish the same thing, and that includes the Minister.  We want to arm local authorities with sufficient power to get the necessary land for all the houses they need for at least five or six years ahead.  I am supporting this amendment because it was put down as a result of experience which showed that when we were trying to get sites, we met with formidable opposition.  It is for that reason that Deputy Tully and I want to see this amendment in the Bill.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that he sent out a circular last May giving all sorts of advice.  There are certain law agents who have a healthy disrespect for such circulars and indeed for statements made by the Minister in the House.  They simply say: &ldquo;That is not the law.&rdquo;  They are in a position to say that.  I do not suggest they totally disrespect Ministerial statements or circulars, but they give that impression if they want to oppose something that members of the council are pushing forward.  It is because of that sort of opposition that can be built up, because the matter is not covered in legislation, that we are anxious to see this amendment included in the legislation to ensure that there will be no way out, no way of building up a case against us.  I do not think that if this is accepted, it will be misused, but I believe it will be of considerable benefit to certain housing authorities in acquiring the land they are likely to need for housing and other purposes in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to have by a pure coincidence a copy of the circular to which the Minister has referred, dated 24th May, 1965, addressed to housing authorities, which goes into great detail about <Col N="1926" /> certain surveys local authorities have to carry out and the acquisition of sites, but right through the circular runs the theme that it is sites for the purpose of filling future housing needs. I do not know if there has been a mistake&mdash;perhaps we are not getting across to the Minister; perhaps we are on different wavelengths&mdash;but what we have been trying to say to him in this debate is that we are asking in the amendment that land should be acquired in excess of needs if the land we need can only be acquired in that way.  If somebody had a farm which is more than we need but the sites on that farm are suitable, we should be entitled to buy the farm, use what we need of it and sell the remainder: otherwise, the farmer will not sell to us.  I think there is nothing unreasonable in that, as the Minister will agree.</P>
      <P>The Minister keeps on saying that this is already provided for and I am saying it is not provided for in section 82 of the 1946 Act or in section 76 of the present Act or in the circular, because in each case the reference is to the housing needs and what can be done for future needs but in no case is it spelled out that a local authority is entitled to buy or acquire more land than they need and dispose of the remainder. The amendment contains another subsection which we have passed over and lest it be completely ignored, it is the subsection that says:</P>
      <P>A housing authority may acquire land which is not suitable or convenient for the purposes of this Act provided that the land is acquired with a view to an exchange of that land for suitable land.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of numerous cases even in his own area where it may be possible to acquire land pretty easily but is not suitable for housing and it may be possible&mdash;to use a country expression &mdash;to swop that land at a later stage for land which is suitable for housing. We ask that permission to do that be given to local authorities because as far as I can find out, leaving aside the interpretation given by the Dublin law agent, it is not contained anywhere in existing legislation or in the Ministerial circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> The Minister referred to the point that this has come up at our annual conference.  That is true.  This matter was raised and it was suggested we should try to get this Housing Bill dealt with as quickly as possible.  That is why the fourth part of the amendment provides that the section shall come into operation on the passing of this Bill.  We can hardly be blamed for putting that down because the first time this legislation was mooted was in October, 1963.  We are not blaming the Minister for that: we know the Minister is not the last word on legislation, even so far as Local Government is concerned, and we are trying to give him a friendly push where a little extra power may be needed to ensure this is done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>If he wants to know why we are going into such detail regarding sections of the Bill, let me refer to the statement I made the first day we started to discuss this in Committee: we were codded with the Planning Act of 1963; we are not going to be codded with this one.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Tully is being innocent to a degree beyond his capacity of innocence in this whole matter.  Even Deputy Clinton believed that long since, but I would say to the Deputy and the House that it is not the want of powers that should be questioned in regard to local authorities in this matter of land for their use in the future.  If anything, the question might well be asked whether in fact they may not be getting too much power for land acquisition in their functional areas.  This is a point we can reach.  It is possible we would be going beyond that point if we were to set out by way of agreement or otherwise that local authorities should acquire land beyond their reasonable needs and expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The Minister should be fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much difference when it comes to operating these things.  Section 82 (i) of the 1946 Local Government Act reads as follows:</P>
      <P>A local authority may, with the consent of and subject to any conditions imposed by the Minister, acquire by agreement, whether by way of purchase, lease or exchange, any land, whether situate within or outside their functional area, which in their opinion they will require in the future for the purposes of their powers and duties notwithstanding that they have not determined the manner in which or the purpose for which they will use the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that does not give local authorities&mdash; even 20 years ago&mdash;sufficient power to hang themselves with land transactions, I do not know what we can devise.  In addition, there is the Planning Act, the other provisions in this Bill and other more refined provisions we may have in other enactments. Therefore, I do not think there can be any doubt that they have the power.  The question is: are they prepared to use it, or are they prepared to be stopped in doing what they feel is <Col N="1929" /> right and what the Minister for Local Government of the time says is right? It is a question whether the local members and the Minister see eye to eye on these matters.  If they do, it does not matter what the legal adviser says.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 81:</P>
      <P>In page 52, between lines 32 and 33, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A housing authority may be authorised to acquire land by agreement or otherwise for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition, by agreement or otherwise, of land under tillage, within or adjacent to an urban area, non-municipal town or an area serviced by water and sewerage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is related to the matter we discussed very fully on the previous section.  The purpose here is <Col N="1930" /> to deal with a case of somebody who has tillage land and is not anxious to sell.  It might be possible to acquire other tillage land and arrange a &ldquo;swop&rdquo; with him.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is that a housing authority may be authorised to facilitate the purchase of land under tillage?  Land jobbing is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be a little clearer on this.  What is suggested here is that a council should be enabled to buy land they have no intention of using either now or in the future?  It would be purchased on the basis that either in the near or distant future it would be useful in offering to somebody with land the council wished to develop?  In other words, it would be used as a method of acquiring land by agreement?  Surely this is getting us &ldquo;round the bend&rdquo; completely? What would your legal advisers say about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the intention but I think it is creating a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.  There are ways and means of dealing with the case where a person has a bit of land on which they are earning a living and with which they do not wish to part. Money may not compensate such a person for his livelihood unless the price per acre was beyond anything reasonable.  The only way of paying him for his land would be, perhaps, to get him ten times the acreage three or four miles away from this little place on which he was earning his livelihood by market gardening or something else.  Surely it is not beyond the capabilities of council members, the manager and his advisers, including <Col N="1931" /> the legal adviser, if such land is available at a fair price, to acquire that land.  Would that not be the obvious way?  If, say, you or I wanted to do this sort of deal, we would know how to go about it; we would probably consult someone like Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

Be that as it may, I still suggest this sort of roundabout transaction, which is unlikely to arise very frequently, can be resolved by the ingenuity of councillors such as Deputy Tully and others, who know how these things can be done peaceably and agreeably without officialdom at either the local level or the central government level knowing anything. That is, I think, the best solution as against providing this sledge-hammer which might subsequently be used for all sorts of purposes.</P>

      <P>Long ago, when local authorities had no county managers, this practice was frequently carried out.  This sort of swop took place.  No one came down from the Department in answer to a phone call from the county manager to say that it was illegal and that it could not be done.  Having county managers now, and having to abide by the advice they give, I cannot see how a local authority could do what the Minister suggests.  If it could be done I agree it appears to be the ideal way but, for the life of me, I cannot see how any local authority would be prepared to agree that they should buy a portion of land without telling anybody, and then go and try to acquire land for housing purposes adjacent to the town without anybody knowing anything about it.  Presumably they will have to wear masks.  I do not know if they will have to disguise their voices. That might be difficult.  I cannot <Col N="1932" /> understand how this could be done. However, it is tied up with the previous amendment and, since the Minister was so strongly opposed to the previous one, I do not propose to press this either.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>Before section 77, page 52, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the Minister is satisfied that any housing authority or two or more housing authorities jointly, or any authorised association, are prepared to purchase and develop any land as a garden city (including a garden suburb or a garden village), or any land in regard to which a town-planning scheme may be made for the purpose of such a scheme for the area in which the land is situate, in accordance with a scheme approved by him, he may acquire that land on behalf of the authority or association either by compulsion or by agreement in any case in which it appears to him necessary or expedient so to do for the purpose of securing the development of the land as aforesaid, and may do all such things as may be necessary to vest the land so acquired in the housing authority or association.</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions of this Act relating to the powers of a housing authority to acquire land shall apply for the purpose of the acquisition of land by the Minister under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> (3)  A housing authority shall have power to acquire land for the purposes of a scheme approved by the Minister under this section, and to develop any land so acquired in accordance with the scheme, and shall have power to borrow any money required for the purpose of so acquiring or developing any land.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section authorised association means any society, company or body of persons approved by the Minister whose objects include the promotion, formation, or management of garden cities (including garden suburbs and garden villages), and the erection, improvement or management of buildings for the working classes and others, which does not trade for profit or whose constitution forbids payment of any interest or dividend at a higher rate than six per centum per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a very long amendment, but this is a very long Bill.  Presumably there will be a very long discussion. So far as we can find out there is no provision in the Bill to allow these things to be done.  If there is provision perhaps the Minister would point it out to me now before I develop my argument any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Try as we may, we have failed to turn up any attempt to utilise this old enactment.  We regard the section as obsolete because it has never been invoked since it appeared on the Statute Book.  Having regard to the enactments of 1934, 1939 and the Planning Act of 1963 the provision is, in fact, now obsolete.  Apart altogether from the powers in the Acts I have mentioned, we also have a new device, one that can be very effective; I refer to the National Building Agency.  It is attached to the Department and it has freedom to do things that the local authority could not do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have power to provide housing and associated services and those services include amenities <Col N="1934" /> on a very wide scale.  One that comes to mind immediately is the Ballymun project.  They are engaged on this project at the moment.  The National Building Agency have demonstrated that they are capable of doing these things.  As well as that, the Minister may in future do things where he feels the local authority have neglected to do them.  Taking all these matters into consideration, the background against which the 1919 Act was framed is seen to have altered very radically and whatever need may have inspired the insertion of that section at that time has been largely displaced by the other newer devices we are operating today and capable of operating to a degree that will meet the intention behind the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the Ballymum project that he has referred to has, in fact, been operated under the 1919 Act?  One of the reasons why we proposed the insertion of this section is that we believe the Minister would otherwise lose a valuable section which he has used, perhaps for the first time, in relation to Ballymun.  He said it has never been used as far as he knows but Ballymum is one case where it is being used.  Secondly, if the section is not inserted, does the Minister believe that a local authority can carry out the developments suggested in the amendment?  Is the exclusion of the section not a backward step?  The fact that it was not operated from 1919 until now and is now being operated proves that there is something in it and that its exclusion was a mistake. Therefore, we are giving the Minister an opportunity of restoring it.</P>

If we build 100 houses in any area in the county adjacent to the city it could be described as a garden suburb.  The power is certainly already existing.  I would be amazed to find that it is not.  It is only a question of whether it is 10 houses or 200 houses.  We have power now to provide sites for schools, churches and recreation centres.  Surely, that is all part of a garden city?  Perhaps Deputy Tully might have other definitions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the suggestion that the Minister should acquire land, there is not anything that I feel we require or that was provided in the 1919 Act that we have not already got or are not now providing.  It is true to say, also, that the 1919 Act did not in itself confer power on the Minister for Local Government to acquire land compulsorily.  To put the Minister for Local Government into the position of acquiring land compulsorily would run completely contrary to the generally accepted principle that the Minister in regard to compulsory acquisition must in many cases act in a quasi-judicial manner.  If he were to enter the field as a person who could exercise power of compulsory acquisition his quasi-judicial position would have to be altered and we would have to take the Minister for Local Government out of these cases and put in somebody else who in turn could sit in judgment, as it were, on what the Minister for Local Government proposed to do in invoking the power proposed for him in the amendment.  I do not think that would be a good thing to do.  I do not think the indications are that it would be worth all the trouble it would entail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> In addition, I am satisfied that the existing enactment, particularly relying on the Planning Acts and on the National Building Agency and the section which we hope to have enacted in this Bill providing that a Minister for Local Government may go in where a local authority has failed to do any of its jobs, after due warning, gives the Minister sufficient power.  If the Minister for Local Government should at some stage find himself in the position that he has to go into a local authority area to build a garden, city or village or town he certainly will be empowered to acquire by agreement, all the land that might be necessary but I still do not think that it would be a good idea that he should be given power of compulsory acquisition over and above the powers that the local authority have already vested in them.  That is my view of it. I do not believe the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 83:</P>
      <P>Before section 77, page 52, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Before allocating any land for the purposes of the Land Acts the Land Commission shall inform a housing authority of the area and location of such land and the manager of the authority shall place any such communication before the next meeting of the authority.</P>
      <P>(2) Whenever a housing authority informs the Land Commission that the authority needs land in any specified area for their powers and duties and certifies that all or part of the lands in the hands of the Land Commission is suitable, the Land Commission shall first make an allocation of suitable land to the housing authority before allotting the lands for the purposes of the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> (3) Whenever any local authority has land surplus to their needs that local authority shall, before disposing of the surplus land, offer the land to the housing authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The case for this amendment is the same case as we made earlier except that it is the tail-end of the case.  In County Dublin, where an allotment was available, after the law agent had refused to allow the local authority to purchase all the estate, the Land Commission purchased the estate. There was, first of all, an area of shrubs and trees which was absolutely no use for housing and which was nearest to the town.  That covered roughly half a mile from the main street in a long narrow stretch.  Next to that was a portion of land eminently suitable for housing and only half a mile from the existing services, water and sewerage.  Beyond that was a portion of land which would also be suitable for housing but which was three-quarters of a mile to a mile from existing services and from the town.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason, despite the fact that the Land Commission were asked by the local authority to give or to sell the portion of land which was suitable for housing to the local authority, they did not do so.</P>
    <P>Not alone did they not do so but, in fact, they allocated to smallholders small parcels of land.  I think I have the particulars here&mdash;six acres, three roods, five acres, five acres, four to six acres, three acres, two acres, two acres, one acre, slightly over an acre &mdash;allocated to a lot of people.  I have no objection at all.  I would be the last person in this House to object to local smallholders, particularly market gardeners, getting extra small portions of land.  But the objection we have is that the land away from the village and the services was just as suitable to the smallholders, while the land beside the services was the ideal land for development and would have cost the Department of Local Government and, through them, the taxpayer much less money than the development of the site which is at present being offered by the Land Commission at the other end of the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> The suggestion is that, in cases like this, if the Land Commission acquire a farm, they should be required, before allocating any land, to inform the housing authority of the intention to allocate the land.  Therefore, the local authority could then decide whether or not they needed some of that land and whether or not it would be suitable.  I mentioned particularly a County Dublin case, not because I am familiar with County Dublin but because this case has been brought to my notice and it seems to be an ideal one to use as an example.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country at the present time&mdash;and particularly in my own constituency&mdash;we have the Land Commission acquiring land, large farms, and the local authorities are in urgent need of the acquired sites.  They cannot get these sites.  We believe the onus should be put on the Land Commission to notify the local authority that they have acquired land in their functional area and ask the local authority what land they require for housing, before they divide any of the land or do anything else with it.  I think it is a perfectly reasonable suggestion and one which the Minister should accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The ideas behind the amendment are I think, in themselves, laudable enough but I question very much whether or not the intentions of the first two parts of the amendment are really serving a useful purpose. For instance, surely the information which the Land Commission would be required to furnish to the local authority in regard to the Land Commission's intention to make allocations of land in that local authority's area would be rather gratuitous, in the sense that the dogs in the streets know a long time before there are any allocations at all.  That is one of our problems.  They have land far too long before they do anything with it and this is probably a true criticism, although there are good reasons for it, as we have often found out.  So the actual intention to require the Land Commission to furnish the information that they intend to do this or that about certain lands they have acquired <Col N="1939" /> is really giving them nothing.  As the Deputy has said, the manager probably does not know.  If he does not, what are the 20 or 30 councillors doing?  I am quite sure they will inform him particularly if there is any likelihood at all that any part of the lands already acquired are needed or are suitable for housing.</P>
      <P>In regard to the practice in the past, I understand&mdash;and I am subject to correction in this&mdash;the Land Commission do generally co-operate with the local authorities in the provision of land arising from an acquisition they may have made, where that land required for the local authority might be a genuine case, and where the circumstances could be regarded as reasonable, at the same time ensuring that the demands of the housing authority are not so great as to run contrary to the intentions of the Land Acts, under which the lands would have been acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Land Commission's acquisition procedures over the years are rather slow to make themselves felt.  In other words, I would say that the Land Commission in most cases are probably the last interested party to come by the knowledge that land is available.  In most cases the local county councillor and indeed the locals living around any particular plot of land likely to go on the market, are, in nine cases out of ten, aware either by intuition or information for years before the Land Commission make a move.  They know in fact that a particular piece of land is up for acquisition and will fall to somebody one way or another in the not too distant future.  With that knowledge, which can be imparted and further conveyed through to the manager of the council, surely if anything else can be done the simple remedy to forestall any action by the Land Commission or anybody else would be for the local authority in question to put a CPO on the requisite amount of land in the estate or farm in question, thereby safeguarding, as it were, their interest in the lands.  With their undoubted early knowledge of <Col N="1940" /> the happenings around the countryside, through the information of the council elected members, there should be little likelihood that lands which are of any use to or badly needed by the council would have already been identified. Any hint that they are for sale or likely to be for sale would be acted upon in the normal way if there was an agreement to a sale and if they have this CPO which will safeguard the interests of the council, no matter what might happen thereafter.</P>
    <P>In regard to part (3) of the amendment which says:</P>
    <P>Whenever any local authority has land surplus to their needs that local authority shall, before disposing of the surplus land, offer the land to the housing authority.</P>
    <P>there is not, as I see it, a great deal of need for this provision, since the housing authorities and the local authorities generally make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that I do not go much for the case made by Deputy Tully, I am inclined to agree that there is something in the third part of his amendment, and that something should be done about this matter. Although on this question of the power of a county manager, he does not seem to have authority even to <Col N="1942" /> meet Deputy Tully's wishes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we wanted to follow that hare, it could prove something completely different, but I do not intend to discuss something that has nothing to do with this legislation. While I do not agree with many of the arguments that have been made, I do think there is something to be said for the intention of the third part of the amendment and I should like to have another look at the amendment with a view to doing something about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from what the Minister has said that he has no serious objection to this amendment.  The only case he has made is that most of it is unnecessary. The first part of the amendment requires the Land Commission to give certain information to the housing authority.  The housing authority would have that information in most cases.  If they do, well and good; if they do not, this section would operate to assist them.  The Minister sees no objection to the first part but thinks it unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Santry Court, it would be wrong to say the housing authority were not aware that this land was available.  They were aware the land was being disposed of, but they were discouraged from purchasing the land. They were discouraged from being among the people who were bidding for the land because they were advised there would be no services available for that land in Santry Court, and consequently they had no further interest in it.  Another authority, whatever advice they had&mdash;and I have no reason to believe they had any exceptional advice that the housing authority had not&mdash;bought it and, as Deputy Tully says, bought it at a very cheap price.  The services were made available for their purposes afterwards, but that has not come to fruition, and even if it did, I suppose it could not <Col N="1943" /> require anything like the same services that would be needed for a worthwhile housing estate.</P>
    <P>Every part of the amendment is useful.  It does something that would be beneficial to the housing authority and should be written into the Bill.  It is an additional help to the end we all have in mind, that is, the provision of adequate housing, if and when the money is available.  The Minister sees no serious objection to any part of the amendment.  He says some of it is unnecessary but he could not say that it would detract in any way from the legislation if it were included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister's assurance that he will look at this amendment again, as it indicates a favourable disposition.  I should like to support Deputy Tully in the case he has made.  He gave an instance not only of what could happen but of what has happened in regard to an area of land within approximately four miles of the city of Dublin.  The local health authority owned that ground and sold it without regard to the future, although at the time they were repeatedly advised of the needs of the county council and were repeatedly advised of the future value and attractiveness of the property.  It was sold in 1960 but the peculiar thing about it is that two attempts were made years previously to sell that ground, before the establishment of the Dublin Health Authority, but it was decided by the then authority, the Grangegorman Joint Board, that they would not dispose of it because of its proximity to the city and the possibility of future development there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister made reference to the question of possible difficulties there arising from proximity to the airport.  One thing that must be remembered is that sometimes not only county managers but Ministers do not exchange information to the extent they could.  Although there was quite a suspicion for many years that the sole difficulty about building in some form in the area arose from the views of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at no stage did the Minister <Col N="1944" /> for Industry and Commerce sign any certificate prohibiting building on that site.  The signing of such a certificate would have enabled the authority that owned it, Grangegorman Joint Board, to recover compensation.  No certificate was signed but some kind of a ploy was worked between the various Ministers&mdash;I do not say the present Minister&mdash;and officials.  I do not think anyone will ever discover exactly what machinations occurred in relation to Santry Court.  Attempts were made twice to sell it under the Grangegorman Joint Board, but on the two occasions the members of that body resisted because of its value, within four miles of the centre of the city of Dublin, 200 acres of ground which was bound to be needed by the city.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has stressed in this Bill not only the necessity to acquire ground for the immediate purpose of local authority housing but the need to anticipate requirements.  This was a case in point where the county council, having an immediate need, were also anticipating future requirements. I do not think it unfair to say that pressure from Ministerial level&mdash; not the present Minister&mdash;has affected the views of officials of the local authority concerned.  Deputy Tully said there was some excuse at some stage that the county council could not get land for housing because of the lack of services.  Anyone inside or outside the House will agree that the call of a modern hotel on a water supply or on sewerage services is greater than that of a local authority housing scheme of the size concerned here.</P>
    <P>Much nearer to the airport, approval was given for the erection of a modern hotel within a year or so of the ground being disposed of.  Peculiarly enough, the land was not sold to the owners of the proposed hotel but to a private party and the portion of the ground was leased to the people interested in the hotel project.  There was a difficulty at a point of time about sewerage but this could have been got over as, I feel quite sure, the Minister is aware.  The area in which the council were anxious to get porperty lies very close to the area in Ballymun where there is a scheme of flats.  I should be <Col N="1945" /> glad if the Minister told us now or on some other occasion how the problems in relation to the development of Santry Court have been got over, not only in relation to hotels and ordinary dwellings but in relation to the flats which have been erected close by.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated he is sympathetic with the third part of the amendment which, as far as we are concerned, is the major portion of the proposed provision.  It deals with the Land Commission who, surely, have responsibility in this matter.  It may well be, as the Minister has said, that the dogs in the village street know when the Land Commission acquire land in an area but I can tell the Minister that it is amazing the lack of contact there is between the officials of various local authorities and the Land Commission.  It is amazing how often senior officials of a local authority have been unaware of the availability of land on which houses could be built and community facilities developed.  Santry Court is an example of what should not happen and the amendment would preclude it happening in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have another look at the second part of the amendment and not continue to assume that because the Land Commission should exchange information with local authorities, they will always do so. There is no assurance of that, unless it is set down that they are required to do it.  If they are so required, they can be asked why they did not do it, but if they are not required, they are not obliged to give an answer.  Deputy Tully gave information in relation to an occurrence in a certain area and I am quite sure he would be willing to enlarge on that information, if the Minister so desires.  I trust the Minister will have another look at the second part of the amendment and have it included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene because I feel local authorities have already been given in this Bill adequate means to acquire any land they may need.  To extend it further would also extend the amount of paper work and interdepartmental communication to no great benefit.  If we wish to get the <Col N="1946" /> Land Commission choked up quickly with paper work this is the surest way of going about it.  If we accept the amendment, the Land Commission will have to wait until the housing authority in the area concerned indicate what land they might need in the future and the result will be that land is frozen until the housing authority make their minds up.</P>
      <P>No local authority need be frightened about their ability to acquire land for housing purposes. They can proceed to a compulsory purchase order and they can serve notices and purchase land.  Generally, land is sold by public auction or private treaty and indeed, as the Minister has told us, where the Land Commission take over land, the dogs in the street are aware of it, and so also must members of local authorities. The amendment is not necessary.  It might have sound features here and there about which I would be in agreement but I am against this danger of a build-up of communication between the Land Commission and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The proposed new section suggests that the Land Commission shall notify local authorities so that any land they do not need will be offered to the local authorities.  There may be a case made for this but I submit that the local authorities already have adequate means of acquiring the land they need. There may be cases such as Deputy Tully and Deputy Larkin cited, a certain estate in Dublin, but if I remember correctly, that was fully advertised and the town planning requirements adequately published.  It went by public auction and I cannot see why the Dublin Health Authority, who had to approve of certain matters in relation to the site, did not step in and buy it.  Despite the fact that it was sold five or six years ago, I have not seen any building on it, though I am aware of the intention to erect the hotel mentioned by Deputy Larkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that local authorities, acting with the full powers they already have and surveying their needs, are not prohibited by the Bill from acquiring any land they need.  In <Col N="1947" /> fact, I think there is adequate means in this Bill whereby they can do just that and then you can proceed with the provision of drains, water mains, and so on.  I do not think the Minister need accept this amendment.  The Bill pretty well covers everything that is required.  If there is any one particular point, it would be subsection (3) and that is if there were any messing about, as it were, in the local authorities themselves under the various departments: there might be a point in that.  I think the other two parts, involving the Land Commission, would have only a delaying effect on action by the Land Commission.  Today, we want the Land Commission to act with expedition and authority.  The more people we ask the Land Commission to serve, the more we should leave the Land Commission to purchase land for the relief of congestion.  If there is any consideration to be given, then, I would say it is to subsection (3) of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been consciously rude to any Deputy and I hope Deputy Gallagher will not consider me rude to him now when I say he has been talking a lot of cod. Unfortunately, he did not hear the debate because, if he had heard it, he would not have said what he has just said.  All the Labour Party are suggesting in this amendment is that one letter be sent from the Land Commission to one local authority when the Land Commission acquire a farm in that local authority area.  If that will clutter up all the channels between the local authority and the Land Commission and if we shall have to put extra postmen on duty and extra staff at both ends to deal with it, then it will have to be a very peculiar letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter of that type would be absolutely useless unless you give it effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the third shoe.  That is No. 1.  Now I come to <Col N="1948" /> No. 2.  Nobody suggests that the work of the Land Commission should be interfered with.  Surely Deputy Gallagher does not suggest that the Land Commission acquire a farm and rush off to divide it immediately?  I challenge anybody to say that farms acquired by the Land Commission have been divided in less than two years, from two years to 12 years, and I can give thousands of examples of them, all over the place.  Surely, within those two years, they could notify the local authority and the local authority could notify them of their housing needs for the area and how much land they would require.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher misread subsection (2) of the proposed section when he spoke about the Land Commission having any land left.  That is not the suggestion at all.  The suggestion is that the local authority should be in a position to ask the Land Commission for whatever land they require for housing in the area.  The Minister earlier asked if we could not put a compulsory purchase order on the original owner.  It is amazing the number of farms that are acquired at the present time without anybody except the owner and the Land Commission being aware of it.  Afterwards, of course, everybody knows about it, knows who will get portion of it, and so on, but it is amazing the number of properties that are acquired without anybody knowing about it until later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be a better judge of what happens in Meath than anybody else here, except perhaps Deputy Farrelly.  He will agree with me that this sort of thing does happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to subsection (3) of the proposed new section.  Mention was made of Santry Court.  There is not the slightest doubt that an awfully stupid thing was done by a local authority in regard to Santry Court. Everybody knew that the proposal to sell was there, and so on.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind, who knows anything about it, that, in fact, <Col N="1949" /> the deal was carried through before it was publicised, and, in fact, that land which was needed badly for housing either by Dublin County Council or by Dublin Corporation, was allowed to go for a song&mdash;and it was not one of the Beatles' songs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It was advertised for public tender, if I remember aright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not remember aright.  If he did, he would not have made the statement he did make.  I am making a statement of fact, that this is what happened.  A further point is that an hotel was to be built there.  That hotel would require more services, as Deputy Larkin said, than a scheme of workingclass houses for the whole area would take.  I am not accusing anyone of criminal intent. All I say is that a local authority did an incredibly stupid thing and now we propose that, before land is disposed of by a local authority, the housing authority shall have a right to look at it.  The Minister should also have another look at the first two subsections because I think the longer he looks at them the more he will realise the justice of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure he will agree with me that, at the present time, land for housing is becoming mighty scarce.  It is amazing how difficult local authorities are finding it to acquire land in places where, a few years ago, they could pick it up pretty easily.  Because of the system by which they acquire only their exact needs, they are now finding it extremely difficult and, following the famous Planning Act, as I mentioned the other day, housing areas, where development can take place, are being acquired by groups of individuals who are now trying to sell them back to the local authority or to anybody else for ten times what they were worth a year ago before the Planning Bill was passed.  Therefore, I think every effort should be made to ensure that any land that can be got at a reasonable price will be notified to the local authority so that they cannot say, for instance: &ldquo;The Land Commission had a farm and we wanted 20 sites in that area.  If we had known <Col N="1950" /> that the Land Commission were taking over that farm, we could have acquired sites on it.&rdquo;  If the Land Commission notify them and there is an arrangement by which a loan can be made available from the Land Commission to the local authority at a reasonable price, I think it solves it all.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to accept the amendment as it is but to give further consideration to the three portions of the amendment.  If he does that, then we are satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Would I be right in saying that it was for public sale, that something has now come out relevant to the fact that it would not be allowed for housing?

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am suggesting that the restrictions made it unattractive to the local authority because sufficient houses were not being allowed, arising from the planning authority decision, and that that same planning authority would have had very definite and direct concern because it would have been part of the same local authority.</P>
      <P>So far as the hotel project is concerned, I have information, rightly or wrongly, and subject to correction, that this particular portion of land in its offering for sale was indicated as suitable for the building of an institution. I do not know whether the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; was used.  If that is so&mdash;and I am told it is&mdash;I cannot see where any great objection can be taken if the proposed hotel which has not yet materialised emerges, because if this is suitable for an institution, if that is the manner in which it was advertised, then the services required for an institution would be no different from the services required for an hotel.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Larkin's query&mdash;and I presume he asked the question only because he already knows the answer&mdash;as to why we can now get over all these difficulties in land which is almost adjacent to the Santry Court land, the answer is that I arrived.  Deputy Larkin knows that. He asked me to say it and I thank him for the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to support this amendment in its very broad principle, and I want <Col N="1954" /> to support it in its entirety.  We all fully agree that the acquisition of land for housing purposes must be a first priority but, at the same time, we would wish, I hope, to cause as little inconvenience as possible to private individuals who want to hold on to their land.</P>
      <P>This amendment would place an obligation on the Land Commission, when they acquire land, to consult with the housing authority and see if they can meet the needs of the housing authority.  When the Land Commission acquire land, either by compulsion or by private purchase, that land for the time being is no man's land.  It is held in trust by the Land Commission until such time as it is allocated.  It is only reasonable that that land should be at the disposal of the housing authority for their housing purposes, if it is suitable.  In that way the housing authority might avoid the compulsory acquisition of land in the locality from a person who might not want to part with it.  There should be co-operation between the Land Commission, on the one hand, and the housing authority, on the other. I think that is what is behind the amendment.</P>
      <P>If there were that co-operation between the Land Commission and the housing authority, the landowners in the locality who wanted to hold on to their land might be spared a lot of inconvenience and hardship and, at the same time, the requirements of the housing authority might be met, and the Land Commission might still have sufficient land for the relief of congestion in the area.  I strongly urge the Minister on those grounds seriously to consider the amendment in its entirety.</P>

      <P>Before we leave this amendment, I should like to clear up one point.  I was, and am, a member of the Dublin Health Authority who owned this land.  I am also a member of the local authority who were anxious to get it for housing, so I know something about it.  I want to say quite clearly that the land was disposed of by the health authority in a perfectly legal and open way.  We <Col N="1955" /> were given certain information, which was that services would not be available, and consequently the county council did not buy the land.  That was the information they were given at the time and they did not compete when it was being sold.  It was eventually sold at a competitive price at that time.  Subsequently the person who bought it sold it again.</P>
      <P>Then suddenly the services became available.  No new sewer was provided. There was no scheme that would give the additional capacity.  Suddenly a second owner was informed he could go ahead and build this magnificent hotel and all the services would be available. That is the only thing that arises on this.  There has been undue influence on the part of somebody but it is wrong to say the housing authority were not aware of the sale.  They were perfectly well aware of it and perfectly free to buy it but they were certainly given wrong information in relation to the services available.</P>

    <P>(ii)  in case such an application is made and is not withdrawn, and the Court decides neither to quash the order as confirmed as aforesaid, nor to quash the order in so far only as it affects any property of the applicant&mdash;become operative on the date of the determination of the application,</P>
    <P>(b)  in case an application mentioned in <i>subsection</i> (2) of this section is made and is not withdrawn, and the Court decides to quash the order in so far only as it affects any property of the applicant&mdash;become operative, on the date of the determination of the application, in so far as it affects any property other than the said property of the applicant.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subject to the provisions of <i>subsection</i> (2) of this section, a person shall not question a compulsory purchase order by prohibition or <i>certiorari</i> or in any legal proceedings whatsoever.</P>
    <P>This amendment is really to add to what is contained already in section 77.  Subsection (3) of that section provides that a compulsory purchase order shall become operative at the expiration of 21 days after publication by the housing authority of notice that the Minister has made a confirmation order confirming the compulsory purchase order or where an aggrieved person questions the validity of the compulsory purchase order and the court decides neither to quash an order if confirmed nor quash it in so far as it affects only the property of the applicant on the date of the determination by the court of the application.  Amendment 84 provides for the further cases where the <Col N="1957" /> court decides to quash a compulsory purchase order in so far as it affects the property of the applicant.  In this case the order will become operative in respect of the balance of the land, if any, to which it relates from the date of the determination by the court of the application.  It is really an addition to the powers already in section 77 (3).</P>

      <P>(5) So soon as may be after a compulsory purchase order has become operative, the housing authority shall serve a copy thereof on every person on whom a notice was served by them of their intention to submit the order to the Minister for confirmation.</P>
      <P>Section 17 (5) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, provides that as soon as a compulsory purchase order has become operative the local authority shall serve a copy of the order on every person on whom notice was served by them of their intention to submit the order to the Minister for confirmation.  This amendment will make a similar provision in relation to compulsory purchase orders made under this Bill.

    <P>I should say, in explanation of this particular amendment, that in section <Col N="1958" /> 79 (1) power is given to a housing authority to enter on or take possession of and use land which they are authorised to acquire compulsorily. Section 79 (2) gives the authority similar power in relation to land which they have agreed to purchase or which they have appropriated to any purpose of the Act.  The section, however, states that they may enter on or take possession of the land.  It does not make any reference to the use of the land.  This amendment will rectify the omission.</P>

      <P>The section says &ldquo;may sell or lease.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; has the usual meaning in this case.  If somebody leases land for the purpose of building houses, the original owner then has the right to decide the type of building, the type of building operation to be carried out, and a whole lot of other things, and he may demand a yearly payment.  Is that the type of lease the Minister has in mind?  Does the Minister say that the local authority shall create a lease or a ground rent?</P>

      <P>Sometimes, yes, but it does not necessarily follow.  It really means that they may but it does not follow that they must, for its own sake, create a ground rent.  Our suggestion is that the local authority <Col N="1962" /> should have at least equal rights with the ordinary private landowner and that when parting with any land, they can attach conditions as to its future use.  No people are qualified to do that more than the local authority and the planning authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister went portion of the way when he said that the local authority should have at least equal rights with the ordinary private landowner and I thought he was going to finish by saying &ldquo;to create ground rents&rdquo;.  We have been told that within the next couple of weeks we will have a Bill to abolish this system.  That is why I am particularly anxious to see that this does not come along here. I do not believe that a local authority, any more than private individuals, building societies, or anybody else, have any rights to create these.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to tie himself to the idea that the only possible use to which the lands might be put would be for housing but that does not follow.  They are not restricted solely to this use.  If the local authority dispose of surplus lands which they do not require, they will not be restricted in this way.  Perhaps they cannot find anybody who wants the land for houses, or perhaps it would not be desirable that there should be houses there.  The Deputy suggests that this is in conflict with the alleged reports which he is quoting in regard to what the House may expect in respect of the abolition of ground rents. Instead of being helpful to the Government and to me and letting us have his views, the Deputy, as he very often does, tries to imply that what I am doing may conflict with what somebody else is doing.  This does not necessarily apply to house building at all.  The land may be used for any of several other uses.  It could be for an industry and it could well be that a lease may be necessary when parting with land for that purpose, not only to ensure proper and orderly development of the locality but to ensure that houses already built adjoining these lands will not be jeopardised in respect of their valuation by the new owner doing just what he likes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> In page 59, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>(6) Before leasing, selling, exchanging or otherwise disposing of land a housing authority shall ascertain if allotments are required by agricultural workers or other persons and may, by resolution, decide to provide allotments to the extent that a demand for allotments exists.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to ensure that if there is land available in an area where there is a number of agricultural workers or people of that category who require plots of land, the housing authority will be entitled to dispose of it to those people rather than to sell it in one lot to people who might not need the land.  That is the meaning of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, this amendment appears to give a duty to the local authority which is not really proper to them.  The provision of allotments on any sort of large scale is not really appropriate to the business of a local authority but is much more the business of the Land Commission, and as regards the more limited action, I commend section 56 of the Bill to the Deputies for their consideration, as it does, I suggest, provide that a housing authority may provide allotments. I feel this probably sufficient on the small scale that I believe is probably well within the proper functions of a local authority and I think we should avoid, as it were, setting up another Land Commission in the local authorities, lest they might conflict in their selection of allottees, about which we hear so many diverse views expressed in the House at different times. I feel that section 56 really meets the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if section 56 empowers the local authorities to make allotments available, but even if that is so, that is a different aim from what is set out in the amendment <Col N="1966" /> because the amendment requires the local authority to do so.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  It places an obligation on the local authorities to inquire whether agricultural labourers in the area need allotments and the type of allotment involved would probably be the normal type of allotment that generally goes with an agricultural labourer's cottage. That is the purpose of the amendment, not to take over the responsibilities of the Land Commission.  The Minister is being a little facetious in his approach to it.  What is involved is a small plot as indicated in the wording of the amendment and by the proposer, Deputy Tully.  Even if section 56 or other sections of the Bill give the local authority power to do this, I do not think it meets the point of the amendment.  If the Minister reads the amendment again, he will find that there is the difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; provide plots and requiring them to do so in the case of agricultural labourers where there is a demand for plots.</P>

That only continues so long as there is a vesting order, so long as an annuity is being paid.  Does that position terminate when the annuity terminates?  There was something similar in the 1936 Act.  Does it mean that if somebody owns a vested cottage and has to leave the area or the country for a number of years, he is entitled to rent that cottage to somebody else or does the section mean that it cannot be sold?  At present that is only the position where the annuity is not finally redeemed.  Does this apply where the annuity is redeemed and it is freehold and the property of the owner?  Is there any alteration of this?</P>
