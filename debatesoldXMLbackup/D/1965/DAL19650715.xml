    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of a lengthy speech in the House two days ago the Taoiseach certainly shocked the House and the country.  We are aware of the Fianna Fáil propaganda throughout the country not alone in by-elections but during the entire campaign leading up to the recent general election.  I want to say deliberately here that the Taoiseach has deceived this House, that he has succeeded until now in deceiving the country also.</P>
      <P>It is no source of satisfaction to me to say that.  Far from it.  It would be far better for all concerned if the economy of this country were on a sound footing.  Unfortunately, according to what we were told by the Taoiseach on Tuesday and from what research we have been able to do ourselves, we find that the position is worse than ever it was in the history of this country.  Since the Taoiseach made his statement, I have been on the telephone to some of my constituents and I have been told that there is real panic among the business people and other sections of the community in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatsoever that a similar situation arises throughout the length and breadth of the country. It is shocking to think that the Leader of the Government, down through the years, has been painting pictures of prosperity for the people for the purpose, as we all realise now, of getting himself and the Fianna Fáil Party into office.  This has been going on for years.  As I have said, it is a sad <Col N="1417" /> thing to think that a man in the responsible position of Taoiseach should indulge in that type of thing.</P>
    <P>Indeed, for myself I must say I did not expect a great deal better from him because I have known him for quite a long number of years and have known him to engage in that type of practice in my constituency throughout the years since 1951.  On that occasion I was elected to the House and I remember that in the course of the election campaign a typical type of Fianna Fáil propaganda was engaged in.  Promises were made but were never fulfilled.  I remember the manner in which the people were deceived in that 1951 election campaign.</P>
    <P>Two or three years after, a by-election, one that will long be remembered, was held and won by Fianna Fáil on false promises.  May I remind the House of some of the false promises made in the town of Ballina at that time?  Of course, the venue was an ideal one for making such statements because Ballina is the capital town of my constituency and there are something like 5,000 voters.</P>
    <P>So the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, came to Ballina and on the eve of the election, for the purpose of vote catching, promised we were to have a biscuit factory there and that there would be hundreds, perhaps thousands, employed in that factory which, he said, would solve all the economic ills of the constituency.  When the election was over, when Fianna Fáil had won, we got no biscuit factory.  From that time onwards, I can assure the House the people of North Mayo did not attach very much importance to or place much reliance on the statements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Later, a situation arose in my constituency in which a gentleman went forward as an Independent.  He was elected as an Independent and subsequently entered this House as an Independent.  To use a crude phrase, he was got at by Fianna Fáil to vote for the turnover tax.  During the entire period of his term in the Dáil, he supported the Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="1418" /> We know he was got at by the Taoiseach and many people throughout the country know that happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What has this to do with the Taoiseach's Estimate or with the Prices (Amendment) Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has appealed to us on this side of the House for co-operation in this most difficult period and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party has assured the Taoiseach that he will have the fullest co-operation of this Party.  I wish to follow that line but I also wish to point out to the Dáil and to the people of Ireland that the Taoiseach is not the saint he pretends to be.  It is very important that the people of Ireland, even at this late stage, should be made aware of the type of man the Taoiseach is.</P>
      <P>However, I was proceeding to point out that the gentleman who voted for the turnover tax is not now a Member of this House but his vote had the effect of imposing that turnover tax on the Irish people, with the dire results we realise and appreciate today.  The removal of the food subsidies, which were maintained by an inter-Party Government, a Government to which I had the honour to belong as a Deputy, brought about a chain reaction affecting the economy of every household in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the inter-Party Government maintained the food subsidies, the people of the country were able to get a bag of flour for 28/-, a pound of tea for 2/8d., a pound of butter for 3/6d. or 3/9d.  That action on the part of that Government served to keep down the cost of living to a manageable level.  Is it any wonder I have said I was honoured to be one of the Deputies supporting that Government? I did so because I realised that if the cost of living went up, as it did under Fianna Fáil, a situation would arise in the economy of the country similar to that described to us by the Taoiseach in his statement on Tuesday.  We would have had at that time, without the food subsidies, demands for increased <Col N="1419" /> wages, strikes and all the ills that go with them.</P>
    <P>May I point out one of the ills consequent on the policy of Fianna Fáil through the removal of the food subsidies and later the imposition of the turnover tax?  The local authority in County Mayo of which I am a member were faced in the current financial year with the job of imposing an increased charge of not less than 10/- in the £ on our ratepayers as a result of increases in the price of foodstuffs, due to demands by officials and other workers for increased wages and salaries.  The cause of this increased rate demand can be traced back to the removal of the food subsidies which the inter-Party Government maintained while in office.</P>
    <P>In County Mayo we now have a rate of something like 79/- in the £. Most of the rank and file of the people in the country think that county councillors, their elected representatives, are putting up the rates of their own accord.  I am a member of the mental hospital committee and the situation with which we were confronted when dealing with our estimates this year was that we were told by the accounting staff that before proceeding to deal with any business, as a result of awards made in respect of wages and salaries, we were faced in that department alone with expenditure involving an increased rate of 2/2d in the £.  We were told we were committed to that, that we had no control over it, despite the fact that we, the elected representatives of the ratepayers, were considered to be the people with the power to keep rates, if not at the level of the previous year, at least within reasonable bounds so that our people would be able to pay them.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, we attended the Mayo County Council estimates meeting. The meeting lasted three days in all and there we were faced with the prospect of an increase of 7/9 in the £. Day after day, after very careful consideration of the estimates, having listened to the county manager's explanation&mdash;we co-operated with him in every way&mdash;we were faced with an increase in the rates of 10/- in the £. <Col N="1420" /> Is it any wonder that in a poor county like Mayo, where the rates are already at an exorbitant level, it was necessary for the bishops of the western dioceses to call a meeting in Charlestown to form a committee which has become known since as the Defence of the West Committee?  The efforts were backed by that great priest from Donegal, Father McDyer.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people attended the inaugural meeting in Charlestown.  It had the backing of Most Reverend Dr. Browne, Bishop of Galway, Most Reverend Dr. Fergus, Most Reverend Dr. O'Boyle, Most Reverend Dr. Hanley and of many priests and people.  It was a singularly wretched situation in the western areas which caused the priests and people of different religious to assemble in Charlestown.  An emergency situation caused that meeting for the purpose of doing something for an area very rapidly dying.  It is still dying according to the most recent statistics and in the present state of the economy it will continue to die.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil reassembled after the recent general election, the first question on the Order Paper was tabled by me, addressed to the Taoiseach.  I asked the Taoiseach if he was aware of the existence of the Defence of the West Committee.  I asked him if he was aware of the serious plight of the people of that area and I asked him what steps he proposed to take to deal with the situation there.  Of course, it was no trouble to the Taoiseach on that occasion to give me an absolutely dishonest answer, one which was completely misleading.  I say that in all sincerity.  His reply to my question was that if I waited until the Estimates were dealt with I would know what the solution was with regard to the major problem of the west of Ireland.  I am not quoting his exact words but they are on record.  The matter was so involved, so complicated, and the matter was receiving such study and attention it would be impossible to deal with the whole question in a short reply such as he gave.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, he misled the <Col N="1421" /> House.  He did not cod me because I did not believe him at the time.  Most of the Estimates have now been dealt with and we know there is no solution for this problem.  At least, the Taoiseach has no solution for this major problem.  It is a shocking situation and it makes sad news for our people.  As I said at the outset, the Taoiseach came into this House two days ago and, far from indicating an improvement in conditions, warned us of bad times ahead.  So far as the west of Ireland is concerned, and any other region in this country as well, things could not be much worse.  If we had not got an outlet to England so that our people can go over and back for seasonal employment and some of them go and take up regular employment there and never return, I just wonder what the position would be?</P>
    <P>The matter did not finish there.  We had the Connacht Fleadh Cheoil at Foxford and no less a figure than the son-in-law of the Taoiseach came down for that.  He was invited down and we all met him there.  He enjoyed the day the same as we all enjoyed it, listening to Irish music, song, dance and the rest.  Lo and behold, at the official opening which took place in the market square in Foxford, and at which the Minister for Agriculture spoke, he announced, above all places, at that Fleadh Cheoil, that a Parliamentary Secretary was being appointed to look after the underdeveloped areas.  No doubt he had at the back of his mind the question Deputy O'Hara had raised in the Dáil and he wanted as quickly as he could to smother things up.</P>
    <P>He availed of this extraordinary occasion, as the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Ministers often do, to announce all this.  He made a sort of major statement on Government policy at the Connacht Fleadh Cheoil in the town of Foxford.  That evening, at the dinner at which I spoke, I said I would accept the Minister's assurance in good faith and as far as I was concerned, as an individual, he would have my fullest backing and support, regardless of what Party I belonged <Col N="1422" /> to so long as the Minister pursued that line.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  We heard from the Taoiseach in this House on Tuesday last that there is now no money in the kitty.  There is not a doubt in the world that this country, if it is not bankrupt, is very near it, and the position is due to the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil, not last year or the year before, but all down the years they have ruled this country.  I am sure the people who heard the statement of the Taoiseach in Ballina at the street corner on the occasion of the last general election and that of the Minister for Agriculture at the Connacht Fleadh Cheoil at Foxford will say to themselves that it is hard to place any reliance on these gentlemen who are capable of making these statements for no other purpose than that of deceiving the people.  I have already said it is no source of satisfaction to me to have to say these things.</P>
    <P>I live in a rural area roughly four miles outside the town of Foxford.  I was born and reared on the land and engaged in the export business for a long number of years.  I have exported goods as far back as the period of the Economic War.  I have exported eggs, poultry and many other things, not alone to Great Britain but to Spain and Germany as well.  I know how the rural population live.  I know how they have lived.  I can go back on books and records available to me over a period of roughly 65 years.  I can now tell the Minister that during the time my area was thickly populated.  I engaged in the egg export business, pig buying, wholesale and retail grocery and gave employment to 17 people there.  If the Minister or the Taoiseach wants to see for himself, he can now see the situation in that place, my home town, which was once a place of business.  It is shut down because there are very few people to come in to what was once a very busy centre. That is only one instance.  There are several others.</P>
    <P>We had the spectacle in recent times of the Taoiseach coming down to <Col N="1423" /> Geesala.  I was glad to see him coming there.  I thought his visit would do some good.  As far as I was concerned, he was very welcome to open up a grassmeal plant down there.  I have never stood up to condemn these things and I shall not do it today.  I am glad if it improves the lot of the people of the Erris area and I wish that project every luck and every success. According to my information, there are only about ten or 12 people employed there.  I hope there will be more employed in it with the passing of time.  I wish it every luck because it will be of great value to the people in that area and the economy of the country if it is successful.  I was doing a good job as a private businessman carrying out my own business, and no one seemed to be excited because I employed 17 or 18 people.  The Taoiseach did not come down to open that place or ask how I was getting on, but he did think it worthwhile to come down to open the grassmeal factory.</P>
    <P>I know that bits of factories have been started in different centres, particularly in the eastern part of the country, at Shannon, and in the south, but while all that has been going on, scores and scores of private businessmen have been shutting down.  Thank God, I did not go hungry.  I turned to other lines.  When I conceded that there was no hope, I paid the travellers as they came in, and then I shut the door and locked it.  That is going on all over the country.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I was not in the House when the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flanagan, was speaking.  I know his home town very well.  There are very few towns in Ireland I do not know through business contacts.  I travelled the whole of Connacht last year&mdash;town after town and business house after business house, and I know at first hand how things are.  I pass through Ballaghaderreen once a week on my way to Dublin.  I used to pass through it three times a week in connection with my business.  I know the business people of that town, and I know the rural population.  You would <Col N="1424" /> scarcely see anything on the streets except a couple of Monica Duff lorries going up and down the town delivering their wares.</P>
    <P>I was in the town of Charlestown a few weeks ago with my son.  I sat in the car watching the street.  I looked up and down and there was not a sinner on the street.  After about 25 minutes, I saw a woman with a shopping bag in her hand and, being a businessman, I could guess that she probably had four ounces of tea, two pounds of sugar, a loaf of bread, and probably two ounces of walnut plug for the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; which all cost her about four times as much as it would have cost during the period of the inter-Party Government.  It was no source of satisfaction to me to witness that but I did witness it, and I could witness the same thing on the streets of many towns in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I knew that town when I used to buy eggs every Wednesday for export. That was not many years ago, and I would venture to say that at least 100 shop-boys were employed in the shops in Charlestown.  In some shops there were three or four shop-boys and it was difficult at times to meet the boss to buy eggs from him because he was so busy.  The whole position has now changed and the streets of that town are deserted.  The amount of money in turnover and the amount of business done in those days are things of the past.  Other small towns like Kiltimagh and Gurteen are nearly wiped out.  I consider my home town of Foxford to be reasonably well-off because we have a woollen industry there which employs about 250 people.  We had some employment on the sewerage scheme and on the Moy drainage scheme for the past couple of years but some of those things will pass on.  Perhaps that town will not be as depressed as some of the other towns&mdash;I sincerely hope it will not&mdash;but, as I say, we are fortunate in having that woollen industry.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil spokesmen want to see those things for themselves, I cordially invite them to come down.  I will go round with them, if they wish, and point them out.  If they tell this House and the people of Ireland that <Col N="1425" /> the Government who are responsible for all this misfortune, for all this depression, and for all the emigration that goes with it, are the Government who improved the lot of the people, I am hanged if I can see it.  In fact, things are so bad in many of the western regions that people have long ago thrown up the sponge, packed up, and gone.  Now the people who are left cannot pay the rates.  I said more than once in this House that at one time there were 26 happy homesteads in my native village.  That figure is down now to 12.  We have many modern amenities.  We have rural electricity; we have tarred roads; we have telephones for the past 30 years so we are not out of touch with the outside world; and we have television; but we would have none of those things were it not for the fact that our people who went to England, America, Australia, and elsewhere, sent home money so that their parents, their brothers and sisters would be able to live on the &ldquo;old sod.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement will come as a shock to many of those people. I know hundreds of them.  I receive letters and inquiries from time to time. After my election to the Dáil, I received scores of letters and telegrams. People who have spent 15 or 20 years in England or America, and who have been looking forward to the day when they could come home&mdash;and like many Irish people, they were deceived by all this ballyhoo about the prosperity we had in Ireland&mdash;will be shocked when they see in their papers the mess the country is in after 25 years of Fianna Fáil rule.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on, but I think the Minister must be aware that what I say is the truth.  If he is in any doubt, he can inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Seán Flanagan, who knows these things as well as I do, because he lives in a town that is as badly hit as any I know.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce brought in some tranquillisers for the Irish people.  The bad news had spread very quickly, as bad news does spread, and in order to pull the situation out of the fire to some <Col N="1426" /> degree, the wily old Taoiseach, realising that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a man whose word is taken by many people inside this House and outside of it, told him to come in here and try to soften the thing up.  I believe he did soften it somewhat.  Unlike the Taoiseach, the Minister's word is taken and accepted; he is respected for what he is, a decent man.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to administer a drug to our people and to tell them that things are not all that bad.  But things are bad.  Everybody must agree that they are bad, particularly when the bishops of the western dioceses thought fit to hold that protest meeting in Charlestown and to hold another meeting in Foxford.  The position now is that over 17,000 people in Mayo alone, people of different political Parties and different religions, have come together in the realisation that there is a serious problem to be dealt with, that the whole of Connacht is dying, that the people are leaving the rural areas and the towns because they are not able to keep going.  These people will be deeply disappointed to know that there is no money available to solve their problems.  When I asked that question to which I have referred, the Taoiseach told me that if I would only wait for his Estimate, I would know the solution he had for the problem.  Now I know.</P>
    <P>On the question of the control of prices, I agree with Deputy Dillon that this is a lot of eyewash.  I am convinced that the Taoiseach feels that way about it also.  He was well aware that prices were soaring, that the cost of living index figure had gone up, that there was a succession of strikes, that we had round after round of claims for increases of wages as a result of soaring prices.  The Taoiseach was well aware of what was happening and he will forever stand condemned in the eyes of the Irish people for his failure to take any action whatever.</P>
    <P>The election is over, and the Taoiseach thought we would have a short debate on this matter and that he could take advantage of the fact that there were no national newspapers in existence.  He thought the people would <Col N="1427" /> be kept in the dark but he has not succeeded in keeping them in the dark. The ordinary citizen has known for some time what was going to happen. At the height of the tourist season, many thousands of people arrived in Dún Laoghaire and found that there were no buses to take them into Dublin.  These people had to avail of hired cars to bring them to Dublin and to the west and south of Ireland.  These holidaymakers will be slow to come to this country again.</P>
    <P>All this, the newspaper strike and all the other strikes, are the responsibility of the Government.  The whole situation has been created by the failure of the Government to act and by the removal of the food subsidies which drove up the cost of living. Fianna Fáil were warned.  I was a Member of this House when these warnings were given to them.  I was defeated in two elections prior to the last one because I could not face up to the lying propaganda and false promises of Fianna Fáil.  I would not follow them in that way.  I am glad to be back here now but I am sorry to have to relate the tale of woe I have to relate here today.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary was very critical of our people.  He said they had lost their patriotism and inferred that the younger generation are very bad citizens indeed.  I do not agree with this.  He laid the blame on the teachers and I do not agree with that at all.  I remember the period of the Emergency when we were threatened with war.  I remember that the people, and they were not all Fianna Fáil supporters, rallied behind the Government and if they did not join the Regular Army, they joined the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force.  They let the people outside the country know that they were ready to defend their own land even at the expense of their lives.</P>
    <P>I joined the Local Defence Force as a private.  I recruited 123 men to that force and I had no difficulty in doing so.  I went into it as a private and was offered promotion but I did not take it because it might be said <Col N="1428" /> that undue influences were at work so I came out of it as a private.  We let outsiders and foreigners know that when it came to the pinch, like those who had gone before us, we were not going to shirk our responsibilities.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks the teachers of this country are not patriotic, that the children and their parents are not patriotic, he is making a great mistake.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a highly respected man.  He has a great record as a sportsman on the football field and I am sure he is interested in the people of his county and of the west of Ireland, as I am myself.  I regret that he made that statement, for the people are as patriotic today as ever they were.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary not forget it is hard to expect patriotism from people who are obliged to leave their native districts and are forced through economic circumstances to go to England or America.  They have learned the Irish language at school, perhaps some of them have spoken it at home and, to be honest about it, and to my own personal knowledge, many of them have spoken it in England, particularly those from places like Achill and Erris, where they are native speakers. If they are losing the language, it is not their fault.  In their own communities in Liverpool, London and Glasgow, they speak the language among themselves.  It is hard to expect these people to continue to speak it in the environment into which they are forced to go.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record in this House as protesting against that statement and saying that I feel the national, and other, teachers of this country today are as fine a body of men and women as you could get in any part of the world.  I will go further and say that the generation of teachers who went before them were a great body and made great contributions.  In times gone by, they did not worry about hours of work.  They did not count the cost, but many of them, when the time came, were prepared to shoulder the gun and go out in defence of this country at the risk of their lives.  When <Col N="1429" /> the Parliamentary Secretary makes a statement like that, I deplore it, first of all.  It was a terrible statement to make and I really feel he should not have made it.</P>
    <P>There is another sad thing I should like to mention.  I visited Achill not so long ago at the invitation of a committee known as Muintir Aichill.  The parish priest presided at the meeting and Deputy Calleary and Deputy Lindsay were there also.  We are the three Deputies representing North Mayo and it is quite a usual thing for us to do this.  We put aside our political affiliations and meet local committees or groups such as Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association or any other organised group who have as their main objective the improvement of the lot of the people.</P>
    <P>At the meeting in Achill, I would say the vast majority of the people present were Fianna Fáil supporters. Achill Island is tremendously Fianna Fáil.  I did not mind that one bit. Perhaps some people also supported the Labour organisation, but at that meeting it was made very clear to us, in no uncertain terms, not alone by the parish priest who presided, but by the ordinary lay people present there, good, intelligent, hardheaded people, that the people of Achill Island, so far as the ordinary residents are concerned, are getting out in big numbers and the trend today is that they are not coming back.  They are staying in England and all because they feel that native government had let them down.</P>
    <P>I know Achill Island well.  I was out there hundreds of times last year, if not more, and I know practically every person in it.  I certainly know the business people there and I had to agree with them in what they said. They told us that all down through the years, they had given their support to Fianna Fáil in the hope something would be done for them but very little has been done.  In fact, some of them said that nothing has been done.  With that I do not agree.  I will admit the housing problem in Achill has been to a large extent solved.  Housing conditions in Achill have much improved <Col N="1430" /> in my time.  I pointed out that roads have been improved and that now a major water scheme has been laid on in order to help them in the tourist season.</P>
    <P>All this is not sufficient to keep the people there.  What they really need is regular employment.  They have the natural resource there because it is an island.  If they were provided with boats and gear and proper facilities for fishing, I believe these people could supplement their income to an extent that would make it possible for many of them, at least, to stay at home and marry and settle down there.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget this.  When Ireland was really put to the test in the dark and difficult days, when religion was being persecuted in this country and when people who were pro-Irish were being tortured and put to death, it was the people of these remote areas who really stood by the country.  It is from such places, in the main, that very distinguished citizens have gone abroad and have distinguished themselves in foreign lands, in the mission fields and in other walks of life.  They should not be neglected.  I think they should be the first call on our Government.</P>
    <P>It is very hard indeed to imagine the Taoiseach coming into this House and pointing out, as he did, if even for the first time, the importance of the Irish cattle trade in the economy of this country.  He laid great stress on that. He did not seem to appreciate its importance all down through the years. His contribution towards improving the lot of the farming community is very poor indeed.  The contribution of the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole is poor indeed.  Now the Taoiseach tells us we have run into part of the main cause of the depression, that a balance of payments problem arises because the cattle trade at the moment, and the numbers of cattle being exported, are not up to expectation.  The reason for that is that over a period last year, and the year before, abnormally high prices were being paid by the British for cattle because, evidently, they were short of cattle and were glad to get them.  It was not for love of us they were taking them and paying those <Col N="1431" /> prices.  It is because many people disposed of perhaps too many cattle at that time that we now find a situation in which exports have fallen which has helped to create this problem to which the Taoiseach pointed.</P>
    <P>I am aware there are hundreds of farmers who have not the capital to stock their lands as they would like to stock them.  They cannot get the capital; at least they cannot get it now from the banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation or anybody else. The grass, in many instances, is growing up to the fences.  If a beast went into some of those fields today, you could hardly see its head up with all the grass in the field and not alone is it there in the field but it is along the roadsides as well.</P>
    <P>These people were told during the election and have been told over a number of years that credit was readily available to stock up with cattle.  We had the Heifer Subsidy Scheme.  They were told by some of the banks that if they were credit-worthy, they would give some money to try to help them stock up.  A few people availed of it and to their advantage. But, at that time, the economy of the country was sounder than it is now.  I am admitting that the few who did avail of it have gained as a result.  There are many who cannot avail of it for one reason or another.  If the honest-to-goodness people, perhaps people who live in remote rural areas, go to a bank, where they probably never stood in their lives before, they are not able to make a very good case for themselves and are automatically refused credit because in the eyes of the bank manager, they are not what one might call a good risk.  For that reason, many of those people have to leave their holdings under-stocked and when the time comes when there is an increase in cattle prices or when something could be made on cattle, those people do not stand to benefit in any way for the reason that they have not the stock and are unable to get them.</P>
    <P>Now, we were told by the Taoiseach here on Tuesday last these people <Col N="1432" /> need not be crying for any more money because it is not there for them and they cannot get it.  The credit squeeze is on.  Hire purchase is being restricted.  As for bank loans, there is not a bob to be lent to anybody.  It has been known for a month or two past that this was the situation because reputable people have been refused credit for many good projects and good development works.</P>
    <P>This credit squeeze will cause more and more unemployment.  I can see more unemployment in the motor trade as a result of a recession.  I can see more unemployment in the television and radio trade.  I can see more unemployment in business as a whole. This country, far from being on the road to progress, as the Taoiseach tried to make the people believe some time ago, is certainly in reverse gear at the present time and, according to the Taoiseach's words, will so continue for quite a while to come.</P>
    <P>We heard down through the years a lot of ballyhoo about the Border and the Irish language.  We heard talk that the Border would be removed, that our people would be brought back from England, that 100,000 jobs would be created, and all the rest of it.  Despite all the lying propaganda and deceit that succeeded in keeping the Government in office, we have not heard much about the Border.  I should not like to be guilty of saying anything here that would be the cause of delaying the day when Ireland will be united&mdash;God forbid.  Nobody can deny that the majority of our people look forward to the day when this country will be united and when we will have a 32-County Republic.  But I doubt very much if the statement here in this House of the Taoiseach is much of an attracation for these people to come in and join us&mdash;far from it.  If, over 40 years, a native Government have achieved only what the Taoiseach told us on Tuesday, then it is a pretty poor record.  It is rather hard to expect those people in the North to come in and join us here.  It might be as well in the circumstances that I should not elaborate on that but I feel that it certainly will not have the effect of speeding the day when this country will be <Col N="1433" /> united and when we will have a 32-County Republic.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks, the Taoiseach appealed for co-operation on the Prices Bill.  As I said at the outset, the Leader of our Party assured him that we would do everything possible to help him over the difficulty.  I was a member of this House from 1951 to 1956.  I distinctly remember what happened in 1954 when an inter-Party Government took office.  I do not like to go back on the past but I feel it necessary in the interests of truth and decency in Irish public life to expose here, or anywhere else where we have a platform to do it, the dishonesty of the Taoiseach and of those associated with him in Government.</P>
    <P>During those years we ran into many serious problems.  We ran into a balance of payments problem in the period between 1955-56 and the problems we were confronted with were not of our own making.  They were problems which arose as a result of the Suez crisis which, as everybody knows, caused a very serious upheaval in this country.  Petrol had to be rationed and over a period, many other commodities were in short supply.  I remember Deputy Norton, God be good to him, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce coming into this House, and, as an emergency measure, moving the emergency powers legislation a Minister must move in such circumstances in order to ration petrol.  On the following day, or a couple of days after, he dealt with that situation.  He was cool, calm and collected.  He did not panic.  However, the Government of the day had to take measures to meet the situation, a situation which was not of our making.</P>
    <P>The overthrow of the then Communist-inclined leader of the Argentine, President Peron, created a further problem for us.  He was chased out of his home country and in recent times he put up in Spain or Portugal and was chased out of there as well, and deservedly so.  His overthrow created a further problem for this country.  The Government which took over in the Argentine were faced with <Col N="1434" /> the problem of trying to put some shape on the economy of the country after misrule and, in my opinion, they were obliged at the time to dump their meat on the British market at sacrifice prices.  The inter-Party Government in office here had to meet that situation.  Now, we know very well that if the British hotelier can buy beef at 3/- per lb. from the Argentine, he will not pay 5/- or 6/- per lb. for our beef.  Consequently, they turned to the purchase of Argentine meat and our cattle exports decreased very seriously, creating very serious problems for this country because of the collapse of the cattle trade at the time.</P>
    <P>The Argentine Government got on their feet again.  The founder of the Argentine Navy, Admiral William Brown, came from my home town of Foxford.  At that time the then representative of the Argentine Government in Ireland was in Foxford preparing for the unveiling of a statue in memory of Admiral Brown.  Some people were not too happy about the statue because they realised that at that time the Argentine Government were cutting the ground from under us in our traditional meat market in Britain.  Some people who were not depending on farming were quite amused at it, but it was no laughing matter from the point of view of the Government and the people who depended on the export of meat.</P>

      <P>I was dealing earlier with the Taoiseach's appeal for co-operation from this side of the House. He can be assured of that.  We will do all we can in the way of constructive criticism and pointing out the right road to him.  We did it before but he did not pay much heed to us.  That is the reason he is in the position he is in today.  We did not get sympathy from Fianna Fáil when we were in trouble.  The Taoiseach is no fool. He knew our difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and those behind him claim to be patriotic and to have done so much for their country down through the years.  According to them, nobody did anything for their <Col N="1436" /> country except the people in Fianna Fáil.  Nobody else fired a shot or got a wound.  I do not subscribe to that at all.  I am old enough to remember that much of that eyewash was put across by Fianna Fáil spokesmen and by their tied newspaper, the <i>Irish Press.</i> That is understandable when you have Deputy de Valera behind the scenes planning the programme.  He walks in and out of here, occasionally whispering into a Minister's ear to find out what is going on, then goes back to the office and gets out this propaganda in the <i>Irish Press</i>.  It is difficult to counteract that, because these people are geniuses as far as propaganda is concerned, but we have done our best.  They will not get many Irish people to swallow that kind of tripe.</P>
    <P>There are men on this side of the House whose contribution to Ireland was far greater than anything they ever did.  One of those people is a man often attacked in this House, Deputy Dillon.  He does not need me to defend him.  Long before the Lemasses and de Valeras were heard of, his forebears worked in the interests of the Irish people and risked their lives for them at a time when they had to have police protection.  We can read between the lines of the history books.</P>
    <P>As far as the appeal to our patriotism is concerned, let us all get behind this in this time of difficulty, give constructive criticism and point out the right road to the Government. We all have a stake in the country&mdash; our families, our friends and neighbours. I pointed out this morning that my neighbourhood was denuded of people and houses were closed down. It is sad to see that happening.  All of us like to return to our homes and see our wives and children.  According to the Taoiseach's statement, the prospect for them, as we move on, is the prospect that faced our fathers&mdash;the emigrant ship and life in a foreign land. We are sorry to see that the Taoiseach has so mishandled the affairs of the country that he has to appeal to us for co-operation, but he will have that co-operation.  If he had to appeal to the Irish people to-morrow in an emergency to join the Army or anything else, they would stand behind <Col N="1437" /> him.  I can assure him they have not lost their patriotism.  They are just as patriotic as anybody in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I said before in this House that from the day Fianna Fáil took over this country, I was convinced they travelled along the wrong road, down through the years, because nobody would deny, going back 40 or even 100 years or more, that the basic industry of this country has always been agriculture and on it nearly everything else depended.  Tourism and other industries have sprung up in recent years but it should be remembered that agriculture is the basic industry. Nobody has pointed this out more often than Deputy Dillon, the man who every day of the week is attacked and abused in this House.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach would like to hear them, I have some suggestions to make in regard to getting the country back on its feet again.  We badly need a lot more technical advice for our farmers. I never believed in throwing money about freely by way of subsidy or otherwise and taking them by and large the rural population do not believe in free money either.  They prefer to work for it.  This Government did away with the scheme initiated by the inter-Party Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I well remember as a member of Mayo County Council that sums in excess of £80,000 were sent to us from Dublin so that we might carry out minor drainage schemes.  The scheme was broken into two parts, Section A and Section B.  Section A dealt with land drainage and Section B with bog roads, accommodation roads and other roads for farmers.  It meant that we could relieve the flooding problems which existed in our county.  Indeed, a similar problem existed all over the country and millions of pounds were made available at the time to cope with this problem.  However, I am speaking about the problem in my county because I am conversant with it.</P>
    <P>The scheme had a double advantage because it made it possible for groups of farmers to have their lands drained, if necessary at a slack time of the year <Col N="1438" /> when they could go out and work on those minor drainage schemes and thus supplement their meagre incomes from their uneconomic holdings.  In those years, it was not necessary for such a small farmer to migrate to England and these men were able to remain with their wives and children and be happy in their homes.  The scheme could be undertaken at a slack period when the potatoes had been dug and crops harvested and the money was then made available for those people and was of great benefit to them and to the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>That scheme was scrapped. It was an inter-Party scheme and therefore it could not be right.  I regret to say that there is too much of that mentality in Fianna Fáil.  I would not care a fiddle-de-dee if the Taoiseach or anybody in his Government put forward some sensible proposals for improving the lot of the people. I would be glad to support them.  Indeed, I would have a moral obligation to do so, and if I did not, I would soon know what the people thought.  These people who are travelling over and back to England are highly intelligent. They can read between the lines; they know if a man is doing his duty in this House and trying to do his best.</P>
    <P>There is also the Land Project initiated by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture.  This scheme was again divided into Section A and Section B.  Thousands of acres were reclaimed under that scheme. Let me explain for the benefit of those who may not know that Section A was a scheme whereby a farmer got not more than £30 per acre for every acre of land he reclaimed, subject of course to inspection and approval by the local agricultural officer.  The land was inspected when the application went in and he was told to go ahead and told the amount of money he would get.  A total of £25 was provided for the actual work on the land and £5 was provided for lime and fertilisers.</P>

      <P>As I have been critical of the Taoiseach and the Government and pointed out the many mistakes I thought they made down through the years, I felt that if I made some brief suggestions, the Taoiseach, even at this eleventh hour, might follow a line of policy to get the country out of its difficulties.  I have said that he has neglected agriculture and has not given it the help and assistance it requires.  The proof of this is that the people are leaving the land.  I am trying to point out these things as best I can from my knowledge and experience. I had to be experienced in these matters because my livelihood depended on it.  I am most anxious to help the Taoiseach and I do not think I am being out of line when I make these suggestions.</P>
      <P>May I finally say that I am proud of the record which this country has in regard to forestry.  We have a proud record in forestry but there is a lot more to be done.  It is not just the inter-Party Minister alone, a colleague of mine, who made that possible.  Successive Fianna Fáil Ministers have done the best they could to improve the position as regards forestry.  I sincerely hope that line will be pursued.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to say there is no better way at present of helping this country out of its difficulties than trying to help the main industry of the country, agriculture.  It might be suggested that I have a very strong rural bias, that I am all for the farmers and I do not care a hang about anybody else.  That is not so.  I have spent quite a lot of my life around this city.  For nine or ten years, I lived here three or four days a week.  I have done business from Moore Street to Camden Street and Wexford Street and I know well how the people live here.  I have spent days around the North Wall and the docks.  I have worked with dockers and I know how they live.  I understand their problems.  Those people, as far as I am concerned, are the salt of the earth, a really wonderful people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people have to put up with difficulties which I fully understand. They have housing problems.  Many of them are short of food when they are <Col N="1440" /> unemployed.  Their problems are much more serious than the problems of the people with small holdings of land. The people with small holdings have something when things are bad.  They have a few eggs and they also have milk.  In this city there is a housing shortage and much unemployment. This is likely to get worse, according to the Taoiseach.  Therefore, those people have my sympathy.  I believe if we can build our economy around the main industry of this country, the problems that confront us today will be got over, if we have better management and a more central approach than we have had in the past.  We will get over those difficulties if we have a more central approach than the Fianna Fáil people have had to those problems all down the years.</P>
    <P>Now that the Taoiseach has come back again, I want to say something which I regret having to say because he is a man who many of the people consider has the ability to do great things for them.  I know he is a man who has tried to improve the lot of the people.  I deplore the fact that he has so misled the people.  He has made so many pronouncements in several places, whether they be dinners, dog fights or jamborees, as another Deputy said, that I am afraid the Irish people will be inclined to take them with a grain of salt.  They will say this man said such and such a thing; he appealed to us to let him lead on and said there was nothing wrong with the economy of the country.  When he gets back to this House, he gets control again and is like the fox after the hen or the cock.  He strolled into the House when he thought we were going on holidays and he said he would explode the whole thing now.  The newspapers are out of circulation and the people will not get the news. I regret the Taoiseach has stooped to such low tactics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very attentively to the last speaker and to other speakers during the last few days.  I was rather disappointed with the unconstructive approach to a national problem by so many speakers from whom I expected more, particularly <Col N="1441" /> those on the other side of the House.  This is a time when we, on this side of the House, are facing up to the problems we have to deal with.  The real difference between the Fianna Fáil Government and the inter-party Government is that when the inter-Party Government had a problem to deal with, though they did not need to go to the country at that time, they rushed out.  The Government broke up. They left us with an unbalanced Budget, an adverse balance of payments and debts all over the place.</P>
      <P>They have told us now that we have treated them dishonestly and that we waited until after the election.  Such is not true.  The Taoiseach has put the facts to the Irish people as any honest to God Taoiseach should do.  He would have failed completely as a national leader if he had not done so. It is no pleasure to the Taoiseach, as leader of our Party, to have to introduce any Price Control Bill or a Bill providing for any restriction whatever, but it is his national duty to see that the economy is put right.</P>
      <P>I have sufficent faith in the Irish people to know they will back the Taoiseach in the national stand he has taken.  We are not concerned with the small things that come along day after day; we are concerned with a major issue.  The major issue is that if we are not able to control our balance of payments, we are in the same position as the farmer or the businessman.  The farmer cannot live unless he sells his products and the businessman cannot live unless he sells what he has in his shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain things which have happened which are beyond our control. The 15 per cent tax put on by Great Britain on all goods going into that country was a very severe blow to our economy here.  The Taoiseach and his Government tried to meet that position by going over to the British Prime Minister and discussing the matter with him at that time.  What more could the Taoiseach do when we have diplomatic connections with that country or any country?  All you can do is to go over to them and reason or argue with them.  That had <Col N="1442" /> to be done on behalf of the Irish people and the Irish people should remember that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay this House because long, rambling speeches have been made over the past couple of days.  I appeal for the co-operation of the nationally-minded people of Ireland, who never failed to answer an appeal when they were told the truth.  During the Emergency, during 1916 and all along, the Irish people were behind a cause which was worthy of their support.  I feel, on this occasion, the Irish people will rally behind the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government because in doing that they will be doing something for themselves and for their children.</P>
    <P>The Opposition could damage this country if they overplayed their hands by saying this country is going down and I appeal to them not to do so. This country is not going down.  Even the great United States has had to curb the spending power of her citizens going abroad and other countries have had to have a look at their housekeeping from time to time. The resources of some of those countries are a good deal more powerful than ours.  As far as the Government can, they will remedy the present situation and we should lend our efforts to that because it is for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>People on the other side of the House have been alleging that we did not help the farming section of the community.  That is completely untrue. This Party bent backwards to help the agricultural side of the economy. So far as we could, within the natural resources of the country, we helped the farmers, big and small.  I hate a person who is always depending on someone else.  The people of Ireland have always stood up to adversity. During the Famine, the people of Ireland rallied to the cause and at that time they had no Government protection. I believe the people will do things for themselves and for their children.  They have always done so in the most adverse circumstances.  We have always been concerned for the wellbeing of every section of the community, and we have always been <Col N="1443" /> anxious to see that our children got better education to enable them to take their place in any part of the world if they have to leave the country.  We were always anxious to provide better housing.  We made an all-out effort to provide better roads, better drainage facilities, land reclamation, better facilities for selling our agricultural production, better facilities for fishing, and everything else that can be mentioned.</P>
    <P>If a temporary brake has to be put on to aid the economy, those who are interested in the national wellbeing should not overplay it and say we are going down.  We are not going down because, so far as I can see, our country was never more solvent.  We want to encourage people with money to come in and invest here, and we have given them every encouragement. We want more Irish people to invest their money in Ireland and to have faith in the Ireland that belongs to the citizens of this country.  We want them to contribute to the wellbeing of the nation of their forefathers.</P>
    <P>Travelling through Israel last year, I was amazed by the progress that had been made by the Jews, and at the amount of development that had been carried on, and the amount of money that had been subscribed by Jews all over the world.  Theirs is a small country and they were up against it at the beginning.  The Jews all over the world showed great loyalty towards one another, and they rallied behind the State of Israel.  Travelling through that country.  I saw the amount of irrigation and the amount of development &mdash; 6,000,000 acres of forestry planted from 1949 to 1964&mdash;that had taken place.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Irish people abroad will rally round and that this country will go ahead in the way everyone would wish to see it go.  I sincerely hope that our people will rally behind us.  I do not want to go into details because I do not want to delay the House.  I am dealing solely with the economic side of our affairs and I am appealing to the nationally-minded people of our nation to rally behind us.  I believe our own kith and <Col N="1444" /> kin in other countries will have the courage to do for this country what the Jews have done for theirs.</P>
    <P>We are standing up to the responsibility of government.  As a Party, we will not run away.  As I said at the outset, the real difference between a Fianna Fáil Government and an inter-Party Government is that the Fianna Fáil Government stand up to their responsibilities and are honest with the Irish people.  We have succeeded in improving the standard of living of our people in every walk of life, and we have created employment for thousands and thousands of our people.  In 1956-57 the inter-Party Government ran away from their responsibilities, and the tragic thing was that the leaders of that national Government, or inter-Party Government, or Coalition Government, or whatever we call it, is that they did not mind leaving office when the country was completely on the rocks.  I should have thought there would have been enough national feeling in them to try to do something for the nation, but they rushed out to a general election. If there were no national Party, concerned for the welfare of every section of the community, to take over, what would the position have been?</P>
    <P>Now those people are talking about the food subsidies.  We had to swallow a bitter pill in 1952 when we had to introduce the 1952 Budget to rectify the national financial position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the Prices Bill and on the Taoiseach's speech.  The Labour Party have supported the Bill and have advocated for a long time that we should have price control in the interests of the working people.  We will suggest amendments to the Bill to the effect that orders made under it should continue for 12 months instead of for six and we think that effective machinery should be brought into operation to have full investigation of proposed price increases.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers, before seeking increases in prices, should notify the Department of this intention in order that their claims may be investigated. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has said on many occasions that he has had no complaints about price increases.  If the system I suggest were to operate, it would make the Minister aware of increases which were about to take place.  The Labour Party also believe that a public inquiry should be held into proposed price increases in the same way as the Labour Court holds public sittings to investigate applications for wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the emergency situation of which the Taoiseach speaks, and indeed there is one, I believe that it was brought to his attention on several occasions during the past few months but the Government have become acutely aware of it only now. <Col N="1447" /> Deputies have referred to the credit squeeze and the Minister for Local Government has denied that there is one.  Bank lending for the first five months of this year has increased by £23 million as compared with £10 million in the first five months of last year. The Taoiseach says that the greater portion of this has been in the Government sector.  Will the Taoiseach state the amount of bank lending in the private sector and compare this with the amount in the private sector for 1964?  If he gives us these figures, we will have an indication of the credit squeeze now in operation which is paralysing the country in regard to housing and smaller industries.</P>
    <P>We believe that the National Wage Agreement will collapse long before the time it is due to expire, for the simple reason that the Government refused to introduce price control when the agreement came into operation. The Government violated the agreement by giving status increases to civil servants and we believe that these civil servants have salaries far in excess of what they should have.  The Government should be the first people to take action and should secure economies in their own Departments.  The workers feel aggrieved that this gap has been created between their earnings and those of the civil servants and the Government's decision to grant status increases to civil servants is a major cause of the industrial unrest in the country at the moment.  The Government have ignored that situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the deficit in the balance of payments, it has frequently been brought to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a ludicrous situation existed with regard to Communist countries to which we were exporting only £1,200,000 worth of goods while they were sending us goods to the value of almost £6 million.  When I referred to this, the Minister was either indifferent or unaware of the situation.  He said that it would be kept under review and that there was no need to worry as the margin against us was only four to one.  The Government should tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is talked about in Government circles but it is never brought down to the level of the workers.  The worker is unaware of what is expected of him.  No effort was made to make these proposals known to the workers and we cannot get their co-operation unless the whole matter is brought directly to their attention.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech would seem to imply that there is to be no improvement in the health services in this country.  He sounded the death knell of any radical changes in the health services.  This was very different from what the Minister for Health said when this young Lochinvar came into this House and said he would have radical changes within a few months. I anticipated this when the Minister spoke at the Irish Medical Association dinner.  I noticed that he had been got at and that his plans had been watered down from the speech he made there. It was entirely the opposite of what he had said on a few occasions here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech would also seem to imply that there is to be a falling off in the building of houses. This is a very sore point with our people.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke yesterday about the bringing home of skilled workers from England but unless we have houses for them, we cannot ask them to come home.  A tremendous number of them are going abroad because of the grave situation with regard to housing here and no effort is being made by the Government to solve that problem. They look for the co-operation and support of the people for their various projects but they will not make any effort to help the people.</P>
    <P>I have been appalled at the inconsistency of the present Government.  I do not want to be over-critical and the policy of the Labour Party is one of constructive criticism, but the indifference being shown by the Government is not good enough.  The Government should set a good example by keeping themselves aware of the situation. They have lost contact with the people and are not aware of what is <Col N="1449" /> going on.  Until they become aware of the situation generally, they cannot have any proper policy.  At the moment their policy varies from day to day.  All they can do is come out with measures which are intended to make matters worse for the workers.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to make sure that more work is done in Government Departments and that there is less wasteful extravagance. They should let us know the amount of lending by the banks to the private sector of industry and we should not have the extravagance with regard to grants given to different companies. When these grants are lost, such as the £341,000 lost on the GEC factory in Dundalk, and when we ask a question as to what moneys will be retrieved, we are told it is not the concern of the House and it is not in the interests of the public that this matter should be known.  That is wrong.  It is over £? million and it is one instance of the terrible extravagance of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be like a housewife living beyond her means and when she lives beyond her means and gets into debt, I know that in Dublin city the corporation has no mercy and evict her.  This happens every day.  The Government should look upon the situation in that they themselves must economise and they must not produce plans which will not succeed.  There should be more foresight on the part of the Government if we are to achieve anything in this country.  The Labour Party will offer constructive criticism and will co-operate with the Government in every way, but they must not be sneered at when they put forward proposals for price control.  Every effort was made by the Government to call this by every other name than price control.</P>
    <P>On matters of buy Irish, I might point out that the Government should set an example.  I shall just give one example of the Government cars which are not assembled in this country, but are imported from abroad.  How can the ordinary people co-operate with a Buy Irish campaign when this is so?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not think that it would be in the interests of the public if the Government cars were not such lavish cars and that we should have cars of proper size and proper price in this country?  We cannot have the extravagance for the Government and then preach to the people that we must have economy in every household.  The householders are not living in the lap of luxury.  They are barely making ends meet, and the Taoiseach is asking them to economise further and thereby live in hair shirts.  This is a policy the Taoiseach proposes for which he does not set an example.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power mentioned that with wages going up 12 per cent, naturally we must have prices going up.  But the ninth round increases were sought because prices had gone up.  These increases were granted to cope with the situation in which the cost of living had gone up.  Now we have a situation in which wages are constantly chasing the cost of living.  As the situation is at present, wages will never catch up with the high cost of living obtaining at the moment.</P>
      <P>The 2½ per cent turnover tax imposed by the Government has been abused by traders and no effort has been made by the Government to see that it was an equitable tax.  Two and a half per cent turnover tax was the figure, but in actual fact up to ten per cent increases were charged by traders and manufacturers.  Any effect this would have is nullified when you have people abusing the system as it exists at the moment.  A proper system, properly formulated, would have secured the support of the people and there would not have been the antagonism there is towards the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should consider very seriously looking at the situation <Col N="1451" /> in regard to housing as an emergency situation and every effort should be made to cope with it.  In Dublin city alone, we have mixed families sleeping in one room.  I know of many cases where 25 people are living in one house with two bedrooms.  This is not an isolated case.  Many such cases exist and newly-married couples cannot hope to be accommodated within the next four or five years.  Is it any wonder that these people show indifference towards appeals by the Government for co-operation with regard to our present emergency situation, an emergency it now is, no matter how euphemistically the Government may try to style it.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach is asking everybody in the country not to spend money on washing machines, on electric irons and on the ordinary things that help every housewife to make life easier for herself and her children, it is up to him to see that State-sponsored bodies do not spend excessively when we run functions in the name of charity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely how money is spent is a matter of Government policy.  We are entitled to see that no money is contributed unless there is a positive certainty that benefit will accrue from it.  It is hard to see how money of that kind will produce anything commensurate with the amount paid for it or how, in the knowledge that that is being done by Government agents, people are expected to listen to the appeals of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is also asking people to tighten their belts, with the exception of the chosen hierarchy of the Civil Service.  One might fairly wonder why these privileged few in the community who have salaries of £3,000 to £4,000 find it necessary to apply for, and get for the asking increases of 20 per cent and more.  I shall give the House and the country the answer.  In March of this year, the Taoiseach wrote a letter to every high-ranking <Col N="1453" /> civil servant, and I have in my hand one such letter addressed by him to a civil servant, not in his home but in his office, in a Government office here in town.  This letter reads:</P>
    <P Just="Right">FIANNA FÁIL</P>
    <P Just="Right">13, Upper Mount Street,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Dublin, 2.</P>
    <P Just="Right">March, 1965.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>The decision to call a General Election now was unavoidable.  It would not have been helpful to the National development campaign to have a protracted period of political uncertainty.  This would have been prejudicial to all progress and had a dampening effect on the entire economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued in his letter to the civil servant:</P>
    <P>I believe that the great majority of our people want to see the present Government continue in office, so that the progress which is at present under way may be continued and expanded.  But this general desire must be translated into a majority in the ballot boxes.  This can only be done by an effective, all-out election campaign by the Fianna Fáil organisation in every constituency.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach says to civil servants who are supposed to be neutral and above politics:</P>
    <P>I am appealing to you to help us finance such a campaign.  I think you can regard any contribution you make&mdash;and I hope you will make as generous a one as you possibly can &mdash;as an investment in the future welfare of our nation.</P>
    <P>He then asked for the subscription to be sent to himself personally.  It is a new depth in political activity when the Taoiseach writes a letter to senior civil servants asking them to send to him personally their subscriptions to keep him in political office.  When the people want to know why certain people have now got a 20 per cent increase on salaries already £4,000, there is the answer.  I want to know how much was paid by these civil servants who were impliedly threatened by the Taoiseach with this letter in contributions to that Party's funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> What is the truth about the Taoiseach's approach to that election? He did not expect to win it; he did not want to win it.  In January of this year, he was forecasting a difficult year in 1965.  Within a matter of months, when the political climate had somewhat changed for the purpose of an election, he forgot about the difficulties that lay ahead.  He was not going to be a bit alarmed if he were defeated in that election, but he wanted to be in a position sufficiently strong and sufficiently near the Government strength as to enable him to harass and embarrass them and, having left them with this rotten economic situation we have at the present time, precipitate a general election and then accuse the Government who replaced him of being responsible for the mess in which he had left the country.  That is the real truth, the only truth and the one that we are going to rub into him no matter how much he whimpers and appeals to us not to do it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that this is no time to apportion blame.  You do not apportion blame when only one person holds the blame.  To apportion blame assumes that the blame needs to be spread over different people, but that is not so and Fianna Fáil would not have it so.  We remember the big orange circle that emblazoned every hoarding and was suspended from every lamp post some months ago, and some of which are still there, bearing the legend &ldquo;Let Lemass-Lead On&rdquo;&mdash;not &ldquo;Let Fianna Fáil Lead On&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Let the People Of Ireland Lead On&rdquo; but &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo; because they claimed, and he claimed, that he alone was responsible for everything in the country.  He was providing the leadership, he and he alone&mdash;that is what the orange balloon said with the legend &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  Now the balloon has come down to earth and has burst.  We heard the last squelching air and condensed spittle here in the past few days as this deflated orange balloon &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo; came to earth with a flop.</P>
    <P>What have we now to look at? Despair.  Everybody is to do something <Col N="1455" /> but not the Government.  Everybody is to tighten his belt.  Everybody is to stop spending money but not the Government.  Or, if the Government do it, we, as the watchdogs of the people, may not criticise them here in this House.  Then people are asked to expect that democracy is working in this country when the Government are above reproach, when the civil servants, who have become the plaything of Fianna Fáil, are above reproach, when State-sponsored bodies are above reproach.  The only people to be blamed are the ordinary people who try to make ends meet and who, when they find it difficult to do so, try to secure an improvement in their income.  The Party opposite are the people to be blamed if the country is in a mess at present.  If the country is in a mess, the people have, so Fianna Fáil boast, been led by Lemass.  He asked them to vote for him so that he could lead them again.  If the country has followed the wrong path, it is because they followed that orange balloon.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us, in all the election addresses published by the Fianna Fáil apostles in the election, that the reason for the general election at that time was to prevent a delay which would prejudice the country's development prospects.  He said that the main task of the new Government would be to maintain the momentum of the country's economic progress.  Here we are, three months later, witnessing the failure of the Government to fulfil what they considered to be their main task&mdash;the maintenance of the momentum of the economic progress of the country. At the same time as they do this, they appeal to everybody else in the country, bar themselves, to help them to build up the momentum once again. I find it hard to accept the good faith of any head of a Government who approaches the people in that particular way.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must accept all the criticism which now can so deservedly be laid at his door.  As other Deputies have said, it is despicable in the extreme that all this wailing and moaning <Col N="1456" /> was left to the last few days of this session of the Dáil.  We had the Budget a few months ago.  If that Budget was notable for anything it was for its entire failure to do anything to solve the economic difficulties which were then so obviously facing this country.  Why were the steps not taken then, it is fair to ask.  The reason is that the Government did not wish to be subjected to criticism from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in introducing the Estimate for his Department, had a brief which ran to 23 columns of the Official Report.  The amount which he devoted to prices in that particular contribution of his runs to something less than three-quarters of a column.  Even when he does mention the subject and gives it only a passing reference, he states that he is satisfied that the workings of the 1958 Prices Act have kept the situation in control and that no further action on his part is required.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, the Fianna Fáil Party standard-bearers, one of whom is the son of the Taoiseach, spoke about the Fianna Fáil years of Government as being full of change.  This is the kind of change they talk about.  Two months ago there was no need for additional price control.  As far as prices were concerned, everything was rosy and perfect.  Now, there is a total change and there is need to bring in this new restrictive Prices Bill.  It is in now and is before us for consideration. We in Fine Gael are not going to withhold from the Government any powers so obviously necessary to prevent any further rise in the spiral of prices.</P>
    <P>We do not believe a Bill of this kind can solve the difficulty of the price structure in this or any other country. The OECD have pointed out that our economy is like the economies of Holland, Belgium and Norway, and such that it would be relatively easy to have a broadly-based incomes policy here.  Our failure has been the way in which the present administration has sought to divorce incomes and prices, to divorce costs and prices. Every price contains an element of <Col N="1457" /> income.  It is just as important to control the amount of income in any price as it is to endeavour to have some form of agreement for wages and salaries. There have been periods here in which workers have been limited to eight per cent increases in wages and, at the same time, profit margins have increased as much as 46 per cent.  How can you expect the person drawing a wage or salary of a known figure every week to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of a Government who make no effort to control incomes except the incomes of wages and salary earners?</P>
    <P>To speak in this way is not to speak against the <i>entrepreneurs</i> who contribute their skill and capital for the development of industry and commerce and agriculture.  To speak in this way is to speak rationally.  It is to say that in a country endeavouring to plan the pace of economic progress and the pace of capital investment, in a society planning an increased growth of improvement in social services, we are only codding ourselves if we do not at the same time plan for an agreed and steady rate of income increases. Because we have failed to do this, as other countries have done it, we have the worst spiral of price increases in recent years in all Europe. That is the situation for which the Taoiseach, who wants us to believe he has led us and wishes still to lead us, is entirely responsible.</P>
    <P>We criticise this crisis measure because it is not creative.  What we need is a creative prices policy, a creative incomes policy and a creative economic policy, so that all these things will dovetail into one another and that we do not try to run them, as we have in the past, in entirely separate Departments.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said the present scale of prices was a symptom and not a cause of our economic difficulties.  I certainly would not agree with him there, and I think many economists would not agree with him.  Prices are a substantial contributory factor to our present economic difficulties.  They certainly have not helped us to expand our exports to meet our increased imports.  The difference between now and any financial difficulties <Col N="1458" /> that existed seven years ago is this: our difficulties at present arise in the main from internal causes, whereas those of seven years ago arose because of causes as remote as the Argentine and Suez.  Therefore, if we are to assess, in discharge of our democratic duty, who is to blame for the present situation, that blame must fall on the present Government and in particular on the man who boasted he would lead the country and got a mandate from the country only a few months ago to lead them in the future.</P>
    <P>On this question of prices, I should like to hear from the Taoiseach and the Government exactly how they propose to control the prices of foodstuffs and other items to be found on the shelves of any grocer's shop, be it a supermarket or a one-man business. There are several disparities in the prices at which retailers can purchase goods from manufacturers and importers. Some foreign-based supermarkets have been able to arrange to buy commodities at prices which are 20, 30 or even 40 per cent cheaper than that at which the same commodities are made available to other people.  If it is possible for manufacturers and importers to make commodities available at those low prices to foreign enterprises that have come in here, one would hope the Government would see to it that the same commodities are made available at similar prices to Irish retailers.</P>
    <P>I can illustrate this by an example. Some time ago we had the rather Gilbertian situation of a supermarket in a street in Dublin offering bottles of salad cream at 10½d., while across the road in the same street we had another store which is also one of a chain of shops, offering the same bottles of salad cream at 11d.  The second chain was able to inform the public&mdash;I have seen the proof of this &mdash;that they were selling the salad cream at the price at which they purchased it, to wit, 11d. per bottle but their competitors were able to sell it at 10½d. because it was sold to them at 9d. per bottle.  How can we try to regulate prices in a Bill such as this if we have such a variation at the very start of the prices cycle?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> That is why we feel this Bill is not going to solve the prices problem in the way so necessary at present.  It is mainly a permissive Bill, and it is up to the Government to prove it can be worked.  It is no more that a red herring.  Perhaps it is a bribe to try to persuade the wage earners to stand back and not look for any increases because the Government are now making an effort to peg prices.  I believe it will crumble in their hands if they try to work it, because I do not think it is suited to our conditions at present.</P>
    <P>We are extremely alarmed by the Government's announcement of further credit restrictions.  We did not think it was possible to restrict credit any further.  We are aware that for the past eight or nine months the Government have been denying in the House that there has been credit restriction.  We have had this subterfuge of refusing to answer Dáil questions used to prevent the Government giving an admission to the country that there is serious credit restriction.  It was only within the past couple of weeks we had an admission that there is credit restriction.  Not only is there credit restriction but it is credit restriction as a result of direction from the Government.  They thought they were getting away with it.  A certain amount of blame was attached to the banks and, in particular, to individual bank managers.  Now everybody knows, as we continually remind them, that this credit restriction is the result of a direction from the Government that it should be imposed. Deputy Burke said that some years ago a person could not get twopence from a bank manager.  He would not get twopence today; he would not get anything.  The bank manager would almost take the twopence from his pocket before he left the bank.</P>
    <P>There are many long-established respectable business, family concerns that for as long as they can remember have had overdraft arrangements in order to cover stock and other recurring expenses of that kind.  All these long-established, respectable businesses have security many times in excess of the limit of their overdraft.  As the <Col N="1460" /> years have gone by, the value of their security has increased because of increases in prices in the property market.  Despite that, many of these concerns have been told in the past six months that they must reduce their overdraft and those who have not reduced them have been prevented from writing cheques on the banks where they and their ancestors have been customers for decades past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke complained that utterances from this side of the House might damage the reputation of this country abroad in financial circles. Nothing could be so damaging to the reputation of this country in international commercial circles than the inability of traders to pay for goods they purchased.  That has happened, and there are several traders and importing agencies in serious difficulties and have already been threatened with or have had instituted against them legal proceedings for non-payment. The reason they have not been able to pay is that the overdrafts which they had assumed would be left to them as in the past have been withdrawn and they have not been able to pay for goods purchased many months ago.  The result is that they have lost the trade discounts to which they were entitled and always got by making prompt payment.  Now they have to pay more for these goods and this in turn is going to inject new increased costs into the distributive trade.</P>
    <P>We pressed the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, on this matter within the past month and he said he was not aware of it.  Then, under pressure, he said he had heard complaints about it and that he would inquire into it.  He conceded reluctantly that it was undesirable, but notwithstanding that, instead of doing something to improve the situation, we have the Taoiseach coming in and saying that not only is that situation to be allowed to continue but that he is going to turn the screws even tighter. The inevitable result will be a series of bankruptcies and failures in business over the next year.  One is concerned about the ultimate result. Already there has been an undesirable <Col N="1461" /> injection into the distributive trade by foreign concerns, who have invested their money here in chains of supermarkets and other forms of retail outlets, and as a result have damaged long-established retailers who have given good service to the community in which they were born and in which they had a stake.</P>
    <P>If the result of all this activity of curtailing credit is to be the ruination of Irish businesses which are to be bought out by people who are able to bring money from abroad, where there is no restriction, our distribution trade will pass into hands which are not Irish.  This would be an extremely undesirable development.  We have been told that there are to be new hire purchase restrictions.  Already in my constituency, where probably more cars are assembled than in any other constituency, we have had an amount of under-employment and disemployment in the motor car industry.  I was disappointed to hear my colleague from Dublin South-West, Deputy Dr. O'Connell, speaking about the Mercedes cars and not being aware that they were assembled in his constituency. Perhaps Deputy Norton could draw his attention to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy does.  Just a stone's throw from Deputy Dr. O'Connell's residence, he will find the Mercedes works, and I am quite certain if he asked for an opportunity to visit the factory he would be afforded the opportunity to do so.  In Dublin South-West they also assemble the Volkswagen, the DKW, the Morris, the Standard and the Triumph and on the borders there is the Booth Poole works where the Wolseley and other cars are assembled. Most of the people employed in this industry come from my constituency, many of them my friends, and many <Col N="1462" /> of them concerned about the trend in the industry.</P>
      <P>The inevitable result of this new restriction will be redundancy in the industry.  This is coming at an extremely bad time.  One recalls the investigations into the motor assembly industry, in relation to our possible entry into the Common Market, when it was pointed out how vulnerable an industry it was.  Notwithstanding the difficulties facing them, some of the people in the industry have shown commendable courage and there has been a considerable amount of capital invested in it.  The result of this will be that we will have capital machinery and buildings lying idle in Dublin and other places.  That will happen in a matter of weeks, and has already happened to some extent.  The Austin concern is shortly to move into my constituency, again part of this increased capital investment in the industry.  One is appalled to think of the future that faces them if this restriction is to be permitted to continue.</P>
      <P>My information from bank managers is that the credit squeeze is going to last not for six months or 12 months but for three years.  That is the minimum period quoted to me, but some bank managers have gone as far as to say it will be five years.  The result of that will be mass unemployment. We in Fine Gael will not stand for any deflation which will cause unemployment. We believe that the greatest asset this country has is its labour force and that in no circumstances should that force be permitted to run down.  That is why we have appealed to the Government for measures other than those which will bring about redundancy in several industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already had the sad experience of the large GEC works in Dundalk closing down.  Fortunately, they have been able to continue manufacturing electrical equipment in the Dunleer works but the inevitable effect of greater hire purchase restrictions on domestic electric appliances and non-domestic electric appliances will be a further amount of redundancy in the electrical goods industry here. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning <Col N="1463" /> and there are several other industries which have already been affected by this credit squeeze and none more than the building industry.</P>
    <P>It is appalling to think that this serious situation should be mentioned only in the closing hours of this Dáil session.  The country is entitled to know that the Taoiseach was extremely angry with the Fine Gael Party when we indicated we were not prepared to bring the business of this Dáil to an end this week in order to allow him and his Ministers to go off on a three-month vacation.</P>
    <P>I had asked the Taoiseach earlier to tell us and the people of the country whether he and some of his colleagues intended going abroad between now and 20th October next, for how long, where they were going and what the cost would be.  This is a reasonable and valid question.  One regularly asks one's friends and neighbours where they are going during the holidays, and when they are going.  When we ask civil questions like that here, we are entitled to civil answers.</P>
    <P>If we ask the Taoiseach whether he wants to let the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs go to study postal facilities in Helsinki, we are entitled to know when the Minister is going, how long he will be away and what the cost will be.  We are also entitled to be told how many other members of the Government, with attendant civil servants, are going abroad between now and October, what the purpose of their visits is and the cost.  Since the Minister for Local Government went abroad to study housebuilding in Europe and America, we have had fewer houses built.  We are entitled to know whether visits abroad by other Ministers will bring about restrictions in the activities of their Departments.</P>
    <P>I chastise the Taoiseach for not giving us an answer to those questions. I can assure him that I shall put the question down for 20th October next and I had better be given an answer as to the time he and his colleagues spent abroad, the purpose of their visits and the cost while they were away.  It is an extraordinary business that we should have so many Ministers going <Col N="1464" /> abroad during the summer vacation. I do not know what benefit it has brought to the country.  Any Ministers who have been abroad have brought nothing back but disadvantage to their respective Departments.  Mind you, I do not say some Departments would not be considerably better off if the Ministers stayed away altogether, but this a democracy and I suppose they must be there sometimes.  One can only hope that in the future Ministers going abroad will bring something of value back to their offices instead of travelling the world for nothing at public expense.</P>
    <P>I thought I had finished with the question of hire purchase but I should like to return to it to refer to one other point.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to increase the percentage of deposit and considers this a legitimate restriction.  I have no desire to restrict legitimate hire purchase transactions in any way, although I do not think we should commend restrictions, but there are a number of types of undesirable hire purchase transactions and if any restriction is to be imposed, these are the kinds of contracts we should get at.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of fraudulent dealing involved in some hire purchase transactions.  I shall illustrate it.  A man goes in to buy a secondhand car.  He is told the price of the car will be £400.  He brings with him his old car to trade-in and the trade-in price he is allowed may be £50.  He is told the deposit on the car he proposes to buy must be £100 and because the trade-in price on his old car is only £50, a further £50 in cash is required.  In many cases, the purchaser does not have to provide the extra £50.  The garage man says: &ldquo;We shall arrange this.  Let us call the price of the new car £450 and we shall allow you a deposit of £100 on the old car.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These transactions are falling on the desks of hire purchase companies as thickly as leaves in the autumn.  I know this because many people consulting members of the legal profession, professionally, tell about articles they bought and in the course of their narratives, describe cases of the kind I have mentioned.  It is something we <Col N="1465" /> must stop.  It is wrong, almost bordering on the criminal.  There is a serious element of criminality in it, and if it occurs frequently, it is not healthy or good for the country.</P>
    <P>Still on the question of hire purchase, we have asked the Government, and they have refused, to allow a cooling off period.  If the Government feel there is an undesirable amount of fraudulent hire purchase dealings, we agree they should kill such transactions. There are transactions involving goods which people buy on the spur of the moment, before they consider their need for them or their ability to pay for them.  In Britain, after many years of agitation, it was agreed to introduce a cooling off period.  This has been done during the past year.  Why can we not have a similar provision here since we propose to introduce new hire purchase restrictions?</P>
    <P>Nothing must have hurt our national pride more for many a year than the Taoiseach's admission that he is now the chief money-scavenger in Europe. To what state have we descended that we have got to go out begging and scraping for money in the world's money markets in order to help us run the country?</P>

      <P>It has sickened us in the past two days to hear people outside this House saying they were aware of the economic and financial crisis in the country while it had escaped the attention of the Members of this House. The Official Reports are bulging with warnings from the Fine Gael Party in recent times about the crisis that was developing.  During the recent election campaign, the Taoiseach and his Party sneered at the detail in which we quoted our warnings about the Government's bad policy in the economic and financial fields.  We have given consistent, constructive suggestions to the Government and they have just as consistently ignored them.  In the light of that, we find it very difficult to accept the appeal by the Taoiseach for our help in the plight that has descended on him.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is a master of verbiage and, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has just educated us on the precise words the Taoiseach used in connection with his scavenging for money abroad, may I point out that we find the same man who is so skilful in words saying that one of the Government's proposals for dealing with the situation was the reorganisation of the Government's capital programme to keep the total outlay within the forecast in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>?  Does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs know the meaning of that?</P>

      <P>It possibly means a lot more, but in the absence of printed reports of all kinds, I had not the opportunity to do the necessary homework by relating the capital plan in the Government's Second Programme to that statement, which means there will be a slicing off of £2½ million from housing investment this year, this, mind you, at a time when building and housing costs are rising.  The so-called Government <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published before the last increases in house building costs took place.  These increases were caused by the industrial dispute which the Government encouraged last year.  The increase in house building costs ranged from 20 to 35 per cent.  The targets in the Second Programme were set on old prices.  Notwithstanding all that, we have a reduction of £2½ million in the value of new houses built in this country in the last year.  That is utterly inexcusable.</P>

      <P>We in Fine Gael, who are pledged to the just society, will not remain silent.  The Taoiseach asked us to be patriotic.  There are many of us who consider our patriotism is to rid this country of Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáilism.  We shall make every endeavour to do that.  We do not consider patriotism in the form of dead things like rocks or the Donegal Mountains and things of that nature.  We see patriotism as devotion to our fellow-citizens and in discharge of that patriotism, we want to see homes are built for our citizens. Those who do not do that will have to suffer the penalties they so well deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, and the former Tánaiste, during the general election made great play of the Fine Gael proposals for the reform of our banking system.  They said what Fine Gael wanted to do was to get hold of the <Col N="1468" /> banks so that they could restrict credit and cause unemployment.  The Taoiseach and the former Tánaiste, now Deputy McEntee, went up and down this country terrifying the people that Fine Gael wanted to restrict all credit.  There are only two interpretations one can put on this. The first is that the Fianna Fáil understanding of banking is such that that is what they thought we wanted. When we see what they are now doing, it is obvious they thought the only way to run the banks was to restrict credit. That is exactly what they are doing now.  Let no blame with regard to this attach to the commercial banks.  Let no blame with regard to it attach to the Central Bank.  Let the blame lie where it deserves to lie and where it originated.  It originated from Deputy Seán Lemass, the man who sought to obtain authority for leadership on the green slogan &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The sad thing is that last year when corrective measures should have been taken, because of the trend in the economy, the Government did not take the steps then to deal with the banking situation.  The really sad thing is we have wasted seven years of reasonable plenty. We have wasted seven years when there was no need for a vice-like grip on our banks.  We wasted those years when we could have reformed our whole banking system.  This would have prevented the ups and downs, the booms and slumps which will inevitably fall on this country until such time as the necessary reformatory steps are taken.</P>
    <P>We are now in the middle of a slump and all the indications are that we are going to have a worse and more prolonged slump than we have ever had in our history.  The blame for that lies, as I have said before, and repeated many times, and as I shall continue to repeat, on the man who claimed he was leading the country on the right road.  This man is leading us whither we do not know.  The people are getting extremely weary of trying to follow this man, who, like the Duke of Plaza Toro, is leading from a behind position which he finds more interesting and less embarrassing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, let me welcome <Col N="1469" /> this Prices Bill, but not without considerable reservation.  Nevertheless, I should like to welcome it.  I believe this Bill does rather too little and much too late but at least it shows that the Government have at last realised the necessity for price control.  Although this took a considerable amount of prodding from us, at least it is a step forward in Government thinking.</P>
      <P>Exactly three weeks ago today, I spoke in this House and I pointed out to the Minister for Finance the danger to the economy which the Taoiseach outlined to us on Tuesday.  I said we would be cowardly if we failed to mention these dangers.  I mentioned that one of these dangers was the utter dissatisfaction and discontent of the wage and salary earners with the way in which prices had risen over the past 12 to 18 months and the way in which the 12 per cent increase in wages had been taken away piece by piece until it has now entirely disappeared.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the possibility of another round of wage increases and the damage this would do to our export trade.  I mentioned the necessity to reactivate the Prices Advisory Body and the necessity to introduce price control.  I said this should be a public inquiry, that it should be conducted by some competent body and that the public should see whatever increases in prices were allowed by this body would be justified and that they would be satisfied that the necessity for those increases had been established.  I asked the Government to consult with the different sections of the community to formulate an incomes policy which would prevent the nation from deviating into an economic jungle in which the stronger sections might survive but at the expense of the weaker and less organised sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, I believe, is a small move in that direction and, as such, I welcome it, not because of the perfection of the Bill itself but because it is a move in what I consider is a direction towards economic sanity and some type of Government planning on a reasonable scale.  I recognise, as the Taoiseach has said, the difficulties of controlling the price of every commodity. <Col N="1470" /> Let us be frank about this; this is practically impossible but the price of the essential items which are reflected in the cost of living could be controlled to a large extent.  There are great difficulties in doing this but the Government should control those prices first.  Because of those difficulties and the headaches they may cause in the future it is all the more reason why the Government should take the advice of people who are competent to give it to them.  They should have taken advice before we were in the middle of a crisis.  If the Government take this advice, there will be a better approach by all sections of the community to this matter.</P>
    <P>I believe that the time to bring this prices body into existence was when the 12 per cent wage increase was first introduced, and not now, when prices have whittled away the increases wage earners and salary earners obtained. In spite of the Taoiseach's appeal for responsibility, I think the Government are not sincere in their approach in bringing in this Bill a week before the Dáil adjourns, and trying to force it through, hoping it will not be discussed and that it will frighten the Irish Congress of Trade Unions next week in Cork away from advocating higher wages and salaries for their members. The Taoiseach appealed to the patriotism of the workers.  He asked them not to rock the national boat, but he did not appeal to any other section in the past 12 or 18 months not to rock the national boat.  He was utterly unconvincing about the necessity for patriotism or stability until he found himself in the middle of an emergency.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Taoiseach actually said.  Here I should like to draw the attention of the House to the difficulty Deputies had in obtaining copies of his speech and to all the conniving that was necessary to get a copy.  It is typical of the Government's planning that in a crisis we could not get the Taoiseach's speech produced efficiently so that we could see it and criticise it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach started by denying that there was any recession, or any crisis, or any emergency.  He said there was no need for panic, and then he <Col N="1471" /> proceeded to deal with the situation as if all these crises and recessions were in fact, present.  I believe the Taoiseach's action is justified by present circumstances.  I also believe he should stop playing politics.  We in the Labour Party intend to assist the country, but the Taoiseach cannot be allowed to stand up there and treat us as if we were simpletons by pretending there is no emergency and, at the same time, appealing to the House to assist him in ten emergency steps to deal with it.  We are used to a certain amount of two-faced behaviour from the Taoiseach, but there comes a stage when he cannot be allowed to get away with it.  He can be assured that we will help him, but let us make it clear that there is an economic situation which is far from healthy.</P>
    <P>I believe that the economic problems facing us consist of two parts: the external aspect over which we have no control; and the internal aspect over which we have control.  I would remove responsibility for the external difficulties from the Government.  We are a very small nation in the financial and economic world, and there is nothing which this Government, or any Government, can do to influence outside events to any great extent. This I believe to be true whatever Government are in office, and I believe it was also true in 1956 when we had an inter-Party Government, and when Fianna Fáil were not quite so generous, and tried to lay the blame for that economic situation at the door of the inter-Party Government.  At least we have now demonstrated the truth and killed the lies and slanders we had from Fianna Fáil in the past few years.  There is nothing that any Irish Government can do to cope to any extent with this external situation.  Let us kill this fairy tale which Fianna Fáil found it convenient to resurrect.</P>
    <P>There are a few comments I should like to make on the internal situation. Many of the difficulties which we have to face were brought about by the Government themselves.  The turnover tax which they introduced on the necessaries of life, increased the cost of living to a very considerable <Col N="1472" /> extent.  It was introduced by the Government on the basis that there was no other method of raising taxes. They said it would not increase the cost of living, and that it was the solution to all our future problems. We have since seen the sad fact that it has not solved those problems.  We are back to the same old type of taxation again, pushing up internal prices and wages to a very considerable extent, and that will continue in the future. The Government accepted very bad advice when they introduced that tax in that form, and I am sure they must regret it.  The fact is that they made a mistake in introducing it, but that is no reason why they should not have second thoughts.  To make a mistake is one thing, but to continue to try to justify a mistake is utter stupidity.</P>
    <P>On several occasions since I became a member of this House I have advocated that this tax should be collected at source.  If the goods are manufactured here it should be collected at the factory, and if they are imported it should be collected at the port.  If the Government wished to change the rate of taxation, from time to time, and from industry to industry, that could be done without any great dislocation, and it would be more or less similar to the British purchase tax which is changed from industry to industry, and from situation to situation. That would allow them to control the present situation to a far greater extent than the Taoiseach now has power to do.  Instead of relying on hire purchase control and credit restrictions, we should change and vary the rate of taxation.  That would be a far more economic method of collecting the tax, and it would avoid tax evasion.  I would consider that good sound planning, but the present method&mdash;and particularly putting it on the essentials of life&mdash;is stupid.  It is hard to understand how any Government who consider themselves a reasonable Government could try to justify it and maintain it.</P>
    <P>At the time of the 12 per cent wage agreement the Government should have had the foresight to bring in a Prices Bill to control the cost of living. One did not need to be a financial <Col N="1473" /> wizard to foresee the situation which was developing, and to realise we would in a short period be exactly where we are now, with prices taking away the benefit of the wage increases, and wage earners looking for another round of wage increases.  The Government must be peculiarly shortsighted and stupid if they could not see 12 or 18 months ahead and visualise this position.</P>
    <P>Indeed, within the past few weeks we heard the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce assert several times that there was no need for price control, that it was unnecessary.  Yet today we have the Taoiseach's word for it that it is necessary.  Within the past few weeks, apparently, Government thinking has undergone a drastic change.  That is a pretty poor reflection on the leadership of the Government.  During the recent election the Taoiseach was held up to the country as the man with more wisdom and planning than anyone else in the country.  If this is the result of his planning and wisdom it is pretty poor.  I do not think any Deputy no matter how inexperienced could have done worse.  I hope that in the future the Taoiseach will stop pontificating and listen to good advice when he gets it in this House.  He should realise that all the wisdom is not concentrated in the front bench of Fianna Fáil, or in the back bench of Fianna Fáil either, but that every section of the House has something to contribute.  He should listen to good advice and he should be less reluctant to take it.</P>
    <P>I have no interest in playing politics. I do not come here to find fault with the Government.  I believe that I should offer constructive criticism and helpful advice.  A certain Hemmingway character was asked how he became insolvent and his answer was: &ldquo;In the usual way; gradually and suddenly&rdquo;. Apparently this is what happened to the Government.  Gradually our balance of payments position has become worse&mdash;this information is readily available to anyone who reads the monthly reports; yet recently the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement led us to believe he was not <Col N="1474" /> concerned about this; apparently he was quite happy about it&mdash;and suddenly the Taoiseach discovered we are in the middle of a financial crisis, although he declines to call it that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach blames the British surcharge for a large part of our export difficulties.  This is probably quite true; yet, in my view, his reaction to the surcharge was not vigorous enough. We are the second or third most important customer the British have and we should have been able to make quite a stand to be treated on a different basis.  If we had made it difficult for them and if we had put some retaliatory levy on British goods coming in here we would have achieved more and they would have more respect for us.  We seem to have got the worst of the two situations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that the capital inflow had slowed down.  We are all aware that a very considerable proportion of this capital came here from Britain, came from people fearing the advent to power of the British Labour Party and who were putting their money here in safe keeping. However, the bulk of that money had arrived here either before or immediately after the British election and it is not surprising that the inflow has since slowed down.  In the event of a Conservative Government being returned to office in Britain this position will reverse itself and the money will tend to flow back to Britain.  I would like to draw the Government's attention to this so that they will not be taken by surprise and so that they will have time to think for it, plan for it and be prepared for such an eventuality before it happens.</P>
    <P>Another point is that matter of bank deposits.  The decision of the Government to compel the banks to return to the Revenue Commissioners the amount of deposits and the names and addresses of the depositors, with the amount of interest earned, was a very shortsighted policy.  I do not know what income tax the Revenue Commissioners gain from this knowledge and what they manage to take from these people, but the fact that that money was there was no great secret to anybody.  It was known it was there <Col N="1475" /> and because it allowed the banks to extend credit it was overlooked by various Governments.  The decision to collect revenue on these deposits has been largely responsible for the outflow of that money from this country. People who had believed themselves safe with this money on deposit found that they were not and it is now deposited in banks outside the State. It is most unlikely that we will ever see it returned.  This is a great loss to the Irish banking system and to the people who want credit from the banks.</P>
    <P>The decision in the Budget to increase from £25 to £50 the amount of money which it is necessary for the banks to return is an admission by the Taoiseach of the seriousness of the position.  When the Budget was introduced we were given to understand that there was no difficulty, so this decision has nothing to do with the present situation.  This is something which we all realised some months ago was a mistake and the Government are now trying to rectify it, but I am afraid their effort is far too late to achieve any practical result.</P>
    <P>Another decision has been to increase the market development grants from 40 to 55 per cent to firms who increase their exports by up to ten per cent in the second half of this year. Up to ten per cent gives the impression that there must be an increase of ten per cent, but that is not so.  If a factory increases its exports by a quarter per cent apparently they will qualify for the grant.  Any factory increasing its exports over ten per cent will get a grant increase of 25 per cent.  This means that a factory increasing its exports by 10.1 per cent or 10.25 per cent will get a grant of 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is not demanding enough from the exporter.  It means that for every 75 per cent grant given to the exporter the taxpayer will be paying 7½ per cent of the ten per cent levy into Britain.  It demands very little effort from the exporters to get these grants and we should demand something more from them.  There is also the question of how these grants should be financed.  I believe that the taxpayer <Col N="1476" /> has more than enough hands in his pocket from every direction at the moment.  This is surely a situation in which we should have put a levy on selected British imports and from that levy finance the grants we are giving to exporters to compete in the British market.  If the money has to be paid by somebody surely the British should pay it on their exports to this country.  However, that is probably too normal and too logical a solution to appeal to the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some mention of credit restrictions.  In the present situation I think it fair enough that spending on inessential consumer goods should be reduced.  This cannot be achieved without hurting some section of the community but I do not think that these credit restrictions ought to apply to money being used for genuinely beneficial purposes. Finances for housing have been restricted in recent months.  That is utterly wrong.  It is bad planning and a stupid method of applying these restrictions.  Housing is a national asset.  Houses have to be built and the sooner they are built the cheaper they will be built.</P>
    <P>I would like a definite undertaking from the Taoiseach that there will be no restrictions on credit for housing purposes and that the existing restrictions will be removed.  As the Government hope to get the support of the Labour Party on this measure, and in this situation, the least they can do is reassure us that there will be no tightening up of credit for housing. There is no point in the Minister for Local Government coming in here with a Housing Bill and making capital out of it and trying to lead us to believe that now at last we will see something in the way of dealing with the national housing problem, which is getting worse instead of better, if the Taoiseach arrives in the following week with an emergency situation. When he is making his reply perhaps he will tell us what exactly he intends to do about housing.  This is a very important point.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I should like to mention before I finish.  It is in relation to the Prices Body itself.  We <Col N="1477" /> are led to believe they will go back and inquire retrospectively into the recent price increases.  An inquiry is at the moment being held by the Fair Trade Commission into prices of drink.  This inquiry does not, I believe, include the brewers and the distillers. If the Government have any sincerity or any honesty they will tell us what they are proposing to do.  The least they can do is inquire into the necessity for the increases in prices by the brewers and distillers at this stage.  It is only 18 months at the most since the time of the 12 per cent wage agreement when the distillers and brewers readjusted their prices and brought them up-to-date to deal with the situation then.  Now we find that without any material increase of any kind they are finding it necessary to increase their prices again and the Government apparently do not feel this is something which should be investigated.  I hope they will investigate it and that they will force the brewers and distillers to prove clearly that these increases were necessary.  I hope the Government will now show some political honesty to the electorate and that they will force these people to reduce their prices.</P>
    <P>This Prices Bill is not what we would like.  It is introduced in completely the wrong circumstances.  It should be brought in at a time of stability instead of being rushed through as an emergency measure. Anyway, it is an admission from the Government that they were wrong and that they did not take the advice they should have taken.  Because this is a step in the right direction, we will support the Bill and we hope that Government planning in the future will be better and that the Government will be more ready to listen to good advice and that we can rely on them now to think before they act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my intention to come in on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, but as matters turned out the Opposition failed to make any worthwhile contribution and the debate closed and any bouquets I have to throw at the Minister for Industry and Commerce would <Col N="1478" /> be as usefully dispensed in his own office.</P>
      <P>On this particular Estimate I should like to compliment the Taoiseach on his very forthright and typical approach to what he describes rightly as a difficult position.  Due to world conditions we have suffered, let us say, an economic setback, but I have no doubt that his positive approach and his positive remedies will produce the necessary measures of correction.  He was honest with the House when he asked for the co-operation of the Opposition Deputies and I think he did so in the belief that he would get it.</P>
      <P>I should also like to commend the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave, for his willingness to co-operate with the Taoiseach and the Government in the present position. The Leader of the Opposition did make the reservation that his Party would not be gagged and that they were entitled to make criticism of certain Government activities.  Nevertheless, I think I would be correct in saying that some of his troops have breached that faith.  I was here last night and I expected a reasonable standard of debate in this House.  I am a new Deputy, but unfortunately I heard a most degrading performance from the Opposition benches, so much so that I was inclined to think that there were some remnants of a most fiendish and unspeakable characteristic of the 1930's still evident in this House.</P>
      <P>Anyhow, we must pass from that.  I should say as well that Deputy M.J. O'Higgins was not slow to remind new Deputies in the Fianna Fáil benches of the patriotic background of Fine Gael.  I do not think we need wait for Deputy M.J. O'Higgins to remind us of patriotism.  Most of the Deputies in the back benches of Fianna Fáil are new and they are doing their best to learn and I can truthfully say they were born into a good tradition of national service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been criticised for their administration from time to time, but, nevertheless, any worthwhile development in this country has come from Fianna Fáil.  You have the development <Col N="1479" /> of the ESB, Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company.  I am very closely associated with the Sugar Company and I will say they have done a considerable and commendable job in developing the economy of this country.  However, it appears to me they are not getting the type of support they should expect.  The increase in imports over the past six months has been one of the major factors contributing to the decline in which we find ourselves at the moment.  I can talk from my own particular sector on that trend and I am sorry to say that the support for Erin Food Products has been very poor indeed by most sectors of the community, Munster and Cork excepted.</P>
    <P>The ratio of Erin foods in Dublin or Irish-made products against imported ones is three to one against.  In Connacht, it is two to one against and in Munster, there are two units of Irish products used against every single unit of imported ones.  This morning we had to endure the dirge of the west: everything was wrong; the Government were wrong and they could not do anything for the west of Ireland and for the western people who are stated to be in a bad plight.  Nevertheless, there is a sugar factory in the west, in Tuam, and the state of affairs in the west is that the people, having been given the opportunities&mdash;the land, the resources, the machinery and all the advisory services&mdash;are still supplying only 4,000 acres of the total acreage of beet supplied to the sugar factory.  The whole position seems to resolve itself into the fact that the western people expect too much from the Government.</P>
    <P>We have a sugar factory in Mallow and a food factory in Midleton and these factories are thriving.  The problem confronting the promoters is the availability of labour.  That is a good state of affairs.  The west has got its chance and I do not think that the Galway section anyway has made the best use of its opportunity.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, problems arise from buoyancy in the economy and from a high standard of living and well-being <Col N="1480" /> amongst the community because then unnecessary luxury goods are imported in large quantities and the balance of payments problem which their importation involves is one of the banes of the Government at the moment.  In my view, the Government are taking necessary corrective measures in this respect.</P>
    <P>We have our problems in my constituency. For instance, we have a housing shortage.  There again, private and local enterprises are very important.  We cannot look to the Government for everything.  In Mallow, for instance, a public utility society is building houses on its own and is cooperating with the Government in not asking the Government to do the job for them.  That is the type of industrial trend which is required among the Irish people.</P>
    <P>No matter how we may look at the picture, the future of our country must rest on our agricultural produce. Therefore, any industries which we hope to establish should be based on our agricultural produce.  Fianna Fáil have certainly done a very good job in that respect.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, we have good employment.  We have a few black spots here and there.  We must get industries for Kanturk, Fermoy, Buttevant and Newmarket.  I would urge the Government to base industry where there are industrious people, not cribbers and criers and people who are looking to the Government for everything.  I would ask them to base industry on places where people are willing to work and will give good value for their earnings.</P>
    <P>I do not care to dwell on the record of Fine Gael but I must point out that in my constituency Fianna Fáil have a very good record.  When I reflect on conditions under the Coalition Government, I remember that a black coffin came to Mallow in 1956; the people do not want that again.  It is obvious that the people have complete confidence in the ability of Fianna Fáil to develop our economy.</P>
    <P>The Opposition seem to be trying to make the case that there is a state of panic in the country at the moment and, of course, they seek to blame <Col N="1481" /> Fianna Fáil for this state of panic which is alleged to exist.  Fine Gael seek to guide the thinking of the country to the view that the economy is in trouble.  It is not in trouble but the Taoiseach was courageous and man enough, in his own typical way, to explain that the signs are there, that unless we take corrective action now and unless the Government realise their responsibility in this matter.  We really could be in trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cronin has described himself as one of the young Fianna Fáil Deputies who are learning their job.  If this is his first contribution to debate in this House then all I can say is that he has learned fairly fast and is to be complimented. He managed to get in a first-class plug for his constituency in County Cork, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was listening.  He said there are no cribbers and criers in County Cork, that they are all hard workers there and that it is obviously the place to which to bring industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton said he was one of the few fortunate Deputies who were able to get a copy of the Taoiseach's statement and consequently he was able to deal with it in a systematic and comprehensive way.  I have not been able to get a copy and it is not easy to remember the details two days later.  However, yesterday, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking he said he did not expect the Opposition Deputies to restrict themselves in any way in their treatment of the present situation.  He said he did not expect, nor did the members of the Government expect, any mercy from the Opposition but that he did expect and hope for the maxi mum amount of co-operation in the efforts being made to overcome the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can speak only for myself but I am sure it goes for many others when I say that we are extremely anxious that no act of ours would in any way interfere with that effort.  In fact, we would be anxious to take a positive part in trying to overcome the difficulties of the country at the present time.  It is only right, at the same time, that we on this side of the House should speak our minds <Col N="1482" /> and my mind is that the Rake's Progress has come to its inevitable end.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came in here a couple of days ago and made a comprehensive confession.  I hope it is a full confession and that the position is no worse than he described it.  He gave me the impression of a man who was very worried, of a man who had kept the true position away from the people as long as he could but could bluff no longer.  It is a strange thing but it is a fact that for the past few years at every function that was held in the country there was a Government Minister present who told the people about the prosperous economy and about the healthy state of the nation generally.  Everything was prospering under Fianna Fáil and nothing could go wrong.  As other Deputies have said, the slogan was: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  Now, instead of that Utopian nonsense, if we had been honest and sincere with the people I think we would have been continuously reminding them, and that the Government would have been at pains to keep before the minds of the people, that an enormous job had still to be done, that this is a small country with few resources, that, if we are to get even a comfortable standard of living for our people, we must have full development in the shortest possible time and, furthermore, that we can never hope to enjoy, if &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; is the right word, the standards of living other countries have.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, as I say, we were telling the people that this is a country flowing with milk and honey: &ldquo;There is full and plenty for all&mdash; come and get it&rdquo;.  What, then, could we expect?  We had an affluent society there, all right.  How can we expect the people to put in the necessary effort to achieve the sort of development our country requires if we say it is already there?  I think that this has done an immense amount of harm. We have given our people a false sense of security and we are now reaping the harvest.</P>
    <P>We should have been telling the people continuously that we should be ashamed of the fact that we still have a chronic 50,000 people unemployed; <Col N="1483" /> that we have emigration at a rate of 25,000 persons per annum; that we have an enormous adverse balance of payments position; that we have approximately 60,000 houses unfit for human habitation and incapable of economic repair; that we have approximately another 60,000 houses overcrowded and that we have probably 50,000 houses unfit for human habitation but capable of economic repair.  We have approximately 100,000 families living in unfit conditions.  This is the prosperous economy that has been dangled in front of the people's eyes all the time and for which Fianna Fáil have been responsible.  We have not half enough schools or teachers, and nobody will more readily admit that than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have had no improvement in the health services for years, and now the prospect of improvement is vanishing.</P>
    <P>These facts should have been kept continually before the people instead of this perpetual nonsense that no effort was needed.  Labour have a part to play here, too.  Everybody at every level has a part to play.  I have always felt that the trade unions were wrong in concentrating too much time and energy trying to get marginal improvements for the people already in employment while not seeming to pay sufficient attention to the 50,000 chronically unemployed and the 25,000 forced to emigrate.  We all know that our standard of living and our prospects generally depend on our ability to produce sufficient competitive exports.  We will not get this initially until we have the country developed, and we will not develop the country by ensuring that everybody gets shorter hours of work and does less for more money.  This applies at every level.  Nobody in this country should be content as long as that number of our people are unemployed and emigrating.  We should have less concentration on those people fortunate enough to be able to earn a reasonable living until we have seen that all our people have at least a frugal living standard.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that.  I did not know it.  The Government are quite right in looking for, if possible, a period of stability, a period during which all our production costs will be known.  That is good for everybody, for the manual worker and the top executive.  It is the only way we can ever hope to be prosperous.  Good employer-labour relations are an essential if we are to find sufficient employment for all our people in this country.  There is no scarcity of employment opportunities if we can simply pay the people to do the work. There is an enormous job to be done on the land in this country.  Vast capital investment is needed in agriculture if we are to hope to reap its full potential.  Arterial drainage and land drainage are proceeding at a snail's pace.  I have referred here previously to the enormous number of people leaving agriculture every year.  We are not providing employment opportunities for them elsewhere in the country.  Practically the only opportunity there is for them is in industrial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been critical of the machinery for the establishment of new industry and the expansion of existing industry. I have spoken on this on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and it cannot be over-emphasised. When we are fortunate enough to get good industries into this country, we forget about them.  Our work should only really start then.  In most industries there are opportunities for expansion.  If they are well looked after, they will bring in additional industries.  We have not sufficient personnel in this Department.  The people I have met in it are excellent, but there are not sufficient of them, and there are too many bodies.  It is all part of the divided responsibility that has had such ill effects in so many Departments. I have criticised it in relation to housing from the point of view of making it impossible for houses to be built within any reasonable time.  It also involves the waste of professional <Col N="1485" /> and skilled people, where we have two sets of people, one checking the other. Yet these are people badly needed in other Departments.  Various remedies have been suggested.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce feels it is much better to soft-pedal in applying these remedies than to attempt any drastic measures.  He may be right in that.  I hope he is.  I hope the situation calls for no more than is asked for at present.</P>
    <P>Apparently, there was doubt in the minds of some Deputies as to whether or not under this Prices Bill the Minister could inquire into existing prices and prices fixed in the recent past.  I was glad to hear him indicate he feels he has sufficient power under the Bill to do that.  Most of our trouble has stemmed from the turnover tax and the advantage that was taken of it.  It brought in its wake a general demand for increases in wages and incomes. That was natural because the cost of living, prices and costs generally had soared.  We have now reached a point where our economy cannot withstand any little adversity at all.  If we had developed our economy, it should have been able, for a short period at least, to stand up to the British surcharge. If the economy were developed and geared as it should be the imposition of the 15 per cent levy, afterwards reduced to ten per cent, should not have put us into the position that we now have to take emergency measures and there is no doubt in anybody's mind that there is a serious crisis.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned as to the effect of this credit squeeze on my constituency. No less than 65 per cent of the total loan and grant houses built by all the lending agencies were built in County Dublin.  We can imagine the effect on employment if this source of house building credit has dried up.  I am greatly afraid that unless immediate measures are taken to enable private house builders to continue their work, there will be wholesale unemployment, particularly in County Dublin, where such a large percentage of the total number of houses was being built.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he has seen the statement of the German Employers Association of 9th July alleging bad conduct on the part of Irish workers in a Dusseldorf firm; whether he will make a statement on <Col N="1488" /> the reported intervention of the Irish Embassy leading to five alleged troublemakers being given their cards; whether his Department accept the charges made by the German Employers Association; and whether they have initiated any independent investigation into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to by the Deputy.  It was published in the news bulletin of the Federal Union of German Employers Associations on 8th July.</P>
      <P>Early in February a German firm in Dusseldorf reported to the Embassy that they were having difficulties with the Irish workers and an officer of the Embassy visited the factory with a view to helping so far as possible to solve the problems.  The main grievance of the workers, apart from difficulties incidental to adaptation to a foreign environment, seems to be that they had expected to have greater opportunities for earning overtime rates, but as the factory operated on a 3-shift base such opportunities were limited.  The workers stated they could earn more in Dublin than their basic pay in Dusseldorf.  The Embassy's representative did not at any time suggest the dismissal of alleged troublemakers.</P>
      <P>However, subsequent to this visit the firm dismissed five of the workers, all of whom applied to be, and were repatriated, two by the Embassy in Brussels and three by the Embassy in Bonn.  Other Irish workers left of their own accord and either found other employment or made their way home without approaching any of our Missions.  Apparently only seven of the original 25 still remain in the factory.</P>
      <P>The statement of the Federal Union of German Employers Associations alleges absenteeism, irregularity in timekeeping, turbulence and lack of discipline on the part of some of the Irish workers.  This if it occurred is of course a responsibility of management and workers and not a matter in which my Department should attempt to adjudicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have mentioned in reply to a previous parliamentary question, the <Col N="1489" /> Government have no power to prevent Irish citizens from accepting employment abroad.  Before they leave Ireland persons going to employment on the Continent are warned that they should be fully conversant with the terms and conditions of employment and that they should advise our diplomatic or consular representatives of their presence in the country and get in touch with them in case of difficulty.  Continental employers who bring out workers from Ireland must expect that the persons they recruit, who have free choice amongst many countries if they wish to take permanent employment abroad, will find linguistic and other difficulties in adapting themselves to very different conditions from those to which they have been accustomed at home. Personnel who are undergoing a limited period of training abroad for eventual employment in Ireland are more likely to adapt themselves to the foreign environment for the period of their stay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this criticism of the Irish workers has based itself on the mentality of the Irish workers involved and on irregularity and has received widespread publicity in the foreign press?

      <P>Provision has been made in the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1963, to enable the Board of An Foras Tionscal, in specified circumstances, to apply in areas like Cashel the scale of grants laid down in the Undeveloped Areas Acts.  In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that adoption of the Deputy's suggestion would serve any useful purpose. It may be taken that every possible assistance will be given by my Department and by An Foras Tionscal towards the development of any sound proposal for the establishment of an industry in Cashel.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is based on an earlier Act which gave the Minister power to include by order a place outside the undeveloped areas in relation to the application of grants.  A later Act makes it possible for An Foras Tionscal to give grants on the scale applicable under the Undeveloped Areas Act to such areas as Cashel and that makes it unnecessary for me to make an order.  An Foras Tionscal can do it now without the Minister making an order.</P>

The licence to be extinguished may be in any part of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a recruit garda who, during his period of probation, was recently discharged from the Force on health grounds.  The position is not, however, as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The member in question was appointed to the Force on 26th July, 1963, and was absent from duty <Col N="1520" /> because of illness from 17th June, 1964, to 8th July, 1965, when he was discharged.  The question of his assuming duty did not arise, as the Garda surgeon advised that he was not fit for duty and would not be fit for duty for another year or so.  In these circumstances, it was not possible to retain him in the Force as he had not satisfactorily completed his period of probation, which is two years.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing these matters are the Garda Síochána Appointments Regulations.  There is also a provision in these regulations which enables the Garda Commissioner, with my consent, to appoint a person who had previous service in the Force, without requiring him to sit again for the entrance examination.  I have already arranged with the Commissioner that, if in a year's time or so the person concerned is acceptable on health grounds and applies to be reappointed in the Force, his application will be sympathetically considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lettings of unfurnished or insufficiently furnished rooms and non-selfcontained flats in houses built before 1941 are subject to the full control of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, both as regards the amount of rent the landlord may charge and the tenant's security of tenure.  Tenants of most of these controlled rooms or flats in Dublin may avail themselves of the special facilities provided under Part III of the Act with the object of enabling them to have the lawful rent provisionally fixed without formality or expense.  As regards furnished lettings these have been free of control since 1923.  Rooms or flats in houses built since 1941 are also free of control, as well as self-contained flats constructed in pre-1941 houses since the passing of the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the level of rents for uncontrolled rooms or flats has increased substantially in recent years, partly owing to the growing demand for this type of accommodation, especially in areas convenient to the city centre, but I have not received any significant volume of complaints in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state with reference to the desire of Dublin Corporation and its tenants to erect master television aerials for corporation flats, what discussions have taken place between his Department and the Dublin Corporation; whether his Department <Col N="1523" /> objects to such aerials; and if so, why; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy regarding communal aerials was discussed with representatives of Dublin Corporation in December, 1961, and there has been no further discussion or correspondence on the matter with the corporation since then.</P>
      <P>Communal aerials, like &ldquo;piped&rdquo; television, involve the relay principle. There is no official objection to the erection of small communal aerials which are intended to serve the residents of a single block of flats or of a single building or of not more than ten adjacent houses.  My Department is also prepared to license large scale communal aerials and &ldquo;piped&rdquo; television services subject to the condition that external television programmes will not be relayed.  The revenue earning capacity of the Irish television service could be seriously affected if relay services distributing external television programmes were freely permitted.  It was, therefore, decided that, at least until such time as the Irish service has firmly established itself and shown its capacity to repay the large investment of state capital in it, this condition should apply to large-scale relay systems.</P>

We do not object to aerials serving the residents of a single block of flats, or of a single building, or of not more than ten adjacent houses, but when very large aerials are erected to serve blocks of flats, one gets to the stage where those aerials are capable of receiving programmes from outside the country and we are not going to <Col N="1524" /> allow these aerials which will go into competition with our own service.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for treating cases of infectious disease, including tuberculosis, and of eradicating sources of infection rests with the chief medical officer of health authorities in whom are vested wide powers under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1964, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>A chief medical officer may, for example, provide</P>
      <P>(1) for the detention and isolation in a specified hospital or other place of a person whose isolation is necessary as a safeguard against the spread of infection and who cannot be effectively isolated in his own home;</P>
      <P>(2) that a person remain away from a specified place or places (which may include his home);</P>
      <P>(3) for the compulsory cleansing and disinfection of persons, buildings and articles.</P>
      <P>Provision is also included in the Health Acts which, under penalty requires</P>
      <P>(1) notice to be given to the district medical officer for purposes of disinfection before a dwelling or part of a dwelling in which a person suffering from an infectious disease has resided during the previous three months, is sold or let;</P>
      <P>(2) disclosure (on request) to a person interested in the sale or letting of a dwelling or part of a dwelling whether a person has resided in the premises during the previous three months whilst suffering from an infectious disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress, I had outlined what I believe to be the cause of most of the difficulties which face us at present.  One thing about which people are being continually exhorted is saving.  I agree with that to some extent but the Government are completely inconsistent in appealing to the people to save.  On the one hand, the people are being asked to save and on the other, all the temptations in the world to spend money are being put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a question about selective credit at present.  Enormous sums were advanced to people to buy public houses and build luxurious lounges in existing public houses, to build <Col N="1534" /> luxurious hotel lounges, palatial State and semi-State offices.  They were anything but essential services and they had the effect on the people we were exhorting to save of inducing them to spend.  We increased the hours of drinking on Sunday and Monday&mdash;all day on Sunday now is drinking time. As I say, we were exhorting people to save and at the same time, putting at their disposal every temptation to spend more.  In the same way, we have asked people to increase output; yet we give them no example from the top.  The lower paid workers in CIE are asked to give greater output when, at the same time, the executives are driving around in luxury motor cars with special drivers.  While that situation exists, how can we expect a response from the people?</P>
    <P>I am glad that discussions are taking place between the Central Bank and the commercial banks in relation to the directions in which credit should be given, but at the present time it looks very much as if we are shutting the stable door when the mare has gone. It looks as if the Central Bank have some influence simply because they happen to be the lender of last resort. This contract between the Central Bank and the commercial banks should all the time have been in existence. It would have meant we would not have this foolish expenditure we have had heretofore.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of development remains to be accomplished in the country and we should be extremely selective in the direction in which we give credit.  I have spoken about State extravagance.  One of the places where it is obvious is in Government entertaining.  When the inter-Party Government were last in office, the expense account for entertaining in the Department of External Affairs was something like £6,000. Today, it is between £23,000 and £24,000.  That is the sort of extravagance a small country like ours should not be expected to bear.  In many European countries, we have costly embassies when we should simply have trade representatives.  It is not of very much use to us to pose as a wealthy country.  There would <Col N="1535" /> be far more respect for us if we exhibited ourselves for what we are &mdash;an ordinary poor country, underdeveloped, trying to make our way in the world.</P>
    <P>The export incentives we have been providing are really the only worthwhile measures being taken which are likely to have some effect.  We know the wonderful effect of the income tax reliefs afforded on exports.  When we tried in the Finance Bill to get some extension of the scope of these reliefs, our suggestions were turned down.  As a result, we have practically lost an export valued at £3,000 a year.  I refer to the export of day-old chicks. If we are anxious to keep our exports up, that was an obvious subject for an extension of export tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday spoke of the attitude of young people to their responsibilities to the country in which they were brought up, educated and provided with certain skills.  He said they had been leaving industry in his part of the country for no reason except that there was not sufficient social life there.  I submit there must be something wrong in our educational system when this is so because we have probably as much patriotism in this country as there is in any country under the sun.</P>
    <P>I was in Yugoslavia two years ago and was amazed to find that education is free, up to and including university standard, though the standard of living is extremely low.  In face of these facts, Yugoslavia does not lose its graduates when they are qualified.  It is difficult to know why, but apparently there is a great sense of patriotism there.  I found there are no restrictions, no efforts made to hold their graduates but they stay to ensure that they will make their contribution to their country.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about attracting Irish people back home to work.  Many people who come back make a sacrifice in doing so and are very badly rewarded.  I have posed cases to the Minister for <Col N="1536" /> Education on the question of correcting the position where children, because they had not the means of getting a knowledge of Irish, were not allowed to sit for the Intermediate Certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about attracting back Irish people who have certain skills and I feel entitled to refer to it.  The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to employment exchanges. They are really unemployment bureaux instead of employment bureaux.  Nobody tries to find out where people are unemployed, what skills they have and where there are vacancies for them.  There is no central organisation in any part of the country to make an effort to let it be known that people with certain skills are available for employment at certain times.  Accordingly, we often have people idle who could be placed.</P>
      <P>Another sector that is deplorably neglected and that has great potential is the fishing industry.  We have done little or nothing to develop it over the years.  It has great export potential. The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> forecast great things for the fishing industry.  It stated that landings would be doubled between 1960 and 1970.  In fact, during the past four years, landings have gone down, indicating there is insufficient interest and insufficient Government investment in the industry.  It has been thrown around from one Parliamentary Secretary to another and from one Minister to another.  An American survey team in their recommendations suggested there was a considerable potential in this industry; yet we have done nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked what we should do after we have achieved our economic growth.  I have indicated that we have an enormous job to do with any wealth we can get for years to come, that we shall never be embarrassed by <Col N="1537" /> too much money or even softened by it.  On this side of the House, we are prepared to co-operate with the Government and anxious to give whatever help we can in the present time of difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prices Bill is the culmination of the political <i>malaise</i> which has set in.  It is a measure in which Fianna Fáil never believed.  It is the result of haphazard planning and irreparable harm has been done to our economy and immeasurable suffering imposed on our people by this type of planning.  It must be admitted that this country has been in a state of unrest for some time, that there has been great uneasiness abroad in the land.  The people are forced to face the stark reality that our economy has been run down very badly, that we are facing a serious recession, that our balance of payments has widened to the extent of £50 million, that the banks have now placed a stranglehold on our people in respect of credit and that all prices are spiralling.</P>
      <P>The sections of the people with which I sympathise most, in this atmosphere of rising costs, are those unfortunate and helpless sections who are dependent on small State pensions and fixed incomes.  It is true to say that these people have been living in one long nightmare of bewilderment about how they could keep body and soul together.  These unfortunate people, by reason of the increase in the cost of the essentials of life&mdash;one can readily understand their position&mdash;have been left in the predicament of trying to exist on 37/6 a week in those times of high prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lot of those people, in particular, is very distressing.  The city and the country have been living in an atmosphere of glittering wealth, opulence and splendour in recent times with banquets, balls and all the wild spending that goes with them.  This image has been projected to the world by Telefís Éireann and Telstar.  We have been shown as a land flowing with milk and honey, a rich man's paradise.  It is right to point out to those in power in this country, lest <Col N="1538" /> they have lost touch with the real people, their suffering and want, that despite the false image which they have tried to create for too long there is much poverty and want in this unhappy land of ours.</P>
    <P>I said this Prices Bill has come too late.  It was the Government's avarice for extra revenue which was primarily responsible for the unhappy situation in which we are today.  Two years ago, in their avarice, they imposed upon this House and this country the turnover tax.  They increased the price of all commodities, especially the essentials of life&mdash;bread, butter, tea, sugar, clothes, shoes, fuel, light, by deliberate policy, despite the pleadings of this House that it was unjust and inequitable.  This was fraught with serious repercussions which, of necessity, involved an increase in prices.  Any fool could foresee what would happen.</P>
    <P>Prior to the turnover tax being imposed, and when it was being discussed in this House, the price of quite a lot of commodities, against which presumably these people were going to compensate themselves for collecting this tax for the Minister for Finance, when it was introduced, jumped very considerably.  After this we had the ninth round of wage increases and prices leaped further still.  They have continued to rise unbridled since then. The facts are that the benefits of the last round of wage increases have been completely dissipated by this spiralling of prices.  The workers are no better off.</P>
    <P>There has been no real increase in wages and the distracted housewives of this country have found that money is no longer of any value.  This is a situation for which the Government are directly responsible.  The Government, unfortunately, held fast to the capitalist idea of <i>laissez faire</i> and no pleadings of ours could get them to invoke the prices measure which was on the statute book all the time.  They maintained that prices would find their own level.  How could prices find their own level when, in fact, competition <Col N="1539" /> in relation to many facets of industry in this country no longer exists?</P>
    <P>The Government have been largely responsible for this situation by reason of certain panic measures which they took in the belief that we would enter free trade conditions in the European Common Market.  They advised all facets of industry and agriculture to merge together, to group themselves and to interlock in anticipation of our entry into this market of some 200 million people.  They have spent quite a sizeable amount of money on adaptation towards that end.  More often than not they have been, during the past two years, whittling away the kind of protection which Irish industry enjoys by reducing tariffs and quotas gradually and exposing the industrialists and the workers of this country, to this unfair kind of competition in anticipation of our entry into a market which is as far off now as it was three years ago.</P>
    <P>This kind of interlocking and merging of groups in industry and agriculture has led to the fixing of prices.  Is it not a fact that the price of bread and flour&mdash;the staff of life of our people&mdash;is determined by monopolies in this country?  Is it not true that the price of drink and cigarettes is fixed by a ring of cartels?  Is it not true that we have evidence of groups coming together in respect of petrol, clothing and even in the provision of services which the people require?  Is it not a fact also that the lawyers, doctors, dentists, engineers, and architects come together and fix their charges for those essential services? It is very largely true that competition would seem to be nonexistent in a large sphere of industrial activity.  This measure, in that kind of situation, should have been introduced long before now.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that this Government have lost control of our economy.  We now have a situation where banks are placing a stranglehold on credit.  We have seen a serious recession take place in the building <Col N="1540" /> industry in the city and country.  I want to ask the Taoiseach now does he regard housing as being of a productive nature.  If he does regard it as productive, will he insist that the moneylenders make available the capital which is required for the furtherance of this essential service for the people?</P>
    <P>I want to pose the question: do the Government control the banks or do the banks control the Government? It would be a tragedy if this country were accelerated into a recession by reason of a shortage of capital.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to have courage, to face up to these moneylenders, and to see to it that they do not precipitate an unnecessary economic crisis.  It now seems that the Taoiseach will be forced to find credit abroad, if that is necessary.  It must be appreciated that a country which is forced to borrow from abroad forfeits a certain amount of its independence. I should hate this country to become a pawn in the hands of any foreign combine or country.  We would lose our sovereignity as a result.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking yesterday on a subject which is very dear to my heart, that is, the implementation of a manpower policy.  We have the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation &mdash;these gloomy reports&mdash;declaring after an impartial investigation carried out by this body in 26 industries employing over 76,000 workers, that in freer trading circumstances, 11,000 workers would become redundant, and that if certain positive steps laid down by this committee were not taken towards re-adapting themselves, reequipping themselves and strengthening themselves for the rigorous competition we are about to face, another 23,000 workers will become redundant.</P>
    <P>Redundancy is rearing its ugly head. I appeal to the Taoiseach, and to the Ministers concerned, to accelerate the implementation of a manpower policy. In a situation in which the protection which Irish industries enjoy is being frittered away, it is self-evident that many of our industries will go to the <Col N="1541" /> wall, and that there will be dislocation. There is already evidence of this in some industries.  Now we know the size of the problem, and we require the implementation of a manpower policy as a matter of grave urgency.</P>
    <P>We believe that the problem of creating new jobs quickly for all those who need them, of providing price stability, and equilibrium in our balance of payments, requires the establishment of a separate Department, a Ministry of Labour whose function and responsibility it will be to plan this manpower policy programme in respect of redundancy compensation, in respect of retraining, education and forecasting for future contingencies.  We do not think the Department of Social Welfare, which we understand is to be charged with this responsibility, is properly equipped or suitable for this purpose.  Indeed, that Department would want to reorient itself in mind and attitude to deal with the problems of the Irish workers.  We feel that in a country where there are so many thousands of men and women standing idle&mdash;while the vast resources and potentialities of our country are still dormant, wasted and unexploited&mdash;we should have a separate Ministry of Labour.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will achieve the things it has set out to achieve, any more than the First Programme which operated from 1958 to 1963.  The First Programme stipulated that there should be the provision of 100,000 jobs, and it is pertinent to point out that after the First Programme had operated from 1958 to 1963, 170,000 persons emigrated from this country.  The Second Programme is, unfortunately, mere indicative forecasting.  We ask the Taoiseach to devise the necessary machinery and make the necessary arrangements to see to it that this Programme will become a reality and is not merely planless planning as was evidenced in the First Programme.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins wants to get in and that the Taoiseach will be speaking at 4 o'clock, and I do not want to stand <Col N="1542" /> in the way of those two important members of the House, but I want to refer to remarks made by Deputy Dillon here yesterday in regard to the part which the Labour Party played in the general election.  Deputy Dillon seems to have taken exception to remarks made by the Leader of the Labour Party in Tullamore prior to the election.  He inferred that that statement was in some way responsible for Fianna Fáil gaining office, and Fine Gael losing votes.</P>
    <P>That statement was merely a reiteration of the policy of our Party which was decided some five or six years ago. No one could have been under any illusion as to where the Labour Party stood on that issue.  If Fine Gael lost votes on that occasion, it is rather childish to attempt to blame the Labour Party, or any other Party for that matter.  Whether Fianna Fáil won votes, or Fine Gael lost votes, the important thing is that the Labour Pary gained seats and votes.  I feel it is only right for me to comment on that matter.  It is a bit audacious for astute politicians to seek to apportion the blame to another Party for their own losses.  I want to make it clear to all and sundry that ours is an independent Party.  We have our own policy for solving the economic evils, and we are seeking power, in the same way as other Parties seek power, through the democratic franchise of our people, to become a sizeable Opposition in a short time and by the grace of God and the wisdom of the Irish people, the Government in the immediate years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Treacy for giving me the <Col N="1544" /> opportunity to say a few words.  What I was going to say in the few moments available to me is that if it is true that the difference between a politician and a statesman is that a statesman thinks of the next generation while a politician thinks of the next election, then, without doubt, the actions and conduct of the Taoiseach in recent years have been more consistent with those of a politician than with those of a statesman.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that most of our present economic difficulties, whether they are correctly described as a crisis or as a danger or threat, have been caused by the Taoiseach's cynical disregard for the economic advice which he must have received when he brought about an apparent 12 per cent increase in wage standards at the beginning of 1964.  There were those at the time who feared that the percentage increase was beyond the level of productivity and that it might not be justified on that account.  The fact was then apparent and is now clear to most people in the country that political considerations prompted the Taoiseach's decision at the time and that he was then more intent on succeeding in the by-elections then imminent in Kildare and Cork.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that that 12 per cent increase was rushed through for the purpose of ensuring success in those elections.  I said it was an apparent increase because the fact has been, and it was pointed out at the time, that the result of the wage increase was that the working people would pay for it with their own money.  It is and has been a disturbing feature over the past 12 months that unfortunate workers who were led to believe that the increase was in real terms found that their pay packets, nominally up by 12 per cent, were being eaten away by rising prices.  By February of this year, just before the general election, price-levels had risen by 11.4 per cent, surely a drastic increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time our balance of payments deficit was running at over £30 million.  By that time there was already apparent a shortage of credit, conceded in certain circles only.  By <Col N="1545" /> that time there was also a by-election in mid-Cork which the Taoiseach and his Party could not win.  In those circumstances the political decision was taken again.  That was to make the issue of that by-election a pretext for a general election before the economic difficulties became apparent to everyone. So we had the election and the slogans and I only wish the papers were there now so that we might see them.  But the tattered posters are still there with their bedraggled messages: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stay With Prosperity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vote for Continued Good Times&rdquo;.  These slogans were put forward by a Party whose Leader must have been aware that the balance of payments deficit was then running higher than £50 million, that a capital shortage was apparent, that there was a downfall in industrial and agricultural output, that unemployment was running at a level of 50,000 and that emigration had increased by 40,000.</P>
    <P>Now it is over.  The election was won by Fianna Fáil.  I have here a quotation from a speech made by the Taoiseach in Castlebar.  The <i>Irish Press</i> heading was: &ldquo;Fine Gael Bank Policy will Start Capital Flight&rdquo;.  He went on to say that the country had already had experience of this when a contraction of bank credit took place and the banks were calling in loans, as a result of which many firms were put out of business and some were put into bankruptcy.  He pledged himself that he would never allow such a thing to happen and he did this at a time when he knew that a contraction of credit was coming and when he hoped to conceal it.</P>
    <P>We are faced here with what the Taoiseach is prepared to describe as a difficulty, not yet a crisis, although his Deputies call it a crisis when they are looking for sympathy and co-operation. Let us remind the Taoiseach that this has happened before.  There was precious little sympathy before when an Irish Government, beset on all sides, were trying to face up to their responsibilities. We are now prepared to act in a responsible manner.  We have always done this but we will not, <Col N="1546" /> now or at any other time, double-talk or double-deal with the people.  We are available to the people of this country as a constructive and alternative Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the debate as a whole, the remarkable thing about it is that there has been no serious criticism offered of the proposal which the Government have put forward for dealing with the present economic situation and, indeed, there was not a great deal of comment on the proposal either.  Most of the speeches delivered in the debate were irrelevant to the situation with which I dealt in my opening statement.</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputies opposite who spoke in the debate said that the situation is not as serious as I had represented it to be.  Others contended that it is even more serious than the Government realise.  So far as I am concerned, I presented to the Dáil all the relevant facts of our economic situation and I left it to Deputies to form their own judgment on those facts.  The Government's interpretation of these facts suggested the need for some corrective action at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out in his speech yesterday, the corrective measures upon which the Government have decided at this time are fairly mild, and I myself in the course of my remarks referred to the possibility that they may prove to be inadequate.  Our main purpose at this time is to put the country on notice that present economic trends point to the possibility of serious difficulties, not that they are immediately with us but that they may be just ahead.  We are, as it were, sounding a cautionary note and urging that all interests should combine to <Col N="1547" /> prevent the situation from deteriorating. This may prove to be enough to get the situation put right again.  I hope it is.</P>
    <P>Both Opposition Parties, of course, attributed the difficulties of this time to the Government, either to the things we did or did not do, and suggested that, in fact, the difficulties could have been avoided altogether if they had been foreseen in time.  This, of course, is the stock-in-trade of a political debate and, as far as I am concerned, I could have forecast with some accuracy the nature of the comments that would be made.</P>

      <P>I have not said anything of the sort.  Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to explain my ideas; we all hope he will understand.  The Government are not greatly concerned with these criticisms.  Our purpose is to get the situation put to right as quickly and as completely as possible so that the national progress will go on as before.  Nor do I think it is correct to say that the situation developed suddenly or without warning to Deputies who have been keeping in touch with the trend of events.  I can say with confidence that I have not at any time in this House or outside it during the past years, since the idea of a national development programme such as we published was born, done other than emphasise the magnitude of the effort that would be required by the country, the difficulty of the targets we had set ourselves and the certainty that before we had realised these targets, we would encounter difficulties and problems that we would have to overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> During the course of this year in every speech I made on our economic situation, early in the year, in some speeches during the course of the election campaign, and in practically every speech dealing with this topic since the election, I have tried to draw public attention to the danger signals which were showing, and to express warnings that the position could not be allowed to get worse.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one of the consequences of my having spoken in this vein was the allegation made yesterday by Deputy Dillon, and repeated today by Deputy Ryan, that we were not even trying to win the election.  I am sure Deputy T. F. O'Higgins will agree with me that that is all nonsense, in view of the comments he has made.  If there are Deputies opposite who seriously seem to believe that we were not trying to win the election and if in such circumstances they could not come within an ass's roar of winning themselves, they should chuck in altogether.</P>

      <P>It is always a matter of some difficulty to decide the stage at which a Government, having regard to the development of a combination of adverse economic circumstances, should take remedial action. So far as we are concerned, we came to that conclusion, when the trend which had been set up early in the year and had, in fact, become noticeable towards the end of last year, was clearly continuing.  We were fully persuaded when the most recent trade figures appeared and when we saw signs that precisely similar problems were beginning to develop in other countries in Europe and elsewhere.  I do not think the Dáil would have accepted earlier than this that there was a need for action in the light of the facts as they knew them.  For my part, I am confident that we have not moved to check these adverse developments too soon or too late.  I think the time is about right.</P>

      <P>It is true that by reason of these measures the adverse trade balance of the day was very quickly wiped out but they generated a depression situation in the country which put many thousands of workers out of their employment and plunged the country into a recession from which it took two years or more to recover. The policy of the Government in the situation now existing, the situation which may be developing, is to do the minimum we think will suffice, and in this way to avoid repetition of the mistakes which we think the Coalition Government made in the circumstances of ten years or so ago. The measures on which we have decided, of course, can, and will, be increased, if necessary, but the aim will always be to do no more than the situation calls for and to rely to the greatest possible extent on public co-operation and understanding of the national needs rather than on restrictions imposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Sweetman was arguing in favour of dealing with this <Col N="1550" /> situation in the same way as the Coalition Government had dealt with the situation in 1956, by the imposition of import levies and pulling down the level of imports by restrictions of that kind.  In my opening statement, I made it clear that we had given very full consideration to the need for imposing controls over imports of that character and we came to the conclusion that the situation did not call for these restrictions.  If we should be driven by a serious worsening of the situation to action of that nature, then we recognise that the consequences would take much longer to repair.</P>
    <P>The levies imposed by the Coalition Government in 1956, whether or not they intended them to be protective, did prove to be so.  They operated to cause an inflation of costs and of prices in the trades and industries to which they related. When the time came to get rid of them, when we came into office in 1957 with the declared intention of getting rid of them, we found that this proved to be much more difficult than we had assumed.  On the one hand, the Minister for Finance, in a difficult Budget situation, was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not anxious to lose the revenue the levies were bringing in.  On the other hand, there were many firms that had availed of the levies to let their costs increase or that had benefited in some way from them and there was pressure to urge their continuance.  In the event, while most of them were got rid of by repealing orders of the Government, some were never got rid of at all and were ultimately incorporated in the permanent tariffs of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made clear, however, that, in the situation which we see developing in the world, a decision to deal with temporary difficulties of this type by increasing the protective measures in operation here would be highly detrimental to the future of the country and would offer <Col N="1551" /> no sort of permanent solution to these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked for an elaboration of the decision of the Government regarding these higher market development grants.  Looking over the script of my speech, I realise that what I said could have been misleading to some extent.  While the amount of market development grant paid to any industrial producer will be related to the actual cost to him of meeting the British import charge, the awarding of the higher grants will be determined by the expansion of his exports to any market, whether Great Britain or not.  It is, of course, clear that these market development grants are also a temporary arrangement. The permanent grants will continue so long as the British import charge remains and these additional grants are being undertaken only for the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>I think it necessary to re-state, for the information of Deputies, the conditions which have caused these economic problems to arise at this time. There is, first of all, the falling-off in the rate of expansion of industrial exports, due primarily to the impact of the British charge and in some cases to the fact that rising costs here have priced some of our industrial products out of export markets.  There is also the temporary falling-off of our cattle exports by reason of the re-stocking operations which are going on at this time.  Then there is the diminution of the capital inflow which has been an important feature in our economic affairs in recent years and which is due to the general international situation and to the restrictions imposed by some foreign Governments on the export of capital from their countries. Then there has been this unexpected rise in the imports of consumer goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any one of these factors, arising at this time, would have been a cause of concern but all coming together at the same time must give rise to some very real difficulties.  If, at the same time as all these temporary factors are producing these economic problems for us, there should be another wage <Col N="1552" /> inflation, then this could cause a very grave threat to the level of employment here.  I emphasise that all these difficulties are temporary.  They will all disappear but, until they do, we must conserve our resources and avoid any courses which could make this situation worse so as to generate a really serious economic recession&mdash;and that is what the Government are determined to prevent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave argued yesterday that these problems stem in some way from the turnover tax.  With all due respect to Deputy Cosgrave, the turnover tax had as much to do with them as the Zulu War or the Night of the Big Wind.  The turnover tax came into operation in the autumn of 1963.  The adjustment of retail prices which was involved had been completed before the end of that year.  The ninth round wage agreement came into operation at the beginning of 1964.  1964 was, however, the best year ever in the history of this State in terms of higher production, higher exports and higher employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This alone disposes of the argument that the turnover tax, or any consequences following from the turnover tax, has any relevance of any sort to our present situation.  If the rise in prices due to the turnover tax were the measure of our price problem, this would be of no great consequence at all.  Indeed, in the circumstances which we now have, in which the consumption expenditure of our people is rising faster than national production, the classical economic remedy would be to increase taxation. We have decided not to adopt this policy but to endeavour to follow courses which we hope will make any further price-raising changes in our taxation unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of nonsense has been spoken here, as I think most Labour Party Deputies realise, about this ninth round wage agreement, the wage agreement that came into operation at the beginning of last year. At the time that agreement was negotiated, a rise in wages was justified by improving national circumstances. <Col N="1553" /> It would, in any event, have taken place whether or not there had been a national agreement.  Some Deputies are trying to suggest that there would have been no inflation in costs, due to higher wages, if that agreement had not been made.  At that time, there would have been either a disorganised type of round of wage increases, such as had taken place in previous years, or else a better organised arrangement such as the National Wage Agreement provided for.</P>
    <P>When the Government realised that this would happen, that we were in for another round of the old haphazard kind, we suggested to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to the Federated Union of Employers that they should get together to see if it was possible to get a national agreement.  We were anxious to have such an agreement to protect the workers against loss of earnings due to strikes, and to protect the country against loss of production during strikes.  We were anxious that they would negotiate what we would regard as a better system of dealing with these matters because we realised the great advantage it would be in our campaign for economic development if we could hold out the assurance of a period of industrial peace for whatever term a national wage agreement was negotiated.  When those who met to negotiate failed to reach agreement, when the negotiations broke down, I met the parties and urged them to resume the negotiations.  Ultimately, they met again and succeeded in producing an agreement.  The Government did not intervene at all in the actual negotiation of the agreement or in the wording of the document.</P>

      <P>The help the Government gave to the parties to reach an agreement was an assurance that whatever they did agree to would be applied throughout the Public Service and throughout all the State-sponsored bodies in respect of the workers employed by them.  As I understand the arguments put forward <Col N="1554" /> here by Deputy Cosgrave and other Fine Gael speakers, it is that that agreement should not have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not what they are trying to suggest, there is no sense in their remarks at all.  I want to repeat that, by and large, the national agreement has held.  It is true that it is threatened by the action of a few unions in what appear to be contraventions of the agreement.  But, by and large, the great majority of the workers of this country and their unions are adhering to the terms of that agreement.  In a recent speech I posed certain questions in that regard. I asked whether this method of adjusting wages by periodical national agreements of that kind is worth preserving and do the parties that negotiated the agreement in 1964 want to preserve this method.  So far, I must say I have got from all the parties concerned affirmative answers to these questions. But all those who believe in this method, who want to preserve this method and see it developing in the future, and yielding for the country and the workers the benefits it can give in the future, will need now to assert themselves to preserve it.  If this is to be done, it is going to require some expertise in leadership and some clear policy statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the Government in regard to wages and salaries and the general level of earning and remuneration throughout the community is that these should increase continuously at the maximum rate feasible without danger to employment, without danger to the competitiveness of our exports and with due regard all the time to their effect on prices.  I believe that the principle the Government have been enunciating over recent years has been generally accepted throughout the community, and by &ldquo;generally accepted&rdquo;, I mean by the employers' organisations established here.  The old order in which improvements in wages and working conditions were obtained by workers only by industrial action through their trade unions is <Col N="1555" /> rapidly disappearing.  This is the understanding of the situation existing here which it is important we should promote amongst our workers. Workers have, so far as it is possible for the Government to give it, an assurance that it is general national policy to ensure that wages will increase by periodic adjustments as national circumstances improve.</P>
    <P>When the National Wage Agreement was being negotiated, I said to the parties in the private discussions I had with them, and I said here in the Dáil, when the negotiations were in progress, that according to all the expert advice available to us an increase of about eight per cent or nine per cent in the general wage level was all that was possible in real terms, and that if the money incomes of workers were increased by a percentage more than that prices would rise to the extent of the excess.  This is not something we decided should happen.  This is an inexorable economic law, which prescribes we cannot better ourselves in real terms by more than we are actually producing.  I have said that if the National Wage Agreement had provided for an increase of that size the rise in prices resulting from the agreement might have been averted.  I do not mean to suggest that there would have been no rise at all in any price. There are some commodities in respect of which any increase in costs must be immediately reflected in prices, but, over all, the price level would not have been affected to the same degree.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about what are called the status increases given to persons employed by the Government and to persons in the public service and in some of the State-sponsored organisations.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said the percentage increase of eight or nine per cent would have been reflected in a similar increase in prices.  The Taoiseach described the extra increase as a bonus of four per cent but prices went up by 11 per cent.</P>

      <P>There were other factors.  The increase in the price of <Col N="1556" /> imported materials was bound to have some effect on the level of industrial production.  There was last year an increase in the price of potatoes and meat which had quite an exceptional and, in my view, very disproportionate effect on our consumer price index number.  Deputies talk about this index as a cost of living index.  It is nothing of the kind&mdash;it is a general price index.  In the index now prepared and published, there are a great many prices taken into account which do not enter into the cost of living as ordinarily understood.  We are, I think the House knows, contemplating another consumption survey next year upon which a new price index will be based and published some time in 1967.</P>

      <P>Most Deputies who understand these matters will realise that since the last consumption survey, the survey upon which the present index is based, there have been considerable changes in the pattern of consumption and in the pattern of trade. For example, in the preparation of the present index no account at all is taken of prices in supermarkets.  There is also complete exclusion of the prices charged for packaged foodstuffs, which have become increasingly popular in recent years.  This consumption survey we are proposing to organise next year will, I am satisfied, show that there has been quite a considerable change in the pattern of consumption during the 12 years since the previous survey. However, that is irrelevant in some degree to what I have been saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with the question of status increases for civil servants.  I am well aware of the misunderstandings about these increases prevalent in the country and I am also well aware of the misrepresentations about them which are being circulated.  They have certainly helped in some way to invoke a situation of dissatisfaction which I think would be dissipated altogether if there were a full understanding of what has happened.  The Minister for Finance in April last issued to the <Col N="1557" /> press an explanatory statement in this regard.  I urge Deputies to refer to it if they want to make themselves familiar with the position in this regard, because, of course, it is very much longer than anything I could attempt here today.</P>
    <P>What was involved here was very largely a process of completing the eighth round and, in some cases, seventh round wage adjustments in the State services.  This was partly due to procedural delay&mdash;the slow method by which the machinery of conciliation and arbitration applied to the public service operates&mdash;and partly to the application of the principle that the pay of public servants should be related to the rates established in private employment.  The completion of these wage and salary adjustments in the public service had necessarily to follow on the completion of similar adjustments in private employment.  Furthermore, the adjustments in the scales of many of the substantial groups employed in the public service necessarily involved adjustments in the scales of supervisory grades.</P>
    <P>This process is now nearing completion. As the Minister for Finance said in the statement to which I referred, it will be well worth while if it yields finality.  The Government accepted the arbitration awards where the issue went to arbitration whether or not we were very happy about these awards.  Deputy Cosgrave put a finger on a weakness in the system in referring to the multiplicity of those schemes and of arbitration boards.  It would be very useful if we could get a unified system.  This is something now being discussed with staff organisations, but I would not like to attempt to forecast what will emerge from these discussions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and some other Deputies were referring to what they called a national incomes policy.  I wish Deputies who use this vague phrase would attempt to tell us what they understand by it and attempt to define it in more precise terms.  I believe this is a phrase used by lazy people to conceal the absence of thought and understanding of this situation.  At best, it represents a process of wishful <Col N="1558" /> thinking, the hope that some magic formula will emerge out of the air which will solve all these problems and introduce the golden era in which after their day's work employers and workers will be dancing around maypoles together.  So far as I know, no satisfactory incomes policy of the kind Deputies appear to be thinking of has emerged in any free democracy.</P>

      <P>That is true, and also the effect on prices of any increase which may be proposed.

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and, I think, some other members of the Fine Gael Party, referred to the policy for the control of banking which they announced during the election.  It was obvious during the election that most of the Fine Gael spokesmen did not understand it themselves.  I certainly did not even pretend to understand it.

      <P>Deputy Corish asked me what has been the response of Irish industry to the help given to it to meet the effect of the British import charge through these market development grants.  By and large, there has been a fairly good response; in some cases, perhaps, no response. There was a situation which induced some firms to withdraw altogether from export business for the time. Most firms certainly set out to try to hold the level of their export trade as it was previously, even though it was now less profitable.  Some firms, the most enterprising in the country, have been increasing their exports during this period and notwithstanding these difficulties.</P>

      <P>May I say that the Government's interest in industrial expansion, in maintaining and increasing the level of our industrial output, is primarily the employment it creates and the guiding principles in the application of aids of this kind are always related to the effect on employment? May I say that Deputy Corish's assumption&mdash;at least, it seemed to me to be his assumption&mdash;that all price rises which have taken place here were either avoidable or attributable to the avarice of manufacturers or traders or to some malice on somebody's part, is far too naïve even to be taken seriously by himself.  I know the Labour Deputies who spoke in the debate alleged that the Government were trying to put all the blame for price rises on the trade unions.  Deputy Sweetman says we are trying to put all the blame on the commercial community. I said in my opening statement that I was not seeking and was not concerned to allocate blame anywhere, that I was confining myself to stating the facts and having looked at the implications of these facts for the future of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make known what the Government had decided <Col N="1561" /> should be done to head off the dangers that seemed to us to threaten. If there should be a failure on the part of any section to take note of these dangers or to show any tendency to act in a manner which would be calculated to aggravate them, then it would be our duty to say so and I hope we would not hesitate to do so. In such event, there would almost certainly be such a worsening of the situation that some plain speaking would be expected, apart from whatever remedial action would be proposed.</P>
      <P>I have said that the main concern of the Government in this situation is to protect the level of employment and to assist, if we can, the process of a continuing increase in the amount of employment available.  Workers will be the main sufferers, if not the only sufferers, in a trade recession by reason of the disemployment of many of them, the loss of overtime earnings or short-time working for others and insecurity for all.</P>
      <P>So far as the balance of payments deficit is concerned, that could be rectified very easily and very quickly by mass unemployment, as was done in 1956, but our determination is to find ways and means out of the situation which will not have these effects, to do so by a process of stimulating exports and by seeking public co-operation in avoiding unnecessary imports at this time.</P>
      <P>If industrial exports are to be stimulated, and stimulated in the degree we require, then some essential conditions must be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first of these is that there must be a vigorous effort by all industrial producers to increase export trade, even if for the time being it is less profitable than it was previously or may become in some future time.  Secondly, they must be encouraged and helped by assurances against rises in production costs which could involve them in serious losses if they set about expanding their export business; and, thirdly, in so far as it <Col N="1562" /> involves investment by them in new productive capacity, then this must be facilitated by the Government and by the financial institutions of the State, and encouraged by a trade union desire to create a climate of confidence in which it will be undertaken.</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Larkin referred to the general desire that exists throughout all sections of the community that in the future adjustment of wages the maximum benefit should go to the lowest paid workers.  This is a desire that we all have and it is certainly an aim that few would openly contest.  However, let us be quite clear about it, it is not accepted in the trade union movement, nor is it capable of fulfilment in the absence of some central trade union authority with executive powers.  I am sure Deputy Larkin understands the position very well.  He is associated with a union that caters mainly for those unskilled and lower-paid workers.  Other Deputies, Deputies in the Fine Gael Benches, may be less familiar with this problem.</P>
      <P>I could perhaps give an instance which will help to bring the character of the problem home to Deputies when I mention that it was stated, I understand, at the Labour Court yesterday in support of the case made by the Dublin printing craftsmen now on strike, that what they were seeking was an adjustment of their wages which percentagewise would be similar to that which the Government had given earlier to postal workers.  One will see immediately that that cuts across any such aim of using the higher resources available in the country to bring up the lower-paid workers by a proportionately higher rate than more highly paid craft workers.  This policy, which, as I said, we all would support in principle, of securing the major advantage for lower paid workers when rising national resources make an all-round increase possible, requires some regulatory authority within or without the trade union movement, because it must mean that the higher paid workers will accept a lower percentage increase than is given to those at the bottom of the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> There may be, and there is in my mind, some doubt about the desirability as a permanent arrangement of continuing national wage agreements of the kind negotiated last year.  These national wage agreements providing for a percentage increase in wages and salaries must necessarily involve some stratification of the existing wage relationships, some disregard of the productivity achievements and the actual level of prosperity in individual industries and occupations.  If wage rates were to be related to productivity, related to the prosperity of particular occupations, to the growth of a particular industry, then changes in the relationship between wages in one occupation and in another would be fairly frequent.  Some would rise and some would not, but it does not seem to be practical politics at this time. Regular and peaceful methods of general wage adjustments, whenever they are feasible, appear to require at this time either a percentage increase or a flat-rate increase.  However, it might be possible for the leaders of our trade union movement and of our employers' organisations to get together to work out a different and better method.  This, of course, would be possible only if there were a period of industrial peace and a genuine effort to try to reach agreement on these matters.</P>
    <P>In this regard I want to refer briefly to the speech made here yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the development of a manpower policy.  The Government are now coming to the point of defining our policy in this regard and to the preparation, where necessary, of legislation to commence bringing it into operation.  In this very important question, which is certain to have a profound influence upon the future of the country's economic progress as well as on our industrial relations, we would be greatly assisted by the holding of joint consultations with the representatives of workers' and employers' interests.  The basic aim must be to give all wage-earners, as far as possible, a security of livelihood that <Col N="1564" /> will extend beyond job changes brought about by reason of technological or economic development, and to ensure that national development will be facilitated by the availability of skilled and trained workers at the right time and in the right place.  This policy, however, will never get off the ground at all except in conditions of economic expansion, and this is another reason why, in the interests of workers as a class, there should be concern now to ensure that economic progress will continue and that nothing will be done to bring it to a stop even for a short time.</P>
    <P>Some questions were asked here regarding the Prices Bill to which I think I should refer at this stage.  May I refer to the comment of Deputy Treacy that this is a Bill that should have been introduced long ago?  I would not agree with him.  Indeed, the Government have grave doubts about bringing it in at all, mainly because we think it may generate among the public false ideas as to the possibilities of price control.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce emphasised yesterday, no system of control, no matter how ruthlessly enforced, can prevent prices from rising when costs are going up, that any attempt to maintain a standstill in prices in any industry or in any occupation when costs were rising would involve only a cessation of work in that industry and the disemployment of the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>As I say, however, in all the cases where prices have risen or where increased prices are proposed, the inquiries envisaged by the Minister for Industry and Commerce can be extended to include not only the actual justification offered for a price increase but the measures of reorganisation of methods of production or distribution which would enable prices to be reduced.  This would apply particularly in the case of some foodstuffs where, as Deputies know, it is often suggested that the chain of distribution is too long or involves costly and wasteful processes.  Whether price inquiries should be held in public or in private is not a matter upon which  we should take a rigid stand. <Col N="1565" /> It is one that should be settled in regard to the circumstances in each case, and flexibility should be the rule.</P>
    <P>Inquiries will be conducted either by prices advisory committees or by advisory bodies.  The distinction between them is that advisory bodies can go beyond the examination of the justification for some proposed increase in price to include reorganisation of methods that might make possible a reduction in price.  Or they can be, of course, and will be if there is need for it, carried out by the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I presume it is not necessary to answer Deputy Corish's query, that the Bill applies only to the prices of commodities and services and does not extend to wages or salaries.</P>

      <P>I want to say that, in the coming session, the Minister for Finance will submit legislative proposals to the Dáil for altering the present procedure for dealing with financial business in a manner which will, we believe, facilitate its discussion by the Dáil and, at the same time, secure an economy of Dáil time and permit of the debates on the Departmental Estimates being considered over the whole year in order to remove the pressure involved in the present system of getting them all concluded before the end of July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This end of session review of the national economic situation, which I have given to the Dáil, may be regarded as less cheerful on this occasion than it has been in recent years.  It would be unrealistic, as I have tried to make clear on many occasions, to expect that national progress could always go on at an even pace, without difficulty and without interruption.  The regulation of the country's economic affairs is the main business of the Government at this time, and that is what we are now doing, although in <Col N="1567" /> circumstances different from those we would have wished or, indeed, expected.</P>
    <P>Running the government of this, or any other country, would be a very simple matter if things always went right.  The test of the basic soundness of our development plan and of the capacity of our national economy to overcome periods of temporary difficulty is now with us.  It is also a test of the maturity of our community, a test which we will pass successfully if we can bring about the general co-operation we need and the adaptation of individual and sectional conduct for which the situation calls.  At this point of time, I do not think we need entertain any doubts whatever about the outcome of this effort of ours to get over this period of difficulty and to get the national economic advance going ahead again at the rate we envisage in the Second Programme.</P>

      <P>The Government have not yet attempted to float a Government loan abroad.  Certain of the State-sponsored bodies have financed some of their development by external loans.  Particulars of these were given to the House by the Minister for Finance.  My purpose in referring to this possibility was rather to discount it as a way out of our difficulty <Col N="1569" /> rather than to indicate an intention on our part to resort to it. Countries like Denmark and Norway, recently floated loans in the New York market, and we have noted the cost and conditions of those loans and the amounts raised, amounts that would not be significant in relation to our circumstances.  I do not altogether rule out the possibility but I referred to it mainly for the purpose of removing any impression that there was likely to be any early relief for our balance of payments problem from that source.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down four questions last week, two to the Minister for Transport and Power and two to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and apparently all four were switched to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When they were asked in the Dáil, the Minister for Transport and Power said he did not know what I was talking about, that he did not know what reports I had in mind.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was concluding the debate on his Estimate, I asked whether he had any statement to make on the anthracite industry and he said he was awaiting reports and that when these came in, he would make a statement. Apparently the Minister for Transport and Power feels that the whole trouble in the anthracite industry at present, and for quite a while, has been marketing, and when there is a stock built up, he does, and has been doing, his best to relieve the position and has made arrangements for the relief of the present position.  I want him to go a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relief of a stock crisis is the relief of a temporary position.  We had a crisis this time 12 months in the <Col N="1571" /> Castlecomer mines which was also relieved by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the people in Castlecomer, the workers employed there and their dependants are anxious to have the industry put on a proper basis.  Apparently, the Minister for Transport and Power thinks that by relieving the marketing position, the industry is put on an even keel again, but that is just like stopping a hole in the ship when it appears and not bothering about it until another hole appears.  The people feel they will not have the workers there without some firm foundation for their employment which will continue for generations to come as it has done in the past.  It is more than a question of marketing.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister if there were any prospects of, or if he had asked if the ESB had plans for, an electricity generating station to be set up on the Leinster coalfield.  When I pressed him by supplementary questions, he said he would look into the matter or ask the ESB to do so.  Then he said that an electricity station would take five years and why trouble about anything in five years' time, that it was the immediate position we were dealing with.  The immediate position has been rectified and it is most necessary to trouble about what will happen in five years' time.  The people have been working there for many generations and I hope will continue to work there for many more.  The Minister then promised in a very half-hearted way that he would look into the possibility of planning an electricity generating station.  It is most important that the mines there should be developed for emergency purposes.</P>
    <P>There are three mines closed down and they have been closed down for 12 months.  I was at a meeting in Doonane attended by all the local Deputies and Deputies from Laois-Offaly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a demonstration. It was organised by the local parish priest.  It was, if you like, a demonstration of people.  There are three mines already closed there and we want to bring that home to the Government.  That was the purpose of the meeting.</P>
      <P>I also asked the Minister for Transport and Power if there was a possibility of using anthracite duff as a basis for smokeless fuel and again I got a half-hearted reply saying that investigations were being made but that the Minister did not think there was much hope in that direction either. It appears there is not much hope anywhere for an industry like this.  I understand the smokeless fuel firms in Britain are doing quite well and I do not see, if that is the case there, that our workers are not just as good.  I think that should be considered.  I got a poor answer from the Minister to the effect that they might look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of the Leinster coalfield was made at a cost of £84,000 and the resources of anthracite there have been proved.  Is there any reason why we should not try to develop these resources to the fullest extent and provide good employment in the area? For the past three days, we have had a long discussion on the Taoiseach's Estimate and other matters and he said we were importing too many consumer goods.  Here we have consumer goods ready for use in the form of anthracite, but we are importing anthracite.  Apart from that, we should plan for more use of anthracite in generating stations and in other ways. After the expensive survey and when <Col N="1573" /> we have proved resources available, it would be a pity not to go ahead.  It creates difficulty when responsibility for a particular matter is divided between two Ministries, as happened the other day when the Minister for Transport and Power was answering the questions.  You may fall between two stools as a result of this division. The people are suffering from the effects of this.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what reports the Minister has got on the Castlecomer mines, which can employ between 400 and 500 people.  This is probably the most thickly populated part of Kilkenny and the surrounding counties and the people are anxious to get continuous and permanent employment. We have £1 million invested in the Potez factory which, practically speaking, has not been opened yet.  We have another £400,000 invested in GEC in Dundalk which is closed.  I have no objection to investments because if you do not gamble in these matters, you will have no industries, but the point I want to make is that if the Government are prepared to invest in foreign firms such as these, why not put some capital into our own resources and develop these first and bring in the foreign firms afterwards? We are now going into recess for three or four months and I appeal to the Minister to take some very definite steps during that time to develop these mines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Crotty in urging on the Minister the necessity for action in this matter and I should like to congratulate Deputy Crotty on raising this question.  It is true that a number of the Deputies from Carlow-Kilkenny and Laois-Offaly were invited with the parish priest of Doonane and the parish priest of Castlecomer to meet in Doonane and discuss the problem on the spot.  There was a very fine response from Deputies from the two constituencies.  Deputy Crotty has spoken in relation to the possible effect on Castlecomer and the threat to the coalmines in that area.  I am concerned as a Deputy from Laois-Offaly with the fact that three coalmines have <Col N="1574" /> now closed down and this has had an effect on the livelihood of up to 1,000 people.  It is a densely populated part of my constituency and of the county of Laois and needless to say, the effect has been very bad on many people and they are looking for some glimmer of hope.</P>
      <P>I have never understood why there has not been an adequate planned development of low grade coal deposits in this country.  I am told, and the Minister can say whether this is accurate or not, that part of the problem facing our coalfields and coalmines at the moment is a marketing problem and due in no small measure to the continued preference for, and therefore the continued importation of Welsh anthracite.  I should like to know why we do not stop these imports.  It is a simple and obvious suggestion, and of course when one makes an obvious suggestion, it always appears that there are many reasons why it could not be done.  One reason no doubt the Minister would say is the existing trade agreement with Britain.  However, there is a saver in that agreement in relation to our own resources, if the result of continued imports is likely to cause unemployment. That is what is happening.  The British were not very choosey about what they did in relation to their recent import levies on all the goods we export to them, when they decided to take action in the interests of their economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a small thing, a humble thing, but there are up to 1,000 people in my constituency, poor people living a marginal existence whose only known way of livelihood is gone, or is going, or is threatened.  They can only hope to leave the country and seek employment abroad if the threat develops and affects the Leinster coalmines.  Then it will be a very serious matter.  The coal is there, the deposits are there, and we know that the market exists in this country.  We had all this talk about buying Irish in the debate we have just concluded and there was what was meant to be a bugle call rally by the Taoiseach&mdash;let us get up and buy Irish.  Here is one Irish industry with the deposits, here is the coal, here is <Col N="1575" /> the market and here are the hands willing to work it, and surely in these circumstances it is the height of folly if the Minister cannot give some indication that this challenge is going to be met and something worthwhile done for the poor people there who have no other hope.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give us some indication that he is going to take action in this matter.  Deputy Crotty was quite right in underlining what appears to us, and to the people in the locality, to be a weakness in the present situation, that they do not know whom to turn to.  They are sent from Billy to Jack and do not know whether they are to go to the Minister for Transport and Power or to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The plain fact is that between these two Ministries this industry is falling into neglect.  Three mines have been closed and others are threatened, and there does not appear to be any hope in the locality.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is perhaps aware that in desperation the local people sought emergency relief, some form of a grant to provide employment. There were high hopes at the meeting in Doonane that the Parliamentary Secretary might have been there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="1576" /> support the two previous speakers. During the past few days we have heard the call to support Irish industry and to buy Irish and this is one way in which the Government can prove their sincerity, by doing something about the Leinster coalfields.  I was at the meeting in Doonane and I was grieved at the number of workers who were at that meeting, workers who have spent their lives in the coalmining industry.  Three mines have been closed and the mine in Castlecomer has been closed at intervals during the past 12 months and while it is working at the moment, what the possibilities are for the future I do not know.  One can imagine the plight of these people who are now unemployed and left, with their families, with practically no income.  If something is not done quickly by whatever Department is responsible, all that is left to them is the emigrant ship.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to do something urgently and if the report is not ready, not to wait until next October when the Dáil will be re-assembling after the Recess.  I would appeal to him to do something in the interests of this industry, and of these workers, and to look at the problem in the same light as Deputies from Carlow-Kilkenny and Laois-Offaly look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should assure Deputies, first of all, that there is not any diffusion of responsibility interfering with Government activity on behalf of the coalmines.  The two Ministers and the two Ministries have been in constant consultation since the very beginning of these problems and the officers of both Departments have been co-operating together in seeking ways to find outlets, markets and solutions for the other problems arising, so there is no question of a division of responsibilities reducing the activities of Government Departments. At the end of the debate on my Estimate, Deputy Crotty asked me this question and I explained that the general problem for anthracite producers was mainly a marketing one, that they were producing what they <Col N="1577" /> could not sell.  I said that one mine, even if the marketing problems were solved, had different problems on which I was awaiting a report.</P>
      <P>In order not to continue the idea of departmental division of responsibility, I should like to say in relation to the same problem of marketing that, in consultation, both Departments have been seeking solutions. The answer given by the Minister for Transport and Power represents the answer the Deputy would have got from me had I taken the question&mdash;that the Minister for Transport and Power has obtained the services of a firm of consultants to examine the whole question of marketing and sales of Irish anthracite. The Minister reminded the Deputy that the problem was that anthracite was being replaced as a fuel by other types of fuel.</P>
      <P>From earlier replies, the Deputies will be aware that imports of anthracite have not increased in recent years. The Minister for Transport and Power told the House that we have had agreed voluntary reductions in imports of English anthracite and that this should help the sale of Irish anthracite to a great extent.</P>
      <P>It is a very complicated problem and it is under examination.  In the meantime, every possible way to find a market for the products of the Leinster coalmines is being examined and followed.  The particular problem of Castlecomer, which would not be solved by having a market for its product, is also a difficult one.  It is the problem of the availability of coal in commercially workable seams and that is quite a distance from what any Government Department could be expected to solve.  If you have not commercially workable seams, no amount of Government action will create them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy has said, in 1963 my predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce was contacted by representatives of the community in Castlecomer and by the management of the Castlecomer collieries.  The collieries were losing money and a close-down was then imminent.  The Government were very concerned at the threat <Col N="1578" /> to employment and the social problems that would follow, and so that the mine might continue in operation while its viability was being examined &mdash;its viability was in question at the time&mdash;assistance was given to the company to obtain accommodation from their bankers.  This assistance, and the accommodation the company got from their bankers, enabled them to continue operations.  By developing fresh workings, they hoped to increase output. All those measures did not succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not.  The next step taken was to try to appraise the prospects of development in the future and, to guide them in this, the company engaged the services of a firm of international experts who made an examination.  Their report, which I told the Deputy I was awaiting, on the prospects of the Castlecomer collieries having enough workable seams to make it possible to continue it, was received recently and a copy was made available to me and is now being examined in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still limited in what I can say in regard to it.  The report is under examination but a first reading of it suggests that the outlook for the mine is bad.  It is quite clear there is no prospect of this mine being worked on an economic or commercial basis.  The Government and Deputies are concerned about the fate of the miners and the effects on the Castlecomer community.  Both are matters of grave concern to me and the Government.  Everything I can do to find alternative employment, to promote other measures for the miners, will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say now that the prospects of alternative employment for the miners is good&mdash;more immediate and better than the prospects of industry for the town.  The promotion and placing of industries is a very difficult problem, <Col N="1579" /> but, as I say, anything I or my Department can do will be done.  In the meantime, the prospects for the continued employment of the miners is good.  I have gone just as far as I can.  The <Col N="1580" /> developments will become obvious to the Deputy.</P>

While estimates are made independently for a number of these sectors, it is not considered that the reliability of the figures is adequate to warrant official publication of each of them.  Estimates of the numbers at work in four main groups are, however, published in Table 15 of Economic Statistics.  The figures for April, 1964, are</P>

      <P>Two Employment Period Orders (a) the Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) Order covering the period 10th March, 1965 to 2nd November, 1965 and (b) the Unemployment Assistance (Second Employment Period) Order, 1965 covering the period 9th June, 1965 to 2nd November, 1965 are now in operation.  As factors, other than the operation of the Orders, affect the numbers on the live register, it is not possible to determine what changes in the numbers of those on the live register are ascribable to the operation of the Orders.  It may be noted, for instance, that a number of the persons who are precluded from the receipt of unemployment assistance by the Orders continue to register and are included in the total live register figure in the category &ldquo;Others&rdquo;, i.e. persons other than claimants to unemployment benefit or applicants for unemployment assistance.  However, as an indication of the changes resulting from the operation of these Orders it may be noted that between 5th and 12th March, 1965 the number of applicants for unemployment assistance assessed with means declined by 2,656 and those without means by 89 while the figure for the category &ldquo;Others&rdquo; rose by 2,312.  Similarly between 4th and 11th June the number of applicants for unemployment assistance assessed with means declined by 5,926 and those without means by 825 while the figure for the category &ldquo;Others&rdquo; rose by 4,419.</P>

      <P>While employment in the industrial sector increased in 1964 at a rate consistent with the 1970 target of the Second Programme, the rate of decrease in agricultural employment was rather greater than was visualised in the Programme and employment in the services sector did not increase as anticipated.  As a result the increase in total employment in 1964 was less than the annual rate envisaged in the Programme.  This situation has been commented on in the report of the National Industrial Economic Council entitled &ldquo;Comments on Department of Finance Review of Economic Progress in 1964 and Prospects for 1965&rdquo;.</P>
