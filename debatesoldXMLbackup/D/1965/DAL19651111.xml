      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave this amendment, I should like to ask the Minister is he satisfied that it covers the type of case we have had for so long in Griffith Barracks, which, because of a shortage of housing, was pushed over on to the backs of the health authority.  This can happen in any part of the country.  These people are not destitute and they are not sick, and they are not a health problem. Nevertheless they appear to be <Col N="1637" /> thrown over as a health responsibility or as a responsibility of a health authority.  Is it intended to cover that type of case by this amendment, and will the housing authorities provide these families with emergency accommodation, and will they get a full subsidy for the housing accommodation they provide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the Bill, the Bill provides for housing authorities and their duties and responsibilities in regard to housing people who cannot house themselves.  In so far as providing shelter as such is concerned, it is not intended that this Bill will take over that which is now a health authority responsibility and add it to the housing responsibility of the local authority.  The health authority render this service to people in need, and where it is necessary to the category I have mentioned who are in need of housing and who cannot by their own lawful means provide houses or homes for themselves.  This is a case where the health authority step in, in some emergency conditions, if you like, where people might, by storm or by fire or some other such happening, have been rendered homeless for a short time, but who would be able to provide for themselves except in a temporary emergency situation.  That is something which it is not proposed to be dealt with by this Housing Bill or a housing authority but left to the health authority as it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with two matters.  First there is the provision of temporary or emergency accommodation for persons rendered homeless due to storm damage, fire damage or eviction; and the Minister might add to that: &ldquo;or for any other reason&rdquo;.  The second is the provision of reserved accommodation for newly-weds.  I am becoming somewhat confused here because it <Col N="1638" /> appears that by some subtle wording of a previous Act, it is assumed by the Minister that a health authority has responsibility for housing these people. We believe that their housing should be a function of the housing authority and not the health authority, and this is a matter I would like to see clarified here.</P>
      <P>I do not care how anybody else feels about it but if a situation arises where a family or families are homeless and cannot find accommodation themselves and the local authority cannot find it for them, I believe we should have some regulation whereby they can be put into temporary accommodation until such time as they reach the priority which will give them a house. This is the duty which some people would like to see put on to the health authorities but it is not their responsibility. It should be the responsibility of the housing authority.  Immediately there is any mention of homeless people, Griffith Barracks comes to mind, but, as I have said already, Dublin is not the only place in Ireland and Dublin is not the only place where this problem occurs.  We have it at local authority level where a family is evicted either by a heartless landlord or by someone who really wants a house or where, because of storm damage or because the house is unfit for human habitation, families find themselves homeless.  There is no place for these people to go but the county home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no room for them there.  The county homes are full up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the situation where people are being put into the county homes because there is no alternative accommodation.  Deputy O'Hara says that there is no room in the county homes and he is right.  In my county there is no room in the county homes at present for any extras. It makes it doubly hard then if accommodation has to be found, not for a single case or for a man and wife, but for a family with children.  The father and mother are separated and the children are put away to some other place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> There is nothing to stop this House inserting in the Bill a regulation providing that a certain type of accommodation which has not to be built, which is there at present and which is not being usefully used, State property and property owned by local authorities, should be turned into family unit accommodation to be used in case of emergency not as a permanent place of abode but for cases of emergency.  These people could be housed in such accommodation until the local authority finds a house for them or until they can find a house themselves.  Such accommodation would not be free.  These people would pay their way.</P>
    <P>This is a must and it is where we can avoid an awful lot of trouble in the future.  The Minister says he is legislating for the future.  He is an intelligent man and if he thinks it over, he will agree that there is no reason at all why we should not put the responsibility on those who should carry it.  The members of a health authority may say that they are prepared to do this but the officials say that there is no reason why they should and that they should not do it. I am aware of a case in which the local authority, because they could not accommodate people in the county home, had to go around from door to door seeking accommodation for a family of nine people who had been evicted and who are living in a tent. They got accommodation for that family at an inflated price, at £4 10s. a week.  The father earns £12 a week and, with nine children, he would not be able to pay that rent.  Who was going to pay the balance?  The result was that there was a charge on the health authority for something that normally should be no charge at all because the man would have been able to pay normal rent.  The Minister would be well advised to have another look at this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in believing that subsection (3) paragraph (a) does in fact make provision whereby what is familiarly known as the Griffith Barracks situation, where a <Col N="1640" /> local authority has to knock down houses on the ground that they are unfit for human habitation, can be dealt with?  They are charged with the responsibility of giving a certain priority to the evacuated tenants in making their scheme.  What I do not understand is that this does not seem to me to give any relief in the situation when you have priorities already established which are of such an urgency that you cannot give anybody else priority over them.  My understanding of the situation in Dublin is that unless you have four children, they will not put you on the list at all. Deputies will realise the atmosphere of futile despair in which these people are living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that we are discussing amendment No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, and that includes paragraphs (e) and (f), and one of these is the provision of temporary or emergency accommodation for people rendered homeless due to storm damage, fire damage or eviction. I think there is power under paragraph (e) to deal with that particular situation but the fact of the matter is that the priorities there already are so urgent that you cannot put anybody else ahead of those already waiting.  We are talking of making provision to authorise people to set up ratios of priority.  What more urgent case can there be than that of a man, with a wife and four children, who has no home, who is waiting to get one and who is told that his name will not even be put on the list because there are so many people with five, six or seven children who have not yet got a home? What I am saying is: do not let us imagine that by authorising local authorities to prepare schemes we are doing anything concrete now or will be doing it in the future, to relieve this situation.  The only thing that will effectively serve&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;the purposes of section 60 is not to add new categories which the local authorities may insert but to build houses, and if we have not got the houses, then it does not matter how excellent the intentions of the local <Col N="1641" /> authorities are or how detailed and sympathetic are the schemes they prepare.</P>
      <P>You cannot put more than a pint into a pint bottle and if all you have got is a pint of houses, you cannot put a gallon of people into them.  That is the real, fundamental problem.  You may make categories until the cows come home but if the houses are not there you cannot make provision for them.  As I understand the present problem, and here I think the Minister's section meets the problem, it is that in the Griffith Barracks situation, the people were evicted because the houses were falling down on them and they had to be put into a disused military barracks.  The problem was that it was very doubtful, when the local authority came to examine the circumstances of individual families in Griffith Barracks, whether these families fell within the category of families for which local authorities could make provision for houses and secure the maximum subsidy from the Minister for Local Government.  That is not such a simple problem.  You may find a family in a house which is condemned and who do not fall within the category of persons for whom the local authority can make housing provision by way of rented houses; yet those people may be wholly unable to find alternative accommodation even though they are prepared to pay for it, particularly if they are in the circumstances to which Deputy Tully has referred, living in a rural area where there just may not be accommodation available.</P>
      <P>How does this amendment alter the situation?  All the amendment proposes to do is to authorise the local authority to make new schedules of persons eligible for houses within the ambit of their present discretion.  Does it affect categories of persons for whom local authorities can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things, the provision of temporary or emergency accommodation for persons rendered homeless due to storm damage, fire damage or eviction and then the provision of reserved accommodation for newly-weds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose, I would gather, is to shift the responsibility for this problem off the shoulders of the health authority on to the shoulders of the housing authority. I sympathise with Deputy Clinton who has been carrying the burden of the Griffith Barracks families for a long time and eventually has resolved it by providing them with caravans.  I do not care who carries the responsibility as long as the people get houses. Deputy Clinton is very much more experienced in the actual day to day problems of this kind than I am. There is a great deal to be said for the view that housing is a matter for the Minister for Local Government, health is a matter for the health authority, and poverty and destitution are matters for the Minister for Social Welfare.  If these three public servants would each do his duty, and if they made one another do his duty, our problems would be largely resolved.  It is a mistake to unload each miscellaneous problem that occurs to our minds on to the back of the Minister for Local Government.  Poverty and destitution are the problems of the Minister for Social Welfare; housing, the Minister for Local Government should cheerfully shoulder; and health should be left to the Minister for Health and the health authority.  In so far as this is providing accommodation for persons rendered homeless, then that is a housing problem and the Minister would be wise to accept that it is the responsibility of the housing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the House to remember that the present situation in Dublin is that unless you have more than four children, your name will not be put on any list in any scheme.  That is the hub of the problem and the only effective <Col N="1643" /> way to resolve it is to build more houses quickly and I doubt if we are going to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important section of the Bill.  The whole Bill pivots around the question of priorities.  There are two types of priorities, first of all, the general classification into which the local authority must segregate people for houses and the other is the question of priority for the allocation of houses.  There seems to be some confusion in relation to the two headings.  I should like to point out, and this will ease Deputy Dillon's mind, that Dublin Corporation are now housing families consisting of a husband and wife and three children.  It is erroneous to say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that people with five, six or seven children have not yet been housed is due to the fact that they requested accommodation in certain areas and will not accept accommodation except in the area they specify.  All those people with four or more children would be housed if they accepted accommodation where corporation accommodation is available. Accommodation is available in Coolock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, I believe that it is already covered in the section.  As Deputy Dillon stated, no matter what we write into the section, it will mean little in the end.  Deputy Tully has stated that the Minister should ensure that accommodation is provided and that he can do so easily by inserting a section.  If it were that easy, there would be no problem at all.  I believe it is adequately covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> I do not want to develop the matter of Griffith Barracks because it has already been developed.  We can have a full discussion on this problem.  In this section I believe it is adequately covered and anything else we try to put in will probably only confuse the issue.  It will not make more houses available.  The only way people can be housed is by a greater amount of building, as indicated by Deputy Dillon, to be undertaken as the Minister for Local Government suggested when he told Dublin Corporation that if they could not build sufficient houses by their system, they would have to build them by his system.  With that type of approach, I believe the priorities will drop and if that happens, all sections will be housed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>God be with the days when we had 1,500 houses too many and no tenants to go into them.  There was no priority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt if we decided to sell out some of the major industries we have, thus disemploying unfortunate workers, we would soon have sufficient houses but I believe the Minister's approach is the right one.  If houses cannot be built by traditional methods, we must find another method.  I believe under the Minister's approach all sections can be housed. Many of them can be and are being dealt with by the local authorities.  We make provision in Dublin Corporation for people evicted through no fault of their own and such persons, provided they have three children, will be accommodated.  I think the provisions of the Bill are quite adequate to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could help in this.  It is true that at present housing authorities are free to provide the type of accommodation sought in the amendment.  There is nothing in legislation to prevent them from doing so and neither is there any obligation on them to do it; but there is an obligation <Col N="1645" /> on the health authorities to do it. Most of us feel very strongly that this housing responsibility should be included in legislation and there should be an obligation on housing authorities, whenever families find themselves on the roadside for any reason, not necessarily the reasons specified in the amendment, to provide accommodation for them.  There are many reasons why families find themselves on the roadside.  They may have returned from England where they had gone to seek work and they have no house here.  They are a father and mother with a family and have no means of providing themselves with a house. The sense of the amendment is to have available emergency accommodation which may be converted accommodation. This requires the co-operation perhaps of many Government Departments in order to make it available to local authorities and have it so reconstructed as to provide family type accommodation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully is not satisfied with the present situation, and neither am I, where perhaps a family, through no fault of their own, find themselves on the street with young children.  The only accommodation they can get is accommodation for the mother and children who can go to an institution but the husband cannot go with them and so the family is broken up.  That situation can continue for quite a long time because they do not come within the priority category.  The Minister could be helpful if he would agree that there should be an obligation on the local authority to provide this type of accommodation which would be family accommodation but which would fall short of being a home proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has greater respect for my old comrade, Deputy Dowling, than I but if he would forget the Party line and discuss this as we on these Benches are trying to do, he would be more helpful to the Minister and to the House in getting a better Bill.  The Deputy made a number of statements which I do not propose to follow but he apparently misunderstood the section. I am not surprised; perhaps he will <Col N="1646" /> pick it up later.  The same thing cannot be said for Deputy Dillon who made a very strong appeal&mdash;and he can make a good case for practically anything.  He made a very good case but made it on the wrong lines.  May I point out that the Labour Party amendment suggests the provision of temporary or emergency accommodation? There is a difference between accommodation and housing.  It may not be houses&mdash;it will almost certainly not be houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Chair's permission, I shall read it all.  It says:</P>
      <P>(e)  the provision of temporary or emergency accommodation for persons rendered homeless due to storm damage, fire damage or eviction;</P>
      <P>(f)  the provision of reserved accommodation for newly-weds.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Accommodation&rdquo; is the operative word in each case and Deputy Dillon said that subsection (3) (a) says:</P>
      <P>(a)  the repair, closure or demolition of houses which are unfit in any respect for human habitation;</P>
      <P>I believe what Deputies Dillon and Dowling were talking about was provision of houses for people out of turn. That is not what Deputy Clinton and I are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I am making is that there are in the city and throughout the country quite a number of good buildings owned by the State or by local authorities that are not being used or used usefully, and those buildings could be converted into emergency family unit accommodation.  That is the difference between Griffith Barracks and what I have in mind. I want accommodation for those who urgently require it until they can be reached on the priority list.  I agree that the proper thing to do is to build houses but at present, with the exception of Ballymun which was already passed before the credit squeeze, no local authority houses are being built.  Nobody need look <Col N="1647" /> surprised.  It is true that the Minister for Local Government has&mdash;I shall not say refused&mdash;failed to make money available for the building of those houses not because he wants to but because the money is not available. The suggestion that since a family of three in Dublin can now get accommodation that answers everything does not satisfy me.  I am speaking of the whole country where at present many people cannot get accommodation and will not get it for years.  The way to deal with it, I suggest, is where an emergency arises as happened this year and last year, accommodation can be made available and this can only be done if, and only if, included in this Bill is a provision that the local authority shall do it.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by somebody saying family accommodation was available in Griffith Barracks.  May I repeat something that has been said here by a number of people over the past few months?  Family accommodation is not available at Griffith Barracks. Part-family accommodation is available there.  If I thought that the insertion of this amendment in the Bill could result in the same situation as now obtains in which only a mother and children can get accommodation while the father must seek accommodation elsewhere, I would withdraw it immediately.  That is an unchristian idea and I do not think there is any justification for it.  If the Minister wishes to have a further look at the amendment, I am prepared to withdraw it, if he agrees to consider it and see what the situation is.  Evidence can be put before him that there are plenty of buildings available all over the country that can be used for this type of accommodation if it is made mandatory that this should be done. But, if it is left to the whim of the local authority, it will not be done.</P>
    <P>Griffith Barracks always comes to the fore.  But we all have the same problem.  I live in a seaside resort where a number of houses are locked up for the greater part of the year.  The reason is the people who own them make their livelihood by letting them at high rents during the summer period. <Col N="1648" /> They are entitled to do so.  But that is poor consolation to those who are evicted in the area, particularly if they have families.  Instead of having to go to the people who own these houses and pay summer rents they cannot afford, there should be an arrangement that buildings which are there, and which could be turned into family units, would be made available to these people until their names are reached on the priority list.</P>

      <P>It would seem that the Labour amendment calls for the provision of only temporary accommodation for the classes of people mentioned.  In fact, Dublin Corporation are at present making permanent accommodation available for all those who qualify.  Despite what Deputy Tully says, the housing programme in the city is expanding.  The corporation have plans on hand, tenders received for, or construction proceeding on about 2,000 houses, plus the Ballymun scheme.</P>

      <P>According to <Col N="1649" /> Deputy Dowling, if anybody living in a room with a relative in a private house or a corporation dwelling is evicted, all he has to do, if he has three children, is to go to the corporation and get rehoused.  It does not matter where he comes from.  What happens the people with only two children or one child?  What arrangements are made for the man and woman sitting on the steps of their house in Mountjoy Square for nearly a month?  Are they to wait where they are?  Is it not Christian that the corporation, or whatever the local authority is, should be responsible for making accommodation available? This accommodation is there.  It requires only a small amount of money to turn it into reasonable family units. If that is done, these people can move in.</P>
      <P>I am talking now about what happens in the country as well as in the city.  It is no use trying to tell us that there are only people in Dublin with three children.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who have not got three children, who are entitled to housing accommodation but who will not get it.  In County Meath we do not have a restriction with regard to the number of children but we have a restriction with regard to the number of houses.  We cannot build rural cottages and housing schemes because the Department of Local Government say: &ldquo;Sign any contract you like but do not start until we tell you, because there is no money available.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why say that the problem can be solved easily?  I am suggesting in the amendment that existing buildings can be converted for temporary use, because I will not suggest that people should live for ever in temporary accommodation, whether that is an old barracks, an old hospital or a caravan. There are many people in Dublin city and county living in old caravans waiting for houses.  All I am asking is that the Department should take the responsibility of pressing on local authorities that the type of accommodation I speak of should be made available.  If that is done&mdash;and it can be done&mdash;it will solve a lot of our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quarrelling with the Fianna Fáil Party over this.  It is not a matter <Col N="1650" /> over which we should quarrel.  I am sure both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael feel the same as we do that it is a shocking thing that people should not have houses.  It is shocking to find people out on the street when they should be in reasonably comfortable accommodation.  This is not a Party issue.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister for Local Government to have another look at it from this angle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Tully's attitude towards housing.  At all times since I came into this House, he has tried to be helpful and undoubtedly he has great experience. However, there are one or two points on which, in fairness to the city, I wish to contradict him.  Dublin Corporation, especially in the past two years, have taken over old buildings, such as old fire stations and even part of Board of Works property, and have provided flats in these buildings.  Even if this Bill never came up, a local authority has power to provide this type of accommodation.  The Ballymun scheme is purely supplementary to the corporation's building programme.  At the moment&mdash;I speak from memory&mdash;the corporation have approximately 1,700 dwellings under contract and, with the tenders accepted in recent months, plus development work now going on, I would say about 2,500 dwellings are either under contract or planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, I am glad to say, the corporation have found no trouble with regard to money.  I can recall only two periods when we were short of money&mdash;that was in 1949 and 1956.  As a Dubliner, I am not proud of the system which creates something like Griffith Barracks; but let us go into the problem of Mountjoy Square and Griffith Barracks in particular.  With one of Deputy Tully's colleagues, I spent some time with the people in Mountjoy Square.  First, I found that very few of them would qualify on the residence qualification.  I appreciate the fact that in Royal Meath they have a serious housing problem, just as we have here in Dublin, but it is most unfair to ask Dublin Corporation to house families which came over here and got great <Col N="1651" /> publicity because they could not get houses.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be some priorities? Dublin Corporation believe in satisfying the greatest need.  The system has been criticised, even by members of the corporation, but I think it is a fair system.  The whole effort of the corporation, backed by the Minister, is to bring about a situation in this city in which each family that qualifies will have proper accommodation.  The City Medical Officer has passed roughly 4,000 families for housing.  If we were to accept that figure, we would wipe out our housing problem over the next two years.  Most of us, of course, do not accept that figure.  We are not so naive as to accept it.  We believe our city will have a continuing housing problem.  The only city without a housing problem is a dying city, and Dublin is far from that, with a population increasing rapidly and a demand for a higher standard of housing accommodation.  Both the population and the demand are rising all the time.  People are marrying younger and the demand for housing is, therefore, increasing.  The fact that the Minister is a member of my Party does not mean necessarily that I must praise him but, as I said before, it was the Minister who conceived the Ballymun scheme and pressed it through against tremendous opposition.  It may sound strange but some members of the Dublin Corporation had to fight a tough battle to get a majority of the corporation to accept the Ballymun scheme.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Tully is trying to do in this amendment but, quite apart from this amendment, the powers are already there for local authorities to provide the type of accommodation Deputy Tully seeks.</P>

      <P>This amendment has given an opportunity to a number of people to express their views on certain things.  Some of them have done so emotionally and some unemotionally. It was said there is no building going on outside of Dublin at the moment. I think that is how Deputy Tully put it: whatever about Dublin, there is no <Col N="1652" /> building going on anywhere else.  The fact is we will complete this year local authority houses in excess of 3,000 as against 2,300 last year.  If Deputy Tully says that is not building, then I make him a present of it.</P>

If, as Deputy Tully says, there has been no building since the credit squeeze and we are building no houses, I take it he will agree that the only conclusion one can draw is that a number in excess of 3,000 were completed in the first three months of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated that providing temporary and emergency accommodation for people rendered homeless as a result of storm damage, fire damage or eviction should be made an obligation of the local authority.  The fact is there is nothing that says a local authority may not house such people.  Under the section we are dealing with, it will be easier for local authorities in future to provide accommodation for these people because the qualifications will not be so restrictive from the point of view of priorities.  The emphasis in future will be on rehousing.  It will be governed by the genuine need of people who are not in a position to provide houses for themselves.  That is a wider approach than we have had up to this.  Of course, in the past, people evicted or rendered homeless for some reason have been housed by local authorities and there will be nothing in the future to prevent local authorities continuing that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we have not reached the point <Col N="1653" /> at which we maintain that the obligations that rest on a health authority should be imposed on those responsible for housing.  Shelter and maintenance are obligations on the health authority.  The provision of houses is the responsibility of the housing authority.  While these two things run parallel, there is the system&mdash;I have already mentioned this&mdash;whereby a housing authority, if they have the accommodation, can house certain categories.  That system will be continued. The only restriction is that those in need of housing must be unable to provide houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we should accept this amendment and, if we do not accept it, what is the point in discussing the one dealing with newly-weds? Newly-weds have, in fact, been accommodated.  Who will say they should have priority over families living in extremely bad conditions?  It is the elected representatives in each local authority who will draw up their own priorities.  It will be for them to decide. This power is given to local authorities in the belief that elected representatives, being on the spot, will be more familiar with the actual position obtaining in their particular areas than this House would be.  Newly-weds will have to take their place with others who are in need of houses.</P>
    <P>I can see no justification for accepting this amendment.  Neither do I see that it would add anything to the powers already there.  Newly-weds are already covered.  Priorities are for local authorities themselves to determine.  If we had a press-button housing service, then we could push the button and provide the house, once the prospective tenant had established need and eligibility, and there would be no need for all the discussion here.  While we have a position where housing in some cases is extremely short and in most cases is not surplus, we cannot start defining down to the finest point, making particular reference in the law to suit newly-weds or any other category when the overall power of the Bill, if enacted, covers the situation where the need for rehousing and the <Col N="1654" /> need for rehousing where people cannot provide for themselves are of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully talks about the amendment as if, if inserted, it could do all things and he goes on to say that there exist today many unused buildings that could be readily and easily rendered fit for occupation by families.  He instanced Bettystown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But do not let us get around to the idea again that in case of shortage, with the same number of housing units, the same power to provide them, the same amount of labour, contractors, money, plans and land, we can pull these people in merely by putting in an amendment that they should be seen to.  We know they should be seen to but we cannot, by the mere exercise of this sort of arrangement, provide what we are not providing now if we are doing all we can, and if we do all we can in future, we do not need this because it makes no sense, makes no additional effort in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quoting of Griffith Barracks makes me rather annoyed.  It makes me annoyed to hear the claptrap and the emotions that seem to be raised about Griffith Barracks and the move to Mountjoy Square and moves to wherever else since.  These people were provided with shelter and maintenance, I admit on a basis that none of us wish to see provided but the best in the circumstances available to them. A report I have here, which is the nearest to date that I have, contains one paragraph for 7th September last. It is interesting to see from this report the families that came to seek housing or accommodation who gave up accommodation that was provided by the health authority and went to Mountjoy Square.  There were 18 families involved.  This is on 7th September. None had been evacuated from a dangerous building, contrary to what Deputy Dillon quoted here that, in his belief, all had been evacuated from dangerous buildings.  Four came directly from England.  One of these was on holidays and has since returned to England.  Another is English and has refused the offer of the health authority to pay the fares of himself <Col N="1657" /> and his family back to England. Four of them had been in England at some stage previously but were put out by near relatives.  Those are the facts about these people on that date when the noise was big.  One left a caravan they had previously occupied and one was evicted&mdash;just one was evicted&mdash;after a dispute with the landlord.</P>
    <P>Can anybody say, in fairness, that in the circumstances of the housing shortage in Dublin, those cases, even though they, no doubt, did need housing, should have been put on the top of the priority list in Dublin Corporation and given houses?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anybody who would say that we were in a position either in the health authority or in Dublin Corporation to make better provision than had been made for them at the time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how.  Let us look at the position in Dublin.  If we were to do something better than the provision in Griffith Barracks, it would reduce what Dublin Corporation were otherwise doing in their building programme by some degree.  There is no point in shaking the head here. Dublin Corporation members and their Housing Committee members and their officials, managers, engineers and architects, came into my office at my invitation on more than one occasion and after long and serious consideration the conclusion was then reached that, from the point of view of construction of housing for their people, they were doing the most they were capable of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was from those circumstances that the Ballymun project that so much is heard about now eventuated.  If they were doing the most they could do&mdash; and nobody will deny this&mdash;in relation to the technical and other resources within the corporation, how can one truthfully say that if they were to convert old buildings rather than build new ones, the new buildings would not suffer at the expense of conversion and <Col N="1658" /> the number of houses that they would hope to build would be reduced in proportion to the amount of accommodation they had added by conversion for these people in preference to those already on an established waiting list which is far too long in the estimation of all of us but which we are trying to whittle down?  You cannot please everyone at the same time.  You cannot give housing accommodation that is not there, and the provision of this is not something you can just whistle out of the blue over and above the absolute limit of the output of Dublin Corporation which they have reached and at which they are stretched at the moment.  We cannot just cod ourselves into the belief that we can, by talking platitudes here and putting in amendments no matter how well meant.  They will not do anything concrete against the background that we are doing all we can, all of us, in trying to provide accommodation.</P>
    <P>We cannot get anywhere by indicating to those people who have left Griffith Barracks that they were right to do so and that the community owes them a debt of gratitude, and the people who induced them and helped them to go to Mountjoy Square.  I think we should catch ourselves on when we are talking about this situation. It is not being helped by those people who encouraged them to leave Griffith Barracks, even though I agree that is not ideal accommodation or anything like it, but it is a lot better than camping in Mountjoy Square or any other square with women and children in the open, in weather which was supposed to be summer weather but which was far from being summer weather at that time.  This gets the headlines and makes news and gets notoriety for certain people, but it does not do these people any good.  It does not do anything for the people who are seeking to house them, for the people themselves or for the people who are trying to help them.  It only adds further to the flames that have been fanned in this regard to have these promises emerging in print which in fact in the circumstances cannot really achieve anything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> This is not in any way a reflection on the good faith of Deputy Tully and other Deputies who go along with this amendment and push it.  I am trying to demonstrate why the amendment could not do anything in the circumstances. If circumstances altered to the point where it could, the powers are in the Bill to do these things if we had enough accommodation, and if we had enough capacity to produce the accommodation. The local authorities today have plenty of powers and their powers are being enlarged in this Bill as to the category of people they may house. If we can produce enough to meet the real needs we do not need to start detailing who, and for whom, and in what way, this should be provided.</P>
    <P>These semi-temporary or semipermanent dwellings&mdash;and Griffith Barracks is one example of that type of institution&mdash;leave a lot to be desired, and is it worth diverting energies which could more usefully be used to provide proper housing?  I do not think we need any of these amendments to do these things if circumstances permitted us to do them.  Not only have we extended and expanded the type of people who may be housed in future, with the aid of a higher subsidy, but we have also given to the local authorities the specific job of drawing up their own priorities, and if they take these wide powers in both hands and work them sensibly and reasonably, as I have no doubt they will be worked by members of the housing authorities, we can do the job and nothing that is being suggested here will add to it. If it would, I would be all for it but I certainly would be slow to take Deputy Tully up on the idea that I should have a look at this again.  I thought a lot about it, and we considered it well before we came here with the Bill.  The amendment has been perused and looked at from all angles and I can see nothing in it for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister one would think this amendment applied only to Dublin city.  I want to warn the Minister that the amendment is important to other local <Col N="1660" /> authorities throughout the country. The Minister pointed out that Dublin Corporation have the powers to speed up their housing schemes.  What is the position in the country?  This morning I received a letter from the Town Clerk of the Youghal Urban Council, one of the most important local authorities in Cork.  The letter asks me to see the Minister and ask him to approve a loan of roughly £50,000 or £60,000 for a new housing scheme in Youghal town.  The Minister has before him an application from one of our committees to meet members of the committee for the purpose of discussing a loan of £100,000.  We are ready to go ahead and we are awaiting the Minister's approval.  This in itself confirms what Deputy Tully wisely said that since the credit squeeze came into operation there has been a slowing down so far as applications for loans are concerned, and so far as the approval of contract documents is concerned.  I want to put that on record because a statement has been made by two members of the Fianna Fáil Party, from Dublin city I think, and by the Minister that there is no slowing down on house building and that if the local authorities wish to they can go ahead.  That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister does not want to see the sense of the amendment.  He wants to retain this system of divided responsibility as between housing authorities and health authorities in the same way as the Government insist on maintaining divided responsibility between health and education so far as mentally retarded patients are concerned.  In this sort of situation we have that divided responsibility and the unfortunate people who are looking for houses fall between two stools and are left on the street.  I do not think they should be left on the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health said it is not his responsibility to provide family type accommodation.  We all know it is not.  He is obliged to provide shelter. The type of shelter provided in Griffith Barracks was mentioned very often today, and I want to go on <Col N="1661" /> record as saying that I think it was first-class accommodation for mothers and children.  There was nothing wrong with that accommodation, but it was not family accommodation.  The health authorities say that in law they cannot provide family type accommodation and the Minister for Health says it is not his obligation.  Therefore, it must be a housing authority obligation, but unless we have it written into legislation somewhere that it is a housing authority responsibility, we will have this divided responsibility, nothing will be done, and families will be left on the street.</P>
    <P>No one suggested any of the things about which the Minister spoke.  No one suggested these people should be on the top of a priority list.  That is just a red herring.  In the course of trying to make his case against the amendment the Minister said that the Corporation were extended to the full and could do no more.  In 1951 they built 2,500 houses, and in 1961 they built 277 houses.  Last year they built 786 houses.  If they were extended to the full when they built 786 houses, how on earth did they build 2,500 in 1951? If they were given some of the empty barracks accommodation that exists in the city&mdash;and the barracks are half empty&mdash;they could provide family type accommodation with a certain amount of reconstruction that would not be very expensive and at least could be quickly provided.</P>
    <P>I know that this is a matter which is surrounded by a lot of difficulties and that you might have many families trying to impose on this type of accommodation but most of the families we have been discussing were able to pay for accommodation.  They could not get emergency accommodation and pay for it although they were able to pay for it.  The English family was not our responsibility and can be ruled out but the others are our responsibility. It has been said that they came back from England but they were driven out of this country.  They were forced out because there was no employment here for them.  They came back as they were entitled to and now they are regarded as outlaws.  I do not think they should <Col N="1662" /> be regarded as outlaws and forced to carry on these demonstrations in the streets as they have done.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who advised them against this action they have taken because I think they are injuring their case and not adding anything to the pressure.  They made these demonstrations in an effort to bring their problem to the notice of everybody.  That was an unfortunate move to make, a move they should never have been advised to make if they were advised to do it.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to place the responsibility for the housing of these categories where that responsibility rightly belongs.  It is a housing responsibility and should not be a joint responsibility between the health authorities and the housing authorities and consequently the responsibility of neither.  Unless there is a firm responsibility and obligation to provide this accommodation it will not be done by any of the parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify two points.  The Minister must have known that he was misquoting me when he said that I suggested that private property should be taken over. I am referring to public property owned by the State, semi-State bodies and local authorities and not properly used by them.  I have available a list of such property around Dublin city and county which I will make available to the Minister and I hope he makes better use of it than the Minister for Health did when I gave it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also been quoted here as saying that there is no building going on at the present time.  What I did say was that since the credit squeeze was introduced no money was made available by the Minister for Local Government and his Department for the public building of houses.  Local authorities have not got any money from the Department and where contracts were already signed a recent notification has been given that they are not to start the work until such time as they get special permission from the Department of Local Government. At the present time there is <Col N="1663" /> almost half a million pounds in applications from Dublin County Council and over £100,000 in applications from Meath County Council and none of this money has been sanctioned.  We have got no indication as to when we will get that money.  Building started before the credit squeeze came into operation is going on because it cannot be stopped.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that no matter how many blackbirds were in the country I would find a white one, but Deputy Moore has beaten me to it.  He has found one white blackbird in the English family that has been mentioned.  We have no responsibility for the housing of that family although I would hate to think that the British authorities would take the same attitude in regard to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are thousands of Irish families living in corporation houses in Britain.  That is the answer to Deputy Moore.  The Minister says he does not agree with the residence qualification where housing is concerned and yet members of his Party say that certain people do not qualify for houses because of the residence qualification.  In other words, if people are based in Dublin county or in County Meath, Dublin Corporation has no responsibility for housing them.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests that accommodation which is available and only needs to be properly split up into family units should be made available for families in certain categories named by us.  The Minister says that if this is done money which cannot be replaced will be switched from building.  I do not agree that this is likely to be a big problem.  There is a big difference between the cost of a house at £2,000 or £3,000 and the amount of money which it is estimated would make proper family unit accommodation in some of the buildings in and around this city.  I think the Minister is wrong when he says he will not take another look at this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> The whole kernel of this problem is that we are trying to take people off the streets where they are through no fault of their own and to put them into accommodation where they cannot be claimed to be jumping the queue. We do not want them to jump the queue but we do not believe that people should be thrown out on the streets for one reason or another, let it be by eviction by members of their own families.  It is as hard to be evicted by a father-in-law or mother-in-law as it is by anybody else.  It makes no difference what is the cause, they are out on the street.  If the house is being pulled down we will have to find accommodation for them.  Let us have the one rule for everybody and let us have the accommodation which is there made available to those people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see an arrangement made where the father of the family is not allowed to stay with the mother. There was nothing much wrong with the arrangement in Griffith Barracks except that the father was not allowed to remain with his family and that there were too many people crowded into the one room.  Deputy Dowling will agree with me that when both of us were serving in the Defence Forces they would not allow the number of beds in one room in Griffith Barracks that was allowed in the case of these people. Cubicle accommodation could have been made available very easily and this could now be done in a number of barracks in Dublin.  The barracks occupied by the Army in Dublin are certainly under-populated at the moment.  There are not so many people living in them.  Quite a number of them could be made available for this reason.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the Bill but this is a very important section. There are other remarks which I wish to make but I will make them on the section.  It is my opinion that this must be included in the Bill if we are going to have it done at all.  There is no use saying that the authority is there; the permission is there but the authority is not.  This dithering between the local authorities, the county council and the <Col N="1665" /> corporation, and the health authority, where one says that it is not its responsibility and passes it to the other which in turn disclaims responsibility, should be ended and the way to end it is to put this into the Bill and then we can use it when the occasion arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to comment on some of the remarks made by Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully. Deputy Clinton behaved in the most responsible manner during the entire Griffith Barracks upheaval.  I am aware of the manner in which he handled it, the advice he gave, and of the fact that in every way possible he tried to alleviate the position.  Deputy Tully has taken the real Labour line.  He has the list there.  Deputy Clinton and myself saw that list before.  It was produced at the health authority.  Deputy Tully says that there is a considerable number of Government premises, disused barracks and so on, which could be converted to provide accommodation. I do not know where they all are. I am a member of the boards of several hospitals, such as Loughlinstown Hospital, and I inquired if there were wards which could be converted in these hospitals but there is no ward available in any of them.  At one time the Labour Party suggested that we should send ambulances to take some people from Mountjoy Square and put them in Brú Caoimhín.  The list is of no importance because it is out of date and we dealt with it before.  Where possible, the Corporation have -taken over accommodation and converted it into permanent accommodation.  Some of that construction work is going on. Work on the Buckingham Street Fire Station has been completed; work is going on at Thomas Street Fire Station and also in Dorset Street.  Elsewhere they took over flats.  Every effort is being made and where accommodation was found to be suitable for conversion that was done by the Corporation.  It was indicated by Deputy Clinton that the Minister said that people should be outlawed because they came back from England.  He did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that only one family was evicted through no fault of their own and I have great sympathy for that family.  Because of the present priority system this family was not housed.  I do not agree with the present priorities as laid down by the corporation in regard to overcrowded families.  The priorities are outmoded and outdated and can cause terrible injustice.  I have a motion before the council for the past 12 months seeking an amendment to the system and which the local authority members have in their hands to accept if they wish.  Last week three or four families were housed from Griffith Barracks and families continue to be housed as they reach priority on the list.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to say that the Minister said that these people should be out-lawed because they returned from England.  He said they had returned from England and, as the House knows, the priority list indicates that you must be back from England for only three months before you are entitled to accommodation.  As long as they qualify in every other way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>They were entitled to houses after three months.  A person coming back with five children would have to be back for three months before he is considered for accommodation by the corporation.  If he has been back for three months he takes his place in the queue.  That is the regulation as laid down in the priority system. As far as Griffith Barracks is concerned it is undesirable but I am very sorry that the matter was introduced.  It is just a red herring, a gimmick, and these gimmicks have a nasty habit of backfiring.  Not so long ago one did backfire and the backfire was heard in <Col N="1667" /> Rome.  These people are being housed gradually.  The only way to resolve the position is to build more houses and that is being done.  If there is temporary accommodation which can be converted into permanent accommodation then that is being done.</P>
      <P>I fail to see any reason why this amendment should be implemented when provision has already been made. Provision exists for newly-weds and in the corporation we have a scheme under which 250 newly-weds are housed each year.  When you have been wed for two years you can take part in two draws for houses for newly-weds. People whose accommodation has suffered from storm damage, or fire, or who have been evicted, have also been housed, provided they reached the requirements of the local authority.  If people are to be housed otherwise then they must jump the queue.</P>

I suggest that the information is up to date.  Another thing is that the Minister for Local Government did say that some of the people in Mountjoy Square, who were there after they had been in Griffith Barracks, had returned from England.  Deputy Clinton is entitled to his interpretation that the Minister felt that the corporation had no responsibility for them.</P>

I gathered from him that some statement had been made earlier by another Deputy that all the people in Griffith Barracks had been evicted from or had to leave dangerous buildings.  The Minister pointed out that four of them came directly from England and found themselves at Griffith Barracks.  A point was made about one Englishman: I do not think it was said that he would not be considered for rehousing but it was pointed out that the Dublin Health Authority had offered to pay the fare for himself and his family back to England.</P>

      <P>In arranging this whole system of priorities, I think it is wrong to have a fixed scheme that must be followed rigidly by the MOH and the manager of a local authority. Whenever a number of houses come up for allocation invariably some family just does not fit into one or other priority category and they are eliminated.  In my view the scheme should be regarded as a guide line rather than something that must be rigidly followed because I have seen so often when houses were being allocated deserving people who could not be considered because they did not qualify under the priorities laid down. If we made this not completely binding, in cases where members of the local authority and responsible officials were satisfied, they could go outside the scheme and agree to include a family that was obviously urgently in need.  We should, I think, be at liberty to do that and that, in some <Col N="1671" /> way, should be agreed on this particular section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great danger in what the Deputy has suggested. Personally, I should like a scheme that would apply to everybody. Something that annoys a number of us on local authorities is when somebody out of the blue seems to appear and get a house to which everybody except the county manager, the MOH or somebody else thinks he is not entitled. I should like to see priority lists drawn up in each local authority and not alone that but lists of people seeking houses.  It annoys the fellow who is second every time and when a house becomes vacant he does not get it.  If he had another few points he would have got it.  Another house comes along and for one reason or another somebody else gets ahead of him and pips him on the post.  That happens again and again.  Every local authority should be asked to draw up a set list so that when a house becomes vacant it would be filled almost immediately. Very often a local authority house becomes vacant and it is several months before the argument is settled about who is going to get it.  That should not happen and the way to prevent it, I think, is to have this list drawn up.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted figures.  There are some figures that I should like to give of new houses built by local authorities.  In 1955 in rural areas there were 2,193 built and in urban areas 3,407.  In 1962 there were 455 in rural areas and 783 in the urban areas.  I am glad there is some improvement on that.</P>

      <P>There is a lot to be said for what Deputy Tully said in his earlier remarks, though not for his last comment.  If we are to have priorities it would be impossible to have a situation where you could depart from them at any or every time. However, I think I know what is in the Deputy's mind.  I know in rural areas in particular you can have the situation where people are waiting for a house for a number of years and <Col N="1672" /> who are pressing their applications on the local authority.  But, when the time comes for the houses to be allotted, some casual person with a very high priority rating, but who did not even bother to apply when the housing need was being established, comes along and walks into the first house to the exclusion of the two or three families who did apply to establish the need in the area.  I remember that at one time to try to combat that in my own local authority we made it known that the first to be satisfied, provided they were eligible in other respects, would be those who had in fact applied when the need for the houses was being established and that it was only after that the others would be brought in.  I do not know whether that still obtains in Donegal County Council.  It was an effort to get over this problem.</P>
      <P>I believe this problem should be capable of being covered even where you fix priorities.  What appeals to me about having the local authority members themselves fix these priorities is this.  In the past the complaint has often been that it is the manager, the County MOH or some other official who made the decision, perhaps against the expectations of the members of the council.  Once the tenancy was allocated, there was nothing they could do about it.  If local councillors can make priorities of their own, they can confine the executive to within those groupings, so that lettings will be made only in accordance with the views of the council.</P>
      <P>I agree inflexibility is not a good thing for its own sake.  However, I think the power to review from time to time will be a sufficient safeguard for dealing with new situations or matters cropping up which might not have been envisaged when the scheme was drawn up.  I think that would meet the point made by Deputy Clinton of giving you flexibility while, at the same time, the priority rating would confine your executive to within that group until the members reviewed or amended the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's opinion that at the time a decision is <Col N="1673" /> made to build a number of houses in a locality the list should be drawn up and priorities arranged and that anybody appearing at the time the houses are being allocated, whether they would be at that time people who would normally be regarded as more eligible, should be disregarded?  I know that the medical officer and the manager have always indicated to us they were obliged to see the situation as it existed on the day they were giving out the houses or a few weeks before when they went around and examined the present position of the families in the area.</P>
      <P>This is one of these things it is very hard to make an exact decision about. You could find yourself in the position that an eviction would take place coinciding with the allocation of a scheme of houses and the family concerned might not be one of the families who established the need.  Are we going to say to them &ldquo;Because you were not one of the families who established the need, because you were not in need of a house 12 months ago, we cannot give you priority.  You must accept accommodation of an institutional type and your family must be divided&rdquo;?  That is not a right decision to make either. All things being equal, the people who by their pressure and agitation to get houses built have established the need should get priority.  If they are not equal, it would be wrong to exclude people who found themselves in deplorable conditions at the time the houses were given out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this scheme is made out and agreed a good deal of publicity should be given to the fact that public representatives have neither hand, act nor part and have no influence as to who should get a particular house or who should get houses in a particular scheme and that that is the function and responsibility of the doctor and manager.  This business of public representatives pretending they are able to decide who gets a house where makes for endless trouble for public representatives generally.  It is completely wrong that any influence should be brought to bear on deciding who should get a house and that need should not be the yardstick.  At all <Col N="1674" /> times need should be the yardstick and not the amount of influence any applicant has.  My experience is that need has been the yardstick in our local authority, but it has gone abroad that that is not so.  A good deal of publicity should be given to the fact that public representatives have no influence and can do nothing for anybody except to help get a house built. But, when it comes to the allocation, their influence no longer exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I can see Deputy Clinton's problem clearly but it will not be true to say in the future that the county manager or county MOH will exclusively, without regard to any other opinion, have the right of housing. The whole purpose of setting out that the members should draw up a scheme of housing priorities is to ensure, first, that we do not get to a point where every letting will be made by a majority decision of the council.  I do not think anybody would wish that.  I do not think it would be a good thing if the members of local authorities could dictate the general pattern but they can indicate the guide lines within which the manager must make the lettings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember an instance which may be of interest.  A letting was made by a county manager in the usual way. The tenant had in fact disposed of two houses and a farm only a short time before.  He had a large, young family and he got a county council house. Later it was discovered that the executive were not aware, as the local councillors were, of the fact that, although he was without a house, he had just sold two and a farm.  He could have provided a house for himself.  The matter was discussed.  It was demonstrated that very often local councillors were in possession of information that might not be available to the executives. The matter was discussed on the basis of existing law, which is being changed somewhat now, and it was decided that local councillors would be given a list of the applicants in advance and they could make whatever comments they wished.  That was the understanding: the manager and his staff would be given the benefit of <Col N="1675" /> the intimate knowledge in the possession of local representatives of the applicant beforehand.  This was done to prevent a recurrence of the earlier grave error.  Of course, this type of thing could be provided against under the scheme of priorities.  It might be a prerequisite, indeed, to the lettings; that the councillors should make their knowledge available before the manager makes the lettings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting we would not all of us have our own priorities.  There will be three or four who will not have the same priorities. If we could achieve agreed priorities, the whole thing would be very simple. That is not what I am suggesting. Councillors may have information of a local character that the ordinary investigators might not have.  It is because of that I suggest councillors might be given a list of the applicants before the manager makes his final decision.  That would at least provide them with an opportunity of presenting whatever information they have before the actual lettings are made.  There are many things that could possibly be built in which only local authorities themselves could be aware of.  Within the general power here, I believe any eventuality can be covered in order to reduce the possibility of any friction arising or any injustice being done unwittingly. In that way it should be possible to get very close to an agreed scheme.  There can be no hope of perfection and no hope that mistakes will not be made, but we can go a long way towards ensuring that mistakes made in the past are not repeated.  The power here can be utilised, I believe, to good effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In our local authority, the elected representatives are asked to give their comments.  If all the councillors, as very often happens, recommend one applicant, say, for a cottage, then the county MOH and the manager accept that.  If <Col N="1676" /> there is a difference of opinion, the county manager gets the councillors together and the matter is discussed with the MOH.  He may persuade them the particular applicant is the proper one or <i>vice versa.</i> The same process obtains with relation to schemes.  Only once in a blue moon is an applicant given a house and it later appears an injustice has been done.  The matter is then discussed in open council.  That does not alter the situation, but it may make the county manager more careful. Perhaps that does not apply all the way through because I saw a headline with regard to a case in Kingscourt. A single man was given a cottage in a scheme of six houses.  Five of the applicants were married.  In the case of the single man, he was employed as a technician in a local factory and he needed a house.  If we can prevent that sort of thing happening we should. There was a definite sense of grievance in that instance.  Many people, including local councillors, felt the whole thing was unfair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton says the local authority has no influence, good, bad or indifferent.  That is not so in Meath. I do not mean influence now in the sense in which it is normally used.  The recommendation is taken as a recommendation and, if the case made is strong enough, irrespective of whether the applicant is supported by members of our Party or some other Party, the decision usually goes the right way. If that principle were enshrined everywhere, we would be much nearer a solution to this very thorny problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To provide specifically for all these various aspects would be dangerous.  The general power is there in the section and local authorities should be able to devise their own framework within which the manager should operate.  Where you have a manager who operates on the basis Deputy Tully has mentioned, everything is satisfactory.  Of course, not all managers operate in that way.  Spelling out everything, one might easily leave the most important things out.  It is better to have a more general provision, without too much detail, such as we have here, and leave it to the <Col N="1677" /> councillors then to draw up their own scheme of priorities for the guidance of the manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything that could be included to cover the odd case I have mentioned?  This man was taken out of the queue and given a house while other more deserving applicants were passed over.  Is there no way in which that sort of thing could be dealt with rather than having an appeal to the Minister or some kind of row?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question.  I do not think he heard me. Is it his opinion that the priorities should be set up at the time there is a decision to build houses or should this be deferred until the time when the houses are built?  The Minister expressed the view that the people who were responsible for having the houses built, namely the applicants, who, in the initial stages, established the need, were the people who should get prior consideration.  He did not explain the position of the doctor and the manager when it comes to the point of allocation, perhaps two years later and in the meantime the situation for X-families has completely changed. What then does he think should be done?  Should these families be excluded because they were not amongst those responsible for having the houses built?  I should like to hear the Minister on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood in regard to the actual allocation procedure. It is done in County Dublin in much the same way as Deputy Tully has explained.  We hold a meeting of the area representatives and it is there decided who gets the houses and we are presented with a list that the manager and the doctor have approved. The only limited influence that we have and, in my view, the only influence that we should have, is, as the Minister says, in bringing something new to light, something that the executive did not know, that the manager or the doctor did not know, or correcting some misleading information that they may have got that would have the effect of putting somebody on the list <Col N="1678" /> who should not be on the list, or <i>vice versa.</i> The influence of a public representative should end there.  It should be a matter only of drawing attention to these things.  A person should not be able to get a house because a Party or a number of Parties support him.  Politics should not have that power.  I am sure Deputy Tully did not mean that but he did refer to Party support.  When it comes to the provision and allocation of local authority houses Party should be excluded.  It should be a question of need.  Need alone should be the yardstick. A great deal of publicity should be given to that.  Party politics should be ruled out of the allocation of houses absolutely and completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The flexibility provided for here is very desirable.  It is evident from the various contributions that have been made that the procedure varies with each local authority area. In my local authority area there is a very rigid system, one with which I totally disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton has indicated, every factor should be duly weighed. That can be done on a points system or some other way.  The system in the Dublin city area is based on size of family.  It may well be that a person living in one room with two children may be much worse off than a person living in one room with three children, if all the circumstances are taken into consideration.  Local authorities need guidance in this matter of priority.  The factors which must be considered include health, ceiling height of room, toilet and water facilities, size of windows, whether the accommodation is basement accommodation or otherwise. Either a man is ill or he is out. However strong the medical evidence may be, if he fails to satisfy the requirements of the city medical officer his application will be rejected.  The medical evidence should receive its due weight.  The system should be such that families would know exactly their position on the list and the list should be brought up to date periodically.  If that were done, the local authority would not have to circularise 7,000 or 8,000 people every few years in order to <Col N="1679" /> bring the list up to date.</P>
    <P>Anticipated increase in families and other factors not at present included in the calculation should be taken into consideration.  A person may be on the waiting list for 15 to 20 years.  Another person may be on the waiting list for only six months.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that local authorities get the necessary guidance.  The section states that the local authority shall obtain and have regard to a report of the chief medical officer.  Does that mean that they should accept it completely or merely have regard to it?  It would be better if it meant that they should merely have regard to it.  In many cases I have submitted evidence which I considered very substantial medical evidence, which was rejected because it did not meet the requirements of the city medical officer.  On the other hand, there are quite a number of medical certificates submitted which are obtained at a cost of 10/- or 15/-from the local doctor.  The position should be completely examined so as to eliminate the tactic in connection with housing accommodation of supplying a medical certificate for 10/-or 15/-.  The city medical officer should make a very comprehensive examination.</P>
    <P>The time must come very soon where Dublin Corporation will have to examine this matter in order to ensure that there will be in operation a system based on fair play under which every relevant factor will be considered.  I would say once again that the system in operation in the Dublin city area is completely outmoded and needs to be rectified as soon as possible if fair play is to be given to all applicants on the list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the local authority should be required to bring in its scheme of priorities.  Of course, that is nothing new.  Priorities are not new as far as local authorities are concerned. Deputy Dowling has mentioned a scheme of priorities in Dublin Corporation. The difficulty there is that the existing scheme is governed by the <Col N="1680" /> Housing of the Working Classes Acts and has to operate within a somewhat narrower framework than may be considered desirable.  There is a particular problem in relation to Dublin which may also apply in the case of large cities such as Cork and Limerick but certainly does not apply in County Dublin or in the rural areas.  As Deputy Clinton has told us in connection with County Dublin, for instance, when they come to allocate schemes in a particular area, say, for instance, in Lucan or Balbriggan, they are dealing with a recommendation of the county medical officer in relation to housing people mainly from that area.  Therefore, the members of the appropriate committees are in a fairly good position to judge whether or not any mistake has been made, or to judge whether information compiled by the medical officer is accurate.</P>
      <P>The situation in Dublin is much more confused.  To start off with, we have in existence areas which have high and low priorities.  I am referring to normal circumstances and I am not dealing with the circumstances which have existed for the past year or two and which have been prejudiced to a great extent because of the existence of the dangerous building situation.  Prior to that there was a situation in Dublin some years ago where a family with one or two children could readily get housed in one area, and yet in another part of the city a family would require to have three, four, five or six children. That is a physical factor, and a confusing factor.  It results from a number of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may result from a desire on the part of some people to live near their place of employment.  For example, it has been noted over a number of years that in the south city there is always a high demand by applicants to be housed in the Ringsend area. Yet, within two or three miles of that area the demand for accommodation has been quite low at times.  This is a particular factor that exists in the city. A few years ago the demand for housing in Ballyfermot was quite low and families of quite small size from overcrowded dwellings could be housed.  That is not the situation today. <Col N="1681" /> A few years ago you could hardly give away a house in Finglas.  That is not the situation today.  This situation continues and varies the whole time.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by Deputy Dowling which I must comment upon is the position of people who may be on a waiting list for a long time.  In some circumstances that can easily be understood.  If I apply to be housed in an area where no building is going on, where it is likely that there will be no building for a long time, and where there is an existing corporation scheme, and only an occasional vacancy, I may wait a long time on that list.  It is a peculiarity of many Dublin Corporation applicants that they apply to be housed in a particular area.  It can happen in the county also.  Someone may apply to be housed in Lucan and there may not be any housing there but there may be houses in Balbriggan or Portrane.  If the applicant does not qualify for housing in those other places, or if he does not put his name down, he will not be considered.</P>
    <P>I think public representatives by and large are mainly concerned to try to ensure that applicants for housing accommodation are treated fairly and equitably.  One of the problems is to make the applicants aware of their rights in a particular scheme.  This is a service which is rendered by public representatives.  The average applicants for a house, or a flat, or a room, will not at all times be fully aware of how the priorities are operating at that moment.  They may be supplied with a statement of what the priorities are. They may be supplied with a statement as to the number of applicants under each heading, but in many cases it is found that the applicants may not realise that if they indicate that they are prepared to accept accommodation in an area other than the area they applied for, they might be housed at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>The problem of local authorities bringing in priority lists will be a major exercise on their part.  One of the aspects of this matter which I should like to see discussed and elucidated much more clearly by the Minister <Col N="1682" /> is how he will deal with priority schemes submitted by the various local authorities that conflict in major respects.  Dublin Corporation may make provision that certain priority should be given to overcrowded or unfit houses, and other local authorities may submit priorities based on the size of the family, or the length of residence in the area.  In that event we may well reach a situation in which there will be a big gap between the priorities laid down.</P>
    <P>The section provides that:</P>
    <P>A scheme under this section, or an amendment to any such scheme, shall be made only with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Allocation schemes are made under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and are clearly supposed to be in accord with those Acts.  The local authorities are required to submit a scheme in detail and can only bring in the scheme when sanction has been given by the Minister.  I think we should get some clarification on that aspect from the Minister.  At present there is no corporation scheme that is being opposed.  The existing scheme was discussed by the housing section in consultation with the assistant city manager.  In fact, it was approved by the city council and while from time to time requests have been made for an examination of the scheme it is still a corporation scheme.</P>
    <P>The carrying out of policy is the responsibility of the city manager and his officials.  As a public representative, my view of the matter is that a scheme should be provided in such a way that, first, the applicants could be dealt with fairly and equitably, and secondly that the policy laid down should be operated by the manager and his officials in accordance with the general terms of the scheme and with a human approach to the problems that arise. I would not like to see a situation in which elected representatives were allocating local authority dwellings.  It would create a most difficult situation, place the local representatives in an impossible position and the people in need of houses would find that they <Col N="1683" /> would have many causes of complaint if, before they could get a house or a flat, they had to depend on the support of local representatives, whether these local representatives were members of political Parties or not.</P>
    <P>There are problems at present, where dwellings are unfit, where applicants can submit medical certificates which show that some members of the family are suffering from a serious disease. I remember a case where an applicant had an operation on the bowel and lived three storeys up in a house in Gardiner Street.  There was no toilet or running water on the landing and the applicant had to have the bowel cleared every three hours.  The medical officer would not certify that the family needed rehousing.  Representations were made on the man's behalf but the medical officer was not prepared to give the certificate that he should be rehoused on medical grounds.  That medical officer was unduly hard.  He was dealing with the case only on the basis that the family did not suffer from tuberculosis and that the dwelling was two-roomed and that there were only three people in the family.</P>
    <P>Similar difficulties arise from time to time in the old age group, difficulties of blood pressure, heart trouble and so on.  Medical certificates are submitted showing that applicants should not climb stairs but the medical officer will not accept that as ground for rehousing.  I could go on interminably about problems arising in this way. Any system of priority should include reference to the medical circumstances of these people.  The Minister might well look at systems which are operated by some local authorities in other places.  There is the system of giving points in respect of dwellings, the size of families, the length of time on the waiting list and so on.  This system might well be introduced in place of the present system.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of allocating houses on a points system is that an applicant would have a reasonable chance of knowing in advance what were his possibilities of being housed. The way the priority scheme operates at the moment is that an applicant <Col N="1684" /> with a wife and three children who might have a reasonable chance of being housed in a month or two may find that his rehousing could be deferred for months because of some minor emergency affecting other people who were not even on the waiting list when his name was put on it.  A man with his wife and three children may have his name down for rehousing in a particular area for twelve months or two years and applicants who were not interested in that particular area at the time he was registered for it may change their minds.  This may be a man and wife and four children and he immediately supersedes the other man.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that officials of local authorities, with some exceptions, would appreciate fairly clear and definite priorities.  It would make their unpleasant job a little better. Many of us who are members of local authorities will have had occasion to complain bitterly that cases of which we have knowledge are not getting the attention they deserve.  It is fair to say that responsible local officials would like to carry out policies in as reasonable and humane a way as possible but they can only deal with the bad cases when they have the houses.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate whether the section which calls for his approval for any scheme is going to be operated in a reasonable way and whether he has any intention of seeing that schemes and priorities are not operated within narrow limits but rather that he is prepared to approve of schemes submitted by local authorities on the basis of the knowledge of these local authorities of the needs in their areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support those who have asked for an extension of the understanding we have of medical necessity.  Apart from the gory details of the cases which have been quoted by Deputy Larkin, one could quote thousands of really frightening cases of human beings living in conditions of appalling discomfort, whose cases are not classified as deserving of housing because of medical necessity.  As far as I know, no official count has been made <Col N="1685" /> of the number of applicants for housing in Dublin which are accompanied by a medical certificate, but I think any member of the House, who is also a member of Dublin Corporation, or is familiar with housing demands in Dublin, will probably agree that it would be no exaggeration to say that at least 50 per cent of the people applying for houses in Dublin can accompany their applications with a medical certificate.  The medical certificate may be in respect of some ailment or disadvantage or some need not regarded as compelling, but nevertheless it is sufficient to justify a qualified medical person in issuing a certificate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Larkin that we need, if we can do it without being unfair to others, to extend the medical facts which should be accepted as deserving of priority.  Some families, by reason of the amount of hospitalisation which they have had, have a <i>prima facie</i> case for getting additional housing accommodation.  If you have families in which members have from time to time to get medical care in hospital, or are in need of constant medical care at home, it might contribute immeasurably to an improvement in their medical condition if they had improved houses, but short of suffering from some highly contagious disease&mdash;such as pulmonary tuberculosis which is the only disease or medical disability spelled out here&mdash;a medical certificate is of little value.</P>
      <P>There are innumerable families in which one or more members are suffering from asthma, or chest or various other respiratory complaints, and the medical doctors will advise in these cases&mdash;and I think we have sufficient general medical knowledge to know&mdash;that people suffering from these complaints ought to have plenty of air while sleeping.  It is utterly impossible to get that, even if you have as few as three people sleeping in one room.  Yet even if there are three people sleeping in a bedroom, they have no prospects of being housed in the city for several years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will argue if I may from a particular case.  I am aware of a case in which a family lived for years in a low-lying area adjacent to a river.  All <Col N="1686" /> the children had been in hospital, most of them on several occasions, because they were suffering from asthma.  The file of these people was thick with medical certificates and certificates from hospitals recommending a change of location to see if that could bring about a change in their medical condition. Because of a factor independent of medical considerations, they ultimately got a house elsewhere and none of those children has since had to get any hospitalisation.  Shortly after they were transferred, their medical complaint cleared up altogether.  This illustrates the need for a wider appreciation of the medical position of applicants.  The code we have at present will not allow either the local authority, or the Minister, to provide for a better understanding of medical necessity, certainly so far as an urban centre like Dublin is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned people suffering from heart complaints who were forced to get out of their existing location because it obliged them to climb heights which put a strain on their hearts.  This is frequently happening. It may in many cases simply require a transfer within the corporation estate to bring about a better level of accommodation but because of the dire shortage a lower level, or a level which would not require climbing, cannot be provided.  There are many people living in privately-owned accommodation at a level far too high for them but at present it does not matter how urgent or compelling is the medical necessity for getting accommodation on ground level.  They have not got a hope of getting it, no matter how many certificates they may get from heart specialists.  The local authority will say, and one can understand why, that they cannot take into consideration domestic rows, upsets, or disagreements between relations.  One can understand easily that if they accepted these things as being a valid reason for obtaining priority, then the best way to get a house would be to develop a row with your mother-in-law.</P>
    <P>There are many cases which can be certified by qualified medical people where difficulties arise, due to the fact <Col N="1687" /> that some member or members of the household are suffering from mental handicap.  There are many cases in which the nerves of people, old or young, can be shattered to the stage where they require constant medical attention by reason of the inadequate housing conditions with which they are faced.  Here again there is a need to try to differentiate between the casually produced row and domestic upheaval and cases of genuine, compelling medical necessity to provide alternative accommodation to relieve distress, cases of bad nerves or mental disturbance.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the solution to these distressing cases is to have a medical committee, or a committee consisting of medical people and people qualified in social and family matters, but somehow or other, I would hope that within the scope of this Bill, or the regulations which may be made, some institution which could command the respect of members of local authorities and the public, would be established to see that in these distressing medical cases we can separate the wheat from the chaff, the genuine from the alleged cases, and achieve a fairer distribution of the housing accommodation which becomes available.  I doubt if anybody who is familiar with the complaints of people looking for houses would disagree with the system if we could humanly achieve it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dowling about how inflexible the present procedure is.  It certainly does not cater for the multitude of conflicting and distressing circumstances which ought be within the consideration of local authorities when houses are being given out.  One of the most distressing things is that at the moment the way in which we measure need is to count the number of heads in a family and count the number of rooms&mdash;I put &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; in inverted commas because I shall come back to them later&mdash;and divide the number of rooms by the number of persons and so you find how many persons or fractions of persons per room there are.</P>
    <P>Some people have been enterprising enough to make palaces out of the <Col N="1688" /> hovels into which they were obliged to go.  People who have divided rooms and have made a very good and presentable job of it find that by so doing and endeavouring to provide temporary relief for some of their problems, they may have postponed the ultimate solution of their problem because what was one room is, because of their enterprise, regarded as two rooms and accordingly their need is halved according to the official regulations which we have at present.  Again, there are cases in which toilets to serve several families in tenement houses are inserted into rooms in which families are living, thereby reducing the accommodation but yet the room which was officially regarded as such prior to the provision of the toilet in it, is still a room so far as rules and regulations go.  These are matters that indicate the need for some flexibility in assessing rooms or units of accommodation.</P>
    <P>A factor which apparently at present cannot be accorded proper weight is the insufficiency of toilets in tenement houses.  Whether an applicant lives in a house with four or five families in which there is only one toilet or in a house where there is a toilet for each family makes no difference as regards what category they go into.  The category will simply be decided by the number of persons per room and the amenities&mdash;necessities is a more accurate description&mdash;do not enter into the assessment or certainly not until a very late stage.  The only point at which they may carry any weight is in determining whether a person will get a house today or in a fortnight's or a month's time.  It does not qualify a person sufficiently far in advance to determine what exactly are the urgent housing requirements.</P>
    <P>While not disturbing the primary needs to which we are directed in this section we should try to give a little weight to the duration of a person's application.  We mortals have not so many decades to live, no matter how long our lives may be and I think it is hardly fair to some applicants to leave them on a waiting list for five, ten or fifteen years.  At present we have people who were married five, six or seven years ago and who then applied for houses still having to stand back <Col N="1689" /> in favour of couples who were married less than five years ago but who, by the grace of God, have larger families. In many cases by the time we can meet the needs of smaller families the children have grown up and gone away. It hardly seems to be distributing the wealth and amenities of this world fairly to condemn some couples to live forever in miserable housing accommodation simply because they have not been gifted with more children than their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Some cases of small families are rather tragic.  I feel I speak not only from my own knowledge but also of what is the experience of other members of Dublin Corporation and other local authorities.  Some cases are tragic in this way that the mothers have had one or more miscarriages because the families are obliged to live high up at the top of an old tenement in flats which have no lifts.  Although some women may produce medical certificates from gynaecologists or family doctors and may produce the certificate in the case of each miscarriage, the person's need for better housing accommodation on the grounds that she cannot be successfully pregnant in her existing housing accommodation does not enter into official reckoning. This is a terribly sad state of affairs and I do not think any member of the House, no matter what his or her Party affiliations may be, would disagree when I say that such people deserve the very special and sympathetic consideration of the House and of anybody who has anything to do with the problem.</P>
    <P>Having said all these things, I can appreciate the difficulty is to provide for them and to recite them accurately and in detail in a section in any piece of legislation but it is desirable that we, as men and women representing the people, should try to see the extent of the problem and try to form under this new Bill a more humane code of priority so that these very compelling and distressing cases can be taken into consideration in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has ever been such unanimity as we have observed this morning among <Col N="1690" /> Deputies including Deputy Ryan, Deputy Larkin, Deputy Tully, Deputy Clinton and others.  We all speak with one voice in this matter of priorities. After a great deal of talk, we find, I think, that the only way to have a perfect system of priorities is to have none at all but to have plenty of houses and do away with priorities.</P>
      <P>There is mention in the Bill of TB cases.  We find in the city that if an applicant for housing has been in a sanatorium and perhaps has had a major operation and a lung removed, he is not given any preference because of that.  Apart from the human suffering this may cause there is also the factor that the treatment of this man has cost so much that it seems wrong to stop short there and allow the man to go back perhaps to an insanitary hovel.  I think we should consider extending post-sanatorium treatment so that this man or woman will be given special consideration because they have had sanatorium treatment.</P>
      <P>A particular case is made here that a person suffering from thrombosis might live at the top of a tenement house and would not get any special consideration.  I am sure that all members who have spoken this morning have helped towards getting a perfect system.  In the Bill it states that the local authority shall have regard to the medical officer's report.  This is quite understandable but how often do we find that doctors will differ on patients' ailments?  We find this frequently in cases where a man is sick for a long time.  He is told by his own doctor that he is fit to return to work but the company's doctor refuses to take him back.  Surely a medical officer might also make a mistake and condemn a man to go on living in bad housing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this which Deputy Clinton mentioned is the matter of local representatives making representations. He rightly said that we have no power in this matter and I do not think this can be stressed too much. There is a fallacious belief in the public mind that, if you know a sufficiently forceful and effective member, your chances of being rehoused are much <Col N="1691" /> better than if you go to a lesser member. Most of us try to stress that the allocation of dwellings is purely a reserved function for the manager, the medical officer and the allocation officer.  If we could clear the public mind of this false impression it would go a long way towards helping people appreciate the true housing position. On the other hand, the Minister mentioned that a local member may have special local knowledge of conditions which the official mind would pass over.  Therefore, I suppose each one of us would feel we should do whatever we can to bring home to the allocation officer or manager the need of a particular case.</P>
    <P>Nowadays health is not one of the greatest factors because the incidence of TB has fallen very much.  I examined the latest list of housing allocation made by the corporation.  Out of a total of 64, only one case was dealt with on health grounds.  The other principal grounds were overcrowding, emergency housing and dangerous buildings.  While I believe that the existing system should be held sacrosanct until it is amended, a few years ago we had the experience of seeing overnight the priority list being cast away because we had such a large number of dangerous buildings to deal with.  I mention that to stress how important it is we should have flexibility in our actions. In that way we could reduce a great deal the sum total of human suffering which is the wake of bad housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moore mentions the desirability for flexibility but there is one aspect of housing on which I should like to see a very rigid attitude. It concerns houses or rooms in tenement houses that have been declared unfit for human habitation.  Subsequently, the landlords come along and rent the rooms that have been closed and even charge key money for them.  They take advantage of the position of young married people in this housing emergency over the past two and a half years.  These young people, who have nowhere else to go, are placed in the position by these unscrupulous landlords of having to pay <Col N="1692" /> £10, £25, and even £50 key money for a room in a tenement house that has been declared unfit for human habitation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind was this.  The local authority have to rehouse the people coming from rooms in houses declared unfit for human habitation, but the problem does not decrease.  They find they are confronted with the same problem again by this action of people re-letting rooms which have been declared unfit for human habitation.  We find in Dublin Corporation that this adds considerably to the swelling of the waiting list.  No appropriate action is taken by the local authority or the Minister to ensure that this practice is discontinued.  I should like the Minister to give serious consideration to the fact that there are people who are prepared to make money out of the misery and suffering of others and it is the duty of the Minister to ensure that adequate penalties are imposed on people who take advantage of the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin top priority is given to people who have been removed from dangerous buildings.  Under the present system a notice is served by the corporation when there is a defect in a building, but that could be a very small defect which could be easily remedied.  For example, it could be a crack in a back wall or something wrong with a chimney.  This can only <Col N="1693" /> be dealt with under the present law by the corporation actually serving a notice on the owner of the building that it is a dangerous building and requiring him to have certain repairs and structural alterations made.</P>
    <P>If&mdash;and this is by no means an uncommon practice&mdash;the landlord sees an opportunity of de-tenanting a house, demolishing it and having a valuable site to dispose of at a handsome profit, he takes advantage of this defect in our law.  It has happened time and again that, while the corporation were swamped with applications for houses, they were compelled to serve notice stating that a building was dangerous because minor repairs might be necessary and the landlord, suitably advised by his solicitor, refused to comply with the corporation's request, even though the cost of the repair might be only £5 or £10.  On the basis of the notice served on him by the corporation that the building is dangerous, he proceeds to get a court order and removes all the tenants from the building.  He then does one of two things.  He either demolishes the building and sells the site at a considerable profit or carries out repairs and relets the premises at an enhanced rent.  The situation is very serious in Dublin.  Having been made aware of it, I believe the Minister will now give consideration to it and ensure that adequate steps are taken to prevent a continuance of this despicable practice by unscrupulous people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Cluskey has said.  This is a problem that faces all local authorities and it often results in delay in the rehousing of applicants.  The local authority are always reluctant to remove families out of such dwellings because they know that the landlord will replace them with other families. We call this &ldquo;jumping the queue&rdquo; in Cork.  I think local authorities have power to forbid a landlord to permit this overcrowding, but something positive will have to be done to cope with the situation.  I know families who comply with all the regulations governing rehousing but the fear is that, if they are rehoused, the same position will recur immediately in the premises <Col N="1694" /> they have vacated.  We are not the only local authority faced with this problem and something very definite will have to be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The system in operation, particularly in the rural areas, is satisfactory.  I am a member of a local authority and I have some experience of priorities in County Mayo.  When a county council house or cottage becomes vacant, a notice appears in the paper and there are a number of applications.  The local medical officer is consulted.  Local medical officers know the people. Quite often they consult the local councillors to find out who is the most deserving applicant.  The manager then, acting on the advice of the county MOH, who gets his report from the local medical officer, makes a decision. In the meantime local representatives have an opportunity of making their representations.  If they are not satisfied they can raise the matter at a county council meeting by way of question. We do that in Mayo under our standing orders.  That is a far safer system than transferring the power to the local elected representatives, who could not agree on an issue like this naturally.  In a rural area where everybody knows everyone else, if a county councillor failed to get a house for an applicant, he would be in real trouble. The majority of our people realise that a county councillor has no power in selecting tenants.  If a county councillor is dissatisfied, and if he is a member of this House, he can raise the matter here.  If he is not a member of this House, he can raise it at local authority level.  Generally speaking, these things are done on a very fair basis, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice has grown up of vesting cottages.  Suppose a son who resides with his parents gets married, and looks for a house, the local authority, realising his problem, particularly if he is a labouring man, provide him with a house.  He pays his rent.  Then the parents die and the parents' house, a substantial dwelling, falls vacant. The son goes back to live in it and proceeds to sell the local authority house, subsidised by the general body of rate-payers, <Col N="1695" /> with which he was provided when he got married.  He sells it and makes perhaps £400 or £500 on some poor devil who is forced into making a deal with him.  I do not say abuses of this nature are many in number, but they do occur.  Steps should be taken to stop that type of abuse.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that part of the problem here in the City of Dublin arises from the fact that so many people are coming in here from towns adjacent and from rural areas.  People, like Bord na Móna, build houses and they can get nobody to take them.  This may not be absolutely relevant, but I think if something could be done to provide work for people in rural areas, there would be tenants for these houses and that would reduce the problem in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>This section will place a duty on housing authorities to make a scheme of priorities for the letting of housing accommodation within their own areas.  Deputy Cluskey was dealing with matters that will be dealt with at a later stage. There would seem to be no point in replying to them at this stage because they will arise on later sections.  This is a new provision, a new approach to our letting system.  Heretofore, the letting of houses was a matter determined, if you like, by way of regulation by the Minister.  Under this section each local authority, the elected representatives, will draw up their own priorities having regard to certain defined categories and it will then be a matter for the manager to implement their scheme.  At any time they can request the manager to inform them <Col N="1696" /> before he appoints a tenant of what he proposes to do and if they are not satisfied they can by resolution insist that their priority scheme is adhered to.  It is a new provision and something that most local authorities will welcome. A great deal has been said on the section.  A number of the points raised by Deputies relate strictly to other sections and there is no point in replying to them now.</P>

      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a) In a case where any person unlawfully enters or occupies any dwelling or building or any part thereof which has become vacant by operation of law or otherwise, the authority may require the said person to vacate the dwelling or building or any part thereof and remove his property (if any).</P>
      <P>(b)  If a person does not comply with the requisition or notice duly served by a housing authority, the District Court, on the application of the authority, may by order direct the person to comply with the requisition within such period specified in the order as the Court may direct.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 63 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (b), there is covered a situation where conditions:</P>
      <P>are such that the free air space in any room used as a sleeping apartment, for any person is less than four hundred cubic feet (the height of the room, if it exceeds eight feet, being taken to be eight feet, for the purpose of calculating free air space), and &ldquo;overcrowding&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Surely it is considered desirable, at this stage, that there should be another look at this question of overcrowding of a cubic capacity and where this 400 cubic feet of free air space is inadequate from one point of view, the area to constitute overcrowding for this particular purpose might well be increased beyond 400 cubic feet in respect of each individual.  We are all aware that this has been the standard, and it was adopted by the medical authorities.  It does not take into account the very human factors that arise in relation to the occupancy of a single room.  Many years ago the situation was that it had to be 400 cubic feet per person.  At that time there was no limitation as to height.  The room could be 14 feet high and for the purpose of considering whether it was overcrowded, the air space with a ceiling of 14 to 16 feet was taken into account.  For a number of years very serious overcrowding took place and then a change was introduced, and even though it was belated, it was welcome.  When considering whether a room was overcrowded a ceiling of eight feet was taken into account. There was a further change.  When considering whether a room was overcrowded inanimate objects such as furniture were excluded.  The average height of the ceiling of modern dwellings is around eight feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with overcrowding in tenement rooms and multiple dwellings. Even allowing a ceiling of eight feet, you can have a father and a mother and two children living in that room and they may well have&mdash;if <Col N="1704" /> they are lucky&mdash;running water and a gas stove or some means of cooking. In that case the family will not be considered to be overcrowded if the room exceeds 1,600 cubic feet.  I think this 1,600 cubic feet is too low.  Even if it were 2,000 cubic feet, it could still be considered to be overcrowded. The application of the 400 cubic feet per person is too rigid and it does not take into account the fact that in dealing with overcrowding, you are not dealing with families living in separate dwellings, or flats, but to a great extent with families living in one room or in a partitioned room.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say if there is any possibility of having that matter re-examined.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the section provides that when the number of persons:</P>
    <P>are such that any two of those persons, being persons of twelve years of age or more of opposite sexes and not being persons living together as husband and wife, must sleep in the same room, or</P>
    <P>Having regard to the earlier development of boys and girls in our country, there appears to be a case for reducing that qualification of 12 years of age to somewhere around ten years of age, because for the purposes of this section, the sex of the children is not taken into account in regard to overcrowding, and a boy and girl of around 11 years of age may be sleeping in the one room.  In the circumstances I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that, having regard to the earlier development of children in this country like other countries, the time has come for a re-examination of that qualification set out in paragraph (a) of section 63.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the definition of &ldquo;overcrowding&rdquo;. I gather the point raised by Deputy Larkin is in relation to a single room dwelling.  We say here that a dwelling of less than 400 cubic feet per person would not be classified as a fit dwelling. The Deputy's point was whether that 400 cubic feet is determined when the room is empty or making allowance for furniture.  Is that the point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was settled providing that the ceiling level was eight feet.  I said that a particular room may also include some means of cooking such as a gas stove, or an electric stove, or an open fire.  Surely for the purpose of deciding on overcrowding, 1,600 cubic feet is not sufficient.  Even in those circumstances if there were 500 cubic feet per person that should be considered to be overcrowding.  A father and mother and two children may live in a single room of 1,500 cubic feet and technically be not overcrowded.</P>

Suppose, for instance, there are two rooms and one is used as a living room, where the cooking, washing and other chores are done during the day time, and they sleep in the other room at night.

      <P>It would not be said they were not overcrowded because a place could be found for a bed for one of the children at night time in the room which was used as a living room in the day time?  Perhaps when he is replying the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with that point.  I think it is important that there should be a reduction of the age of the children from 12 years to ten years, perhaps.  It is a well-known fact that today children are much more advanced than they were some years ago, due to television and various other communications that bring them into touch with these things.  I think a case must be made for reducing the age from 12 years to ten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is looking for a great deal of machinery from a local authority that is not there at the present time if he thinks that this kind of loose phrasing can cover the position? There is gross overcrowding in many areas in this city and the matter of overcrowding is very far down in the <Col N="1707" /> corporation's priority list.  At the moment five in a room is the situation they are dealing with and I have come across cases where people in two rooms were badly caught for accommodation. I think this phrasing looks at the matter in too cold and too scientific a manner and does not take into account the problems with which we are all familiar.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this does not give local authorities a standard to which to live up in the matter of space. There is the question of the furniture in the room, the size of the fireplace, the cooking facilities, the ages of the children and so on, and then there is the overall problem that the local authorities are not staffed sufficiently well to keep a proper check on the overcrowding position.  It does not strike me that this clause will improve the position as it is now.  It seems to me to have been phrased badly and I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what difference there is between this section as compared with the similar section in the previous Act?</P>

The reason for the change is that under subsection 66(13) a notice becomes operative after 21 days from the time of service.  It might happen that service could not be effected for some time after the date of issue of the notice and a person might receive a notice requiring him to do something without giving him sufficient time.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that even the 28 days is sufficient?  We all know what happens when a house is condemned. Somebody applies for a new house and it often happens that an owner may have allowed a tenant in as a matter of temporary convenience. <Col N="1709" /> There is also the case of very many old people who do not appreciate what is meant in a letter from the county council quoting a statute.  I would like some better method of ensuring that owners of property are aware of the situation which arises when a house is condemned.</P>
      <P>I have in mind a case in which a house was condemned by a local authority and a rather slick auctioneer sold it to an unfortunate woman who spent £300 in putting it into proper repair and then the local authority came along and took the roof off. Certain things must be done to ensure that people know what is meant when they receive a notice that a house is to be condemned.  I have no sympathy with a person who contrives to let a house which has been condemned to a person who gets what is known as the golden key in some areas.  The one way in which a tenant was able to get possession of a vacant house or cottage was by getting this key and very large sums of money have been paid out for this purpose.  I should like to see this dealt with in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in relation to the 66.66 per cent subsidy on loan charges payable to housing authorities under the Housing Acts, he is aware that in relation to a housing scheme of 88 houses (particulars supplied) the loan charges for the year ended 31st March 1963 were £4,442 and the State subsidy was £475 (9.5 per cent); and if he will state why the 66.66 per cent was not paid in that year in respect of that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The 88 houses referred to by the Deputy form part of a scheme of 827 houses provided by the Dublin County Council about 1948 to which the then maximum subsidy rate of 60 per cent of subsidisable loan charges applies.</P>
      <P>In 1962-63 the total subsidy paid on the 827 house scheme amounted to £10,840.  The proportion of this amount applicable to the 88 houses would be approximately £1,152.  In addition to the annual subsidy the local authority got a grant of £396 per house from the Transitional Development Fund towards the capital cost of providing the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that if houses are built in a local authority area over a number of years, at some stage the 66? per cent grant is reached?  Is he also saying that grants given to a local authority for the erection of houses are charged against the amount of loan in order to allow it to be reduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available.  On the basis of a cross-section of tenders approved in the present year, averages of £2,747 and £2,153 have been calculated for 5-roomed houses in Dublin city and elsewhere, respectively.  The highest prices approved for 5-roomed houses in these areas in the same period were £2,872 and £2,503 respectively.</P>
      <P>There is no information available in my Department as to the average price charged for houses other than those provided by housing authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in <Col N="1729" /> view of the tender prices which have been secured by housing authorities in 1965, he will sponsor a campaign to encourage housing authorities to build and offer houses at cost to persons who would not normally qualify for a local authority house in order that houses may be provided at a minimum cost and to promote activity in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility of housing authorities is to satisfy existing and future requirements of persons in need of rehousing who are not in a position to provide their own housing accommodation.  In so far as private housing is concerned effective measures have already been taken by me, and further steps are proposed in the new Housing Bill to encourage and maintain, with the co-operation of housing authorities, a high level of activity in the private housing sector of the construction industry and to secure all possible economies in the cost of private housing. Indications to date are that demands for new house grants in the private sector are continuing at a very high level and it is anticipated that the record number of allocations for such grants which was reached last year, will be exceeded in the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 relating to the acquisition of land in development areas, are in fact, unoperative mainly because the local authorities are unable to raise sufficient money to pay compensation; and if he will introduce alternative remedial legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, does not in itself confer any new acquisition powers on local authorities. Section 10 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, as amended by section 11 of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, enables local authorities to acquire land by agreement or compulsorily or the purpose of any of their powers, functions or duties.  Section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946, enables local authorities to acquire land by agreement in advance of need although the exact purpose for which the land is to be used has not been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> I am satisfied that these powers are idequate for all purposes but I am aware that they are not being effectively availed of by all local authorities.  If some local authorities fail to use their powers of advance acquisition in development areas until the costs of such acquisition are inflated by development pressures, this is not due to any defect in the acquisition powers.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act has made a number of important changes of benefit to local authorities in the rules governing compensation on compulsory acquisition, for whatever purpose.  Thus under the Act no account may be taken in determining compensation of the existence of proposals for development of the land, or any other land, by a local authority, or of the possibility or probability of such development, but regard must be had to any contribution which a planning authority would have required as a condition of the development of the land.  Such contribution may be required towards, among other things, any expenditure incurred by the local authority in respect of works which have facilitated proposed development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the following case?  A local authority which urgently required land for houses was offered such land by a religious order.

      <P>Every person who again became compulsorily insurable for the full range of benefits available under the Social Welfare Acts following the raising of the income limit has been credited with employment contributions for a period sufficient to render him immediately eligible for unemployment, disability and treatment benefits.  The contributions so credited will not, however, reckon for the purposes of widows' and orphans' contributory pensions or old age contributory pensions, as title to those benefits could have been preserved on a voluntary basis.  Persons who failed to become voluntary contributors will not re-establish title to the benefits mentioned until they have paid sufficient employment contributions to satisfy the statutory conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question was in receipt of disability benefit up to 21st October, 1965, when, following examination by a medical referee he was found capable of work and payment of benefit was stopped by decision of a deciding officer.  An appeal against that decision has been received and in accordance with normal procedure a second medical referee examination has been arranged.  This will take place tomorrow. As soon as the medical referee's report is available, everything will be done to ensure that a final decision on this case will be given without delay.</P>
      <P>The examination by a specialist to which the Deputy refers took place on 21st July, 1965, in connection with a previous appeal, which was decided by an appeals officer in favour of the appellant.  It did not determine the insured person's health condition for a later period.</P>

He is depending solely on the goodwill of the local shopkeepers to give him the necessaries of life for his wife and family.  Shortly afterwards he was called before a medical referee who recommended him as fit for work. It is very hard to understand how a specialist could say he was unfit for work and then a medical referee say he was fit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that, in the case of a person (name supplied) in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension, upon receipt of an increase in her pension as widow of a Garda her social welfare pension was reduced by an amount in excess of the increase in her Garda widow's pension; and if he will take steps to ensure that the actions of his Department do not, as in this case, offset and more than offset any increase in other types of pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not as suggested by the Deputy.  As he was informed in a letter dated 29th October, 1965, the widow in question <Col N="1737" /> was overpaid widow's non-contributory pension amounting to £12 15s. 0d. in the period October, 1964, to September, 1965, because of the issue to her of a pension book at the wrong rate. This amount is being recovered at the rate of 5/- a week from the pension now payable to her.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a reduction in her widow's non-contributory pension in excess of the increase in her Garda widow's pension.  Such a reduction is expressly forbidden by section 15 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1961.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are six farmers living within a one-mile radius of that holding whose valuations average £15? For the life of me, I cannot see why this 30-acre farm should be sold to this gentleman, considering these six farmers are living in poverty and need this land very badly.  Furthermore, of these 30 or 40 acres, there are only eight acres of arable land.  What use could such a 30-acre farm be to the purchaser in that particular locality?</P>

With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, if there are a number of uneconomic holders in the area, it would appear to me that eight acres of arable land would be of very little benefit to them.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Labour Court, although working in two divisions, is operating months behind an acceptable schedule; and if, in view of the decision announced in Dáil Éireann on 3rd November, 1965, which will operate to reduce the Court to one division for four months, he will introduce a one section Bill to increase the membership of the Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that parties bringing disputes before the Labour Court are finding that the Court is operating months behind a schedule acceptable to them.  If the Deputy will furnish details of specific cases, I shall look into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that there is very considerable delay in having a case heard before the full Court even though the Court is working in two divisions and in view of the fact that the proposed salary-freeze commission will be using some of the personnel from the Labour Court does it not follow that the position will become progressively worse?  Will the Minister not make some inquiries from the Labour Court about this matter and see if it is necessary to introduce the legislation which has been suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made all the inquiries I need make.  There are very few complaints from unions about delay and there are no delays of the length the Deputy suggests in the question. As to the use of personnel of the <Col N="1744" /> Court, I understand from the Minister for Finance that he intends inviting representative members, not the chairman and vice-chairman, of the Court. So that, since the main burden of work and investigation and formulation of recommendations falls on the chairman and vice-chairman it is not expected that the absence of representative members on other work will aggravate delays already existing.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that there are only six members &mdash;two chairmen, two employers and two workers&mdash;who sit on the full-time Courts.  Will he not agree that delays of six to ten months in the fixing of a date for important cases affecting thousands of workers are delays which should not occur?</P>

They are quite free to change the order of business in any case which may seem to them to be of particular urgency but they have very few complaints from unions about delays of this kind.

      <P>Sketch plans were received in my Department from the Town of Tralee Vocational Education Committee in August, 1965.  The plans related to a proposed apprentice training centre in connection with the Technical School, Tralee.  There are, however, wider implications since the proposals envisage a considerable expansion of the centre in the future. These implications are being considered in relation to the establishment of regional technical colleges generally. I expect to be in a position to communicate <Col N="1753" /> with the committee soon in this matter.</P>

While agreeing with the Minister's thesis of establishing parochial schools, does he realise that the frequency with which he is making the kind of answer he made today is beginning to create suspicion?  Is this not being used as an alibi for not building schools at all?  Is this part of the Taoiseach's withdrawal of educational facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me Deputy <Col N="1754" /> Dillon would like to have it both ways in this matter.  He has regularly and consistently advocated in the House the policy which I am implementing but he is now trying to get a little political kudos out of it for which there is no basis at all.</P>
      <P>There is no question whatsoever of any cutting back on school building and using this policy as an alibi, as Deputy Dillon put it.  The Deputy must realise that to tackle this problem in the first place, one must start with the schools which are about to be built. There is no point in building schools on the one hand, and then saying we should not be building them.  The logical step is to start with the schools that are due to be built.  The reply to which the Deputy has referred relates to schools which are in the pipeline and about to be built.  We have investigated in each case what should be done in the circumstances, and in some cases we decided that the building should be proceeded with, and in others that it would seem that the educational interests of the children would require us not to go ahead with building, but to amalgamate.  There are various possibilities open to us in each case, and we deal with them after consultation with the managers concerned. There is no question whatsoever of there being any use made of this policy to cover up anything else in any way.</P>

A proposal has been before the Minister's Department for some time requesting an inspector to come to the committee and talk about this problem, but the committee have not even had the courtesy of a reply from the Department, although they have written three times.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section because it represents a great improvement in the method of dealing with unfit houses.  I have seen several instances of unfit houses being demolished and these were houses that could have been made use of in another way than for human habitation. This section makes provision for the carrying out of limited repairs so that a house can be occupied for a limited period of time or turned into a store or shed, if not required for living purposes.  It may be possible to turn half of the building into limited accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been dealing with this matter in a more humane way in County Meath where every opportunity is given to a person who has received a demolition order to sign a document to the effect that he will use the building only as a store or a shed.  My objection to the present system is that elderly people who are not well acquainted with the law and receive a notice of demolition from the local authority do not understand that they are being asked to make a case as to why the demolition order should not be carried out.  They assume that it is a demolition order and that they can do nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also cases which frequently arise throughout the country in which single people or an elderly man and woman would be able to live in houses which are unfit for habitation by a family.  There are single people who would not normally qualify for housing and it should be possible to accommodate them in premises which would be unfit for habitation by a family but <Col N="1770" /> which can be made suitable for limited accommodation.  If that could be arranged, it would be a more humane approach to the whole matter.  I know of cases where this has happened but the local authority has either had to close their eyes to the breach of the regulations or the person who has taken up the accommodation has made himself liable to a heavy fine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that within the terms of the section the sort of variation mentioned by Deputy Tully is capable of being done and that limited repairs to a house could be initiated and carried out, if necessary, up to a particular given standard.  There are cases where the house might be really unfit but where that condition would be more related to its being overcrowded and such cases would be best related to the overcrowding provision rather than to the unfit provision.  It would seem to be dealt with in the earlier section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only portion of the problem.  There is also the problem of the house that can be put into habitable condition in some way. There may be the house that could be made habitable for a single person or for two people.  That would mean locking up the remaining portion of the house and I have not found anything in the section that would cover such a position.  If a house can be made habitable for limited accommodation by not more than two persons, it should be possible for some provision to be made to enable this to be done.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of a house which has been condemned and which has been repaired by somebody who has bought it from a slick auctioneer. Something ought to be done to prevent such a house being demolished.  I know a case of where a substantial sum of money was spent in repairing such a house and the local authority came along and took the roof off, even though the house was then in a fit state of repair, simply because the demolition order was there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully has referred to a matter of real consequence where demolition orders or notices are <Col N="1771" /> served on elderly people who become confused and do not know their true position and their rights of appeal and rights of review.  I do not know if this falls within the functions of the Minister, but I suggest that it would not be an unreasonable burden to place on local authorities that one of their officers should call on the persons to be dispossessed and inform them of their rights.  We overcame this difficulty in the Department of Agriculture in dealing with the land reclamation project by so formulating the application form as to ensure that an officer of the Department would call on the applicant and explain his position to him.</P>
      <P>We felt it was impossible for ordinary people to meet the requirements of bureaucracy and we found it a successful procedure to formulate the application form in such a way that the officer of the Department called on the people concerned.  In this case it is more reasonable to ask the local authority to call on the ratepayer than to inform the elderly rate-payers that they may call on the local authority.  The ratepayer is the master of the local authority and we are getting too much into the habit of asking him to call on the local authority instead of the local authority calling on him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal to be said for what Deputy Dillon has said.  He speaks from experience of rural Ireland and what he has said can be equally relevant as far as urban Ireland is concerned.  The fact that they have not to travel long distances does not overcome the lack of understanding of elderly people affected by the edicts of local authorities.  I am certain from my knowledge both as a public representative and in my professional activities that many hundreds of people were evicted from unfit houses in this city within the past few years who could have obtained compensation in the courts or elsewhere, if they had known their rights, but the local authority was concerned only with wielding whatever legislative powers it had, or believed it had, and in consequence, the rights of the people were trampled upon.  Now many people are really destitute and <Col N="1772" /> without adequate shelter because we failed to allow the public authority to communicate to the people the rights which they had.</P>
      <P>The glib answer of course is that every person should consult his or her lawyer when in difficulty, but people have as much reluctance about going to a lawyer as they have about going to a dentist or a doctor.  Even if they did, they might find that the processes of law open to them were costly and long and not one an impecunious person could undertake.  If we are ...giving powers to local authorities to evict people from property, or to oblige people to do so, we have an equal right to concern ourselves with the rights of individual tenants.</P>
      <P>I notice that subsection (17) says that notwithstanding safeguards which Oireachtas Éireann has given to the small people of this country under the Landlord and Tenants Acts, 1931 and 1958, and the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, those safeguards will have no application where local authorities seek to enforce section 66 of this Bill. I suppose the answer I will get is that this does not deny to a person the remedies for compensation or otherwise which may be available in those Acts.  I say that that does not go far enough.  I speak with some little experience. I am convinced that the effect of this will be that we will force many people to suffer hardship which at the moment the remainder of our law prevents them from suffering.  I am also convinced that the effect of this section and of this subsection will be that many property owners will deliberately allow their property to run down and become unfit because by so doing they can hope to avoid obligations under the Landlord and Tenant Acts and the Rent Restrictions Acts.  In future, if you are anxious to get hold of your own property without danger, the thing to do will be to remove the roof, or part of the roof, and it will then become unfit.  No simpler remedy could be made available to unscrupulous landlords under this section and under the Second Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that account, I would plead with the Minister to try to tighten up this section.  There are between 1,700 and <Col N="1773" /> 2,000 words in this section alone.  I shudder to think how long it would take our superior courts to interpret this section but I do not think it would take any unscrupulous property owner very long to realise that the section gives him freedom to take advantage of an unfortunate tenant by allowing the property to run down so that it will become unfit and a demolition order will be made.  The result of all this will be that our second stage will be very much worse than the first.  Section 66 requires that a housing authority shall declare properties to be unfit if they so find them.  I am not certain whether the same obligation exists in present legislation, but I am satisfied that there are unfit dwellings in this city at present which are not being so declared because the authority do not wish to have more people on the public conscience than they already have.</P>
    <P>For years we avoided the problem created by dangerous buildings by deliberately not condemning the buildings as dangerous.  The result was the appalling calamities we had and the appalling situation which we have suffered from for some years past.  We are going to create a similar position in regard to unfit dwellings.  Unless we resume the lead we previously had and maintain the same rigid standards, we will not know how many we need to replace.  On that account, while I am saying it is necessary to deal with the problem of unfit dwellings, to declare them unfit when you find them, and to deal with them, we should, while trying to achieve that particular goal, not give an instrument to unscrupulous property owners to take advantage of legislation to eject from their premises tenants who under other legislation would have a right to remain there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the suggestion which Deputy Ryan has made, I would say that in so far as it is possible for the local authority officials to convey the sort of information which the Deputy seems to feel is needed for occupiers affected by a closing order or a demolition order, I can see no objection whatever to the Minister for Local Government recommending and/or ordering the local <Col N="1774" /> authority to have their officials, where possible, give this information in whatever way it can be put across, to benefit the people concerned.  It will clarify what they might have to do, or what assistance they may hope to get, and in the case of demolition orders, what rights they have.  I have no objection to doing that by way of recommendation or request to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Ryan's further point, I should like to take him up on the suggestion that section 66 will facilitate unscrupulous property owners to come in and take the roof off a house in order that its condition would become such that either the people would leave it or, under application to the local authority, it would be condemned.  I cannot imagine taking a roof off an otherwise sound house, particularly in the city, as being a sensible operation.  If such did happen for any selfish motive, then clearly the local authority would come along and say: &ldquo;You must put that roof on that structurally sound house and make it fit for human habitation again.&rdquo;  I do not think the exercise would be profitable in that event to the property owner.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the reason is such that in fact it is right that it should be taken down, whatever may be the motives of the property owner in taking the roof off, it may be that he is doing the residents of the house a good turn, if, for instance, it is dangerous and likely to cause damage in the future.  I should say to Deputy Ryan and others that if the local authority are not operating various other sections of this Bill, there is little use in our providing power for them to do this or that.  If they failed to avail of their powers up to now, not a great deal could be done by the central Government to change the position but under this section Deputies will find we can protect tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government may in future, if he finds there is reason to do so, go into a local authority area and do any of these jobs he feels they are neglecting and that require to be done in the interests of the community.  This section could deal with the odd case where a local <Col N="1775" /> authority might not be performing their duties to the community but it is unlikely to be required because I do not think any of us would want to give these various powers to local authorities if we were not convinced that the local authorities will not only operate them but actually want them in order to do certain things they may not so readily do at the moment.  If the necessity arises, this section can answer the call, if something is being neglected by a local authority.  After due notice and warning have been given by the Minister, he may move in and do the job apportioning the cost between the local authority and the State as the job would fall to be paid for if the local authority had done it. Generally, we can rely on local authorities to carry out the law in the terms we provide here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's anxiety and earnest desire to deal with unscrupulous people but it seems that what come to light here are obligation and entitlement.  Certainly, some landlords have been found who do not face up to their obligations and do not realise them, and the tenant is often quite ignorant of his entitlement. As regards taking the roof off a house, three cases come to my mind where the landlord did not do a good turn to the occupants.  He persisted in gradually removing the roof with a view to getting the people to leave. When he did not succeed, he took the roof off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one case a couple of young children were in the room off which the roof was taken.  That family did not get accommodation because it transpired that the person whom the tenants knew as the landlord had sold the property some 18 months earlier and the new landlord did not make it known that he had come in.  When the tenants were put out, Dublin Corporation refused them accommodation, having particular regard to the shortage of accommodation.  I should like the Minister to assure the House that the section we are now dealing with will make it possible to deal with such landlords, bearing in mind that a local authority may be as earnest as <Col N="1776" /> possible in trying to ensure that the law is carried out but they are only a small band of men.  If the penalties were stronger, we might get some place.</P>
    <P>We should do something positive about what are described as illegal tenants in unsafe houses.  A considerable number of people in desperate need of accommodation are taking small rooms, unaware that the house in which the room exists has been previously condemned. In some cases they have been found in occupation for 18 months or two years and when it comes to the time to declare the building dangerous, it is discovered they should never have been there, but nobody has told them. This has happened in a number of cases and in some cases rents have been collected from them.  Is the Minister satisfied that under this section that type of case can be dealt with, so that we shall not have unscrupulous landlords encouraging people to reside in such houses in the full knowledge that they are doing wrong?  I am aware that the landlord can be prosecuted but the fine is only nominal and he can continue doing it.  My colleague, Deputy Cluskey, did a good deal to unmask a certain type of operator known as the Rachman of Dublin in this city but he is still operating.  I trust this section will put him out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What worries me is that if, at the moment, a landlord's property has got into a bad state, he may need vacant possession in order to put it right.  He may do that of his own volition or perhaps the tenant will issue proceedings against the landlord who is responsible for exterior repairs and for making the property wind and watertight.  The landlord may say in court: &ldquo;I will do these repairs as they are my obligation.&rdquo;  In either case, the interests of the tenant will be protected, and although the tenant will be required to vacate the premises during the period of the work, his right to return after that will be reserved.  Alternatively, if the landlord wants to get permanant vacant possession of the property, he must compensate the tenant.  Under this section a landlord may sit back and do nothing until the <Col N="1777" /> local authority steps in.  Once that happens, the remedies of a right to return to occupation or a right to compensation are automatically closed by this subsection (17).  That is what worries me.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that the right to compensation is not automatically removed by this subsection but one can reasonably foresee people instituting claims for compensation in respect of disturbance under the Landlord and Tenant Act or the Rent Restrictions Act and the defence will recite in their defence that subsection (17) is a complete answer to the claim for compensation or the claim for occupation. There is nothing in the Bill, as far as I can see, which would prevent that being a valid defence.  I should like the Minister to look at it to ensure that this section will not be used to remove the kind of protection that we here should be providing for the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's observations, sections 67 and 68 give an amount of protection against what the Deputy says he fears.  Under section 67 the local authorities are being empowered to affix notices to property already condemned and other property on which they have served notice.  Section 68 makes it an offence for the landlord to allow the re-use or habitation of a dwelling already cleared under any of the operations under previous sections.</P>
      <P>Further, in section 110 there is an obligation on the landlord letting rooms and such lesser accommodation at a fairly low rent&mdash;a rent not exceeding £130 per year is mentioned&mdash;to have the property at the time of the letting in a fair state of repair, and that obligation will remain on the landlord to keep it in a fair condition in the future.  When we come to those sections, there may be some changes we would wish to make.  I merely refer to them to allay the fears expressed by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go with the Minister this far.  Section 110 deals with tenancies which may commence after the Act comes into operation, but it does not deal with the hundreds of <Col N="1778" /> existing tenancies in controlled dwellings. I think the number of controlled tenancies which will arise in the future will be very few indeed compared with all those now existing. If property owners can get possession of their property now, they will see to it the premises are not controlled.  They will put in a few sticks of furniture and convert them into uncontrolled tenancies.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the question of notice.  I wonder if in certain cases this might not be a very harsh way of serving a notice that might have to be observed within a short time.  There are many houses in remote parts of the country on which a notice could be affixed for a long time and the owner might not see it and it might not be fair to expect him to see it.  He might have gone to England or elsewhere for employment.  It would not be fair that he should find himself involved in the payment of expenses for demolition he knew nothing about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say on the previous section, in relation to the serving of these notices, that he would be prepared to recommend to local authorities that, as far as possible, they would get somebody from the local authority to call on the people concerned rather than send a notice to them in this vague way and, in many cases, frighten the life out of them.  In County Dublin, it has been <Col N="1779" /> the practice for a long time to serve a demolition order on a family where the intention was to house them, but say nothing to them about the latter. Perhaps a housing scheme was practically ready for allocation, but they just saw the demolition order and nothing else.  Unless they had a local representative to whom they could turn, they feared they were going to be put out on the road.  This has caused much distress and concern because people did not understand what was involved.  I hope the Minister will not neglect to advise local authorities &mdash;and I hope it will be compelling advice&mdash;to be more considerate in the manner in which they tackle this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if an official goes out and explains the matter, it will solve much of the problem. The section, as it stands, is fairly loosely worded.  A notice might be on a dwelling for some time and might not be discovered, or else might be taken down.  If that is the only way of passing along the information, I think it is rather slipshod.  There are a lot of roofless houses and the wrong one might come under the hammer.  The Minister has agreed to advise local authorities to send somebody out, but I assume the present system of sending notices by registered post will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the present procedures will have to go on, but in conjunction with them, we would recommend to local authorities to have some of their officers go to the people concerned, tell them the real effect of the order, what they can do about it and, if it is a matter of repair, what help they can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 67 Deputy Clinton talked about a notice up on a building which might not be seen for a long time by the owner.  The Deputy has taken me up incorrectly.  This section does not deal with the actual power to give notice.  This is a case where a notice has already been served on the owner in relation to demolition or unfitness in which further power is being taken to affix a notice to the property or premises to indicate the <Col N="1780" /> position to any unwary prospective tenant.</P>

      <P>There is one matter to which I referred this morning on which I should like to have the Minister's observations.  A notice is served by a local authority on a landlord because there is some defect in a building. It may be a minor defect, but the wording of the notice is such that the building must be either repaired or taken down.  That is the dangerous building notice.  If the landlord finds that it is more profitable to vacate the premises and demolish the building, subsequently selling the site, that could be a very lucrative exercise for him, if the site were a valuable industrial one.</P>

During the dangerous building scare here in Dublin, a good deal of uneasiness was caused to people in perfectly good houses by other people, who claimed to be officials of Dublin Corporation, coming in and taking a look around, without asking permission from anyone, and subsequently notifying the tenants that the building was in a dangerous condition.  This section suggests something similar can be done in the case of houses occupied by certain people.  This is something about which we should be careful. The responsibility for carrying out the repairs must be carried by the owner of the house and not by anybody else. The Minister would be well advised to have another look at these matters.</P>

      <P>The first point is that of someone on behalf of the owner coming in while the council are actually undertaking certain works. This would only arise subsequent to due notice having been given and the owner failing to comply with the notice and carry out the repairs requested. Only that situation has got to be determined at some point and the council can then go in and do the repairs.  The owner cannot have second thoughts, as it were.</P>

As soon as they disappeared from the scene, he could take his workman away.  A week later the council workmen could return and the very same situation arise.  We are trying to prevent that here.  This can happen only after due process of notice and the owner has failed to comply with that notice and do the repairs requested.  In no other circumstances will it arise.</P>

      <P>I notice that the local authority may sell materials obtained in the course of demolition in order to discharge the cost of doing demolition but may not sell the property itself, not even the cleared site.  Even though they may demolish a substantial structure and the value of the site may be commensurate with the actual cost incurred by local authorities, apparently they may not directly sell the site.  There is a provision all right for the making of an order which may be charged on the property being registered either in the Registry of Deeds or in the Land Registry.  May I take it that once the charge is registered there the local authority may apply to the court or must the local authority await the private sale of the property?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point on the legal side.  I might get some legal advice.  Subsection (8) provides that the local authority in calculating expenses may include costs in relation to proceedings in the district court. Supposing the amount of money they seek to recover is beyond the jurisdiction of the district court is there special provision enabling the local authority to go to the district court and get recovery in the district court even though the amount sought is in excess of the ordinary jurisdiction of the district court?  That may be the case.  I know it is the case in recovery <Col N="1786" /> of Small Dwellings Acquisition Act houses.  In that case the local authority may go to the district court and get an order.  But, it strikes me that difficulties could arise unless it is specifically provided for because a district court is not at present a court of record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (8), expenses and incidental costs are being provided for, but I take it the Deputy's point is that under subsection (2) this would be referable to the district court and that if the costs were of a certain amount, it might be outside the jurisdiction of the district court.  I am afraid I cannot answer that question straight off.  I could say that it is most unlikely, but it still does not answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be unlikely, having regard to the existing jurisdiction of the district court.  I do not know how high it might go.  Costs could run into thousands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something that we will have to clarify for the House.

I do not think it is likely to arise but, if it could, we had better find out about it now.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I should like to find out.  Subclause (d) (i) says:</P>
      <P>a notice under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 70 of this Act, requiring the payment of a rent or a payment in lieu of rent to be made to a housing authority,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>may, within the period ending twenty-one days after the date of the service of the notice, demand or <Col N="1787" /> copy of the order, or after the refusal, as the case may be, appeal to the Circuit Court;</P>
    <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  on an appeal in relation to a demand for the recovery of expenses incurred by a housing authority in doing anything required to be done by a repairs notice or a demolition order, no question shall be raised which might have been raised on an appeal against the notice or order, and</P>
    <P>Subclause (ii) provides:</P>
    <P>no appeal shall lie under paragraph (a) of this subsection in relation to a closing order at the instance of a person who is in occupation of the premises to which the order relates under a lease or agreement of which the unexpired term does not exceed three years.</P>
    <P>This appears to be a little harsh, particularly the first part of the subsection, because it suggests that if somebody in error misses out a point when discussing with the legal official before the order is made or does not discuss the matter at all, if for one reason or another an order is made and it is not properly dealt with, it says here that the appeal can deal only with new evidence.  I suggest that the appeal should allow somebody at a higher level to deal with existing evidence and find whether or not there was a proper decision given on it.  For that reason I think the subsection would have to be amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One could have said four years and one could have said two years.  No matter which number you said there would be a case to be made for moving it up or down, according to one's views.  As the years contract, the interest in the lease becomes so small as to dictate that some sort of termination should be arrived at.  I have suggested three years there, anything within three years.  It could have been two, It could have been four.  There is no hard and fast way in which it could be tied down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose this does not arise at all and a person had a lease and normally the lease is renewed. Is it not as big a hardship on somebody who has only a month or a year or two years as it is on a person who has ten years?  There must be some justice in that.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on the first point I made, that is, about the right to appeal, that only new evidence can be used, no matter what the ground of appeal is?  Does it not follow that if somebody gets a decision, which will in fact be a decision by a local authority, that a certain case they have made is not a valid one and if they feel that the evidence they have is strong enough to entitle them to have the case given in their favour, surely they should be entitled to use that evidence to appeal?  I would suggest that this subsection makes the right of appeal absolutely useless, unless you can think up something new after the order has been made.  I think the Minister should definitely have a look at that because I feel that what we want to avoid is repetition and to make people have an initial discussion or arrangement at the same time.</P>

      <P>and a number of other things&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>may, within the period ending 21 days after the date of the service of the notice, demand or copy of the order, or after the refusal, as the case may be, appeal to the Circuit Court provided that on an appeal in relation to a demand for the recovery of expenses incurred by a housing authority in doing anything required to be done by a repairs notice or a demolition order, no question shall be raised which might have been raised on an appeal against the notice or order</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that in fact what is being said is: &ldquo;You can appeal to the Circuit Court but you cannot use the evidence you have already used, or which you could have used.&rdquo; The Minister says the exact opposite.

      <P>Even allowing the Deputy to get away with that, yes. The council serves its repairs notice, closing order, demolition order or whatever it may be.  At that particular point, as outlined in various sections here, there is a procedure laid down whereby the person aggrieved may make an appeal against the order, the justice of it and so on. If he fails to do that, then all I am saying is that, in regard to the part below which excludes those things, he may appeal only against subsection (c) really, in essence.  Subsection (c) was not read by Deputy Tully to the House at all.  This is what he then really appeals against.  If he wants to appeal against that, he is not being allowed to bring in an appeal as to the justice or equity of the order so served by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised an interesting point there.  He says that the appeal which would lie would be on the question of cost.  I saw the corporation take three months to demolish a house which a strong wind <Col N="1791" /> would have demolished overnight.  It took an unbelievable length of time to demolish it.  Attendant watchmen and attendant machinery were moved in and out.  I have not yet succeeded in finding out the actual cost, but it cost as much to demolish it as it would have cost to rebuild the structure.  If the owner of that property could show extravagance and unnecessary expense by the local authority in demolishing that structure, and if that person could show that a private contractor would cost one-fifth of the cost to the local authority, am I to understand that a successful appeal would lie and the local authority would recover only whatever the appellant could show it would have cost to get a reasonably efficient contractor to do the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine so, and I would certainly hope that in the circumstances the Deputy describes where any local authority workmen, or agents of a local authority, had been wasteful and, wilfully so or otherwise, spent an undue time and therefore an undue amount of money, the aggrieved party would succeed in court in his appeal against undue expenses incurred. If he could show by comparative quotations and the measurement of costs of a related job, whatever it might be, that the cost was exorbitant and brought about by waste or other factors within the control of the corporation or local authority, I would hope he would succeed under this section.  Basically, that is why we have this section in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The section provides that any person aggrieved by &ldquo;a repairs notice, a closing order, a demolition order, or a refusal to determine a closing order&rdquo; may, after the service of the notice, appeal to the court.  A person served with one notice may appeal.  If he fails to make that appeal and the local authority move in, do a job and incur certain expenditure, and he is now aggrieved by the actual cost incurred, we are now saying: &ldquo;You are unable to go to the court and base your case on the fact that the costs are unduly high&rdquo;, and we say at the same time that you cannot go in then and make your case on this appeal that should have been made earlier and which was never made by negligence, default or design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, if I may mention the kind of possible clash under different pieces of legislation, this kind of problem seems to occur.  We may have compulsory demolition.  Based on a compulsory demolition order, the local authority may come in and demolish a structure, and the compensation paid to the owner will be the site value, less the cost of the demolition.  I have experience of a particular case.  As I understand it, the local authority is subject to appeal to the Minister and he is the sole arbiter of the cost of a demolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the instance I have in mind, the person was offered £10 as the value of the site less the cost of demolition, and the person was able to show that he had intended to get the demolition done by a contractor, but he had been ill over the significant period, and omitted to have it done.  If a private contractor had done the job, he would have received about £600 instead of the £10 offered by the corporation because the cost would have been considerably less, and he would also have been given credit for slates, windows, doors and other items of furniture which the corporation simply knocked into rubble and for which they gave him no credit.  After an argument going on for a couple of years, I think it is true to say, the corporation ultimately agreed&mdash;mainly, I suspect for the purpose of getting rid of him&mdash;to <Col N="1793" /> the magnificent sum of £50 as against £600.</P>
    <P>It would now appear that if that kind of thing were done, that person would have the right to get an independent assessment of the average cost of demolition in such cases.  If that is the purpose of the section, I think it is a laudable one, and I think Deputy Tully in a way is confusing the issues.  In relation to the charges and costs and the work done under this section, it would appear reasonable that only the question of costings should arise at this appeal stage, unless it could be shown that the person had obtained new evidence in new circumstances which had arisen after he failed to avail of the right of appeal against an earlier notice, and the local authority acted upon that notice not being appealed against, but it does seem reasonable that the local authority should be able to recover the fair costs they were entitled to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has raised a matter which comes later in the Bill in the Fourth Schedule, Part I.  I should imagine that would be more appropriate than this section, strange as it sounds, but having raised the question, it may have some association with the matter we are discussing on the section.  I should say that one thing Deputy Ryan has omitted to refer to is the fact that the arbitrator is available in the case which he talked about.  While it is true that in many cases no recourse is had to the arbitrator, nevertheless he is there and can finally determine how much it costs or should have cost to clear a building off land, or to clear a site. If the owner is not satisfied with the findings of the corporation, the arbitrator then comes into the picture. Having said that, I still think this matter could more appropriately be dealt with under the Fourth Schedule, Part I.</P>

      <P>(2)  A housing authority may acquire land which is not suitable or convenient for the purposes of this Act provided that the land is acquired with a view to an exchange of that land for suitable land.</P>
      <P>(3)  The power conferred on a housing authority under this section shall be in addition to their powers to acquire land under section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>(4) This section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to strengthen the hands of the local authorities.  We believe the first part of the amendment is eminently suited to this section of the Bill because we find occasionally that local authorities may be acquiring land for building purposes.  They may require 17 acres and there may be an area double that available which they can buy at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th November, 1965.</P>

      <P>The rental data for local authority dwellings included in the Consumer Price Index relate to the figures for total weekly rent, including rates, of all occupied rented dwellings. The rent inquiry is made at mid-November each year.  Data for 1965 are therefore not yet available.  The following statement shows for each county, county borough and for Dún Laoghaire Borough the number of occupied rented local authority <Col N="1760" /> dwellings, together with the average weekly rent, including rates, for which data were included in the Consumer Price Index for November, 1964:</P>
      <P>NUMBER of occupied rented dwellings owned by local authorities in each County, County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough together with the average weekly rent (including rates) of such dwellings in each area, as used in the compilation of the Consumer Price Index at mid-November, 1964.</P>
