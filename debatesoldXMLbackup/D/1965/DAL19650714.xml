    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting to be called.  If I had been here when the Estimate for Agriculture was under consideration, it would not have been passed so quickly.</P>
      <P>I was sorry the Taoiseach was not present last night for most of my address but I will commence this morning by saying that the Taoiseach appealed to the Opposition for co-operation in the nation's difficulty.  I heard the Leader of my Party, Deputy Cosgrave, saying that the co-operation would be available, and, knowing Deputy Cosgrave to be a man of his word, I know that co-operation is available to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> It is rather fortunate for the Taoiseach that this difficulty has arisen during the course of a printing strike.  If the Taoiseach expects co-operation from these benches, surely he will give Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish the same kind of publicity as he himself would get?  On the radio this morning, we heard only the Taoiseach's speech.  On the news telecast last night, we got portion of the Taoiseach's speech and practically nothing from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I believe the nation is in difficulty but I have great faith in my own country, having seen my country go through a civil war, an economic war and a great war and being able to surmount them.  This country was able to surmount all the damage, all the destruction, all the disunity that Fianna Fáil and their Governments brought to it and it will surmount the present difficulty.  However, it will not surmount it with gimmicks and it is with gimmicks that the Taoiseach has been getting away with it since he came into office.  His predecessor was not bad at it, either.  As a matter of fact, he was the matter hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying: &ldquo;Do not draw me out&rdquo;.  I want to be cool, calm and collected on this matter.  I heard Deputy Dillon speaking in that debate when he and many of his colleagues warned the nation of the danger of inflation and the danger of the policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to a little bit of order, even if one of those interrupters is one of my best friends and even if he has a more penetrating voice than I have.  It is very hard to keep calm in this debate with the bitter memories of 50 years behind <Col N="1192" /> one.  We will have to help out the Government.  The Taoiseach came in yesterday like a naughty boy and confessed that his <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has gone.  We now have a programme for economic contraction.  There was a document published some time ago, a progress report on this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Practically everything in it, and it is only three or four months old, was a miscalculation.</P>
      <P>Here we were with the leader of Fine Gael warning the Government, but on top of that we had a great rush of the newspaper propaganda and television propaganda which Fianna Fáil are so adept at putting out.  I do not mind what the people in the <i>Irish Press</i> say&mdash;they are tied hand and foot &mdash;but none of the national newspapers was able to see the danger.  I would like to see them published this morning and see what their comments would have been.  They have a great opportunity now of letting this thing lie and then later they will come along and have wonderful ideas and wonderful remedies, but, at the time, they were not able to see what was obvious to everyone over here and to half a million Fine Gael voters.</P>
      <P>This is a desperate situation and one which must be compared with the situation of 1956.  The Fianna Fáil propaganda machine classes 1956 with &ldquo;Black 47&rdquo; but now we have 1965 to compare with it.  In 1956 we had the Suez crisis.  That was outside the control of the Government of the day.  The bank rate in England went up to seven per cent two days before a national loan was floated here at 5¼ per cent. We had no control over that.  The Argentine Government dumped thousands of cattle into Britain and cut down the price.  We had no control over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What position did the Taoiseach find himself in last year?  He could proudly wave the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> all over the country.  The cattle trade became good and all the cattle went to England.  It was these cattle that saved the economy of the country, not the planning of the Taoiseach or of his Government and not because of the <Col N="1193" /> foresight of the Taoiseach or his Government, because if they had their way, there would not be a beast in the country.</P>
    <P>In that year Fianna Fáil brought housing practically to a standstill.  The inter-Party Government, which they had taunted and embarrassed, built three times as many houses as they did and built them at the low rate of interest of 3¾ per cent.  That is something that should not be forgotten.  It was that inter-Party Government who brought in legislation which made industrial exports possible.  That cannot be denied.  It was that Government who took away the stupid bar of the Control of Manufactures Act which made it possible for exporting firms to come in here.  It was that Government and Deputy Sweetman who launched the Prize Bond scheme.  I was here in the House at the time and I heard all the Fianna Fáil Ministers howling that the country was being raffled, that it was being put in pawn.  But that scheme brought in over £20 million.</P>
    <P>We will judge by results and that Government over there have had more plans which failed than I can think of. They have come out with plans that would make good music hall jokes. They had one leader of a Government who told us he would put us on light beer and Egyptian honey.  He was going to bring in Egyptian bees.  This is the kind of thing Fianna Fáil carry on.</P>
    <P>We had one election in which the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil and put your husbands to work&rdquo;.  All the wives had to do was to vote Fianna Fáil and their husbands would be at work on Monday morning.  They were probably at work in Birmingham on the Monday fortnight.  They came into office in 1957 with another slogan: &ldquo;100,000 jobs and £100 million&rdquo;, but the number of people earning wages in this country dropped by 50,000 and thousands of them emigrated.  I heard Fianna Fáil Ministers state here that the unemployment figure had been reduced.  That it quite true but it is true because the people were shipped over to England.  That is Fianna Fáil successful policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> I have no faith in the Bill before the House.  It is merely another gimmick to have the House closed. In 1956 the inter-Party Government subsidised tea, butter, bread and sugar and kept prices down.  That is something for which they must get credit.  Things were stable.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency in the following year, on the Friday night before the election, the former Leader of the Fianna Fáil Government was being marched into Belmullet with torchlights and bands, the whole mixture as before, and he said: &ldquo;They are saying&mdash;meaning Fine Gael&mdash;that if we get in, we will do away with the subsidies.  We never did what they said and we are not going to do it now.&rdquo;  It is true enough that he never did what we said because anything good we suggested he would not do.  On the same night the Taoiseach was down in my constituency, and he made a promise to the railwaymen that was never kept. He also informed the electors of Waterford and the country that if Fianna Fáil were returned, the subsidies would not be taken off.  That night he was offered the hospitality of his supporters in my native city. He did not accept; he just had a cup of tea in his hand because he had to rush off to the <i>Irish Press</i> to make sure his announcement would be properly headlined the next day, that the subsidies were to be kept.</P>
    <P>The first action of the Fianna Fáil Government when returned to office was to do away with the subsidies. I shall take my time telling this story. I do not care if I keep the House here till Christmas because this story must be told.  The next step, and rightly so, was to give people an increase to offset the rise in the cost of living.  The local authorities throughout the country called special meetings and passed supplementary estimates for the purpose of meeting the extra expense involved.  Then there was a rise in the rates.  That was the start of the inflation and it has gone on merrily since.  We could not get any support from newspaper commentators, television commentators or newspaper editors when we <Col N="1195" /> said this was a dreadful situation, that this would eventually bring the country into inflation.  I heard that said here and it was jeered at.</P>
    <P>This went on and on, and then the turnover tax was introduced.  The people of Dublin gave the Government their answer, but it goes to show that democracy does not work in this country and has never worked under Fianna Fáil.  They did not give a hoot about the people.  They continued with their policy.  They staved off the Cork and Kildare by-elections.  Then when negotiations were in progress for a wage agreement, my information is that it could have been settled at seven or eight per cent, but the Taoiseach came along and suggested 12 per cent and everybody said &ldquo;Hurrah&rdquo;.  Then the cost of living was all right and people did not pay so much attention to the turnover tax, but as the months went by, the bills started coming in to them as they came in to the Government. The Government's attention was drawn to the simple facts of the situation. In the first stage of inflation it was wonderful.  It was just the same as if a man were spending twice his week's wages.  He was having a whale of a time.  He could do it again next week and the week after that, but the bills would eventually come in.  That was told to Fianna Fáil supporters and to the Government, but they took no notice.</P>
    <P>I find fault with the Taoiseach for leaving so long the confession he made yesterday.  I would remind him of what happened in regard to our external assets.  From 1st January, 1964, to 31st May, 1965, they have dropped from £99 million to £75 million, that is, 25 per cent of our external assets dissipated. The Taoiseach said last night that the bulk of our reserves are in sterling.  If the present trend continues, they will not be in anything; they will all be done away with and we may reach the stage when our money may be like Confederate money.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said the Government have endeavoured to secure moneys from abroad.  If the Taoiseach expects the co-operation of the House, he will <Col N="1196" /> have to be more candid.  He will have to tell us where he went to look for these moneys.  He said he failed.  To what countries did he go?  What terms did they ask for or what terms did he offer?  An answer to those questions is due to the House and to the country.</P>
    <P>I glory in what the Taoiseach said yesterday about preserving the British market.  I advocated that during the Economic War and I was physically assaulted by Fianna Fáil bravos, blackguards.  Two of the so and so's are working in England now.  It was some source of satisfaction to know that I have friends who were able to deal with them on the spot, but there it is.</P>
    <P>Now we must preserve and maintain these relations with Britain.  Where is all this brave talk about the Common Market? Where are all those speeches at all those dinners all over the country on the Common Market? I was getting indigestion from listening to them and all these new executives&mdash; I could not call them anything else. None of them read anything about the Common Market or knew anything about it.  &ldquo;Increased production, more production; we will all go into the Common Market and do not touch Britain.&rdquo;  Now the Common Market is gone and we hear some of the Taoiseach's colleagues saying what I was trying to get them to back us on, that we should stick to the market we were in, the British market, because threequarters of the countries of the world were trying to get into it, and that the Government should have a good and proper promotion and sales service for our goods there.</P>
    <P>If there was a manufacturer in this country who was manufacturing an article that was good and that was not getting the promotion it deserved in the British or any other market, the Government should send for the directors of this firm&mdash;and I have one clutch of firms in mind&mdash;and tell them that if they did not do something, the Government would do it themselves. I am referring to something that the American Ambassador referred to about a fortnight ago, so I am in good company.  I am referring to Irish <Col N="1197" /> whiskey.  Only a few years ago we had the former Deputy Robert Briscoe going across to the United States as practically a semi-Government envoy and it looked as if we would have to build tankers to send the whiskey to America.</P>
    <P>I asked a Parliamentary Question yesterday and was told that we exported £114,000 worth of whiskey last year to the United States, to the great market there, and for the Taoiseach's benefit I would like to state that the Scots exported £46 million worth. I know I will be told that you cannot just make whiskey&mdash;you have to put it down&mdash;but the Government have been eight years in office and they have done nothing about it.  If ever there was a helpless lot of men as far as the marketing of products is concerned, they are the Fianna Fáil Government. They are the people who get people to back them up and talk about economics but they do not know anything about economics.  They do not know anything about ordinary business.  You could not expect them to.</P>
    <P>Now we are asked for co-operation, but when this Party were in Government over there, everything they tried to do that would be of benefit to this country and to its people was sabotaged and blackguarded by the Fianna Fáil Party in opposition.</P>
    <P>The entrance of Deputy de Valera reminds me that he appeared here as a greyhound expert and the Fianna Fáil Party in opposition at the time opposed venomously and consistently and with an ardour worthy of a better cause our Bill, only to put it into operation when they came in themselves and give jobs to all their chaps. I am going back a bit now.  I remember seeing a mechanical totalisator in Harold's Cross in 1931, all ready to open up in 1932 but Fianna Fáil when they got into office, allowed themselves to be swayed by a few bookmarkers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant. It was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government which the Taoiseach is now maintaining.  I wonder in what position would the greyhound industry <Col N="1198" /> be now if for 30 years it had had totalisators.  And be it remembered as far as Government policy is concerned that when they were fresh in here, having decided to take the oath, they opposed Mr. Cosgrave's Government when the totalisator was being introduced into Irish racing, something that saved Irish racing and put it on the map.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted last night to the English levy, and I would remind the Taoiseach that, in my opinion, we actually lay down and took the situation as it was&mdash;a 15 per cent levy on our products going into Great Britain in order that they might correct their balance of payments. Surely that was a most unreasonable thing for a Labour Government to do, a Labour Government elected with practically 95 per cent of the Irish workers' influence, that enjoyed a trade with Ireland where they told us £160 million worth and we sold them £120 million worth.  There was no reason to correct any balance where we were concerned.  Now we are in difficulties and we should tell them: &ldquo;We are in difficulties and we want you to take this levy off.  We are in balance with you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a source of great fun to what I call the Fianna Fáil trained dog act behind the Taoiseach when the Taoiseach used to chivvy me when I asked him a question every six months about the trade between the Republic of Ireland and the Iron Curtain countries, and with Eastern Germany and with West Germany.  Here, as we are talking about the balance of payments problem, I am on record, just a parliamentary representative coming up from Waterford&mdash;I am on record eight years twice a year drawing attention to this fact.  The latest one is that we buy £23 million worth from Federal Germany <Col N="1199" /> and sell them £8 million worth; we buy £1,379,000 worth from Eastern Germany and sell them £377,000; we buy £800,000 worth from Hong Kong and £122,000 worth from Hungary, and £826,000 worth from the USSR; they buy £28,000 from us; we buy £440,000 worth from Czechoslovakia and they buy £228,000 from us; we buy £7 million worth from Canada and they buy £1 million from us.  We buy £3 million worth from Australia and they buy £281,000 from us.</P>
    <P>The Australians had a trade mission here the other day trying to sell more to us, but the Taoiseach and whoever is Minister in charge of this should tell these gentlemen: &ldquo;You had better do something about this or we will have to do something.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who used to be Minister for Industry and Commerce, and who now has the present Minister for Industry and Commerce with him, will have to take cognisance of the fact that another country that is out of balance with us is France.  When we wanted helicopters we had to buy French.  We could not buy British helicopters.  Again, an Irish Minister of State should have as good a motor car as anybody else.  But why have we to buy Mercedes?  Why put ourselves further out of balance with the Germans?  Buying Irish will have to become Government policy.  It should also be made known that we will give preference to imports from those countries with which we have trade agreements.  A few years ago Western Germany gave us a cattle quota of 600.  One would swear at the time that the whole country was saved. That quota was announced here by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith.  As I say, one would think the country was saved with this quota for 600 cattle.  There are many cattle dealers in this country who would buy 600 cattle for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hear the Deputy very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not just too bad?  The Deputy will hear me and he will not like what he hears.  The 600 cattle were going to save the nation. <Col N="1200" /> Of course, Fianna Fáil were always trying to do business with Germany. Most of them hoped Germany would win the war and Herr Hitler would come in here.  They got a drop then and they got another drop when the Germans ratted on the agreement. But they let them get away with it. There is a demand in Germany for the heavy type of bullock we have. Our 600 quota was given to Denmark and a few other neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>The Germans sell us £25 million worth and they take from us about £8 million worth.  The Taoiseach said that, apart from nursing and maintaining the British market and our relations with Great Britain, they would also go abroad and look for new markets.  I can go back now into the limbo of forgotten things; this is the mixture as before, the mixture doled out by his predecessor, the alternative markets.  I take the whole thing with a large pinch of salt.  At the same time, I maintain we could have an alternative market pressed on the Western Germans for our heavy bullocks.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we hear in this House about an export order given to an industry.  The whole thing may not amount to more than £25,000 or £35,000.  It is regarded as something wonderful.  Our greatest export is our cattle.  This export trade is in the hands of independent dealing men; that is how I describe them.  There is not a good word for them on those benches over there.  They have never been given any assistance of any kind.  Nobody cares about the high freight they have to pay.  Nobody cares about the difficulties they have to surmount.  Nobody realises the risks they take.  A man may come up here to the Dublin market and buy 100 cattle costing £8,000.  He may put them on a boat and find that there is a slump.  There may be an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  He may reach the North Wall and discover there is a strike there and he has to bring them home again and hang them around his own neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is our greatest industry, but nobody cares about it.  If a Chinaman <Col N="1201" /> comes along and starts a factory to make mousetraps, it is regarded as a cause for wonder.  The factory closes down in six months and, after a period of time, we have a question asked here about the poor devils who were employed in that factory and who are now out of work.</P>
    <P>There is a policy, or part of a policy, going to be carried out by this Government. Talks are going on.  I know they are.  I have a question down to the Minister for Agriculture today.  They are going to rationalise the live pig trade.  God forgive them.  Last night Deputy Lemass said we should not discourage people from running their own business.  I wrote his remark down.  Fianna Fáil policy!  I think of the fine men in Limerick and Cork and Waterford.  They were destroyed deliberately by two Acts of Parliament passed by Fianna Fáil.  Prominent members of Fianna Fáil got up here and welcomed those two Acts, Acts designed deliberately to do away with the pig buyers.  That is on the records of this House.

      <P>I think I must be allowed to mention something about State companies.  This is Parliament and we are the representatives of the people.  Whether they were foolish enough to elect some of the Deputies over there or enlightened enough to elect some of us over here, we are their representatives.  We are asked by a citizen of this State to have some matter relating to him, and him alone, investigated and we are entitled to put down a Parliamentary Question on his behalf and get an answer to it. We allowed the Government to set up these State companies which have entrenched themselves in a very strong position.  Most of them spent a lot of money but that was all right because Dark Rosaleen would pay and the trained dogs would run through the lobbies and vote it.  They did not know <Col N="1203" /> what they were voting for; I know that because I whipped a few of them and asked them what they were voting for and they did not know.</P>
      <P>Most wonderful briefs come along from Ministers which show that State companies have made an operating profit but then you discover that they have lost about £490,000.  Nobody says anything about that; it is all right.  I know some State bodies must be subsidised; they are really public services. Fianna Fáil made that discovery regarding transport only last year or so. It took them about 20 years to find out and this is the Government who nationalised the railways.  Many people did very well out of that because they were tipped off that the railways would be nationalised.  When we look at the position of the railways, we must consider the position we are in in regard to the Minister for Transport and Power who will not answer a Parliamentary Question regarding a year's trading receipts.</P>

Why should we not do so since we are brought in to vote the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has successfully deceived the country for more than a year.  This business was brewing but like Micawber, he was waiting for something to turn up.  He gambled hard and frittered away the nation's reserves.  Last year we were told so many millions were provided for housing but that was not spent because it was deliberate Government policy to turn down schemes that were sent up for sanction.  We shall have more about that on the Housing Bill tomorrow.  Now the Taoiseach says <Col N="1204" /> we must save and there is a Finance Bill going through the House that will penalise anybody who saves.  That Finance Bill represents a degrading performance on the part of the Government who introduced it because nobody understands it, not even the Minister who brought it in&mdash;he could not be expected to understand it.  One reads a whole section of it in which there is not a word about an insurance policy but it is designed to tax insurance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, I am very sorry that Lemass led us on to this day, that he led this country into the present situation.  I am very sorry this occasion has arisen and let nobody on the Fianna Fáil Benches say that the same thing happened in 1956; it did not. Everything that happened in 1956 to <Col N="1205" /> restrict credit was due to outside influences; everything that happened in 1965 to restrict credit&mdash;and I should include 1964 because credit was restricted then as the Taoiseach admitted yesterday &mdash; happened through the action of the Fianna Fáil Government. The restriction of credit was brought about by the Government and I accuse the Taoiseach, as Leader of Fianna Fáil, of being the prime mover in this, the most stupid, idiotic and nonsensical economic policy that was ever carried out in any country.</P>
    <P>It is poor satisfaction to say that and we can only regret it.  One often wonders if people care whether you are right or not.  Are they being brainwashed by Fianna Fáil propaganda? When they are able to cook up a state of affairs in which they could win the Cork and Kildare by-elections and the state of affairs which let loose the Mafia on those constituencies to tell people they would lose their jobs and would have to emigrate, one wonders what to think.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said, and it was quoted here yesterday, only a couple of months ago, during the election, that this wonderful ship of State should not be handed over to Fine Gael who would not know what to do with it. This ship of State is in need of many shipwrights.  It is following an old Fianna Fáil pattern.  The Government under their policy purchased the three dud trawlers and we lost £350,000. The Government's policy is destroying the Irish Navy.  They are trying to keep afloat the three old rust buckets they call a Navy.  They can examine their own consciences to see if they are justified in that.  If the Taoiseach were candid, he would tell the House that the real reason is they cannot afford to buy ships.  That would be all right.  We would not howl the place down as his supporters did when in Opposition. We would give the Government co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will listen patiently to the Taoiseach and all the brass he will put up to what we have said, but I expect him to reply to this.  He told us the other day he was seeking alternative markets. I want to know where.  He told us yesterday he had been endeavouring <Col N="1206" /> to obtain credit abroad without success. I want to know to whom did the Government apply and what were the conditions, if any, on which credit could be obtained in any of these countries.  I want to know what offers, ir any, our Government made for these credits.</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation for the country.  If the Taoiseach expects co-operation, we promise we will give it to him.  But he will not get it if there is not fair reporting on Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.  I do not want to have to listen all tomorrow night and hear nothing but the Taoiseach's speech.  I want to hear the speech of the Leader of the Opposition and the points put up here by the Opposition. When the Taoiseach comes in here to-night or to-morrow, I want him to be frank with the House and the country and to tell the people where he has led us.</P>

      <P>I am almost hypnotised by the fascination of listening to 50 years of treasured wrongs coming one after another from the burdened breast of Deputy Lynch.  But his promise of co-operation made it well worthwhile to listen to the many severe things he had to say about the Government. We have not come into the House to seek to share our worries but to seek co-operation in areas of activity where the Government cannot effectively act by themselves.  It is this actual co-operation we want rather than any pious agreements or sparing of us by the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>One would hardly have believed it listening to Deputy Lynch but we have before us two things&mdash; the Second Stage of the Prices Bill and the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department.  Price control, perhaps because it was mentioned first, because it required enabling legislation to be brought to the House for approval and because it represented not a change but a digression from normal Government policy, <Col N="1207" /> seems to have got undue prominence and significance in the present circumstances. It is in fact just one of nine or ten proposals or approaches indicated by the Taoiseach to protect our economic growth during a temporary period in which external circumstances and internal trends combine to make it necessary for us to regard it as a period of rest and consolidation rather than a period of movement in our economic programme.</P>
      <P>The external circumstances are known to the House.  The trends which internally have occupied our minds these past couple of days have perhaps been there for some time, but they are underlined by circumstances in other countries and by the drop in the net inflow of capital which make it necessary for us to see what we can do ourselves.  We cannot do a great deal about matters which are outside the control of this country and so it is we are preoccupied with the trends. I believe economic growth is subject to rhythms.  There are periods of rest and periods of movement.  I think the survey made yesterday by the Taoiseach of our economic future did not indicate the emergence of anything like a crisis or an impending crisis, as Deputies have said, but rather an exercise in government allied to protecting our economic growth during this particular period and, perhaps in this period, for further growth.  We have in recent times, commentaries outside this House making our own behaviour as a people the focal point of discussion.  There has been a serious amount of soul-searching, blame-placing and accusations of things like alimentory exhibitionism and vulgarity. All Deputies must realise that although such may be taking place, it is not characteristic of all our people. It is not characteristic of the majority of our people or even of a large minority of our people.  Any country in the world will have some section of the people so behaving but that cannot be taken as the cause of their troubles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough to make a glib diagnosis or attribute the trend to some section of the community and leave it at that.  If we have to have a <Col N="1208" /> self-examination, the most fruitful would be to remind ourselves of our national aims and ask ourselves what do we want to do with the economic growth and with affluence.  I am sure thinking persons will be satisfied that prosperity in itself is not enough.  We are faced here with problems common to expanding economics.  These problems are being faced by other nations.  At the same time, it might be a good occasion for us to decide on what we want to spend our money and what are our national aims.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Taoiseach came here to seek the co-operation of various sections of the community.  It may, perhaps, strengthen all of us to persevere in every possible act of ours in protecting the economy if we have continuously before our minds the national aims which have been before my mind, at any rate, for some years past.  Economies, and even our own, could support a great deal of consumer expenditure and at the same time provide the education services, the health services, and the housing services we want for our people.</P>
    <P>I have a great belief in a national aim and a national purpose.  We have, from time to time, as a people, overcome difficulties because we had firmly in view a goal and an achievement to which we could aspire.  I have, for myself, for some years past accepted as a goal, for which I have found a response fairly widely throughout the country, for our people, to give every child a chance in life.  We have, as other countries have found out, problems and difficulties in trying to distribute the wealth and the materials of this life but we can achieve, and we must achieve, a situation where every child in this country will get a chance through the educational system right up to the top of the educational ladder, if he has the necessary ability. He must get a chance at every rung on leaving the educational ladder for employment in industry, in services as technicians and a variety of opportunities which are available in other countries.</P>
    <P>This is a worthy aim, and if we keep it before our minds, we can overcome difficulties, and overcome perhaps the <Col N="1209" /> worst features of affluence which can be as difficult to handle as scarcity of money.  We ask of ourselves, of individuals and organised groups on whom we have called for co-operation, a change of emphasis in the application of our available resources at this time and perhaps a thoughtful prudence in the use of our personal income.</P>
    <P>From this point of view, it has been declared as policy that credit should be given to capital production projects in preference to consumer imports. It has also been decided that from the money available to us, there should be support given to our exporters.  As the House knows, our exports were rising in a most satisfactory and welcome fashion, year by year, until the temporary surcharge, at the end of last year, was put on by the British Government to solve some of their own problems.  I do not want to get too involved but during the debate on the Estimate for my Department this year, some members of the Opposition were inclined to jeer and say the description of that surcharge by the Taoiseach as a body blow was an exaggeration and that we were wailing too much.  Time has proved now that this surcharge was a real blow to our exporting firms.</P>
    <P>At that time, and almost overnight, to help our exporters to meet their added difficulties, the Government announced the implementation of a scheme of market development grants under which over £500,000 has been paid to 400 exporters already this year. These grants are available to the general body of exporters to help them to maintain their position.  The general body of our exporters are holding their position in the market.  The drop in exports, combined with an increase in imports, make it necessary for us to invest more of our money and energies in expanding, if possible, our exports at this time.  The amount of money payable to exporters under this scheme of grants is being increased for that reason.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach announced, if an exporter in the final six months of this year increases his exports up to ten <Col N="1210" /> per cent of his exports for this time last year, there will be a 15 per cent increase in the market development grant.  If he increases them over ten per cent, the increase in grant will be 25 per cent.  I mention this as a shift in the impetus in our application of our resources.  The Dáil already knows that the funds available to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta have, this year, been substantially increased to enable them to intensify their activities and give additional help in grants available to exporters.  I think I should say at this time that exporters should make more use of Córas Tráchtála, and I would ask them at this period, for their own benefit and the national benefit, to make whatever use possible, as often as possible, of the services which Córas Tráchtála are willing to supply.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail, but some Deputies were worried that Córas Tráchtála were not seeking markets.  I think America was specially mentioned.  Córas Tráchtála are continuously seeking markets, and in America this autumn, it is intended that there will be major store promotions in three of the big cities.  Another is planned in London, and others on a smaller scale are planned in different British and European cities.</P>
    <P>As I say, our action is not dealing with a situation that has developed, but dealing with trends, and taking what measures we think necessary to protect the economy from the final effects of these trends and to ensure further growth.  Early in my career, not as a politician, but as a doctor, I learned a principle which I continued into politics.  It is: <i>Primum non nocere</i>&mdash;The first principle is, do not do harm.  That is related to the treatment of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>A modest aspiration for a physician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because in giving treatment, one can do harm if one is not circumspect.  Deputies have likened this situation to what happened in 1956.  I say that in 1956 the Government over-responded to what they saw, and that over-response brought a <Col N="1211" /> massive reaction on the economy with the effects we all saw at the time.  I believe any intervention by the Government should be very gentle.  At that time they did cure one of the ills, but many of the ills of the economy of 1956 could be described as iatrogenic, which means &ldquo;caused by the physician&rdquo;.  Many of the troubles in the economy in 1956 were caused by the treatment of the early situation.  I stress this because, as I said, I believe any intervention by the Government should be gentle.</P>
      <P>As an example, I might cite our attitude to the hire purchase order which I intend to make in the next few days.  The range of articles which will be affected by this order, has been named by the Taoiseach, and is limited.  As can be seen, it is much more limited than corresponding ranges at other times in other countries.  Indeed, the percentage of the price required in the deposit and the time given to pay for the article is not very much more onerous than is the actual practice of traders, and certainly is the same as has been in use in England for the past few years.  It is a very slight curb, and perhaps it is no more than has been advocated as a social necessity by various Deputies from time to time, regardless of any economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, intervention by the Government should be gentle and I suppose I should have said before that it should be reluctantly carried out. Governments do not want to rush to interfere with the processes of the economy, and it is only when one is persuaded that such intervention is absolutely necessary that one should intervene.  The fact that we have been patient and reluctant to intervene is borne out by speeches made here. Deputies have asked why we have not done something before now.  Having decided that these trends would not right themselves, Government intervention had to be timely.  We did not come to this House painting a sombre picture.  We did not come with long faces, as Deputy T. Lynch said.  We came to tell the House of the trends that can be corrected, of a temporary <Col N="1212" /> situation combined with trends in our own economy which can be corrected, of a slowing of growth which can be used as a period of consolidation preparatory to renewing growth again. We came to say that we can prevent what has been described in a most melancholy way by some speakers as a &ldquo;situation&rdquo;.  We have made our intervention reluctantly but it is timely and as gentle as possible.</P>
    <P>When I started to speak after Deputy T. Lynch, I said I did not expect any member of the Opposition to miss his opportunity.  We do not want anyone to share our worries. What we are seeking is not pious statements but co-operation along certain lines from various individuals and from the organised sections of the community.  We accept total responsibility for taking the measures necessary to protect our economic growth and to see that this growth will be resumed.  I speak of co-operation along certain lines.  They have been mentioned by the Taoiseach.  Many are old.  For instance the Buy Irish campaign is one which is very old but which recently had a very welcome revival, starting at the time of the introduction of the British surcharge.</P>
    <P>I expect that the natural response of the majority of our people to the appeal now being made will be to increase the effects of the Buy Irish campaign, which traders have already remarked upon.  I know that anybody interested in employment in Ireland for themselves and other people will continue to buy Irish and will extend the range of the Irish goods they buy when they are spending money.  Those who have money to spare will, I know, save it and put it into useful savings because, again, they will be putting it into our economy, putting it into Irish industry, making employment at home possible, and bringing nearer the day when we will fulfil the various national aims of which I spoke earlier.  We will be appealing for saving as much as possible.  The Minister for Finance is arranging with the people who organised the savings campaign to revitalise it.  We are hoping to have an increased buying of Irish goods where spending is necessary.  But savings <Col N="1213" /> must come first in my list.  We are hoping to find co-operation in the area of higher productivity.  To this end I have had talks with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the FUE and other employers.  I have given them the Government's assessment of the situation and I know their normal care for the welfare of their own members must extend to a care for the protection and expansion of the economy.  They have as big a stake in this as anybody else.</P>
    <P>These are the general feelings. Gentle curbs to consumer expenditure are intended&mdash;to have people think rather than act in any way which would be regarded as an overreaction to our situation; to encourage people to save and where spending is necessary, to spend at home, and to give active support to exporting campaigns through increased expenditure in marketing developments grants and to Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Prices form a part of this discussion. As I said, the Bill might have been introduced in the normal way and I might have been making a speech explaining it, were it not for the fact that it is better that we should see this Bill as one of nine or ten approaches to economic ills that must be righted.  I think prices have to be controlled and increases in prices must be seen to be reasonable, because as bad almost as high prices is suspicion between different sections of our community.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of this Government in relation to prices in normal circumstances is well known.  Deputies on the other side of the House seem to think that this is a grave situation&mdash;the Government having suddenly changed their mind, there must be an emergency.  I have on several occasions expressed the view that the best regulator of prices is competition.  The legislation we have at present which largely protects free competition or makes possible the limitation of competition, or limitation of interference with it, was adequate for our needs in normal circumstances.  Before me, other members of the Government have always expressed opposition to the setting up of a general system of <Col N="1214" /> price control, but it has always been considered possible that situations would arise which would call for the temporary application of price restraints. It is felt that, if such a situation is now developing, the powers required to right it are not in the present Act and should be sought before the House goes into Recess. That is why this Bill is before the House at this time.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps necessary for me to tell the House my powers as they exist to control prices of commodities and charges for services.  This power is derived from the Prices Act, 1958. Under that Act, I may by warrant appoint advisory committees to investigate and report on the prices charged for commodities and on the methods of marketing these commodities by manufacturers, or on the charges for rendering services or the methods of rendering services.  The 1958 Act empowers me to fix maximum prices for bread, butter, sugar and, in certain areas, for milk.  It also empowers me to fix prices and charges where the Fair Trade Commission find that prices and charges are kept artificially high by restrictive practices.  I am also empowered to fix manufacturers' prices and charges for services where a Prices Advisory Committee reports that they are unduly inflated.</P>
    <P>It is only when a state of emergency exists in relation to the supply of a commodity that the 1958 Act enables me to fix prices at wholesale and retail levels.  This may be where Deputies got the idea of an emergency. The word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; applies only in the Act to the supply of commodities. I do not want to give the impression in changing these powers, or seeking to have them changed by this new Bill, that I have unearthed a conspiracy on the part of the manufacturers or traders to fleece the community. On the contrary, the evidence available to me indicates that many of the recent price increases were due to causes over which the manufacturing traders had little or no control. Neither would I like to give the impression that this Bill is a magic wand that will keep production costs at a standstill while wages and salaries are going up and production is not.  If <Col N="1215" /> wages and incomes are not matched by higher productivity, there must be increased production costs and increased pressure on prices.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Corish that higher productivity is not merely a matter for the workers.  I am well aware that management has a vital part to play in this and management must realise that an automatic increase in prices is not the only way to meet increased costs.  There are other and better ways to improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>In brief, this Bill would insert provisions in the 1958 Act to enable the Government, if satisfied that the condition of the national economy is such that it is necessary for the time being to maintain prices at a stable level, to make an Order empowering me to do any or all of the following things: (a) to carry out an investigation of all prices or articles of any description and of all charges for the rendering of any services; (b) to require any person connected with any of these investigations to furnish any relevant information in his possession or any documents in his power or control; (c) to fix the maximum price at which any article of any description may be sold and the maximum charge which may be made for the rendering of any service; and (d) to impose a standstill on prices and charges in relation to all or any prices of all or any articles and in relation to the charges for the rendering of any service.</P>
    <P>Any Order made under these provisions will have a maximum life of six months but may be renewed.  I wanted for the purposes of the investigation of prices and charges to be able to use the machinery of the Prices Advisory Committee as constituted by the 1958 Act and to constitute a prices advisory body or bodies.  To enable that to be done, it will be necessary for me to introduce, on Committee Stage, amendments to the Bill which has been circulated.</P>
    <P>During the debate some questions have been asked about the actual Bill. Deputy Cosgrave felt that manufacturers and traders should have to give advance notice of proposed price increases and furnish evidence before <Col N="1216" /> increases would be permitted.  The powers in the Bill are adequate to provide for that situation, if it arose.  It has already been made clear that a standstill could be made by order and no change in prices could be made until an amending order was again made.  Deputy Corish made the same point and added that a prices inquiry should be conducted in public.  Under the Bill, it could and would be possible to conduct price inquiries by prices advisory committees or bodies in public.  The question was asked whether the Prices Advisory Committees were defunct and the answer is that they are not.  One of the amendments which I propose to introduce will be to extend the scope of their inquiries.</P>
    <P>I have covered the point made by Deputy Corish that there should be a longer period for the order and the main point I should like to make is that the Bill is intended to deal with short-term economic situations.  The exclusions in section 5 of the Act do apply to the Bill, in answer to a question by Deputy Corish, and further, a reduction in quality as mentioned by him can be dealt with under the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is possible&mdash;you hear all sorts of suggestions&mdash;that people might think that a standstill was <Col N="1217" /> coming and might come up a little bit to meet it.  The powers are flexible enough to deal with a prices problem as it affects the economic position for a temporary period.  Again, if I may stress the fact, in ordinary circumstances, the normal play of competition should be the best regulator.  It is only the possibility of economic circumstances making it necessary to have temporary standstill or control of prices which makes me seek these powers.  As I said, the protection of the economy may need control of prices, or at least the means to make it quite clear that any proposed increases are justified.  Most of the approaches to our economic situation are interwoven.  The talks I have had with the Congress of Trade Unions have, of course, covered more than the industrial relations problems which we face.  I am satisfied that the unions will take whatever course is compatible with, and not alone compatible with, but necessary for, the protection and welfare of their members.  Long-term concern with the economic situation must certainly be a big factor in their considerations.</P>
      <P>The talks have not been brought to a conclusion and it is intended this week, after fuller consideration of the outline made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday, that the Congress of Trade Unions will meet me again to discuss the part they can play.  It is of course essential for them to be clear that they alone are not being called on to make sacrifices; every sector of the community will have to play its part and nobody, as the Taoiseach said, can opt out of his responsibility in regard to protecting the economic programme.  The trends in the economy and outside influences impinging on the economy are active, changing processes.  The Government are keeping an eye constantly on what is happening and on what needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we are reluctant to interfere until we have to, reluctant because of the nature of the democracy and the type of government we have here, and because of our experience that interference with economic processes must not be lightly undertaken and <Col N="1218" /> must be minimal and gentle if found to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I think we have been timely in pointing out the trends and the ways in which they can be corrected and we continue to believe that this temporary situation will be corrected by the combined activities of the Government and the voluntary activities of organised groups and individuals.  As I said, the position will be constantly kept under review and the proportions of Government activity to voluntary contributions will be changed only if necessary, but will be changed, if necessary.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not move the Second Reading of the Prices Bill yesterday evening because he appears to have a far brighter outlook on the future economy than the Taoiseach had.

      <P>It did appear for a period yesterday evening that matters were so serious that the Taoiseach could not find words to express how serious they were and when there was a minor interruption, he sat down and appeared to feel that in such a desperately serious situation, he should not be interrupted by anyone.  Having listened to the Minister this morning, whether he has had a sleep on it or whether he was luckier than the other Deputies, including the Front Bench members, and succeeded in getting a copy of the Taoiseach's address, I do not know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the doctor's prescription has solved the problem but I would suggest that the Taoiseach out of common courtesy to the House should have supplied the members in the usual way with a copy of his script.  It is just too bad that that little courtesy was overlooked on such a serious matter as he seemed <Col N="1219" /> to think we were discussing.  Put very plainly, the position appears to be that we are now about to do what the Government said could not be done. We are now preparing to put a standstill on prices.</P>
      <P>For the past 18 months, Members of this House and particularly the Labour Party have been pressing the Government to tie prices.  The reply given on every occasion, and repeated a few minutes ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as something which should be referred to in passing, was that free competition would hold prices.  The people who said that, including the Minister, must be very naïve.  All of us know that free competition has not held prices.  The really annoying thing about this is that we find, just before the Dáil prepares to go into Recess, that this Bill is produced and, let me say, attempts have been made to rush it through the House while it could have been introduced, and should have been introduced, early last year.</P>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach had his tongue in his cheek yesterday afternoon when he commented that the workers would suffer no hardship, that they had in fact got the ninth round. Maybe his calendar is a bit out of date.  They got the ninth round with effect from January, 1964.  In normal circumstances, it terminates on 31st December, 1965, and there is a clause in the agreement which says that if there are abnormal increases in the cost of living index, the agreement may be terminated at any time.  I know what I am talking about because I am the only Member of this House who was, in fact, one of the negotiating team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not rather remarkable that the Taoiseach should still think that the benefit the workers got in the spring of 1964 is still effective when it was fleeced from them with the Government's permission because the green light was given to the manufacturers and to the shopkeepers as well as to the workers at that period?  Is it not remarkable that the Taoiseach should think that the workers should still have <Col N="1220" /> the benefit of the increases they then got?</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that if the measures which have been taken now had been taken in the spring of 1964 the talk of a ninth round wage increase would not be in the air and we would not have ten or twelve proposals for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Cork next week to terminate immediately the wage agreement.  It was extremely stupid of the Government to allow it to continue.  As it was, they allowed the situation to go on. They allowed the few extra shillings which were given to the workers to be taken away from them and then, when it is all gone and a little along with it, the Government say, in effect: &ldquo;You are all right now; we will tie prices and no more will be taken from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was also rather intrigued by the theme which seems to be running through all Government statements that the cause of all this trouble, the cause of the adverse trade balance increases, the cause of every evil that has befallen the country, must rest on the shoulders of the workers of the country and that when they got their £1 increase, they rushed out to buy, say, a Mercedes Benz or some sort of expensive machinery manufactured abroad which did cause a lot of trouble to the economy of the country. I think we all of us know&mdash;at least those of us who are spending the time we should spend moving around among our constituents&mdash;that the people who got the wage increase last year needed it to feed and clothe their families and, while some people did buy certain articles which they required, does anybody now suggest that, in a normal modern society, washing machines and television sets should not be bought?</P>
    <P>Over the past six months, particularly, suggestions were made by various Ministers.  I think the Minister for Transport and Power was leading the band and talking about an incomes policy but then, after he had explained it for a few minutes, everybody knew he was simply talking about a wages policy.  There is no suggestion at any time from the Government benches, <Col N="1221" /> when they are talking about tying prices and incomes, that those who are really making big money should have their incomes tied.  I think, and Deputy Corish said yesterday, that the blame for a lot of what has happened now as far as wage increases are concerned must squarely rest on the shoulders of the Government who allowed those status increases to get out of hand inside the organisation which the Government themselves control.</P>
    <P>Surely they cannot blame the £10 a week man, if he finds that somebody who got the 12 per cent the same as he did subsequently got a further £2 a week as a status increase, for expecting an additional increase and for not wanting to stay the way he was?  I think the whole thing went crazy and was allowed to go crazy because the Government wanted to have a foot in both camps at the one time and it just cannot be done.  We had a few references here to what happened in 1956.  I am a great believer in not going back on history.  I do not believe we gain very much in going back on what has happened before but I should like to say that when there was a crisis in 1956&mdash;and only time will tell whether it was more serious or less serious than the present one&mdash;the then Government got very little support or co-operation from the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry was <Col N="1222" /> not so happy a few weeks ago.  The Opposition of that day were very noisy.  They forced division after division and went around the country shouting to everybody they thought would listen that the Government of the day must go and that all the people had to do was to replace that Government with a Fianna Fáil Government. Then, all the evils that beset the country would disappear overnight. You know, when they got the opportunity, the evils did not disappear. Some of us did not wholeheartedly agree with the steps which had been taken but nevertheless we supported them because they appeared to be the only thing that could be done by the then Government and, when the present Government got into office, they sat tight and carried on and used the machinery which was put there for them.  They now come into this House and look for co-operation.</P>
      <P>I hope the situation is not as bad as the Taoiseach yesterday seemed to think it was.  I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the full facts and that we are only passing through a very mild economic storm. I hope that the gentle remedies which the Minister has referred to today will be sufficient to right it.  I assure him and the Taoiseach that the Labour Party are anxious to co-operate but I think we would be less than human if we did not point out that we got very little co-operation from them, in Opposition, when the situation was reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the prognostication of the Taoiseach about the cattle industry&mdash; what happened this year, what will happen next year&mdash;and to hear him talk of the £7 million extra we will get from cattle exports is rather amusing.  I do not know whether or not the humour of the situation has struck the Taoiseach, if he realises that a few shillings per cwt. difference in the price of beef on the British market has on occasion meant and will again mean the difference between whether or not the balance of payments is on the right side or on the wrong side.  Having that situation in mind, I think the Minister's suggestion that everything for next year <Col N="1223" /> is grand and that our cattle exports will go up by £7 million was a little bit off the beam.</P>
    <P>The hire purchase regulations suggested may be a good thing but I should like to tell the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the finance houses have already notified the motor traders&mdash; they did so a few days ago, before the Taoiseach made his statement&mdash; that they were tightening up very seriously on the money to be made available for the hire purchase of cars or of any motor vehicles.  They stated that besides the 25 per cent deposit for new cars, the amount of deposit would increase according to the age of the car and that no vehicle more than five years old would be considered for hire purchase until this blows over.  They stated that no commercial vehicles more than three years old would be considered for hire purchase.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister and the Taoiseach are aware of that. It suggests a very serious situation.  It knocks the bottom out of the used car market.  I do not know whether it will have any effect on the purchase of cars from abroad because the people who buy big, expensive cars will not be affected by the deposit they will have to pay, be it a quarter or one-tenth. Many of them pay the full price.  The Taoiseach should be aware of the phoney deposit arrangements in respect of trade-in vehicles.  For a motor bicycle worth £5, the price gets marked down as £50.  If we are to restrict hire purchase, that is one of the things we must tighten up.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how things have worsened so much over the past three months.  During the general election campaign, if anybody suggested this situation would arise, the Taoiseach and every member of his Party would have thrown a fit.  Nobody dared suggest there was economic danger in the country.  Last night I went through the speeches of Ministers and of the Taoiseach to find any hint in them that anything was wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I read them very carefully.  There was one suggestion by the Taoiseach at Kilkenny.  He stepped slightly over the line and somebody reminded him it was not the right thing and he stepped back very quickly.  He said that if there was careful budgeting, there was no need to increase taxes.  That was not repeated because when the indications from his Party appeared unfavourable, the Taoiseach forgot it and did not use it again.</P>
      <P>We were to have wonderful times: there was no question of anybody being unemployed, of anybody being short of money.  The glowing pictures painted relieved the doubts of quite a number of people who felt things were not so good.  However, many of us recalled what had been said before and we realised from what happened subsequently that we were not getting the whole truth.  Even during the Budget debate a few weeks ago, there was not any of this hairshirt and sackcloth talk we had here yesterday evening.  Why this should have transpired immediately the Budget debate had concluded makes one wonder whether once again we are being treated to another type of propaganda plan.</P>
      <P>I should not like to let the opportunity pass without mentioning one other matter.  For years we have been told that anybody who suggested foreigners were coming in and buying farms and helping the balance of payments by bringing in substantial amounts of money did not know what they were talking about.  We insisted it was happening and when the Land Bill was going through, the Minister for Lands rejected an amendment, first introduced by the Labour Party and subsequently by Fine Gael, that foreigners should not be allowed to buy land.  The present Minister for Agriculture, speaking in Galway, introduced the attitude later enshrined in section 47 which would prevent foreigners from unrestricted purchase of land in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> We now find a serious position in our balance of payments and this, I suggest, has been brought about by the action taken to stop foreigners buying land.  It does not matter how badly it affects the balance of payments position: it is much preferable to have that than to allow the sale to outsiders of Irish land because if it had continued at the level at which it had been running, more than half the land of Ireland would have passed from the hands of Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce commented here today that the Prices Act of 1958 did not give him all the powers he needed and that therefore he was seeking further powers in this Bill.  The 1958 Act was the one the then Minister for Industry and Commerce said he would have put on the shelf until there was occasion to use it.  The dust must have got so thick on that Act that the subsequent Minister could not find it.  It was very little used until the Árd Fheis wanted to know why the price of petrol had increased.  Petrol was reduced in price.  Deputy Corry wanted to know why sugar had increased in price, and sugar went down.  When somebody suggested the price of soaps should be investigated, it was investigated and they found we were not being asked to pay too much for soaps. If the Minister had faced up to his responsibilities during the past 12 to 18 months and, under the 1958 Act, investigated the prices of commodities being increased not by a few per cent but by 15 to 20 per cent, we might not have the serious situation now facing us.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Corish, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it would be possible or could be possible to hold the inquiries of the new prices body in public.  When he is replying, I should like the Taoiseach to say definitely if it is intended to hold such inquiries in public.  &ldquo;Would be or could be&rdquo; is not sufficient.  We all know how those phrases can be used, how the inquiries can finish up behind closed doors.  On the question of retrospective action, I believe it must be taken in regard to the prices of commodities which have increased <Col N="1226" /> during the past 18 months.  I suggest that the prices of all articles which have been increased abnormally since the ninth round increase in wages and salaries should be investigated by the new advisory body as quickly as possible.  If they are not, those who have jumped the gun by increasing prices will have got away with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about savings and suggested we would be obliged to depend a lot on them in the future.  Savings are all right but the Minister should remember that the interest rate on Post Office savings has not been altered for so long that it does not appear to attract people as it did a few years ago.  If the Minister wants to provide a new incentive to saving, he should do something to have the interest rate on Post Office savings, the poor man's method of saving, increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of an effort to tie wages.  The Taoiseach said it was in the interest of preserving workers' jobs not to look for more wages.  I do not know whether he realised he was not directing his remarks to Members of the House or to the trade unions but to people like the members of the Labour Court whose job it is now to investigate and make recommendations on serious disputes before them.  I do not know whether or not he appreciates the fact that what he said here yesterday evening may result in very serious trade disputes occurring almost immediately.  All trade disputes that take place eventually have to be settled one way or the other.  It was a rather unfortunate expression used by the Taoiseach yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>After all, if the Government are going to depend on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to try to get restraint from their members&mdash;and it is going to be pretty hard to ask people who got £1 last year and have had 25/-taken off them in the past 18 months to sit tight and not look for any more &mdash;it will be extremely difficult to get these people to hold on, but if in addition to that, it can be proven that they are entitled to an increase and, in an oblique way, the people who are <Col N="1227" /> recommending whether or not the increase should be granted are being told that they must hold the line, a very serious wrong can have been done and if anything can be done to remedy it, that should be done.</P>
    <P>I do not know what discussions the Minister had with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' executive.  I am told there was not very much discussed.  I am told the Minister had not very much to say when he was there.  He does not normally say much.  The Minister must be frank with the Congress. If things are as bad as the Taoiseach says they are, the full facts should be put before them.  It is not enough just to come along and pass a few compliments.</P>

      <P>It did not say that if things got worse, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, the Dáil would be recalled.  Do not forget that we are now giving power to the Minister to tie prices.  Would the Minister tell me for what reason the Dáil would be recalled if things got worse if it is not to make an attempt also to tie wages? Maybe the Taoiseach, when he is replying to the debate, would answer that one because it appears to be pretty obvious that the threat of going a little further, while not stipulated in so many words, did indicate that intention. <Col N="1228" /> That is what is likely to do the harm.</P>
      <P>Finally, I may say that I hope the present crisis&mdash;call it what you like&mdash; does not tie up the housing programme, does not create a situation where the people who are at present attempting to get money to build houses will find that they are being put in the same position as those who have been refused already by the building societies.  I hope it does not mean that the housing programme will stop and that because of the withdrawal of money from such schemes, we will find ourselves in a far more serious crisis.  Instead of the Government spending money for the purpose of trying to keep things going, they are going to tighten the purse strings and prevent those who have very little from getting any more.  That is actually what is intended when the banks are told to tie up credit.  The usual thing is that they call in the small man who has borrowed a couple of hundred pounds and do not mind the fellow who has borrowed £50,000 &mdash;he is big enough and they can trust him.  The little fellow is restricted in credit.  It is not the little fellows who are causing the trouble.  The Government should remember that, if trouble there is.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is not exactly what we thought it would be, at the same time we have been preaching to the Government, particularly over the past 18 months, that price restriction was necessary, that prices should be tied if we are to have any stability in our economy.  Even the little bit that is coming now may be better than nothing at all.</P>

      <P>When we were listening to the soothing syrup which was being dispensed by the Minister for Industry and commerce today, I began to wonder if these men had already manifested the yellow streak that runs through them and were already running away from the Taoiseach's speech of the previous day.  Judged by the Minister for Industry and Commerce this morning, there is no very serious problem confronting the nation at all and that speech is made 12 hours after <Col N="1229" /> the Taoiseach informed the House yesterday that &mdash; and I am quoting from a note:</P>
      <P>It is of critical importance to the future progress of the country, to the maintenance of employment and to the protection of the standard of living of our workers that there should not be any further general inflation of personal incomes of any kind until the external payments deficit is reduced to manageable proportions and until production is again moving up at the necessary rate on the basis of competitive costs.  I could not put this any more strongly.  It is essential that all of us, Government, Deputies, trade union leaders and everybody try by every means to spread understanding of how serious this situation can become.</P>
      <P>That is one significant paragraph in the Taoiseach's speech.  The other was where he described the steady erosion of our resources.  Having hawked our country, our land and our assets to the foreigner for cash, the Taoiseach now announces the intention of the Irish Government.  Let me get the words:</P>
      <P>The Central Bank will continue, as the lender of last resort, to supply sterling reserves to the commercial banks to maintain both private and public credit needs.  We are considering the practicability and desirability of easing our present difficulties by borrowing abroad.  All the evidence so far available to us makes-it clear that foreign borrowing is not likely to be practicable on a scale which would make a significant difference to our present circumstances....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now jumped to the stage that, having hawked whatever we could sell for cash, we are now hawking our credit around the countries of Europe and can find no takers.  Compare that with this affirmation on 19th March 1965&mdash;this was not a speech addressed to a public meeting at a street corner or to a limited company; it was addressed to the Irish people on television so that everyone in the country might hear, study and believe: &ldquo;The tide in Ireland's affairs has <Col N="1230" /> reached the flood,&rdquo; said the Taoiseach. &ldquo;We must sail out capably to new horizons.&rdquo;  We certainly are sailing to a horizon that this country never knew before when we hawk the credit of Ireland through every banker's back parlour in Zurich and elsewhere and can find no takers.  Were those the new horizons we were told Lemass would lead on to?  When I look at the poor dupes sitting behind him, who really believed the kind of tripe that was being given out by the Taoiseach in the course of the general election and who are now beginning to understand the morass into which they have been led, I almost despair of this country.</P>
    <P>Paraphrasing Shakespeare, the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>There comes a tide in the affairs of every nation which must be taken at the flood.  The tide is with us now. It is at the flood and we must not leave our ship of State in the harbour to people who do not know how to operate it and who would not know where to take it.</P>
    <P>That was 19th March, 1965&mdash;four short months ago.  Today, he has the effrontery to come into this House and tell us, having led on for four months, that we are now hawking our credit through the continent of Europe and can find no takers.  That has never happened since this State was founded.</P>
    <P>I want to state quite deliberately that, in my judgment, this Prices Bill is the purest eyewash and that there is no man in this House more convinced of that than the Leader of the Government.  He has had the effrontery and unscrupulous audacity to introduce a Prices Bill to try to take the heat off himself, a heat which is the consequence of his own perfidy and fraud.  This Prices Bill is like a sailor hammering strips of tin on the bottom of a row boat over the gunwales of which the tide is beginning to pour.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is continuing to soar, the adverse balance of trade is stated to be £150 million and the imbalance in our balance of payments is estimated at over £50 million this year.  The net external assets of the joint stock banks are being depleted, exports are declining and our imports <Col N="1231" /> rising.  How are we to believe these figures?  The Taoiseach comes in here and estimates a decline in our balance of payments.  Four months ago, he was stating the exact opposite of what he is saying today.  Are we to listen to his falsehoods now or to his falsehoods of four months ago?  Is he speaking any more truthfully today than he was speaking four months ago?  I do not know and nobody else in this House knows.  I forecast for him four months ago, and 12 months ago, the inevitable consequences of his perfidy and these consequences have now come about. We do not know the facts and we cannot ascertain the true facts.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the time has come, in my judgement, to tell the House the real facts so that we may realise the full gravity of the situation. I do not accept the estimate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I think the country is on the threshold of a much more serious crisis than it has ever been since the State was founded, with possibly the exception of the civil war.  It is time this House realised the true nature of the perfidious fraud which the Taoiseach has perpetrated and realised that it is as a result of his shameless traffic in our people's votes and our people's confidence that we find ourselves in the disastrous situation in which we are today.</P>
    <P>As I was listening to the Taoiseach yesterday, I asked myself if anybody here had ever seen a gambler's hand pinned to the table as he tried to palm an ace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Hansard has quite a lot about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Official Debates of Dáil Éireann also have quite a lot about it.  Events have pinned the Taoiseach's hand to the table as he sought to palm the ace and the years have exposed the conspiracy of which his conduct has constituted a part.  I believe the Taoiseach embarked on the last general election in the belief that he was going to lose it.  I believe that he hoped that by scraping the <Col N="1232" /> bottom of every barrel, that by spending every farthing the State disposed of, he believed he could create a situation of such utter impossibility that no Government could follow him.  He hoped, up to the time Deputy Corish made his speech in Tullamore, that he would be succeeded by an inter-Party Government and that because of the appalling situation in which he had left the country, that Government would not be able to carry on.</P>
      <P>I believe he hoped that by using these unscrupulous methods he would drive such a Government out of office in a limited period and that then he would return himself as a knight in shining armour with the intention of passing over the Government to his son-in-law, Deputy Haughey, at the earliest available opportunity.  We all realise that certain actions are legitimate in politics, but when a thing like this is done at the expense of the existence of our people, it becomes a crime against this country.  I believe that this gamble of the Taoiseach's was made at the expense of our people and I believe that our people will have to pay an appalling price for it.  The Taoiseach has allowed us to drift into a position of acute difficulty in which, when we go looking for money in the back bank doors of Europe, we are told it is not available to us.</P>
      <P>It is a deplorable thing to see an Irish Government sell the country, and our country has been sold and is being sold to conceal the adverse balance of payments situation.  It is truly dreadful when our own Government are constrained to offer the country for sale generally and to find no bidders, to find our Government sell the country and not even get paid for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this Government, as evinced by the conduct of the Minister for Industry and Commerce here today, are only too ready not to face up to the true situation confronting the country today.  There are examples before us in the world today as to what can happen in such a situation. In the whole Continent of South America, there was not a more stable state than Colombia five years ago. It was then true to say that Colombia <Col N="1233" /> was one of the most stable states in the Continent of America.  Four years ago Colombia began to travel the path we are now travelling.  People often ask themselves what has happened but here we have an object lesson before us.  In that stable state of Colombia, capital first began to emigrate.  Factories began to close down.  Do not forget the GEC factory in Dundalk, the Sykes enterprise in west Cork, the factory at Shannon.  Do not forget certain other factories which at this moment are showing grave disquiet and instability.</P>
    <P>Unemployment grew in Colombia. In that country there was not the safety valve of emigration that this country has traditionally employed. As unemployment grew in Colombia, disorder began to develop and at this moment Colombia is on the verge of revolution.  That is not the dialectic that will be followed here because here you do not get mass unemployment. What you get here is mass emigration. I warned this House before, that in the last seven years of Fianna Fáil government, this country lost between 250,000 and 300,000 of its young people between the ages of 18 and 30. If we have another mass emigration on that scale, this country will be no longer viable.  There will not be left enough productive citizens in this country to carry the essential services that a civilised society requires if it is to survive as a viable entity.  There will not be enough earning power left to pay the old age pensions, to pay for education, to pay for the health services, to pay for the other indispensable requirements of a 20th century society.  When that time comes this country's independence, not only its economic but its political independence, will be gravely jeopardised. That is all the work of a cheap gamble which, in order to buy votes and capture political advantage, has put the whole foundation of this State in peril.</P>
    <P>There is no escape from that indictment when you read the description given by the Taoiseach, presumably with the full knowledge at his disposal as head of the Government, to the Irish people of the then state of the <Col N="1234" /> economy and his estimate of what the state of the economy was going to be, given over Telefís Éireann last March, and then compare that with the statement he made to the House here yesterday.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk&mdash;and it is prudent to learn wisdom from the past&mdash;about the parallel that exists between our situation today and the situation which obtained in 1956. There is one fundamental difference. We got into financial difficulties spending too much money on building houses.  I am delighted we got into difficulties spending too much money on building houses and if I were in government tomorrow I would cheerfully take the same risk before I would put my neighbours into Griffith Barracks.  I have no apology to make for it and I glory in the fact that when the present Taoiseach came into office he told the House that he interviewed Dublin Corporation, and Dublin Corporation said to him: &ldquo;We have too many houses.  The last administration built so many houses that we have 1,500 houses vacant on our hands.&rdquo; That is the glorious monument to the memory of men like Bill Norton, Tim Murphy and Michael Keyes who were our associates in the inter-Party Government. When I hear Deputy O'Leary sneering at the memory of men like Deputy Norton, Deputy Keyes and Deputy Tim Murphy who killed himself working to house the people of this country, it makes me physically sick.  Deputy Corish and Deputy Everett, while they survive, can defend themselves against the sneers of Deputy O'Leary but my former colleagues, Deputy Norton, Deputy Keyes and Deputy Tim Murphy are no longer here to defend themselves, and if nobody else raises a voice to praise them for what they did, I will, and if Deputy O'Leary does not like it he can lump it.</P>
    <P>We did get into financial difficulties to house our people and when we saw these difficulties we met them and overcame them within one twelve months and faced the political unpopularity of doing it.  The Fianna Fáil Party did everything in their power to exacerbate those difficulties <Col N="1235" /> and enlarge them.  They claimed that loans floated by our Government had failed to fill owing to the insolvency of the State while many of their members knew very well that it was due to the fortuitous circumstance of our loan being issued the day before the British bank rate went up by one per cent that the loan failed to fill, being unsuitably timed in the money market.</P>
    <P>However, the underwriters took up the loan and the shares were sold on the Stock Exchange without the slightest difficulty.  In exactly the same circumstances loans of the present Government failed to fill.  Were they derided in public that the credit of the State was gone?  They were not.  They were sustained by the Opposition in this House who, knowing the true nature of the facts, were more concerned to protect the public credit of this country than they were to secure a cheap political advantage over their political opponents.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Lands doing all in his power to shake the foundation of the credit of the State, although after one short twelve months we had converted an adverse balance of payments into one of the first favourable balances of payments recorded in the history of this country since the State was founded.  In 1957 the balance of payments showed a balance in favour of this country of £12 million and instead of realising that the situation we had been called upon to face in 1956 was corrected, it was this Government in the text of their own publication that announced they were going to stop building houses, that they were going to stop social investment.  It was that that precipitated or inaugurated the vast wave of emigration that carried between 250,000 and 300,000 of our people out of this country in the past seven years.</P>
    <P>I warn this House that our present situation is critical in the last degree. I cordially agree with the Taoiseach in his estimate of the situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a nice decent fellow but he knows as much about the Department of <Col N="1236" /> Industry and Commerce and national finance as my foot, or substantially less.  He may know about soothing drops for children.  He may have learned from his distinguished father and grandfather before him, who both adorned the profession to which he belongs, that it is important for a physician when he takes his fee to resolve positively that he will not do any harm, but that is scarcely the appropriate requirement in a Minister for Industry and Commerce of this country at the critical stage at which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>This at least must be said, that the Taoiseach, after all the gambling and the palmed cards, after all the twisting and fraud he has practised on the public, knows the facts.  He always knew them and his version of them as recorded to this House last night is much nearer the truth than that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. However, I am glad to hear the House is not going home this week.  It would have shocked me to think that Dáil Éireann was calmly going off on holidays having been informed of the facts which have been brought to our attention.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a tragedy that this information cannot be furnished to the country as a whole as a result of the suspension of the daily newspapers. It is a tragedy that the versions of the proceedings of this House which are provided by Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann are grossly inadequate.  I did not listen last night but I understand that the report of the proceedings consisted almost exclusively of a report of the Taoiseach's speech without any reference to the speech of the leader of the Opposition or the speech of the leader of the Labour Party.  That is, of course, a gross scandal, and deplorable, and creates a situation with which we will have to deal when the time comes in this House, but in the interim in the absence of the newspapers it is catastrophic that there should be none because I do not believe the people of the country have any understanding of what the true situation is.</P>
    <P>Forty-nine per cent of them voted <Col N="1237" /> for this man who told them &ldquo;the tide is with us now.  It is at the flood, and we must lead our ship of State to harbour&rdquo;&mdash;these people who do not know how to navigate and would not know where to take it.  They read the poster up and down the country &ldquo;Let Lemass lead on&rdquo; but they do not know now and they cannot understand whither the tide has led them.  I think that at this moment we stand at the very nadir of our experience as a nation, and it is humiliating that one has to look around this House and say in one's heart &ldquo;the fools, the fools, the fools, they have actively concerned themselves to sell all they could lay their hands on&rdquo;.  Now we are face to face with the problem, are we going to prepare the supreme final treason of selling for money what was bought with blood?  That is the question we have to ask ourselves, because you are very near the point when that bargain is going to be proposed.  I never believed that I would sit in a Parliament where I could see a serious threat of such a proposition being entertained.  If that day has come, let us fix the responsibility firmly where it belongs, on Fianna Fáil.  We are entitled to ask them, we have a duty to ask them, what must we do to retrieve the situation in which our country finds itself today?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the best solution would be to get rid of Fianna Fáil, and I say that deliberately because I would not trust the Gospel from their lips hereafter.  They trade in falsehood, and the quotations which we have made here today manifest for all of us that they trade in falsehoods and cannot be trusted.  I can say, looking now from the outside, that I would have formed a Government to get those fellows out and I think we would have formed a Government successfully but for the speech made by Deputy Corish at Tullamore.  I think that he persuaded a sufficient number of our people to vote for those people, for this collection.  They felt that if Deputy Corish and his Party ran away from the responsibility of Government there was no possibility of finding an alternative to the present collection. That is why we have a Fianna Fáil <Col N="1238" /> Government, and every man who loses his employment, every man who bears the burden of the rising spiral of costs, every man who feels tonight that his job is in jeopardy and that the menace of emigration hangs over him again&mdash; this is largely the result of the Tullamore speech.  We have to face that.  I do not know whether the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You may have to travel the road other countries have travelled, that Colombia is now travelling.  If you think that you have not men of the calibre to fill the position of an alternative Government you might wake up to your astonishment some day and find that you have no country left and you are unable to participate in Irish public life at all.  That is a risk that I would be very slow to take with my own country.  If we are in the position that there is no alternative to this gang, where do we go from here? Have Irish parliamentary institutions broken down?  Is it impossible to put them out?  Is it impossible to supply our people with an alternative to the Fianna Fáil Party?  If it is, then we have arrived at an exercise in futility which justifies the gloomy prophecies of the worst enemies that this country ever had.  I remember, not personally but vicariously, Bloody Balfour proclaiming that if the Irish were given self-Government they would not be able to govern themselves.  Our fathers and grandfathers derided him when he made that prophecy.  Does the Labour Party now claim that it was not a lie? I am saying that you are face to face with the fact that this Government has <Col N="1239" /> brought us to the verge of catastrophe. Are we now in the position that this Parliament has no alternative to it to offer?  If so, then this Parliament has failed in its purpose.  The moment a free deliberative assembly finds itself in a position where there is no alternative to the administration which has bought the votes of the people by fraud, then democracy has ceased to function.  There is the danger which I cannot help feeling regarding the position of the Labour Party, which claimed the traditional prerogative of power without responsibility.  I leave it to the Deputy to imagine who traditionally claimed that power.  I think it is common knowledge.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the best thing that could happen would be to clear Fianna Fáil out, because I believe that the people have utterly lost confidence in them.  But make yourself ready for this&mdash;it may take the concerted action of every Deputy in this House to preserve the integrity of this State.  That is the position in which we at present stand.  There is the man who is solely responsible for this situation. He knew it, and I think he is the only one of his colleagues with the intelligence to understand it.  He deliberately gambled with the economic life of this country for the political advantage of himself and his own people.  That is a terrible indictment to make of him.  I believe that he was primarily concerned with the political advantage of the Party of which he is now leader and secondarily, with securing the succession of the present Minister for Agriculture to the post of Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that to have risked all that which has been put at risk for those base purposes, is a terrible crime against this country.  I warned this House long ago that they were dealing with a gamblers' Government, led by a gambler.  I say that he is not thinking of the welfare of his country but of the welfare of his Party.  The price of that is terrible, but the tragedy of it is that it is a price which will be paid by simple people who do not understand where the evil that has come <Col N="1240" /> upon them had its origin.  The danger of it is that you may get a situation evolving here such as evolved elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that Battista came before Castro in Cuba.  I can remember a time when the Republic of Cuba was a stable and immensely wealthy Republic.  I was a witness of the Republic of Cuba being a place in which decent people turned their backs upon politics, with the result that a situation ultimately evolved in which popular election could there throw up a character like Battista.  Remember, Battista was popularly elected in his last Administration because standards were so low that he could suborn the welfare of the State, and of the people, and of everything else, to secure his own personal advantage until ultimately the people of Cuba became so revolted by the situation that they themselves had allowed to transpire within the democratic State that they cheerfully received the military dictatorship of Señor Castro as preferable, detestable as it was, to what they themselves had created in the Battista Administration; and it was too late when they woke up to the fact that they had delivered into the hands of the Communist stooge the freedom that they had enjoyed before they sold it.</P>
    <P>Now those very people who failed the Cuban people are themselves refugees scattered like refuse on the shores of any country that will receive them.  But the mass of the simple people of Cuba were left behind to face the consequences.  We will not go the road of Cuba, but we could reach the stage in which the institutions of this State would collapse if people once became convinced that Oireachtas Éireann was no longer capable of functioning.</P>
    <P>I once said to a man, who shall be nameless, that when he left this House he left after him the potential of Government as compared with the President of the French Republic who had created a situation in France in which such a potential would not exist when he no longer was.  It would be a catastrophe if that potential to <Col N="1241" /> provide a Government, and an alternative, were frittered away by wild folly. The magnitude of the crisis which the Taoiseach so baldly described in his statement yesterday shows the danger in which we stand.  My apprehension is that Deputies do not really understand it.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach is beginning to play politics again.  I think he sent in this mild-mannered man, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make the kind of drooling speech he made here this morning, knowing that it would in some degree offset the shock his speech gave his own supporters last night.  It is patent that he is beginning to recall now the obligations that his own grave misdeeds have placed upon him.  I want to tell the House that the picture painted by the Taoiseach yesterday is in no sense an exaggeration of the real situation.  I think he underestimates the urgency of the measures that may be required to cure it.  I say to the Labour Party that they ought to examine their consciences. They have a part to play in the government of this country.  They cannot forever sit washing their hands on the sideline and claiming the prerogative of Parliament without accepting responsibility.  I say to all the Deputies of this House that they should not forget that we represent the people.  And it is the people who matter.  The people now are in dire straits and the danger in which they stand is that of being driven out of their own country.  If they go, then the independence we enjoy today will be also in dire danger.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that Fianna Fáil can be trusted to meet the emergency in which we at present find ourselves. I would be happier to see an alternative Government taking over from them and cleaning up the detestable mess they have made.  I believe that to be necessary because the falsehoods on which Fianna Fáil at present stand invalidate their potential as a useful Government in this country.  I believe an alternative Government could be found in this Dáil and I believe that those who fail to form it will have much to answer for to the country's posterity.  Above all, in the last <Col N="1242" /> analysis, do not let the country go down and founder in the swamp of fraud and deceit into which the present Government has led it.  It may take the combined efforts of all to drag the country out but, if they are needed, we shall provide them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I welcome the statement made yesterday by the Taoiseach.  It was the call of the captain to his team to show the true team spirit in an effort to overcome the present adverse economic trends.  The substantial rise in imports and the serious decline in exports call for very positive action. We should set the headline to the people generally by example and exhortation.  We should, in our contact with the people, emphasise the necessity for refraining from purchasing the consumer goods mentioned by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to increasing exports, I suggest the setting-up of a professional sales force, attached to Córas Tráchtála, if necessary, manned by personnel with the ability to go out into the world markets as the first line of attack directed towards selling our products abroad.  Anyone familiar with sales management will tell you that the most difficult sales are always the first sales.  I believe nothing but good would result from the setting up of a body such as I suggest.  Selling our goods abroad should not be left to the chosen few, the managing director of a company, the favourite son of an executive, who will receive a bonus by sending his son abroad to sell the firm's products on new world markets. The body I suggest would be the equivalent of the Pioneer Sales Force in America.  In England there is at the moment a firm which specialises in this form of pioneer sales force selling. In actual fact, Erin Foods, to the best of my knowledge, utilised this firm when they were launching their products on the English market.  I cannot stress too strongly the absolutely vital necessity to have these trained salesmen at the disposal of Irish manufacturers, available for utilisation in any way that our Government or our firms see fit.  Having had a certain amount <Col N="1243" /> of experience myself in that form of selling, I can see that the amount of potential that is opened up by the proper type of salesman going out and bringing his product in the proper fashion before the public and making the right contacts with firms with which he wants to do business, is amazing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also spoken about the reduction in the net inflow of capital and this caused a contraction in our external reserves.  Also, unfortunately, it had the side effect of restricting the abilities of the banks to lend at the rate they had been lending and especially to continue the same level of lending as last year.  I wonder if it would be possible for the Government to consider ways and means of attracting new capital here by, say, doing away with death duties altogether or by giving some tax concession to people who bank on deposit in this country.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the rate of industrial production is, I think, due in some way to the success of the Buy Irish campaign which, in my opinion, made some manufacturers very complacent and therefore they did not go out into the export market as vigorously as they should have done. Instead, they relied on home markets and cut down production to meet the needs of the home market rather than take the risk of producing sufficient to sell by export.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with wage demands which in some cases, to the best of my knowledge, contravene existing agreements, and with wild-cat strikes.  It never ceases to amaze me that some trade union officials, and indeed Deputies of the Labour Party, can stand up and tell management exactly how they should run their business and all the things laid down in the various booklets for the successful running of this type of business.  I wish the trade unions and the Labour Deputies would try to put their own house in order first and get some control over the impossible few who can, by their irresponsible action, disrupt the whole economy and in most cases <Col N="1244" /> cause very severe hardship to the majority of workers who are hardworking, honest and God-fearing men. If these unions cannot restrain their own members and control them, it is high time we brought in some legislation to control wild-cat strikes and impose penalties, if necessary, on people responsible for this type of strike.</P>
    <P>The bright factors in the Taoiseach's speech are the continued building up of the breeding herds as a result of the heifer subsidy scheme and the large increase in the number of young cattle in the country which augurs very well for the future and also the expectation of a recovery later on this year in our cattle exports and the substantial increase the Taoiseach envisages for next year.</P>
    <P>Another heartening feature as far as I was concerned in the Taoiseach's speech was the enterprise shown by him in resisting what must have been a very strong temptation to adopt a negative attitude as the British Government did in imposing tariffs on imports. Instead, he introduced imaginative aids by way of grants to those exporters who were prepared to go out and seek new business and a graduated incentive in relation to their new business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that all these democratic measures in the Prices Bill will be sufficient to restrain and contain the present adverse trends.</P>

    <P>When I heard him talking about the amount of emigration and the number of emigrants we have at present <Col N="1245" /> and when I think of his activities in that line, I wonder, because he was the gentleman who stood up here and solemnly proposed that the four sugar factories supplying the country with sugar today should be abolished and said the amount we would save by importing foreign refined sugar would enable him to increase the children's allowance from 2/6 to 5/- for every child in the country.  Of course the emigration of the 7,000 or 8,000&mdash;I might say 10,000 including transport services and so on&mdash;at present employed and getting a living in the sugar factories and in the fields would not matter to Deputy Dillon.  We can remember that one gentleman at present in the Fine Gael front bench, Deputy Fitzpatrick, owes his advent to public life through an election address in which he announced the firm intention of the Fine Gael Government to close down Rushbrooke Dockyard and throw 1,000 men out of employment.  We had that also.</P>
    <P>After all, Deputy Dillon did succeed in smashing two Governments here in his time.  I was rather amused at his invitation to Labour Deputies now, considering the invitation he gave them previously to a reduction in wages and a reduction in social services when he had them in his net as part of a Coalition Government.  It is satisfactory to find that in facing the present upset we have a Leader and a Government who are going to remain there and see this through.  We are not going to have an overnight disappearance of a Government and a Minister for Finance such as we had on the last occasion in 1956 and the previous occasion when we had financial trouble.  Anyone who studies the booklet issued to Deputies every month containing details of our imports will see where the trouble arises.  As a producer myself, I have a decided objection to seeing my cattle and those of my people, our butter and eggs, going across to pay for £1 million worth of musical instruments brought in here for the pop singers during the past 12 months.  It is time the Government took measures to stop that.  Anyone going through that list and cutting out unnecessary <Col N="1246" /> imports would get us on an even keel in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I suggested here on another occasion that shopkeepers selling foreign goods should be compelled to display a notice in their windows stating the percentage of Irish goods stocked.  I did that after bitter experience.  With a colleague, I went into one of the largest shops in this city.  A man there wanted to bring home a couple of pairs of nylons.  He walked out of that shop with three pairs of British nylons. He was offered nothing else.  I was not involved but I was so bitter I asked for a pair of Irish socks and I was told they were not stocked.  That was in one of the largest retail drapery shops in this city.  Then we wonder why our adverse balance is high.  Those people should be compelled to display in their windows the fact that they are not stocking Irish goods.  It is very little use for anybody in this House or anywhere else appealing to people to buy Irish when we have that state of affairs in our towns and cities.  I do not know whether it is that the commission on foreign goods is higher to the retailer, but the fact remains that they are anxious to sell foreign goods here.  I was glad to see that the representatives of the people remembered it even in the Seanad election this time.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to call attention is the advertising on Telefís Éireann.  I suggest that those interested get a stopwatch and check the time Telefís Éireann devote in their advertising periods to the advertising of foreign goods competing with ours as compared with the time they devote to advertising Irish products. I would also like to call attention to the large amount of foreign goods being brought in here by British-based industries with branches here.  We have too much of that.</P>
    <P>I regret that the representatives of agriculture are not being called in on this.  However, I must frankly admit that on every occasion the representatives of agriculture required to see our Minister, they were always able to see him and discuss matters with him.  Since we are the people apparently who will have to pull the fat out <Col N="1247" /> of the fire with more production and exports, I suggest that consultations be not confined to the farmers' organisation but that the creamery milk suppliers and the sugar growers should be called in periodically for consultation with the Minister.</P>
    <P>As one in charge of an industry that was driven to strike, I have a certain sympathy for strikes.  There is a limit. We agricultural producers are the lowest paid section of the community. The costings for agricultural labour are less than £7 per week. When you have a refusal to pay the price on the basis of those costings, and which has been paid from 1948 up to this year, there is no other refuge left to the producers but to have a showdown.  I was grateful to the Minister for Agriculture for interfering in that and for his straightforward approach.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency which is very largely industrialised.  I am proud of the action of the Taoiseach in regard to industry in that constituency. I am proud of the manner in which he has nursed them and has sustained them.  We now have industries in those towns where they had nothing to offer our people but the emigrant ship.  We have, in those towns today, industries which are giving full employment despite the efforts by Deputy Dillon and his associates to close down those industries and create further unemployment in the country.</P>
    <P>We are going through a difficult period.  We are going through a period when we will have, so to speak, to halt as far as increases in prices go.  I would suggest also that those who would take advantage of the condition of affairs when we are having a review of prices should be called in to give an account of themselves as to the grounds on which they increased prices.  That is essential.  I would suggest that we have a more even keel.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to see that a bill last Monday for consultants' fees on a reconstruction job was £18,000.  Two or three satellites added to him brought the fee up to £28,000.  That <Col N="1248" /> was for the paper work of a job.  We have seen that here before.  The cake is not being evenly divided and it is time a halt was called as far as some of those gentlemen are concerned. They are largely responsible for the high cost of housing and the reason we have not proper houses for our people.  The paper gentlemen are the cause of this.  It is time a halt was called on those gentlemen.  The grounds for a charge of £18,000 for a little reconstruction job should be examined.  The labour that went into that job should also be examined.  I saw one bill in connection with the building of a bridge and the consultants' fees were £80,000.  The bridge cost £300,000.</P>

      <P>This is not the Taoiseach's Estimate.  This is a question of prices.  I suggest, when we are holding down prices, that we examine the manner in which the loaf is cut and that we examine the reasons for it. This thing will have to be widened so that we will have grounds for examining the reasons for the high costs.  I have given one of the very definite reasons for the high costs today.  It is not the cost of labour and not the cost of the ordinary worker.  It is the cost of the white-collared gentlemen who believe in getting rich quick.  Those people are largely responsible for the 30 per cent increase in imported motor cars as well.  It is time we got down to those things and examined them.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House any further except to say I am glad, in a period when we are in difficulties, we have a Government who are prepared to stay there, work it out and find the proper solution.</P>

      <P>I hoped the Deputy would go on to the logical end of his argument in that respect.  Unfortunately he was too overcome by a problem of his own to do so.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach in introducing this Estimate tried to make the commercial community the scapegoat for the Government's blundering.  He tried to make the commercial community the scapegoat for the failure of the Government, and the failure of the Taoiseach in particular, in relation to his own fraudulent deception of the people over recent years.</P>
      <P>The speech he made yesterday was such a confession of failure as might have been made by Khrushchev and Malenkov when they were getting up in the Presidium and making a public confession of their failures in the hope of avoiding the punishment normally meted out in those countries.  One thing after another, one plan after another made by the Government had gone wrong.  It was indeed dismal reading to read through this speech.  It was dismal reading to read through it the way in which he failed, adequately or properly, to face up to his own responsibility and the responsibility of his Government for what has transpired.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that in criticising the failure of the Government to meet the situation at the appropriate time or in the appropriate way and the failure now to tell the truth in relation to that situation, I intend to do it in a critical and a constructive way.  I do not intend to follow the lines followed by any of the people from the Front Benches opposite when they were on the Front Benches on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can remember then, and the records will show it, the efforts Deputy Moran, as he then was, made to stampede the devaluation of the Irish pound with his questions and supplementary questions.  We can remember the manner in which Deputy Blaney, as he then was, deliberately tried, with some assistance from Deputy MacEntee, to prevent the Taoiseach speaking at all on the Taoiseach's <Col N="1250" /> Estimate at that time.  The leader of the Mafia, as he now is, the Minister for Local Government, as I must properly call him, then went out of his way deliberately to attempt to prevent the Taoiseach speaking on the economic ills of that time.  Then we had that petulant fit of temper yesterday from the Taoiseach when he was asked a couple of questions.</P>
    <P>I can remember, too, the manner in which Deputy O'Malley, as he then was, now Minister for Health, endeavoured to break up the building industry.  I can remember, too, the manner in which a certain housing job was criticised.  It was not done in a properly critical, constructive manner.  The line taken by the former Deputy Briscoe, who was then Lord Mayor of Dublin, aided by another Deputy, was deliberately to sabotage the small dwellings loans scheme.  I can even remember the manner in which the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party sat back himself and got his minions to throw dirt around.</P>
    <P>There will not be any of that anti-national sabotage from Fine Gael on this occasion when the Government and the nation find themselves in difficulties, but there will be plenty of critical analysis and a detailed examination of the manner in which the Government have failed in their duty, and failed because they were prepared to put their own Party interests before the interests of the nation.  Yesterday in relation to the Prices Bill, the Taoiseach tried to place the blame in that context.  He also deliberately tried to place the blame for the problems with which we are beset on the commercial community.  The fact of course is, as we all know, that these problems were generated by the Taoiseach himself in the first place, and were certainly accentuated by the actions and the line he and the Government have been taking.</P>
    <P>In any situation in which a Government may find themselves from time to time, there is always an obligation to be entirely straight with the people, but I am afraid the Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1251" /> cannot live up to that standard. In the general election in 1957, they made a pretence to the people that they only had to wave the magic wand of putting a Fianna Fáil Government in power for everything to be remedied overnight.  I think history will show that the reason we had a recession after the balance of payments had been brought into line by March, 1957, was that the Fianna Fáil Party had sapped public confidence by suggesting that everything would change overnight if we had a change of Government. Of course there was far more to be done than merely that.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the by-elections in February, 1964, a year and a half ago, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party went out of his way to suggest that we were floating ahead with such wonderful economic progress that we could afford to do virtually anything we liked, and that we would be able to digest it from an economic point of view.  It is perfectly clear now&mdash;and the Taoiseach has impliedly admitted it is clear&mdash;that what was done at that time was done for the purpose of gaining political advantage for the Fianna Fáil Party and ensuring that they would win the two by-elections in Cork and Kildare.  During the last general election, the Taoiseach in a speech, in Drogheda, I think, said that he would take any action to ensure the return to office of Fianna Fáil, and he made it clear that he was not going to take the people into his confidence as to the true state of the national economy.  Now Nemesis has caught up with him and he has had to make an explanation, but the explanation is too late, and it is contradictory of everything said by the Government during the past year, and particularly during the past few months.</P>
    <P>It is not as if no one else saw that these dangers were abroad.  The Central Bank made it clear in their April, 1965, report, that the increase in imports gave rise to serious problems. In our policy published during the general election, we made it clear that we considered a most important aspect in financing Government expenditure is the state of the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> We were beginning to be worried then, but the Government were prepared to rush on regardless.</P>
    <P>The report of OECD issued in March, 1965, made quite clear on almost every page the danger signs they saw, where they referred to the slowing down of output&mdash;a matter to which the Taoiseach referred only yesterday&mdash;where they referred to widespread increases in prices, where they referred to the capital inflow, which, they said, included some short-term funds from Britain which it was pretty obvious would not remain here indefinitely, where they referred critically to the rise in Budget Estimates and to the drop in exports, and where they suggested there should be a phased incomes policy which, I might add, had been suggested from this side of the House as far back as two years ago in discussions which are on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>Even though all these warning signs were there, the Taoiseach and the Government not merely ignored them but decided they would add fuel to the fire.  I am prepared to take each one of the 11 headings the Taoiseach took in his speech yesterday and show categorically that, in relation to almost every one of the steps which he indicated must be taken, what has been done by the Government in the past six months has been the reverse of the safety procedure, the reverse of the procedure he has now adumbrated, the reverse of the procedure which would have stopped these difficulties from coming upon us so acutely.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach started off by saying the Government proposed to reduce Government capital expenditure to the amount provided under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> What are the facts?  In 1964-65 the public capital programme out-turn was £1,700,000 in excess of the Second Programme estimate.  In the quarter ending 30th June of this year, the figures published by the Department of Finance show that the issues above and below the line were £4,390,000 more than last year, and last year was ahead of the Programme. Even two weeks ago the Government <Col N="1253" /> were on a different course.  They now suddenly find themselves in the position of having to change course. Incidentally, I should also add that there was one significant note in the Department of Finance return of 30th June, which was that the deferment of tobacco duty was some £426,000 less than last year.</P>
    <P>Even taking capital expenditure as announced for this year we find in the Budget a contradiction of the correct analysis published in the Capital Budget memo for 1965.  In case Deputy de Valera, who, I gather, will follow me, feels that this is being wise after the event, I invite him to read volume 215, No.9 of the Official Debates of 12th May last and he will find that these criticisms were all made then in detail.  I said categorically that unless these steps were taken along some lines, we would find ourselves one day flat up against it.  We find ourselves up against it, accelerated by action which the Government have taken by burying their heads in the sand in relation to all the warning signs.</P>
    <P>Let me get back to the capital Budget. In the capital Budget statement issued by the Minister for Finance before the Budget it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Voted Capital services listed in Table 6 of this paper amount, however, to £32.12 million or £4.07 million more.  While the national accounts classification is appropriate for international statistical comparisons, it does not follow that that system or the classification at present used for budgetary purposes should govern the method of financing public capital expenditure in any given year.  As systems of classifying expenditure, they serve a useful purpose in the realm of accounting.</P>
    <P>Here is what I want to stress:</P>
    <P>In the broader context of the national budget, however, the amount of total expenditure, both capital and current, to be met from taxation must, as explained in last year's Capital Budget paper, be determined by reference mainly to prevailing economic conditions.</P>
    <P>Prevailing economic conditions were <Col N="1254" /> in the Budget.  The £4 million which the Capital Budget statement said were not true capital were utilised and treated by the Minister for Finance as capital, borrowing for it on the never-never, adding fuel to the flames, making it clear that the Government of that time were doing nothing to damp down the excessive demand or the inflationary influences that were at work.  All the same, of course, we must, in considering how this has been done, take account of the fact that the Budget deficits of £11 million over the past three years have had their part in building up this inflation, Budget deficits, I may add, on the current estimates, estimates which are taken in a very mild way as to what should be met below or above the line.</P>
    <P>But, not content on 11th May with putting on the never-never finger £4 million that a few days before he had, in the Capital Budget paper, suggested could not and should not be met from current borrowing, the Minister for Finance added another £1,500,000 in his Budget to make an extra £5½ million additional borrowing on that aspect alone.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of whether it would be proper or fair or right to take the individual item and charge it to capital account.  I think it might have been.  But it is the overall picture which should have been a matter of general concern then.  In spite of that, what happened was that the Minister for Finance adopted the easy way out and accelerated and brought on us these difficulties to which the Taoiseach had to refer yesterday.  In consequence of that, the difficulties now are worse than if they had been tackled at the right time.  The Taoiseach nominated, as I said, the first measure as being the reduction of Government capital expenditure to the amount limited by the Second Economic Programme.  Where exactly will that get us?</P>
    <P>The Second Programme provided for a total capital expenditure this year of £95,570,000.  The estimate set out at the time of the Budget was £103,720,000, an increase of £8,130,000. The Taoiseach yesterday said that that <Col N="1255" /> £8,130,000 was going to be cut, that we were going to go back to the estimate provided on page 270 of volume 2 of the Second Programme. He did not tell us under which heading it would come.  He did not tell us whether it would be a total, global cut or follow the individual decreases or increases, reducing them to decreases down the way of the items.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the items that might be met by this.  The increase in building and construction, according to the Minister's estimate over the Second Programme which now has to come off was £2,110,000. The increase in tourism was £50,000, the increase in agriculture was £1,210,000, the increase in agricultural credit was £1,450,000, Forestry remained the same.  Fisheries increased £60,000; fuel and power increased £500,000; telephones increased £1 million; transport increased £440,000; industry, £180,000; industrial credit, £950,000; Radio Éireann, £100,000; and miscellaneous, £490,000, making a total of £8,130,000.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach tell us when he is concluding this debate where exactly he will get that £8,130,000 he promised yesterday when he said there will be a reduction of Government capital expenditure to the amount visualised in the Second Programme? Will it come off the individual increases to which I have referred? Will each individual heading be brought back to its original pristine figure or will there be a global cut which will mean that some items in the list will have to bear more than the others?  If it is the individual ones, there is only one person who will be pleased, that is, the Minister for Transport and Power because the estimate for ports is £490,000 down on the amount included in the Second Programme at page 470.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach owes it to the House and to the country to tell us where this reduction of £8,130,000 will come from, under what heading, so that people can plan.  We have the Minister for Local Government pretending that there is no squeeze in <Col N="1256" /> relation to building, that it is possible for people to complete purchases of houses or building just as they used to do, when everybody who is concerned with it at all knows that is entirely untrue and is not a fact.  Will the amount for building and construction be cut?  That is the largest increase.  Or how is the point he made to be met?</P>
    <P>What reorganisation of the Government capital programme is envisaged? Are we to see a reorganisation or a change which will ensure that the Government will not take, as they have been taking, and as the Taoiseach admits, too much out of the pool of resources available for lending so that there has on that account been a restriction on capital available for the private sector?  These are questions which should have been answered if the Taoiseach was meeting the House fairly, openly and squarely and if the Government had been, as they should have been, considering the position for some time.</P>
    <P>The second point made by the Taoiseach was that we are to have restriction on Government current expenditure in such a way as to avoid increased taxation.  It is a little late for the Taoiseach to think of this.  Is he not aware that current expenditure is £19,700,000 more than last year?  Is it not about time he thought of restriction on Government current expenditure in view of the fact that he produced the largest Book of Estimates ever produced, quite apart from increases that have been put into it since?  Is it not fair to say, when he says that that is an essential prerequisite for getting back to sound times, that he thought of it a bit late and that what the Government have been doing in this regard has been largely adding fuel to the flames?</P>
    <P>The third way in which things are to be cut is a credit squeeze.  For some time people on these benches have been endeavouring to get from the Government an acknowledgment of a fact, the fact being that of course there was a credit squeeze.  For the past two months, it has been the experience of everybody who has had, in any form of <Col N="1257" /> business, the necessity to contact lending agencies that there was a squeeze of a fairly substantial nature.  Notwithstanding that, members of the Government, one after the other, choose to put their heads in the sand and to suggest the contrary.  There is a credit squeeze and, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, there must be a credit squeeze, because of the way the Government have let the situation get out of hand.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  Our net external assets in May 1965 amounted to £208.6 million.  In May 1964, they amounted to £230 millions, showing a drop in that period of £21½ millions.  I noticed, incidentally, that the Taoiseach when speaking yesterday referred to a drop in our net external assets of £33½ millions.  I must of necessity refer to the stencilled Official Report as the printed reports are not available and on page K.2 in the penultimate paragraph, the Taoiseach referred to a drop of £33½ millions in our net external reserves.  I must confess that unless the Taoiseach has received figures for June which are not available to the general public, I did not think the position was so bad because it seems to me that the drop between May 1965 and May 1964, on the last figures published, was somewhere in or around £21½ millions to £22 millions.  Perhaps the June figures are available to the Government and have shown even greater reduction. In June 1964, the figure was £230½ millions. What it is in June this year the Government may know but on what has been published, it is not quite as bad as that figure.  Even in May 1965 we had gone back to a situation in which we were worse than any May since 1960.</P>
    <P>No wonder that in those circumstances we are faced with difficulties of the credit squeeze variety, difficulties which were accentuated because, as I said already, the Government were taking far too much from the public sector and drawing on the private sector of the economy as well.  Now we are told by the Taoiseach that there is to be a credit squeeze.  I should like the Taoiseach to let this House know before this debate is concluded <Col N="1258" /> to what figure of total advances the Government and the Central Bank have decided the economy must be brought back.  To what figure of limitation are we to be faced in present circumstances?  In other words, how much have the Government decided the belt is to be tightened?  Up to this the suggestion was that there was no credit squeeze but that there was not as much expansion as previously but now we are told there is to be a credit squeeze.  How bad is that squeeze to be?  To what point of limitation is it to be taken?  These are matters about which the Government should take the country into their confidence and enable the people as a result to see exactly where we are travelling, because there is one thing, and only one thing, that will get us out of our difficulties in relation to present circumstances, that is, in the Taoiseach's words, a general awareness of the whole position and a feeling amongst everybody that the whole truth is being told so that everybody can get together and pull together to get us out of these difficulties.  Unfortunately, I did not see any signs of this in the speech he made yesterday.</P>
    <P>The fourth point mentioned was the necessity for an increase in savings.  Of course it is a truism that there must be an increase in savings.  It is a hard world; we cannot isolate ourselves ourselves from that hard world, and fundamentally we have to realise that our improvement in living standards will depend on what we save and put by towards productive investment for the future, that nobody in this hard world is going to give us anything for the love of our blue eyes and that unless we face up to that fact and make it clear that we are going to gird our loins and do our utmost for ourselves, we will not be able to get out of the difficulties we face.  How could there be an atmosphere for saving when Fianna Fáil, in the past 18 months, have been deliberately suggesting that everything in the garden was so beautifully lovely?</P>
    <P>What effect did that have?  Did it not inevitably have the effect that not merely did the people look for a larger share of the cake, but in addition felt <Col N="1259" /> that what they had they could spend safely because more was bound to come on the same lines?  The attitude taken by the Government has accentuated and increased our difficulties and has done nothing to encourage the diversion from spending to saving; on the contrary, it has gone a long way towards encouraging a diversion from saving to spending.</P>
    <P>When speaking here the day after the Budget, I referred to the issue of National Savings Bonds the Minister had announced the day before.  I felt then, and I said so in a very mild way, that it was not the best way of encouraging savings.  The fact is, of course&mdash; though, as I promised at that time, he did get a little of my money&mdash;that it was an utter flop, that it was the worst flop of any loan that was ever issued, so far as I can trace, by any Minister for Finance since the State was founded.  The gross amount received was £1,092,800, of which £225,000 came from the Post Office Savings Bank and from Prize Bonds.  The net gain, therefore, to the Exchequer in loan was £867,800.  It would have been far better, as I suggested to the Minister at that time&mdash;quietly, mildly and almost in an aside because I did not want to say anything that would affect the issue as such&mdash;if he felt normal methods of loan issues were not sufficient, to adopt the system of index loans which exists in Sweden.  So far as I can see, there has been no examination whatever of that system from the point of view of saving.</P>
    <P>We are bound to have difficulties in relation to saving in Ireland so long as we are in the position that many of those who would naturally save can remember what happened to their savings (1) by the disastrous decrease in the price of money and (2) by the manner in which the prices of their stocks, even in nominal value, have been slashed following the increase in interest rates since the Daltonian era. People who invested 20 years ago&mdash; less, 15 years ago&mdash;in national loans at three and 3½ per cent now see that the £100 they put in at that time was worth only £70 in nominal value and <Col N="1260" /> that that £70 may perhaps today be worth only £35 or £40.  Such people will not be encouraged, no matter what one may say, to invest in national loans in present circumstances to the extent that we need the capital for the continuance of a productive capital programme.</P>
    <P>The Swedes had the same difficulty. They met their difficulty by introducing, as I have said, a system of index loans, loans that are tied to a cost of living index figure, so that people will be able to know, when they contribute to those loans, that, in the future, they will be paid back in real values and will not be paid back in values that may have depreciated perhaps by 30 or even 50 per cent over the years. That is what has been happening. Some new approach of that sort is one of the essential things I suggest is necessary to ensure that our habit of saving is increased and increased particularly at the present time, in the Taoiseach's words, in order to encourage a diversion from spending to saving.</P>
    <P>We see by the Government no conception in that regard.  We see by the Government no move at all towards encouraging saving except one, one that was not included in the Budget. Even at the time of the Budget, the Minister for Finance had not thought it worth his while to do anything to encourage saving.  But, in the long drawn out period between the Budget and the publication of the Finance Bill, it apparently was born&mdash;a difficult birth apparently: perhaps his colleagues in the Government were against it and if they were, I think I know the reason why.</P>
    <P>That one small mite was an increase from £25 to £50 of the amount of interest from deposits that was exempt for tax purposes.  Of course, we know where that came from.  It was merely a doubling of the figure which initially was thought of by the Government of which I had the honour to be a member and was introduced in the Finance Act, 1956.  There was nothing new in it.  All the Minister for Finance did&mdash; and that not even in the Budget&mdash;was to increase the figure somewhat.  Out of all the mountain of energy and <Col N="1261" /> thought that was supposed to be going into the production of the Finance Bill to assist our economic position, one thing emerges and even that was not original, just merely increasing something the Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government had done. As I have mentioned the Finance Bill, I may say, as regards the other things in it, that I do not think they are designed to increase savings, to increase the capital available to increase the resources that are required to deal with our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>The fifth step the Taoiseach announced yesterday he will take to deal with the situation is a limitation of imports through the credit squeeze and hire purchase.  I do not know how that will work in relation to the limitation of the credit squeeze on imports. I am giving the Taoiseach a present of the fact that I cannot see how it will work.  I think it will be impossible to work and I do not think it will have the effect desired.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in his speech yesterday that they had considered the levies and had decided against them, had considered quantitative restrictions and had decided against them. Let me say at once that I agree that he was right to decide against quantitative restrictions.  I was doing some of my homework upstairs while the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking and therefore I did not myself hear exactly what he said. However, I was told that he said that the reason the Government decided against levies was that the previous physician who had administered them had been too severe.  If that was the only reason they decided against them, was it not a very bad one?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Good; I like criticism.  I think it is good, provided it is not the type of criticism, to which <Col N="1262" /> I referred, by Deputy Moran, as he then was, in an endeavour to stampede the devaluation of the Irish pound or the barraging type of criticism indulged in by Deputy Blaney, as he then was, to prevent the Taoiseach of the day from speaking.  Criticism of any sort is a good thing, because it is only from criticism that one will get the best results in the long run.</P>
      <P>My view in relation to the levies of 1956 is this, for what it is worth: the essential thing at that time was to make it clear beyond question that the Government meant business and it was twice as difficult to make that clear because of the campaign then being waged by Fianna Fáil.  History will tell that.  It is not very often I find myself in accord with Deputy Corry&mdash; it does not happen desperately often&mdash; but surely to goodness it is better that some capital would be obtained by the collection of a levy on unnecessary luxury imports rather than that the amount of capital thus collectable would not be available for introduction to productive enterprise which might have to be cut by that amount.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Government could take the view that the front over which the levies were then imposed was too wide. That is a matter that could be argued. Perhaps the Government could take the view that it might be too difficult to impose levies in the context of the shameful breach of treaties by the British last November.  When we imposed levies, we made it clear that there would be Commonwealth preference and we kept to our part scrupulously.  Perhaps the Government might have found difficulty for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the people are entitled to know why, if the Taoiseach were telling the truth when he said yesterday he would reduce Government capital expenditure by £8,130,000 in cuts in the Estimate for 1965-66 to the amount included in the Second Programme, it would not have been better if some of that capital productive programme could be financed by the introduction of a special emergency tax, if you wish to call it that, on luxuries rather than cutting out something worth while.  I <Col N="1263" /> suspect there was no reason for the decision of the Government not to adopt that method except that they did not wish to follow any line the previous Government had taken.</P>
    <P>I regard that decision of the Government as being on a par with their decision, through the Finance Bill, to do away quite unnecessarily with a sum of £180,000 a year in the 25 per cent stamp duty which is in the process of being abolished by the Minister for Finance.  As I said the other day, I cannot see any reason why the Minister for Finance should forgo that £180,000 which would be paid by externs coming in here in cases where the Land Commission were satisfied that it was not contrary to the national economy to allow them to come.  That sum was thrown away as a matter of no importance just as other possibilities of getting immediate capital to remedy our immediate difficulties were thrown away by the Taoiseach in his speech yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>The second arm of that fifth point of the Taoiseach is to be restriction on hire purchase.  As I understand his speech, a flat restriction, imposing a 25 per cent deposit and a maximum repayment period of three years, is to attach to the whole range of articles which may be subject to hire purchase. Is that again not a rather wooden, flat-footed way of dealing with the matter?  Are not some things in relation to hire purchase of greater value than others?  Are not some of them luxuries and some of them necessaries?  Would it not have been much better to provide that the restrictions would be so phased that there would be a smaller deposit required on things that are necessary and a larger percentage placed on things that are luxuries?  Could the repayment period not be phased in the same way?  If the Taoiseach meant exactly what he said yesterday, is not what he is doing a flat-footed crash across the board without any conception of or consideration for individual needs.</P>
    <P>The sixth item to which the Taoiseach referred was the avoidance of increases in personal incomes.  For <Col N="1264" /> a long time we have been trying to persuade him from this side of the House that what is needed is an incomes policy, some plan to ensure that the growth in the national wealth would be followed step by step and spread through the community as a whole.  The Taoiseach has set his face against that.  During the election campaign, at Mullingar and at Navan, he made it clear he was totally opposed to an incomes policy, It is because he is so totally opposed to an overall incomes policy, which includes more than wages, that we are in our present difficulties.  The policy advocated by this Party made it crystal-clear where we stood in relation to an incomes policy, but the Taoiseach, going back to February, 1964, when he saw his Government tottering and in danger at the Cork and Kildare by-elections, was prepared to throw all prudence to the winds so that he would not be pushed over in those by-elections.</P>
    <P>Having said he thought an eight per cent increase in wages and salaries was what the country could afford then, he succeeded later in securing the elections by announcing a 12 per cent increase.  He was careful not to say too much himself but his minions, his mafia, descended on Kildare and Cork.  They went around beating their breasts and saying: &ldquo;Look, we have got you a 12 per cent increase in incomes and there will not be any increase in prices&rdquo;.  Of course the ink was scarcely dry on the certificates the returning officers had signed to send up to the Clerk of the Dáil when the price increases started.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had really meant to improve the national economy, he would have advocated before that a proper incomes policy governing incomes and prices, and that policy would have been explained to the people.  Had he done that, he would not have found himself in the difficulty he told us about yesterday.  He was anxious to ensure that there would be benefit to the Fianna Fáil Party and that the benefit to that Party, the interests of that Party, would be away before the benefits to the national economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> I am certain the Taoiseach knew at that time that higher costs would emerge.  I am certain he knew that those higher costs would make it more and more difficult for our exports&mdash; that unless those higher costs were matched by higher costs in other countries, we would find it difficult, if not impossible, to increase our real living standards, quite apart from paper standards calculated in paper terms or percentages.</P>
    <P>Virtually every speech made by every member of the Government in the past 18 months has referred to our great economic progress.  On every possible occasion there has been rammed down the throats of everybody in the country the enormous progress, the great strides that were being made.  Is it any wonder, then, when that was the theme of Government statements at all times, that people should feel they had a right to a bigger share in the cake than had been indicated 18 months ago?  Was it not inevitable that all that deliberate propaganda would have the effect of ensuring that people would spend more and save less, because they were encouraged to believe that there was always more coming from where that came from?  It is the deliberate policy of the Government that has accentuated the difficulty that has arisen.</P>
    <P>The seventh point made by the Taoiseach was price control, a Bill for which we are discussing jointly with this Estimate.  I said at the beginning, before the Taoiseach came in&mdash;and I do not mean any discourtesy in that; he has to eat as all of us have to eat&mdash; that the purpose of the introduction of this Bill in this context was to try to make the commercial community the scapegoat of Fianna Fáil blundering. That is what is being done in this Bill to a large extent.  In so far as it could be operative, it is shutting the stable door after the horse has gone.  If price control were the key, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had plenty of powers to deal with the matter before now and could have dealt with it in the difficult situation that was building up.  I do not think the Taoiseach really believes that it is the key.  I believe that he has introduced <Col N="1266" /> this Bill largely as propaganda for the purpose of endeavouring to make the commercial community the Fianna Fáil scapegoat, to offset analysis and thought being applied to where the blame should really lie and where the blame does lie, on the Government, for having in almost everything they have done in the past four months added fuel to the fire latent perhaps in some respect, but certainly brought out into open flame by many of the decisions taken entirely at the wrong economic time and to which I have referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Let me say, however, in relation to prices, that I agree entirely with the view expressed by the Taoiseach that any further increase in prices or any further increase in cost at the present time would make it virtually impossible for us to maintain, much less expand, our industrial exports and that what we must do above all else is to endeavour to ensure that by increased productivity our costs are brought down rather than expanded.  It was in that context particularly that we felt the increase in transport and distribution costs as the inevitable result of the increased taxation on petrol and oil was a grave mistake in present circumstances and would add to our difficulties instead of alleviating them.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there is in this Bill that it is only the commercial community that has contributed to increased costs is utterly without foundation, utterly untrue.  It is the old story, perhaps, of taking one small one per cent who may perhaps have erred as the yardstick with which to beat the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the commercial community as a whole will wholeheartedly co-operate with the Government of the day&mdash;with any Government of the day&mdash;in providing a proper, stable system, through a proper incomes policy covering all aspects of our national life, because it is on the basis of stable prices that a really efficient man is best able to plan and to expand his business as he would wish to do.</P>
    <P>The eighth point on which the Taoiseach relies to deal with our <Col N="1267" /> difficulties is the investigation of overseas market possibilities for exports. I thought that was what the Taoiseach had been doing for years.  I thought that was what Córas Tráchtála was set up for.  I thought that was what our Embassies should have been doing, although I agree at once that our Embassies abroad could do little in that regard while they were directed by the present Minister for External Affairs who is far more interested in prestige and in travelling about the world pretending that he is a world figure than in expanding our trade and exports.  I can remember&mdash;I wonder if the Taoiseach can remember&mdash;being in this House last autumn when the Minister for External Affairs was asked would he ask our Embassies to see what could be done to sell Irish wool abroad and his answer was that there was no necessity to bother to do anything about wool, that wool could be sold without the slightest trouble. All of us knew that there was a wool depression, not merely coming but upon the world at that time.  The Minister for External Affairs, apparently, was not interested.  How could there be any real inducement amongst his staffs when he himself takes that line?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced that he was making certain market development grants available even up to the maximum, as I understand it now, of 75 per cent in certain instances.  I was not clear from the Taoiseach's speech as to whether he meant that that was for market development grants in England only, for the purpose of overcoming the British surcharge, or whether it was for market developments across the entire board, so to speak.  That is a matter that the Taoiseach may make clear when he is concluding. That measure is too small an indication in our present circumstances of the need for further industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear.  An improvement in exports is what one might term a longer term proposal.  It is something that should have been thought of and woken up to by the Government not <Col N="1268" /> only when difficulties were met with in the past few months.  It is something that should have been done long ago and the Taoiseach owes it to the House to explain where the deficiencies have been in the organisations responsible for this purpose and where they have failed up to now that he has considered it necessary to put this in as one of his eleven points.  Is it because it was only yesterday he was able to reconcile the different views there are among the members of his Government in relation to our economic difficulties, difficulties which were only settled in time to give an indication of these eleven points on his Estimate yesterday, differences of opinion among members of his Government which have reached this side of the House and, indeed, the whole country?</P>

The reports and accounts of these bodies which are presented to the Oireachtas afford all the information which can properly be disclosed in accordance with normal commercial practice.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question does not relate to tax reliefs for industry nor to the assistance given by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo., and its subsidiary Erin Foods Ltd., to local initiatives co-operating with them in the development of the food processing industry.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation, in common with other housing authorities, are required to allocate the tenancies of their dwellings in accordance with the provisions of the Housing (Management and Letting) Regulations, 1950 and 1953, made by the Minister for Local Government in exercise of powers conferred on him by the Housing (Amendment) Acts, 1948 to 1952.  These regulations prescribe the preference to be given, wherever practicable, to different classes of applicants and provide an early preference for persons with a family living in overcrowded conditions, or in a one-roomed dwelling, where one or more than one member of the family is suffering from tuberculosis. The regulations also provide that, for the purpose of determining the order of priority within a class of applicants, the housing authority shall obtain and have regard to a report and recommendation from the chief medical officer.  The criteria to be observed by the medical officer in preparing this report are not prescribed.</P>

      <P>Plans submitted by Dublin Corporation for the improvement of the section of the Bray Road from Donnybrook to Foster Avenue, were approved in principle in August, 1961.  Recently, Dublin County Council furnished tentative plans for continuing the improvement to Galloping Green and these are at present under examination.  Both sets <Col N="1280" /> of plans envisage the provision of a dual carriageway, all-purpose road in place of the existing road.  Accordingly, while it will not be feasible to eliminate existing intersections in the improved road, their design will receive particular attention before final plans are approved with a view to ensuring that the treatment adopted at each particular location will afford the maximum safety to all road users.</P>

      <P>For some time past the water supply in Letterkenny <Col N="1281" /> has had to be regulated in order to minimise possible hardships on the residents.  I understand that the position was aggravated recently by bursts in the main from Lough Salt and that it was necessary to cut off the town supply entirely for several hours.  In the course of discussions held in January last between officers of my Department and of the local authority, it was agreed that priority should be given to the ascertainment in detail of the several causes of the shortages occurring in the water supply system, for example, wastages, leaks, pressures etc.  Since then certain remedial measures have been taken: a break pressure tank is being provided to help the high areas of the town and work will commence soon on the renewal of pipe line and provision of a booster in the New Line Road.</P>
      <P>Further measures, as recommended by the consultant in his report of 26th March, 1965, involving relaying of three sections of pipe and the installation of a temporary booster to provide a supply to Glencar area in the event of a failure of this source have also been approved.  I am informed that the consultant's report and recommendations on a complete survey of the entire system are expected to be completed shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the question answered by the Minister for Finance about net external reserves in the banking system today, might I refer the Taoiseach to the page on the stencilled document marked &ldquo;K.2&rdquo;&mdash;they are not numbered in the ordinary way&mdash;in which he said:</P>
      <P>The impact of the higher trade deficit in this year has, therefore, fallen on the external reserves of the banking system and on Government funds and by mid-May these external reserves of ours had shown a fall of £33.5 million as compared with an increase at the same time last year.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Taoiseach would confirm that that is the figure he intended and that it is not a clerical slip because it seems to me it is not compatible with the figures.  The external reserves of the banking system and of Departmental funds at mid-May this year were £208.6 million, as given to me in a reply in Volume 216, column 722.  The external reserves in mid-May of last year were £230 million, a reduction therefore of £21.4 million and not £33.5 million, as the Taoiseach stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought, first of all, when the figures did not tally that the Taoiseach might, perhaps, have meant from the figures as they were at 31st December, or the beginning of the year, when there was a reduction all right of about the sum involved, but the Taoiseach <Col N="1294" /> said &ldquo;as compared with an increase at the same time last year&rdquo; and, last year, the May figures fell from the December figures and that explanation, therefore, does not fit the bill.  Let us be quite sure in any event that we have our facts right and, not merely right, but right in such a way that they can be easily understood by all of us. I do not understand these figures and I should be glad if the Taoiseach would, when he is replying, let us know exactly to what figures he was referring, month by month, and where they came from.</P>
    <P>The ninth point the Taoiseach made in relation to the ninth remedy was that he was going to lead a trade delegation to Britain to endeavour to negotiate there a better trade agreement for us.  It would be wrong in the national interest that anyone should say anything that might in any way jeopardise or harm any negotiations that the Government might engage in. Bad and all as they are, they are the Government of our country and they must not be hindered or harmed in any way, particularly when, as I am glad to note, they have now repented of their folly in earlier years in saying that the British market was gone forever, thank God.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also indicated as one of his points that the Government were going to consider external borrowing.  I should like to be told what he had in mind; how temporary the borrowing is to be and the purpose for which it will be used. External borrowing, unless we use it for genuine productive efforts, could make the situation worse instead of better.  I should also like to know where the Taoiseach had in mind for this borrowing.  The position <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling is, we hope, going to become better because much of our reserves are in the sterling area, and unless the position of sterling remains strong, we shall not have as good reserves as we would wish, but we must face the possibility that it could happen that sterling would be devalued and if that did happen, borrowing outside the sterling area could be a very expensive thing indeed for us.  Therefore, it is a remedy that, particularly in <Col N="1295" /> present circumstances, requires to be considered most carefully.</P>
    <P>In any case I am rather inclined to the view that any suggestion that we can solve our problems by external borrowing is going to cloud from our own people that it is on their own resources that emergence from our difficulties will depend.  Only by bringing it home to our people that it is only by depending on their own resources, and ridding themselves of the blather that has been produced by every member of the Government from the Taoiseach down for the past year and a half in relation to our economic progress, can we ever hope to surmount the difficulties with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>The final remedy to which the Taoiseach referred was the Buy Irish campaign.  I understood that campaign had been progressing as hard and as vigorously as was possible and therefore I should like to know how it is hoped to step up or accentuate that campaign so that it will have good results, bearing in mind that, as was said on an earlier occasion, the Buy Irish campaign was excellent from the point of view of a reduction in our imports but in so far as it makes a soft market for our production, instead of being excellent, actually does harm to the economy and prevents exports.</P>
    <P>The increase necessary in our industrial exports is not something that will come very easily.  When discussing the Budget, one of the things for which we criticised it vigorously was that it made no effort to stimulate exports; indeed, it made no effort to stimulate production either, but it did not visualise the necessity for any increase in our exports to solve our economic problems.  The Minister for Finance and the Government in that Budget were quite content that it should be utilised, not as a weapon of economic progress but merely as a weapon of transfer payments for social services. Desirable as those transfers were, nothing would enable us to keep them except a very much more vigorous and alert policy in relation to our economic activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The indications that the Taoiseach gave yesterday were not indications that the Government were prepared frankly to face the situation.  The Taoiseach seemed to be more concerned with trying to cover himself with a protective cloak than with telling the people exactly where our difficulties were and where we were likely to go if we were to surmount them. There is no good in Ministers of the Government going on hiding their heads in the sand trying to pretend to the people at one stage that there might be a credit squeeze in some other aspect of national life but not in their particular aspect of it as the Minister for Local Government has been doing.</P>
    <P>It is no good for the Taoiseach to try to tell the people that there has been no recession in economic progress. The circumstances he announced yesterday and the measures that will have to be taken to remedy those circumstances will show a recession, a retarding of economic growth and they will show it far less if we meet them frankly with the co-operation of everyone, instead of, as unfortunately we have had over the past month, the Government on every possible occasion throwing fuel on the flames by encouraging spending rather than saving, by their accentuating of progress and by encouraging people to look for a larger section of the national cake by all the talk of progress and wealth, by failing to meet responsibilities in relation to capital expenditure and the methods of paying for it and generally by trying to cod the people, a codding which was fraudulently done at the last general election and which was continued right up to the present time. The Taoiseach stripped that somewhat from his colleagues yesterday but there must be more frankness if we are to be able to surmount the difficulties with which we shall be faced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with this matter at any great length and certainly not to deal with it in as comprehensive a way as Deputy Sweetman did in his very lengthy speech.  We, as a Party and group here would certainly be hurt by <Col N="1297" /> the information that we had emerged curiously into a serious economic position about which there was very little prior notice.  It is true that all of us had been told for a long time and up to very recently, up to the recent general election in fact, that the country was on the crest of the wave.  We had been told continually by Government speakers that we were one of the greatest nations in Europe from the point of view of progress.  Why an abrupt change should have come about and why there should be this deterioration in our status as a nation which was not foreseen further ahead, I cannot say.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach came before the House yesterday, looking back on it, I suppose he had to lay the blame on somebody, but I should have resented from this side of the House any attempt that might be made by the Taoiseach or anybody else to pin the blame for an economic crisis on the workers or on the result of anything that those who represent them had done, in order to clear himself or somebody else who might be more responsible.  We have to look at it in a straight and honest way.  Were it not for our workers we would have no economy at all.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by the Taoiseach&mdash;and probably rightly so at this stage&mdash;that any further requests for wage increases would have a detrimental effect on an already bad situation.  While we do not accept that anything that might have been done in violation of the existing wage agreement had any serious effect upon the present state of the economy, we do not deny that it could be a factor. But this contravention of the long-term wages agreement, to which Labour leaders lent their hand, was not brought about because of the wage earners covetousness but because the Taoiseach and the Government proved themselves to be bigger fools than the trade unions had taken them to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody in this country who had come to the use of reason knew that, if we were to have a long-term wages understanding here, it could only be successful if, side by side with it from 1st January, 1964, price control had <Col N="1298" /> been introduced.  It was utterly impossible for any agreement to run its course if prices were allowed to get out of hand.  That is exactly what happened. Any breach that has taken place was caused by lack of foresight on the part of the Government in not introducing the price control which the Taoiseach now says is vital.  I would remind him that it was as vital on 1st January, 1964, as it is now.  I do not at all agree that this breach was a serious factor in bringing about this present very undesirable situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, I was glad to hear, said he did not want to avail of this bad situation to make political capital.  Certainly, I would agree with him there.  I would not like to hear anybody from this side of the House trying to make political capital out of this situation.  What we want to do is to be helpful and constructive and to say clearly what we believe is the position without making any political capital.</P>
    <P>We have been looking for price control from this side of the House for a long time.  We are glad that, even at this late stage, the Taoiseach is coming before the House for authority to put it into effect.  He can rest assured that that authority will be forthcoming from these benches.  But we resent the finger of blame being pointed at the workers because we believe that, in justice and fair play, they are in no way responsible for the present situation.</P>
    <P>Nobody could envisage the Government not introducing price control. Nevertheless, that is exactly what happened. Take, for example, the price of beer.  This is something being seriously discussed the length and breadth of the country.  The justification for it is something that will be examined.  We feel it shows a complete disregard for Parliament and authority if the licensed vintners in provincial towns and cities can assemble together and put on any price they like.  They had no more respect for this House and the Government than a bulldog would have for the rules of Shelbourne Park. Not alone should they be stopped but they should be severely chastised. Somebody may ask why men want to <Col N="1299" /> drink.  But drink with the Irish worker, and the Dublin worker in particular, is a luxury that has become a necessity. It is traditional with our people. Because it has become a necessity, nobody should be allowed to rifle the pockets of the Irish worker in that regard.  I would nearly go so far as to say that the price of beer has been more a factor in workers looking for increased wages than the price of any other commodity we might suggest.</P>
    <P>We deplore that anything that might come from our side, particularly from the industrial arm of the Labour Party, would cause industrial unrest to an unlimited and damaging extent.  We are going to contribute in every way we can to finding a cure for this situation. We are going to do all we can about it here as a Party.  In this situation in all its aspects, we will be helpful, but we want to make it clear that the cause for it rests with the Government and with the Government alone.</P>

      <P>The last speaker suggested that there had been very little prior notice and the Opposition seem to be making a point that this was a sudden development.  I should like to remind the House that there has been nothing sudden about this at all.  Right from the beginning of the year, one might say, certain factors in this situation have been well known and have been duly emphasised.  There are two things we should remember about this situation.  First, it is not by any means of emergency or crisis proportions.  We are faced with one of the normal problems of national housekeeping.  There are good times and bad times.  There are easy times and there are times with problems.  This happens to be a time with problems.  It would be a terrible mistake to start off on the assumption that we are suddenly faced with an emergency crisis.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said earlier, one of the mistakes the Coalition Government made in handling their problems in 1956 was to take just that approach to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second feature in regard to the present situation is that there is nothing in the Taoiseach's speech, which we <Col N="1300" /> all have now before us, even if only in typed form, which is essentially new as far as information is concerned. But it is a very valuable and accurate summary of the situation we have to face and, as responsible people, we should face it.  It is inevitable that the Opposition will find a continuing temptation in this debate to indulge in self-justification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman dealt with some of the financial aspects of the matter and I should like to mention two or three of what I might call the physical or human factors behind the present situation.  The first is that in leading up to the present situation there was development and there was a rise in the standard of living of the people from 1957 onwards.  There has been a very real increase in living standards and a real increase in remuneration and in the economic development of the country. <Col N="1302" /> Naturally that led to a certain tendency, to an increase in consumption and in the purchase of consumer goods.  That is a fact which has to be taken into account in the present situation.</P>
      <P>The next thing that has to be taken into account is that in that developing situation, incomes were increasing. These two factors were all right as long as balances were maintained, and in fact they were desirable in so far as an increase in consumption meant improved standards of living and was matched also by increased incomes, which in turn also meant increased standards of living.  Those things in themselves were good if they were in balance but then something happened to put them out of balance.</P>
      <P>Let us see how this disbalance has come about.  The disbalance has come &mdash;in so far as one can summarise causes like this, and one can do so only very approximately&mdash;from two things.  You had the position of the neighbouring economy: there was a change of Government after a deteriorating economic position in Britain and the repercussions of that situation were immediately effective here as a result of the levies that were imposed.  We cannot overlook the fact that that was a factor and a very real factor in the position.  It had an important bearing on our imports and consequently on the balances about which I was speaking.  Then you had the natural time-lag that is to be found in such cases, a time-lag in appreciating the effect.  Lastly, let us face it, there were demands for remuneration in excess of what our production would support, with a consequent increase in prices.  These, very briefly and very incompletely, were some of the causes that brought about the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with one aspect of the problem with which I want to deal &mdash;I see no point in covering ground which has already been covered&mdash;I should like to point out that these factors were there and the present situation is the outcome of a disbalance, introduced as I have indicated, operating on the natural <Col N="1303" /> tendencies that there were from a very good origin, namely the rapid development that had taken place since 1957 under the present Government.</P>
    <P>As a specific matter in this debate, we have the question of price control. Prices have increased and it is right that these measures should be introduced, but it is also right that it should be recognised that this is only one aspect of a programme to cope with problems that have to be coped with. It should also be realised in regard to prices that, as the Taoiseach said, they are more a symptom than a cause.  In this regard, especially having regard to some of the things said about price control <i>vis-à-vis</i> income increases, it is no harm to look at a few basic facts in regard to prices.  People talk about warnings and I should like to go back to April, 1964, when the Taoiseach addressed himself to these problems in this House.  I want to quote one paragraph because it is relevant to this debate.  The remainder is as relevant but it can be read by Deputies in the Official Report.  This is what the Taoiseach said, reported at column 1787 of Volume 208:</P>
    <P>Once again it appears necessary to re-state some elementary principles in this matter.  When national production is rising at an average annual rate of four per cent this is the maximum rate at which incomes can increase in real terms.  If nominal incomes rise faster than that, prices will certainly move up to confine the real gain in incomes to what higher national production can support.</P>
    <P>It is as necessary, I think, today to re-state some elementary principles as it was then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that 12 per cent was given was clearly stated by the Taoiseach.  In the following column of Volume 208, he is reported:</P>
      <P>There was an agreement for 12 per cent and I said here at the time that it would be worth while paying some premium, over and above the average increase which the expansion of national production could support without adverse consequences, in order to initiate a new and better system of wage adjustment which we hoped would be retained in the future.</P>
      <P>That was the reason for the 12 per cent as the Taoiseach mentioned, and some Labour Deputies implied it, that 12 per cent was not unjustified. There was a great measure of agreement and a great deal of good stemmed from it.  Productivity per worker went up.  It was in the first part of this year that we began to notice room for correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the remark made by Deputy L'Estrange a few moments ago may seem a smart political point, it does not get us any further with the argument.  Let me return to an objective analysis of the present situation and in doing that, it is necessary to re-state some elementary principles.  The point I was dealing with was that prices of themselves are largely a symptom.  They cannot be controlled of themselves.  If there are excess profits, by all means control them, and in so far as control is necessary, it will be done, but let us realise that price control is not the panacea for everything.  Prices are in the main determined by costs.  There may be sectors where prices are excessively high but a general analysis today will show that by and large there has not been an excessive increase in prices and that the increases which have occurred in recent times, <Col N="1305" /> during the past eight to ten years, have been the normal consequence of increasing costs.  If I am right in that&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins can make his speech later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says the Bill will have no effect on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.  I said that by and large prices have been conditioned by costs and it is important therefore to analyse where costs tend to increase.  In any domestic industry here, costs are largely determined by three factors&mdash; costs of production of any article are determined mainly by labour costs, costs of materials and services required for production and lastly by taxation. Now, unfortunately, as has been pointed out before these three elements in industrial costs are to some extent cumulative and whether we like it or not-many of us do not&mdash;the costs of remuneration, of personal wages and salaries, are the key, the triggering element in most industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If incomes go up in an industry, that element spreads also to services and materials used in the industry.  If there is a general wage rise, not only will the cost of wages in any particular industry go up but the cost of the materials it uses will go up because the materials are made and distributed from somewhere else where the general wage increase round pushes up costs in turn.  Therefore, the industry must bear the increased cost of the materials and the services it uses.  Lastly, a general round of wage increases will affect the entire services of the country.  It will affect the public services and, as we can easily see from the figures available, there is a bigger bill for the Minister for Finance to meet and he can meet it only by increased taxation <Col N="1306" /> which, in turn, comes back to the industry, both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>To cut a long story short, we cannot escape the fact that a prime element, a triggering element in the upward trend of costs, the vital element in the costs structure today&mdash;it need not necessarily be so but it seems to be that way at the moment&mdash;is the question of salaries and wages in an industry.  That in turn affects the other essential factors in industry. We cannot get away from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne talked about incomes and prices.  There is a very interesting diagram on page 19 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> in relation to the Budget for 1965 published by the Central Statistics Office.  Diagram 3 on page 19 shows the upward index of weekly earnings.  That index is deflated by the consumer price index.  In other words, earnings have been going up and so have prices, but the significant thing is that when you take the difference and call that net earnings or any suitable word you like, the graph is still going up, which means that earnings have been going up faster than prices on the whole.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is vital to understand that price control is only one facet of the whole problem which has to be dealt with, that it is related to costs in the way that I have mentioned and that one has to face the hard economic facts of life in that regard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, again to put things into perspective here, although, as I understand it, production is still going up and industrial productivity has gone up the rate of increase has been falling off in this year.  That fact has to be taken as a signal for correction.  It might be that in certain circumstances there was a tendency to saturation but our economy is not developed sufficiently for us to be talking in terms of saturation.  We should be able to develop further.</P>
    <P>There is a more significant factor in the situation and that is that our labour costs tend to be rising more rapidly or at least as rapidly and at an accelerating pace compared to the rest of our environment.  These are all matters which call for correction but correction is the word.  We can achieve <Col N="1307" /> that correction with the co-operation that the Deputies on the other side have so stressed&mdash;and we welcome that&mdash;and that the Taoiseach has asked for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman was quite right when he said that we must do these things out of our own resources.  That is one of the really fundamental things for us to grasp here.  As I said at the outset, our development had been almost spectacularly rapid in the recent past and we may have been somewhat deluded by that into thinking that it was a relatively easy task to develop the economy of a country like this.  Set-backs such as those one had to face as a result of the British levy, and so forth, are a reminder of the grim fact that we as a country live in a highly competitive economic environment and that we have to compete to live and that if we do not succeed in that competition we will not be able to live.</P>
    <P>Some of our problems are not ours alone.  As I have said, we know the difficulties of the British economy and we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that these will have repercussions here, indirect as well as direct repercussions.</P>
    <P>I noticed in yesterday's papers, for instance, that the Labour Economic Minister in England, Mr. George Brown, said as follows, approximately &mdash;I paraphrase him&mdash;referring to the balancing of incomes and prices and to a number of problems that have certain similarities to our problems here:</P>
    <P>If agreement is not reached voluntarily over prices and incomes it will have to come in some other way.  This could be through deflation and unemployment with resources underused and investment discouraged or by abandoning the voluntary principle and its replacement by something else.</P>
    <P>He was not making a threat.  He was making a statement of the simple economic facts of life, he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly get it for the Deputy but I think the quotation is substantially accurate as reported in that paper.  These are the simple economic facts of life and we cannot get away from the simple economic facts of life.  Deputy Sweetman has done a service in emphasising that it is by our own efforts that we must put things right.</P>
      <P>There are sometimes psychological factors.  There are the difficulties in a democracy of getting all people to pull together, and so forth, but some people might wonder why it is that we cannot seize the opportunities we have at the moment and make something out of them.  We know that there are difficulties in Britain where we have a large market, that there is an environment to which the Taoiseach referred which may be difficult but, on the other hand, we have had an extraordinary resurgence here and all it needs, in the last analysis, is for us to have enough faith as a community to invest in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish all of us here in this House could make our people realise that by a little extra effort and investment in the future, which may take the form of a little forebearance, we could capture the foreign markets that would enable us to continue the development which we have had.  We have had plenty of experience to show that the hope is more than justified.  We know that the economy can be developed.  It has already been developed to a remarkable extent having regard to the situation as it was before the first economic programme was initiated.  We have every reason to believe that we could <Col N="1309" /> do it.  We could sell abroad.  Let us face that.  We have the know-how and we have been able to get to the standard of production.  We could sell abroad if we could sell competitively. What is stopping us from selling abroad is that there is a tendency for our prices to be too high and, as is commonly said, for us to price ourselves out of the market.  What could we not do if we could sell at the fractionally lower price in the foreign market and get the trade?  That is a thought that perhaps everybody should fix his attention on.</P>
    <P>It is all right to talk about efficiency. Yes, let us have maximum efficiency. The product that we are selling must be of the very best or we will not maintain the market.  The key to the whole thing is, having got maximum efficiency and having got the product, to do what the Japanese, the Germans and many other countries have done, that is, to be determined that you are going to sell the product and to adjust your price accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Our tendency has been the other way.  It is with that thought that I would like to approach this whole question of re-introducing a balance into our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I quote Deputy Sweetman, the essential thing is to do it with our own resources but it must be done by getting foreign markets.  In this modern world of ours, one cannot live in a vacuum.  One cannot have the same standard of living as the rest of the world if one lives in a vacuum.  We must get out and sell our products and the way to do that is to sell them at competitive prices.  Mere price control as such is only one aspect of the problem. I want to emphasise that equally important with price control is the question of remuneration and above all, there must be an ordered organisation, particularly of export industry. Anyone can develop the logical consequence <Col N="1310" /> of that thought but, if we preserve the essential that is in the thought, we will have gone a long way towards doing it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I was tempted to follow Deputy Dillon in some of the things he said, but, in view of the situation as it is, it is well to forebear.  If we can take seriously the declaration of the Opposition of their intention to co-operate in dealing with this problem for the good of the country, I, for one, will be glad to forebear many of the other things.  With that co-operation, we should also try to look objectively at the causes of this problem and not run the risk of escapism focussing all our attention on one or other particular aspect of it.  We should look for the co-operation of all the sectors of the community to whom the Taoiseach looked and, if we do so, the difficulties we have to face will be successfully surmounted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to some of the amazing economic views that Deputy de Valera has so suddenly annexed to himself and also to his rather cynical scepticism about the co-operation they will get from the Opposition.  He seems to forget the times when economic difficulties were abroad before and when he and some of his colleagues were not only prepared to sabotage the national effort but were prepared to use every possible base effort at political advantage to do so.  They will not get that kind of treatment from this Party but that does not say that we do not have the right to copperfasten on top of this Government its own sins.</P>
      <P>I remember Fianna Fáil Deputies laughing two years ago when I was challenging the then Minister for Industry and Commerce on the prices that had already started to soar in anticipation of the turnover tax.  I had already shown him the danger that was arising from this willy-nilly increase in costs without any justification or without any effort at investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody welcomed more than I did at that time the fact that there was alleged goodwill growing up between <Col N="1311" /> employer and employee.  I am not a member of the Labour Party but I can sympathise with them in their efforts to solve the problem which was created under this agreement when the value of the wage packet to the employee was dissipated by increased prices before he got the increased wages.  We must be realists when we are facing economic difficulties and it is the purchasing value of the wage packet which is the ultimate analysis on which the worker can assess whether he is doing well or otherwise. If an increase of wages is to be consumed immediately by inflated prices for essentials, then that increase has no real value and no Government can criticise the worker because he wishes to extricate himself from a position in which he finds prices chasing wages.</P>
    <P>When I heard Deputy de Valera talking about forebearance, I felt like telling him that he should address those remarks to the limited sector of the community that can adopt that attitude because the working man, whether he is rearing a young family or a large family, is the one who feels the pressure of continually rising prices from week to week and who does not know how he is to continue to exist.  I have always said that this is an inept and incompetent Government. Their emphasis on development has never been right.  We are all getting away from the basic reality that the widest scope for production and for the invasion of foreign markets lies in agricultural products and not in artifically-boosted industry.</P>
    <P>One of the ills of our whole industrial policy is that we are trying to compete by means of imported raw materials processed in this country with the home producers of these materials.  The great weight of our exports lies in the once despised bullock, sheep and pig.  We know the burden that our agriculture is carrying.  We know that it is in agriculture that there is the scope for expansion of exports that will save our economy.</P>
    <P>It is amusing to hear a Fianna Fáil Government pleading the exigencies <Col N="1312" /> and difficulties of the British situation as an excuse for some of our economic difficulties.  I have repeated year after year in this House that we must always face the fact that unless we build our production on something that is part of our way of life, which is agriculture, that we will always find ourselves affected by the law of diminishing returns when we try to compete against the home producers of the raw materials which we use in our industries. This is so simple and basic an economic theory that I cannot understand why we have not wakened up to the fact that much of the difficulty and much of the recession that has come in parts of our industry is due to the fact that there has not been the type of planning one would expect and there certainly has not been the development in efficiency or in methods of marketing that justifies the continuance of many of these industries at all.</P>
    <P>It is time this country woke up to the fact that we must start planning, not in theoretical blue books, First and Second Programmes, but in the light of the capacity of our people to produce.  If we are to rescue ourselves from the economic slough we are now in, we must embark on an expansionist programme that is real in relation to the lives and activity of our people and to their capacity to work and increase their production and their efficiency. We are not going to do that by trying to heap the blame on anybody or by trying to hide behind spurious agreements that are outmoded.  No matter how the Government try to disguise it, the Irish people know perfectly well that a very large part of the motive that activated this agreement and this 12 per cent rise was the imminence of by-elections in Cork and Kildare and the preservation of the then tottering Government in office.</P>
    <P>Our present difficulty stems from that.  It was then that the Government should have been talking about price stabilisation and price control.  It was then, when they were making this effort in regard to a period of expansion and development, that they should have seen to it that the 12 per cent was not going to be gobbled up and dissipated in what I describe as the <Col N="1313" /> meteoric rise in the cost of essentials. Remember that at that stage the Government were hiding behind the fact that many items that we regard as essential in the maintenance and development of a family are excluded from the items that actually affect the computation of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>No matter what warning were given to the Government, we were told with the flamboyant abandon of which the Taoiseach is capable that we were never going better and now as Deputy Byrne of the Labour Party said, we suddenly find there is a complete reversal in the trend.  The Government had been warned week after week, year after year, that this was coming. It started long before the beginning of this year.  It had started long before there was any change of Government in Britain, but the Government refused to face up to the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>We have seen how inept and ineffective the Government can be. Price control <i>per se</i> may not be a complete answer to the problem but to attempt price control now, when the matter has been allowed to get out of hand and when the range of commodities and the range of investigation has become universal, will be extremely difficult, particularly in view of the fact that in the past couple of months, without reference to anybody, the costs of a wide range of goods have increased by 1d., 2d., 4d. and 6d.  This is because, with demands in every direction, people are trying to take the easiest way out by foisting, without reference to anybody, extra costs on the consumer.</P>
    <P>If we are to get over this problem and we will get over it&mdash;if we could get the Government out, we would get over it quicker but they are fairly entrenched in their seats; they have the brass neck of Old Nick and always had&mdash;the Government must give a lead.  If there is to be, as Deputy de Valera is suggesting, forbearance, why do we not start where forbearance can be very effectively exercised?  Let us have a look in a cold analytical way at some of the big impacts on our economy in recent times.  One will <Col N="1314" /> find that status rises that have been a long time outstanding to the public service have had a tremendous impact on the economy.  The delay resulted in the accumulation of a vast debt which I am quite sure is more than due to the overworked civil servants, but we want to ensure that that type of debt will not be allowed to accrue again.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that we meet our housekeeping difficulties as they come along.  If we are to ask the workers, the industrial overseer, the person working on the land of Ireland, the producers, to restrain their demands in certain directions, then the load will have to be borne by everybody, not by one section.  One of the things that has bedevilled this economy and one of the things that is causing unease and unrest among the people is that many of them think the Government have no policy and no desire towards the control of this ever-rising monster of administrative costs.  We must get all the community properly and intelligently aware of the difficulties and, having done so, we must spread the responsibility for the recovery over the shoulders that can bear it.</P>
    <P>This does not alter for one moment the fact that the Government never made a conscious effort to control the rising spiral of costs, the inflationary tendencies that developed, so that the real worth of the worker's pay packet would not be devalued.  It was because they did not do that that we find ourselves in the jam we are in today. Every man, no matter what section of the community he is in, has the right to use all the methods at his disposal to ensure that he gets a reasonable share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>I fault the Government, as I always have, for a lack of planning concepts and a lack of a balanced approach to what this country really can do.  I have always been astounded that we should make so little of our potential in both agriculture and fishing.  There is a tremendous variety of industry germane to agriculture and agricultural production but we have failed utterly to plan and develop such industry.  As I have <Col N="1315" /> said here on numerous occasions, our lack of initiative has always astounded me.  In my constituency I see the trawlers of every nation in Europe&mdash; aye, and from further afield than Europe&mdash;travelling thousands of miles to catch fish.  Fishing at that distance must be an important and a valuable factor in their economy.  Yet, after all our years of self-government, and all the years in which government has been under the aegis of this dynamic Fianna Fáil Party, we have never seen any real effort to develop the potential that is there in the fishery waters around our coasts.</P>
    <P>We have not seen the development we should have seen in our agricultural industry.  We have not seen the market that should be developed properly developed.  We have, indeed, some queer capacity for sending people all over the world looking for exotic markets while we leave the one nextdoor without the attention it should get.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make political capital out of this economic difficulty in which we find ourselves, but the effort to remedy the situation must be a realistic one.  If the worker is to be asked to do a little more, then, equally, the employer should be asked to do with a little less in the way of profits. Let all sections of the community carry their reasonable share.  The person who can least carry any additional burden is, in my opinion, the worker. He is bound to feel the pinch more severely than anybody else.  In my opinion, the Government are sitting quiet and calm, hoping, to use a favourite expression of the Taoiseach's they will get over the hump.  But one must get down to realities.  One must do something about the situation.</P>
    <P>If this price control is aimed at stemming the tide, then effective steps will have to be taken immediately. The Minister should have the courage to backdate his standstill order to the beginning of the year when, as alleged by the Taoiseach, the trouble started. It is no good saying now that a whole series of prices will be investigated.  I would prefer the opposite approach.  I <Col N="1316" /> should infinitely prefer to see prices sealed off as of a certain date.  Then anyone who wants to increase prices should come in and justify that increase to the Department rather than have the Department initiating investigations.</P>
    <P>We all know that since this iniquitous turnover tax entered our economy, people have been trying to exploit the situation to the utmost in an effort to recoup themselves for their added difficulties as a result of this iniquitous impost.  I do not intend to enter into an economic survey of the difficulties the Government have created, but, if the Government cannot offer something better than the Taoiseach's lamentations and his milk-and-water type of price control now suggested, would the Government get out and make way for a Government who can and will do the job?</P>

      <P>We, in the Labour Party, have grown quite used now to the situation in which we advocate certain things and implore the Government to pursue a certain line of policy over a period of time, to be abused, sneered at and jeered at.  Then, overnight, we find the Government at last converted to our way of thinking, implementing something at a belated date, something we have been assuring them for some considerable time was both necessary and desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome, as I say, some form of price control.  We would welcome it still more if we could be assured that the Minister will use the powers he seeks and that we will not have a repeat of the situation that existed under the 1958 Act.  Under the Act certain powers were conferred on the Minister.  He neglected to use those powers in the interests of the nation. Under that Act he could have curtailed some of the activities which have led <Col N="1317" /> us into the situation in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things in this Bill the Minister has not made clear. He said this morning that, if these inquiries are held at his instigation, they can be held in public.  When questioned by Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, he was, however, very reluctant to say whether or not it is his intention to hold these inquiries in public.  I urge the Minister to give very serious consideration to the manner in which these inquiries are held.  If this form of price control is to be effective it is essential that the people, and particularly the workers, should have confidence in the strength of this measure.  If the form of inquiry is to be one held by a couple of civil servants from the Minister's Department, behind closed doors, with the Minister issuing his findings and saying that the proposed increase is justified, I am greatly afraid that the confidence of the workers in this form of price control will be very seriously undermined.</P>
    <P>Workers feel that there is a tendency on the part of Fianna Fáil to discrimate between them and certain other sections of the community.  If a worker seeks to increase the cost of his labour, he is required to go before the Labour Court and make a case in public justifying the proposed increase.  Surely, if a manufacturer seeks to increase the price of his commodity or a utility the price of its service, then the justification for that increase should be made publicly?  No matter what form of price control is introduced, there will be occasions when increases will be justified but it is of the utmost importance that those who are going to bear the increases can see the justification for them and that the manufacturer or shopkeeper who wishes to make the increases should of necessity justify these increases in public.  I urge the Minister to ensure that any investigations he intends to make are made in public.</P>
    <P>There has been great talk from Fianna Fáil benches to the effect that our present difficulties can be attributed&mdash;solely, according to some <Col N="1318" /> Deputies and very largely, according to some Front Bench members&mdash;to the increase secured by the workers under the National Wage Agreement.  This is totally untrue and the worst feature of it is that people who have made the statement know it to be untrue. Surely members of the Government are in a position to have proper and accurate statistics; I have no doubt they have them and that they know that the increases that have occurred since the National Wage Agreement do not in any way account for the very substantial increase in prices that has taken place.  The actual statistics show that while wages increased by 12 per cent, prices have increased by 11 per cent and if the agreement is to run its normal course, there are still 12 months left before another increase becomes due.  Unless the Fianna Fáil Government have been completely and very recently converted to price control and unless the Minister means to use ruthlessly the powers he will have under this Bill, we can foresee without any stretch of imagination a very substantial increase in that 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>The 12 per cent has been virtually wiped out&mdash;11 per cent of it has gone &mdash;and unless the Government are sincere in implementing price control we shall find in the very near future, in my opinion, a much more serious situation than we have today.  The Taoiseach yesterday appealed to the patriotism of all sections of the community but while he did that, some speakers on the Government Benches who have since spoken have harped continually on one section.  The workers are apparently responsible for all our ills, according to Fianna Fáil spokesmen; they have done it all.  We know that is not true, that while workers have not only given lip service to the interests of the community as a whole, they are the one section that have proved by practical demonstrations over a number of years in their wage restraint that they have the interests of the nation at heart and are willing to play their part in recovering from any difficulties in which we might find ourselves and in contributing to the national welfare.  It is only fair to say they are becoming a little fed-up <Col N="1319" /> with being the only section that is appealed to, the only section that in a difficult situation that has been brought about by Government policy, are being asked to contribute while no effective measures are being introduced by the Government to ensure that other sections, far better able to contribute, do so.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that if there is a clear indication that the powers conferred on him under this Bill are used, the organised workers, as in the past, will be only too pleased to play their part, but it is essential that the conversion should be complete, and now that the Government have realised the absolute necessity for some sort of check on prices, it is essential that they use what they have sought, the powers given in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Our people are faced with a challenge which will tax their ingenuity, ability and energy to the limit.  Contrary to what some speakers have already said, I believe in and have confidence in the people's ability to stand up to this challenge and solve the difficulties facing us.  I think there is nothing wrong with the nation at present; we have run into troubled waters but, by and large, I think we have solved our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker said that the workers were, I should probably say, cringing, under the strain.  The majority of people in this country are workers, farm workers, organised industrial workers, local authority workers and so on.  Therefore, whatever problems or difficulties have been imposed on us are the responsibility of the entire working people.  Unfortunately for all of us, credit facilities were too easily obtained in the past. That brought about a wave of spending on consumer goods which stretched the limit of our finances to the utmost in purchasing from outside as, unfortunately, the bulk of these purchases were imported goods.  If my figures are correct, I remember reading recently that we purchase £37 millions worth from Germany, 85 per cent of which was consumer goods, many of which we could quite easily <Col N="1320" /> do without.  Our people were really purchasing against the wages they would earn in five or ten years time. This was a new pattern in Irish life because in the past our people never committed themselves to more than they could handle tomorrow or even today.  I think that is the cause of our trouble.  The measures being taken here should prove useful in reducing the import excess which in many cases was entirely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the contribution of Deputy Collins and the advice he attempted to give&mdash; extraordinary advice coming from a member of a Party who made no attempt to cope with the difficulties they ran into in 1956, who ran headlong into the troubles they created at that time and who indeed threw in the towel and stepped out of the arena. They were not forced out: they just disintegrated, walked out and left the position after them.  I would like to know what sound advice we could get from that attitude of mind today.</P>
    <P>This Government have always stood up and done what was necessary to get this nation out of any difficulty.  This Party will get the people back on the right track and have them at work again in a realistic way.  Those of us in business and closely associated with the purchasing public realise that our people have been up in the clouds and have not been facing their responsibilities. I believe this nation still has a great future and that we are on the right road towards attaining the aims we hope to reach in future years.</P>
    <P>I had a particular instance of this in my own constituency last week where extra personnel were required for a German factory in the town of Cahirciveen which is engaged in the production of hosiery for export to the German market.  These people are producing a first-class article entirely for export to Germany.  They have to bear the cost of getting the article to the German shopkeeper and, in addition, have to pay a 20 per cent entry duty.  Despite this, they have to compete with the locally-made product, and they are successfully doing so. <Col N="1321" /> When we have people able to do that, it shows there is nothing wrong with our workers and that we will solve our problems by showing the type of spirit the workers in that factory are showing.  They are doing their job conscientiously and well and giving a good return for their wages.  That is the type of outlook we want to get from our people.  Co-operation from all sides is needed.  It is up to everybody to advise our people to develop that outlook and have a united effort to produce goods which can be sold abroad competitively.  I believe from the figures I have seen in Cahirciveen that we can do that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Collins that there is scope for big improvement in our agricultural sales and marketing. Under the present system, we have to have subsidies to the extent of £53 million to sell £130 million worth of our agricultural produce on outside markets.  Half of that produce would sell itself without any subsidy, which means there must be almost a pound for pound subsidy in order to sell the remainder.  Those figures would indicate, as Deputy Collins tried to point out, that our market development is not correct.  We know it costs a large sum to sell butter.  If we have more cattle, we must have more butter; and more butter costs us more millions again.  We will have to find alternative methods of developing that arm of our agriculture and enabling ourselves to face the future with confidence.</P>
    <P>Coming from a rural area, I am always in favour of maximum agricultural production.  The whole economy of my own constituency depends on high-priced agricultural produce.  If we have to compete with low-priced produce in foreign markets, our chances of success are limited. Certainly, we can sell all the cattle we can produce without any subsidy. Unfortunately, more cattle mean more by-products, and the by-products cost us money.</P>
    <P>At this stage the nation is facing one of its greatest challenges.  I will not say it is a question of survival, because personally I do not think we <Col N="1322" /> are in that kind of difficulty.  But corrective measures are necessary.  Our people have energy, initiative and pride.  If we can channel those attributes into the right lines of production to give us command of outside markets, we will have our people on the right road towards getting out of our present difficulties.  If we can curb unnecessary imports and bring them down to the ordinary needs of our people, I believe we can resolve this position in a short time.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the people opposite that their help and co-operation is needed.  It is the urgent duty of every Irishman to see that our people are not divided in any way but that they all co-operate to develop their energies in order to overcome this temporary crisis and bring our nation back to the position it was in four or five years ago, with the hope that in our time we will see full employment for our people.  In doing that, we will be doing a good day's work for the benefit of the country we all love and which we are all so anxious to see reach the place amongst the nations to which it is entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the introduction of this Estimate yesterday, in conjunction with the Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1965, we were told that the present rate of economic growth is not sufficient to maintain our present standard of living. That means that we must either increase the rate of economic growth or reduce our standard of living.  There is nothing in the proposals put before the House by the Government, nor was there in the Budget introduced by the Government, to increase the economic growth.  Therefore it would appear to me that the only solution the Government have, or the only alternative, is a reduction in the standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were also told that our imports have increased substantially while our exports have been seriously reduced. Our imports have gone up for the first few months of this year, I understand, by £16 million, while our exports have been reduced by £9 million.  Our exports are less than half of the <Col N="1323" /> amount of our imports.  There are no proposals before the House, nor were there any in the Budget, to correct this state of affairs.  There is no incentive to export in the Budget and therefore we must assume that the only way the Government have to correct this is to try to reduce our imports and again hit our standard of living.</P>
    <P>In the same speech we were told that the adverse trend in our external payments this year would amount to at least £50 million, if we were lucky. That came as a startling piece of news to this House because if anybody had suggested during the last general election that that was the state of affairs, he would have been accused of sabotaging the country.  As recently as the Budget, introduced only a month or six weeks ago, we were informed that the adverse external balance of payments for the year ended had been £31 million and that it would remain about the same for the next 12 months.  In less than six weeks, the Government have got to know, or at least they have decided to tell the House, that the external balance of payments position has deteriorated to the tune of £20 million.  I want to know did the Government not know at Budget time that the external balance of payments this year would be £50 million, if we were lucky, instead of £31 million?</P>
    <P>In the same speech we were told that there is an undesirable rise in the Consumer Price Index; in other words, that there is an undesirable rise in the cost of living.  That is one thing we had not to be told because it is something that everybody knew, that everybody felt and that every housewife fully appreciated for some time past. We were told in the same speech that in the past 12 months the deficit in visible trading amounted to £125 million. We were told that the capital inflow for this year is estimated at £25 million instead of £36 million for the previous year.  We were also told that production costs still soar and that the nation is consuming more and producing less, and that bank lending has increased by £35 million, but principally into Government sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> That roughly is the picture that was painted.  It is not a success story.  It is a story of gloom and, in my opinion, a story of abject failure.  It is a picture that was not painted by the Leader of the Opposition Party in this House; it is a picture that was not painted or a story that was not told by a Taoiseach who had come into office and found things not as he had hoped or expected.  It is a story that was not told by the Leader of a minority Government because the man who told it enjoyed an overall majority from 1957 to 1961 and from 1961 to this year, he enjoyed a safe majority. He enjoyed a majority of his own Party coupled with support from people whom he respected and in whom he had confidence, in the persons of two Deputies.</P>
    <P>In 1962 in glowing terms, in a long speech, he said that the former Deputy Sherwin, who was then in this House and was supporting him, spoke more sense in ten minutes than all the other speakers had spoken in four hours. Several times during that speech he referred to the same Deputy in glowing terms.  He also had the confidence and support of Deputy Leneghan of North Mayo during that term and he has since endorsed that confidence in and respect for that Deputy by restoring him to Oireachtas Éireann.  The story I have summarised here was told yesterday by the Taoiseach, by the Leader of the Government, and can be regarded as nothing more or less than a confession of abject failure on the part of the Taoiseach and the Government.  This did not happen all of its own accord; it did not happen accidentally.  The present challenge, as Deputy O'Connor calls it, the present mess created by the Government as I would prefer to call it, was brought about by direct Government action over the past four or five years. I have been a member of the Oireachtas only since 1961 but I remember early in 1962, the bright young dynamos of the Government Party coming into the Seanad and saying that the national cake had grown to enormous proportions and that everybody was entitled to a fair share of it.  They were putting through <Col N="1325" /> measures to increase salaries, by as much as £600 per year in some cases, on the basis that those increases were not required to catch up with the cost of living but that the people concerned were entitled to them as status increases.</P>
    <P>That was the picture being painted in the early part of 1962 and on the Adjournment Debate in this House in the middle of December, 1962, the Taoiseach, speaking to criticism on that debate, in a speech in which he paid glowing tributes to his friend Deputy Sherwin, stated that the economy was sound.  It is in black and white and cannot be denied.  He deprecated criticism from Deputy Dillon and others in the House.</P>
    <P>No sooner were the Christmas festivities over than the Taoiseach and the Government introduced a White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i>, from which it appeared the economy was far from sound, from which it appeared that production was not keeping up with wages and salaries.  That was the same man in the same Government who had the previous December stated from that bench over there that the economy was sound and that anybody who said it was not was being unfair to him and to the country.  That was the situation that began to develop.</P>
    <P>We were told in the White Paper that there was a serious gap which would have to be corrected, that unless it was corrected, the country would head for trouble.  The workers were asked not to request any increases in wages and the people employed by State subsidised or controlled concerns were told they would not get any further increases in wages or salaries. One would have thought that that being the situation then, the Government would not do anything which might be calculated to increase the cost of living further, to drive the wage earners of this country to seek higher wages.</P>
    <P>Imagine the indignation and the surprise of the country when the Budget, which came only a short time afterwards, increased the prices of food, clothing and fuel.  All the necessaries of life, for the first time in this country, <Col N="1326" /> were taxed.  That tax came immediately on top of a request for a standstill in wages, for a standstill in salaries.  It came on top of a request to all to pull their weight to see that the gap was closed.  Did the Government seriously expect that wages would remain at a standstill on top of an increase in the cost of living brought about deliberately and directly by their actions?</P>
    <P>They were warned in this House by the leaders and other members of this Party that what they were doing would lead them and the country into trouble.  The Government did not take heed.  There was a by-election in this city that summer, in North-East Dublin, and the Government suffered an overwhelming defeat in what was regarded as the best-organised Government constituency in the country. The White Paper was still in force. The gap had not been closed.</P>
    <P>At the end of that year, the Government were faced with a by-election in Cork city which they refused to hold. That by-election, in the ordinary course of events, would have been held at the end of 1963 but the Government refused to take the initiative to hold the by-election and resisted a motion tabled from this side of the House to move the Writ for the by-election. Then the occasion for another by-election occurred in Kildare and the Government had no alternative but to go to the electorate in Cork and Kildare. That was less than two years after the introduction of the turnover tax, less than 12 months after the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> had been introduced warning the people the economy was not sound and that no further increases in wages could be allowed.</P>
    <P>Then in the early days of 1964, the Government were guilty of a dishonest political trick which is causing the country its present trouble.  The Government then, within 12 months of the issuing of the White Paper, gave the green light for a 12 per cent increase in wages which the workers had been forced to seek because of the increase in the cost of living brought about by the turnover tax and by nothing else. <Col N="1327" /> In those early days of 1964, the Government were concerned only to hold on to office, to win those two by-elections. For that purpose they sought to take credit for the 12 per cent wage increase.  They were determined to avoid negotiations for wages going on at the same time as the election campaign.</P>
    <P>We know that as a result of that they won the two by-elections in Cork and Kildare.  We know that as a result of the turnover tax, followed by the 12 per cent increase in wages, things were driven out of hand.  That is the cause of the trouble we have today.  It is only now for the first time that the Government admit the litany of troubles I have recited.  It is not my litany; it is the Taoiseach's litany.  Now for the first time that litany has been acknowledged.</P>
    <P>What would the position have been if, before the last general election, held on 7th April of this year, the Taoiseach had come clean with the people of the country and had told them our trade balance was wrong, our balance of payments was wrong, that our cost of living was going sky high, that our present rate of economic growth was not sufficient to maintain our present standard of living?  He would have been swept out of office.  Some people did not understand why the general election was held on 7th April.  The country knew that the by-elections in Cork did not change the Government's representation in the House.  The Government had the same majority in the House after the by-election as they had before it.  It is now obvious to the people why the general election was held on 7th April of this year.  It was because the Government decided that if they did not go to the country then, they would be driven to the country later in this year and swept out of office.  It was a shabby confidence trick on the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> A number of proposals have been made by the Taoiseach to correct the state of affairs which he now admits exists.  He says that he will encourage saving.  Is there anything in the recent Budget to encourage saving?  Will the <Col N="1329" /> new death duty proposals encourage saving?  Will the fact that the personal allowances under the income tax code stand at the figures which they have stood at for many years encourage saving?  The Taoiseach says that he will curtail bank lending.  That will be a very simple operation because bank lending has stopped.  It will not take any Government action to curtail bank lending at the present time. Anybody who through business or otherwise has had occasion to investigate bank lending at the moment will know that that is the easiest job to date that the Taoiseach has taken on.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the external payments deficit must be reduced.  He has not told us how he proposes to do that or what measures he proposes to introduce to close the gap.</P>
      <P>Again, I go back to the Budget. The Budget is the instrument which once a year discloses Government policy.  There is nothing in the Budget which will encourage exports either agricultural or otherwise.  There is not, substantially speaking, one penny in the Budget for agriculture.  I should like some of the Ministers in this House to tell the House how the Government propose to increase exports.</P>
      <P>There are to be no further increases in wages and salaries and personal incomes.  Does that mean that that will apply all round and to everybody? Does it mean that there will be no secret increases given either to heads of the Civil Service or otherwise?  Does it mean that this wage freeze will apply to everybody?  Can we have that assurance and can we have an explanation as to why large increases in salaries were not disclosed in estimates introduced into the House this year?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that he will borrow abroad.  Is that not a dangerous proposal?  Deputy Dillon has said to-day that we have sold a lot of our land for foreign capital and now if we are going to borrow vast sums of money abroad, if it is lent to us, the state of affairs may be reached where we will lose control of our own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that another plank in his platform for economic <Col N="1330" /> revival would be the encouragement of the Buy Irish campaign.  When the British levies were introduced last year and when we had this terrific Buy Irish campaign initiated, the first thing that struck me was that the Government for years back had forgotten about a Buy Irish campaign, had forgotten about giving any encouragement to the people to buy Irish.  It took the British levies to bring them to their senses.  If what I am saying is wrong, why was it necessary to start such a widespread publicity campaign immediately the British levies were introduced to get the people to buy Irish?  If the Government had been doing their work, that campaign would not have been necessary.</P>
    <P>The next proposal outlined by the Taoiseach was the Prices Control Bill. None of us likes price control.  The Taoiseach does not like it.  He denounced it in this House on several occasions.  He said that an attempt at price control usually ended in increasing prices.  If price control is necessary, although we deplore it, we will put up with it, but I should like the Government to tell us something more about how they propose to operate this price control.  The Taoiseach was Minister for Supplies in a Fianna Fáil Government during the war.  He operated the Department of Supplies, a Department which rigidly controlled prices and supplies.  That Department was necessary then.</P>
    <P>A state of affairs then existed here which was completely beyond our control, either in its extent or otherwise. The state of affairs which then had to be dealt with was that of a world war, the greatest war in the world either then or since.  Do the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach tell this House that the situation here today, brought about by them, is something akin to the situation which existed here in the 1940's?  Many traders in this country were harassed by the Department of Supplies under the present Taoiseach and I think the Taoiseach in his references to this Prices (Amendment) Bill should have told the House a little more about how he proposes to operate the measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> Will prices be controlled from town to town; will they be controlled on a national level; will they be fixed as a result of an investigation carried out by an impartial tribunal; or will they be fixed by the Minister behind closed doors after consultation with some of his own officials?  Those are the things which the people are entitled to know. The Taoiseach said that there would be control first and investigation afterwards. That sounds very like shooting first and asking questions afterwards. It is a very drastic suggestion and one that could be justified only by the most severe national crisis.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach introduced his Estimate with a brazen face.  He did so as the head of a Government who did not think they had anything to be ashamed of, did not think they had anything to account for, did not think they had anything to explain.  He introduced it in a tone and with an air of complete justification, as if he deserved to be complimented on his activities and on his record.  I do not think he deserves to be complimented. I think he and his Government deserve the greatest censure from Deputies and the people of the country for allowing this situation to develop for cheap political reasons, for the purpose of winning by-elections and remaining in power throughout a general election.  I am confident that when the people get an opportunity of expressing their views on the Taoiseach and the Government, they will do so in no uncertain manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Fitzpatrick, one wonders whether he really does approve of any of the proposals of the Taoiseach to deal with this particular economic crisis.  There appears to be some division of opinion as between him and Deputy Cosgrave who made a most statesmanlike speech and indicated his consent, with reservations, to the proposals being made in order that we could meet the balance of payments situation.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has introduced an element of purely political propaganda into the whole discussion which will not get <Col N="1332" /> us anywhere and will not enable us to overcome our difficulties.</P>
      <P>He reiterated all the nonsense about the by-elections in Cork city and Kildare. Everybody knows that the negotiations for the ninth round of wage increases were undertaken by the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Everybody knows that under our system the Taoiseach and the Government could have no influence on the final outcome of these negotiations and that in the period which led up to these discussions, warning after warning was given not only by the Taoiseach but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, other Ministers and myself in public speeches of the effect of increases in wages on labour costs.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is on record as saying, well before the Cork and Kildare by-elections, that an increase of anything from six to eight per cent would be much more effective than a larger increase, that it would result in the workers being able to keep more of the increases for themselves.  He is on record as saying that many industries would be able to increase productivity to match a reasonable wage increase to hold for a year.  To say that the Taoiseach deliberately boosted the 12 per cent increase is completely untrue, as is shown by his own speeches. Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that perfectly well.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was also talking as if this were a <Col N="1333" /> unique form of national crisis, as if no other country were affected by such a crisis, as if we were the only country whose balance of payments situation was not in order and if there were no such similar situation in democratically well-run countries such as New Zealand, the great United States and from time to time in the very well organised and well-run democracies. Deputy Fitzpatrick is trying to fool the people into believing that this is something unique caused by the alleged failure of the Government to warn the country that certain eventualities might take place.</P>
      <P>The problems that have faced other countries are in many cases similar to those which we face ourselves, the problem arising when everyone looks for a higher standard of living as rapidly as possible as the economy expands.  People in most countries are not prepared to conserve something for the lean period, to restrain their demands for increased salaries or to allow for a possible change in international trade.  That is the fact, and all over the world in countries run by left of centre Governments where there is a tremendous desire to improve living standards, these Governments are faced with continual demands by the ordinary people to live up to the limit of what income is available to them, due to the growth of exports and productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is facing some of the same problems as those which are faced by other countries all over the world.  People do not like to put aside reserves to meet an unknown eventuality, and the people of this country have not desired in the past five or six years to put aside reserves to meet an eventuality.  In the case of our own country, the reason is more natural, that we had only a one per cent increase in national income during the whole period from the end of the war up to 1958.  Other countries were advancing more rapidly than we were. When the Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1957, for the first time after a period of inevitable delay, the real incomes of our people started to mount at a faster rate than had been <Col N="1334" /> recorded at any previous period of our history when conditions were normal and when free competitive influences were at play.</P>
    <P>For the first three years, our growth of production and our living costs related to each other in the most satisfactory way, and from 1958 until 1961, there was a very small increase in the cost of living.  Wage level increases kept pace with growing productivity and there was every evidence that our growth of income compared with some, the very few, countries in Europe which have maintained the principle of a national incomes policy and where everybody has come to realise that wages and salaries should grow with national income, and that if they grow with national income, then the workers keep the increased earnings they are able to secure through a growth in the nation's productivity.</P>
    <P>From 1961 onwards, the pace mounted.  Let no one in this House say that the people were not warned of the possibilities that might arise if for any reason there were circumstances in which the balance of payments position might be accentuated by changes in world economic conditions. Every Minister of this Government, the Taoiseach, the former Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself, everybody who is acquainted with or interested in economics and in the national economy and who specialise in that subject, all have warned the nation on every possible occasion, right from the coming of the events associated with the <i>Closing the Gap</i> White Paper, right through the whole period, about the effects of inflation.  They have made it perfectly clear that we have a free enterprise economy in which no attempt is made by the Government to control the earnings of the people by any decree, that all the Government can do is to control increases by taxation and credit restriction.</P>
    <P>We have all been telling this story continuously, suggesting that the time had come for the acceptance of a national incomes policy, asking for its consideration by the trade unions and <Col N="1335" /> by the Federation of Employers. There has never at any time been a lack of propaganda in regard to this whole matter.  I was looking back on the speeches I made on this subject which were in consonance with speeches made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Taoiseach right through the period from 1961 to 1965.  Warnings were given that this practice of taking every little bit of the cake that could be taken had its dangers.  That is the position and I do not intend to bore the House by reading extracts from endless speeches I made on this subject. We made it absolutely clear that inflation was of no benefit to the workers, that they themselves would be able to have exactly the same increase in real earnings if they were to follow the example set for them by a small number of countries, mostly in Northern Europe, where this concept of a national incomes policy had been accepted and where it can be seen that there was less inflation than in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have gone as far as we can to suggest that there is no reason for us to copy the bad practices of English industrial relations, that we should imitate the English only if they have good traditions and good practices, and that we should try to get away from the attitude of mind that has beset the whole arrangements for negotiating wages and salaries, that has beset this country particularly in recent years.</P>
    <P>We have given all the facts about the situation.  What we are facing here today can be described in the very simplest terms, and I hope that from now on everybody will begin to appreciate the facts that have been told to them over and over again, that for every £100 spent in this country, £40 is imported, and that although a Buy Irish campaign can mitigate that to some extent, because of our fundamental lack of raw materials, we are a country where imports inevitably succeed the spending of money.  No worker, no salaried person, no one in the community <Col N="1336" /> will have a higher standard of living unless he comes to appreciate the fact that if we spend the £100, we must be certain that the £40 of exports are there, that they are sold, that they are available and will continue to be available.  That is the simplest way of putting it.  That has been stated many times in different ways by Ministers of this Government. Although, as I have said, the Buy Irish campaign can mitigate that and although it is better to buy Irish shirts than foreign-made shirts because there is the Irish labour in making the shirt, the materials in the shirt are mostly foreign because we cannot grow cotton here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to many industries, particularly industries using all kinds of metal such as the motor car industry.  It is better to buy an Irish-assembled car than to buy a foreign car; nevertheless, the import content of the Irish-assembled car would be relatively high.  We are an import-intensive country and we must forever remember this rule about the £100.  Until people start to realise those facts in our national life, we are bound to have successive balance of payments crises at different periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard one statement by a Deputy of the Labour Party which suggested that they, or at least some of them, were under the illusion that if wages went up by 12 per cent, prices need not rise.  There is no country in the world where, if wages go up 12 per cent at once, prices will not rise.  One only has to go through the ordinary labour costs of any industry, which are available in various publications, to see that is inevitable.  What we want to ensure is that if there is a wages increase, the industries can absorb the increase in wages through greater productivity.  Some of the industries have been able to do that; some have not been able to do it. When the question of people receiving increased incomes as a result of greater prosperity is considered, it has <Col N="1337" /> to be remembered that there are a considerable number of industries and trades where it is almost impossible to make any saving whatever and where any increase in labour costs is directly passed back in increases in living costs and so cancels out the benefit to the worker.</P>
    <P>In relation to these trades and industries, we have to live with this problem perpetually.  A typical example is that of CIE.  No matter what CIE does to increase productivity the labour content is something between 60 and 64 per cent and, if fares are increased, it is quite impossible at any time for CIE to absorb the increase in fares by greater productivity.  The company simply cannot operate on that basis.  I think everybody must know the reason, but it is partly because, if a train has to run every day at a given time, it just cannot stop running on a particular day because there are no passengers for it.  On the other hand, a firm can cut down temporarily the production of a particular article if there is no demand for it.  In a transport service, however, and this applies equally to every transport service throughout the world, where there are regular services scheduled, there is just nothing drastic that can be done to increase productivity at a particular period and, when there is a considerable increase in labour costs, it is inevitable that these must be passed on to the community either by way of increased subsidy paid by the taxpayer or by way of increased fares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of other considerations have been mentioned in this debate.  As the House knows, the total level of taxation levied last year bore a relationship to national income that was about the same as in 1956-57. Taxes were increased because under the prevailing system of taxation there could be a very big rise in national income without receiving the same percentage in tax for Government services, which are becoming more expensive because of the national development that has taken place and will continue in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> There are a great many things we have to face in relation to taxation.  If a turnover tax is applied on the whole community and one-third of it is remitted in increased social welfare there seems to be some sort of theory that everybody must recoup himself and herself by having an increase in wages of 2½ per cent.  I wonder whether in the next ten years that will prove to be possible in connection with the turnover tax or any other tax.  The Government asked the people to transfer a given amount of their incomes for the sake of national Government services.  I wonder whether the workers and the salaried people generally will succeed ultimately if, over the next ten years, they try to undo the effect of a tax, which is needed by the Government and which is all spent among the people, by having increases in wages to cover the particular tax.  I think, if one looks back over the history of other countries, it will be found that such ventures are not generally very successful.</P>
    <P>What was the basis of the tax?  The facts are that in 1964 the people spent £88 million in consumer expenditure and the Government asked them to give £13 million of that £88 million for Government services.  The implication was that, if they recouped themselves by increased wages, then the effect of that would be to increase costs still further and you would have a leap-frogging effect which would ultimately result in no one gaining anything.</P>
    <P>There is another question we have to consider then very honestly.  These are matters about which we can speculate. Part of the increase in the cost of living has resulted from the increase in certain agricultural products.  Everybody knows that.  Some people say the non-agricultural community must compensate themselves for the increase in the cost of agricultural goods produced by our own people.  I wonder whether they will be able to do that over the next ten years.  I wonder whether it is not right sometimes for the agricultural community income to increase at the expense of the nonagricultural <Col N="1340" /> sections' income because the actual facts are that the agricultural income per head in this country is still lower than that of the nonagricultural community.  Efforts are now being made in all parts of the world, in the EEC and elsewhere, to try to level up incomes.  I wonder whether there is much use in the nonagricultural community trying to compensate itself with increases to offset the costs which provide more profits and more help for the farmer when inevitably Government policy is to transfer payments made by the nonagricultural community back to the farmers in the form of additional subsidies.  I wonder whether there will be much success in that exercise in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>All these things have to be considered.  There is yet another hard fact we have to remember.  We have about one half of the national income per head of the British.  Many other countries have similarly lower incomes than the British for one reason or another.  In our case we have had a very short period in which to develop our economy.  We also lack the essential raw materials which the British have or which they derive from their long imperial associations. These are disappearing.  We have now had a warning that in the future we should all consider together how to provide some element of reserve resources to meet certain eventualities, international repercussions and the absense of international liquidity in payments, the effect of the British levy on our export trade, and other circumstances which arise and which all help to contribute to the crisis which we hope and believe will be overcome by the measures proposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters that arise in connection with this discussion&mdash;the discussion has been fairly continuous over the last three years&mdash;is the possibility of getting agreement on a national incomes policy.  That is, of <Col N="1341" /> course, associated with many practical problems.  One of them is the fact that there are different industries with different degress of productivity.  Some industries can engineer a big increase in productivity, and have done so, while others lag behind.  I heard some Deputies suggest that not enough was being done to increase productivity. As far as I know the National Productivity Authority have been operating with the aid of Government funds and adaptation councils have been set up for all industries.  Adaptation councils have been set up for all the industries and there has been nothing to prevent any particular trade union group or any employers' group from making proposals to increase productivity. Productivity is growing; it has to grow still faster if we are to overcome some of the difficulties we now face.</P>
    <P>In regard to the controversy over national incomes policy, it is true that a great deal of the price structure of the country is determined on a competitive basis.  The Bill before the House will ensure that there are no exceptions to that and that it shall be impossible for firms to increase their prices excessively, even though they may face competition, through some kind of tacit agreement between them that prices should go up by a certain amount.  Having agreement to a stricter form of price control would seem to me to answer many of the objections that have been put forward by the workers' side to a national incomes policy, that if there is price control and if the National Industrial Economic Council put forward proposals to the country as to what they believe the growth of real incomes has been and what can be safely gained at a given period in increased salaries and wages which will not be lost through inflation, the attitude towards the national incomes policy with a price control system installed may be more favourable. I hope it will be, because I have found, by making an examination in other countries where this system is operating, that on the whole it is very successful.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about the system abroad is that in the few <Col N="1342" /> countries where it operates the workers always have the opportunity, if they wish to take it, of getting a bigger increase at certain points if they feel the system is lagging.  That is one of the things that is never spoken about; everybody thinks that if we have a national incomes policy it must be absolutely rigid and that at no point can there be any departure from it. People are human and in every country where there has been a national incomes policy there can be seen at certain times a departure from it because the workers perhaps felt that the rules had been too strict or perhaps that the country could afford a little bit more than was recommended.  It is also true to say that there have been periods where the system has broken down and in some cases the Government have had to take corrective action because the body that corresponds to our NIEC were right in the particular year when they made their declaration and corrective action had to be taken of a disinflationary kind.  In other years it would appear that when there was a departure after a number of years of following the strict rules, eventually no harm came to the community because the value of money had declined in other countries and the industries in the particular country concerned did not suffer as the costs in the other countries had gone up.</P>
    <P>All these things need considering at present on a constructive basis. Obviously, it will take time for people to come to any kind of agreement on this proposal and I am mentioning it merely as a background to the discussions that must eventually take place arising from the present crisis.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to say a few words about status increases in incomes. Nobody in the House, so far as I know, opposed any of these increases. I wonder why there was no objection to the majority of the increases by anyone.  The reason of course was, as everybody knows, that the great majority of these status increases represented the inevitable levelling up that takes place in every country when the incomes of certain classes in the community relative to other classes in <Col N="1343" /> the community were depressed.  In fact no national incomes policy in any country is so rigid that it precludes income adjustments for workers who, for one reason or another, have not been able to secure the same growth in income as has been secured by the other sections of the community.  In those countries where this kind of thing takes place nobody suggests that because there have been status increases everybody should get a corresponding increase in wages.  These are matters that must be looked at dispassionately and calmly.  There have been criticisms in this House over the past five years in respect of sections of the community whose incomes were low in comparison with the incomes of others and now we have a whole series of statements made here suggesting that all these increases were unjustified and that they are one of the causes of the present inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government could not face the position in which increases had occurred in commercial and industrial employment which meant that the position of others, particularly in the Civil Service, had become relatively worse and salaries by comparison with outside salaries appeared abnormally low.  There were bound to be adjustments of this kind and it does not mean that anybody is going to benefit by simply washing their hands of all the issues that have to be faced and simply saying: &ldquo;We must have an enormous increase in wages because these other people have been given status increases.&rdquo;  That will not serve the best interests of the country and will not bring the workers any real increase.</P>
    <P>It has been made perfectly clear, as long ago as December, that until productivity rises sufficiently any demand by workers for wage increases will not give them the advantages of those wage increases.  What we should all long for is a system in which when workers get increases in wages they are able to keep them.  That can be done; it has been achieved in a considerable number of countries where workers' real earnings have steadily increased with due regard being paid to the <Col N="1344" /> national economy.  Anybody who wants to read the facts can find them in Switzerland or the Netherlands or in Belgium or in a number of other countries.  They can see the system operating, not perfectly &mdash; it never operates absolutely perfectly&mdash;but with the real earnings of the workers advancing as a result of concerted discussions between the employers and the workers and some sort of independent council as to what optimum increase could be given which would enable the workers to retain the full benefit of what they have secured.</P>

      <P>I think I have dealt with a number of points raised in the debate.  The main point I wished to make was this: we have had a great growth of national income; we have made tremendous progress but from the beginning of the period where the growth in our national production, in terms of greater costs, started to mount very rapidly as compared with the growth in the national production, taking the value of money in constant terms, every Minister of the Government has warned the people of the result of asking for too much too soon. <Col N="1345" /> Those warnings have been given steadily by the Ministers concerned with State companies, with Industry and Commerce, and by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance ever since 1962.  Nobody can say the underlying causes, which are only part of the reason for the action now being taken, have not been fully published and if people did not see fit to take our advice there is nothing we can do about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Deputies, I am grateful to the Minister for Transport and Power for giving us this rather extended left-of-centre dissertation here late this afternoon.  I am so grateful that I stayed until now, late in the evening to hear these thoughts of the Minister because I think he was courageous enough to grasp some nettles that others in his Cabinet, perhaps with more foresight, have not grasped in this debate.  He mentioned this ugly word &ldquo;status&rdquo; which is causing quite a lot of trouble and possibly is one of the reasons why this House has rather a closed club atmosphere rather late this afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach asked us yesterday afternoon to preserve a sense of responsibility and calm in the discussions on the economic situation at present facing us.  As responsible people we should strive to do that.  We should avoid what I do not think the Minister for Transport and Power avoids, that is, chasing culprits in the trade union movement and saying that the cause of our inflation is exclusively the wage claims from that part of our society.  We can all look for culprits and seek alibis at this time, but I do not think there should be a one-sided recitation of the events that have brought us to a point where we are almost back to where we were in 1956. Probably the one element that distinguishes this period from 1956 is that production is still showing a slight rise. In all other respects, we are slipping back quickly to 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his tour of the progressive countries mentioned the problem of balance of payments faced by other well-regulated democracies.  That <Col N="1346" /> is true.  Our problem is that we must be unique as being the only economy that has a permanent balance of payments problem, coupled to a considerable extent at the moment with an inflationary situation, together with unemployment and emigration.  I would say a comparison with the well-regulated democracies and the common problems they face is not valid in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>One thing I was disappointed about in the Taoiseach's speech yesterday was that there was no real honest attempt to break down the inflationary trends which have gripped the economy since the National Wage Agreement. If he erred at all, it was in having a political interpretation of the period since the National Wage Agreement. In the serious situation before us, this had a little bit of dishonesty in it.  At this time there is need to state the problem before us honestly.  I thought the Taoiseach could have done so more wholeheartedly.  We could have had a clearer description of what elements had occurred in the price increase since the National Wage Agreement. Above all, we could have had the reduction to a proportion of what part the actual 12 per cent had in the rise in prices over this period.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out how belated has been this action of the Government in bringing in price control machinery.  We have called for it often in the recent past.  But it is not my purpose to fire any parliamentary salvos about the past but to talk about the immediate problems facing us.  The great tragedy I see in this situation is that in seeking to bring before the House at this moment, and in seeking to alert the country to what is supposed to be, and is, a potentially extremely serious situation, the Government lay themselves open to the charge of being cynical in their approach to price control at this time. They are bringing in price control machinery at a time when we can now see that the increase people received under the National Wage Agreement has been cancelled out by an increase in prices.</P>
    <P>In his statement yesterday, the Taoiseach said that all the measures <Col N="1347" /> proposed involved no sacrifice on the part of the workers.  Certainly, anybody with a trade union background, or anybody who has close contact with his constituents at this time, can tell you there is grave sacrifice on the part of all workers in the situation that the increase they received has been cancelled out.  The Taoiseach, in saying there was a further year to run for the National Wage Agreement, must know he is speaking against all the current of opinion in the country and all the feeling of the working classes.  The tragedy we have at present is that the workers are poised for another round and the Taoiseach tells us yesterday there is an economic crisis in the country.  He introduces a Prices Bill as an element of our concern for the economic crisis.  I will be a delegate to the forthcoming conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They will be meeting to consider reports of movements already beginning for another wage round.  This is at a time when the Government are telling us that the economic situation is so bad that we must introduce price control.</P>
    <P>It is obvious there is an extremely difficult and grave situation before us where, because of lack of control, prices have slipped up since the National Wage Agreement.  They have now registered their effect on the living standards of the people, and the people have reacted normally to them.  At this time we introduce this Prices Bill and expect to have the support of the people.  We expect it to be a sort of guarantee to the people that they need not seek any further increases in their living standards because there is now a Prices Bill in operation that will preserve their standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that however much the Minister for Transport and Power may lecture us about progressive movements all around the world, and how socialism in countries on the other side of the world may appear to him, looking at it from Dáil Éireann, the situation to which we must face up at the moment means that trade unions, under pressure from their members, are on the march to <Col N="1348" /> increase their standard of living and we are told that the economic situation of the country is not such as to warrant that advance.</P>
    <P>When the National Wage Agreement was signed, most of us welcomed it. Any of us looking at the economic situation over the past few months could see there was an extremely severe build-up which could have an adverse effect on our economy.  Over this period nothing was done to stop the tremendous increase that had occurred on the prices front.  Whatever other failures the National Wage Agreement may have had, this is surely the one part of it that will doom any repeat of a national agreement in the future.  A national agreement is not something that can be agreed to at one period.  It is not something if you have an unfortunate experience with it, that can be replaced in a year or two by another agreement when the first has proved a failure.  Industrial relations are extremely complex.  Initiatives, once taken, must be maintained and preserved.  We cannot, with the wave of a magic wand, reintroduce the situation as it was before.</P>
    <P>Over this period of the National Wage Agreement, there has been this large swing in prices and we have not taken action to counteract this increase. Presumably, the casualty of the present situation will be this&mdash;that it will make the possibility of the signing of another national agreement extremely unlikely in the future.  This is to be regretted because we can see that wages going up according to a plan, and the trade union movement sitting down peaceably with the employers and bargaining amicably for increases for their members, is a better form and a better system of industrial relations than a free-for-all system with strikes and what they mean to the ordinary workers.  The fact is that by our refusal or our failure to take prompt action in the period up to now, in the life of the National Wage Agreement, we have probably jeopardised any future hope of a national agreement or industrial relations based on this system.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of the other matter to which the Minister for Transport and Power referred, an <Col N="1349" /> incomes policy.  At one time or another, we have all spoken about an incomes policy being a just and a desirable objective that we should have before us, but can we say that an incomes policy can be achieved when we see a Prices Bill like this, which is a softener up, being introduced at such a time in the economic situation?  I do not think that we can say there is a possibility in the near future of an incomes policy in the sense that we are trying to bring in a Prices Bill when the economic situation has already become too bad for such a trend and when the ordinary trade unionists have suffered for too long the erosion of their increase and are moving ahead automatically.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power and other Government spokesmen have made it clear that their version of an incomes policy is solely to try to control wages.  This was the form of incomes policy mentioned in <i>Closing the Gap</i> to which the Minister referred.  That kind of policy has no hope of being accepted by the trade union movement and the sooner the Minister for Transport and Power and other Government speakers get this idea into their heads, the better. An incomes policy is one that seeks a policy for all types of income, however difficult this may be to achieve in our economy, but this is the only form of policy that has any hope of success, of acceptance, or agreement as far as the trade unionists are concerned.</P>
    <P>This Prices Bill is belated.  It seeks to remedy a situation that has already moved out of control on the prices front; yet the Labour Party have been calling for such a long time for some form of action on prices that we support it and we will constructively suggest changes where we think there should be changes.  But as I said before, the opportunity which a proper Prices Bill offered any Government, either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, as an opening or as an avenue towards an incomes policy, has been postponed by the unfortunate timing of this Bill and the refusal to face up to these facts before now, to the erosion in prices which has been obvious over a certain period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> The Government now seek to hand to the trade union leaders the unpleasant task of bringing trade unions into line in facing up to an unpleasant situation.  The National Wage Agreement expires next December and the possibility of another one being signed in the year after, in 1966, is rendered very slim indeed and the way forward if we were to take it towards an incomes policy has been postponed indefinitely by the timing and policy of the Government in producing this Bill at this time, and in not taking action before. I do not make these statements with any view to scoring political capital but merely to point to what I and other members of the Labour Party feel has been a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government.  However, we will support this Bill constructively even though time will tell whether I am right, whether our opinion is right about this uncertain outlook for the future.</P>
    <P>We have tinkered around with this problem for too long and I for one am rather gloomy about the prospect of improving this situation in the future. It is going to require far more consultation with the trade unions than the Government have shown themselves to be capable of.  These consultations should not be held at the time of an economic crisis, such as now, but at a time when things are going well.  That is the time to hear the complaints of the trade unionists in regard to the national economy.  The complaints have been loud enough about prices in the period since the National Wage Agreement was signed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>The fact that the Government have at this late stage given consideration to the question of price control brings again to the notice of the public the wise action taken by the inter-Party Government between 1954 and 1957 when the Prices Advisory Body was functioning.  That Government showed their concern in a very practical and positive way in regard to the cost of living and the control of prices.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce what machinery it is proposed to use to control prices.  The speech made by the Taoiseach yesterday, <Col N="1351" /> the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce today, as well as the few feeble speeches flavoured with hypocrisy which have come from the Government benches, have given no indication to manufacturing or business concerns, or to the public at large, how the Government propose to work this Prices Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sure the voters of this country would like to ask the Taoiseach what extraordinary change has taken place in the country since 6th April, 1965. Everything was right on 6th April, 1965, the day before the general election, when we were told that we were living in the greatest period of prosperity, that there was no such thing as a poor person, and the voters were asked to return Fianna Fáil so that the rate of progress could be accelerated.  Those were the very words used outside the General Post Office not only by the Taoiseach but by every other Fianna Fáil candidate. They said that people were wallowing in wealth, living in the greatest period of national prosperity since the State was founded.</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach tell the voters that there was a crisis or did he tell them about the balance of payments problem?  There have been plenty of speeches and statements from Fianna Fáil, all of which were made in an atmosphere of gaiety, of gluttony and of banqueting and dining, but what is the use of delivering an address to certain privileged classes when the speeches are given a particular flavour so that they will be relished and be more palatable to those participating in these dinners and banquets?</P>
      <P>It is the height of hypocrisy on the part of Fianna Fáil to have conducted a general election campaign by painting a picture through the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;one advantage we have in this debate is that we have no <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;for the people of the country that anything any Deputy opposed to Fianna Fáil said was wrong.  The <i>Irish Press</i> gave the speeches of Ministers and Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, all painting pictures of the period of prosperity in which we lived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> I want to place on record very clearly that the general election speeches and promises and undertakings of Fianna Fáil were only a ruse to catch votes.  Now that the Government see themselves firmly settled in office for the next 4½ years, they tell us, immediately after the general election, that there is a period of scarcity and of depression, that there must be a wages standstill and a Prices Bill to remedy a grave national crisis.  They have the courage to stand up and say: &ldquo;We appeal to the patriotism of Deputies, of trade unions, of all the people in the country, to stand behind us to surmount this grave national crisis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to refresh the memories of Deputies on speeches made in 1956 and 1957 when the inter-Party Government were faced with a balance of payments problem.  Every speech made in those days by Fianna Fáil Deputies was a direct attack on the Government. They said the crisis had been brought about by the Government by deliberate action.  There was no question of their co-operation.  In the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i>, on every platform at every church gate, they not alone took advantage of the national crisis but deliberately misrepresented and tried to undermine the Government. What is the position today?  Is it not true that the Government have brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy?  They are lucky as they were always lucky.  They have extraordinary good luck.  They were lucky at the polls and now they are lucky that this crisis cannot be conveyed to the people of the country because of the newspaper strike.</P>

      <P>Of course there is the radio and there is the television, but neither will give a true <Col N="1353" /> picture of the situation.  Radio and television are biased.  They are always inclined to favour Fianna Fáil.  Naturally enough, they are the child of Fianna Fáil and surely a child, subject to good parents, cannot go wrong.  In order that the radio becomes a good son of a good founder father, naturally enough it will give favourable publicity to that father.  There is nothing we can do about it.  It is only right that we should direct the attention of the public to this grave crisis in every way we possibly can.  We all have our views and opinions on this crisis and undoubtedly Deputies are expected on occasions like this to express their views.  It is not unbecoming to a Deputy to make known his views on all subjects.</P>
      <P>Since I am expected to express my views on this crisis, I should like to say that personally I should not give co-operation, good, bad or indifferent, to the Government.  If they got into a mess, let them stew in their mess.  If there was anything I could do to make the position known to the general public, at church gates or at fairs throughout the country, I should like to tell the people of the country that this extraordinary mess was made by Fianna Fáil, that they are in it, that they have dragged the people of the country in with them and let them get out of it themselves.  I cannot understand how any Minister has the nerve, the audacity or the neck to stand up and ask for the support of Labour and Fine Gael Deputies to help them in their difficulties when we all know that any difficulty that exists is a direct result of the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>They have made a bad job of running the country to such an extent that they have never been concerned with the welfare of the country or its people.  The only concern of Fianna Fáil is to get more jobs for their friends, to remain in office as long as they can, to drive the country into debt, to allow the cost of living to soar higher and higher.  The more people leaving the country, the better for them, the less they will have to contend with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not our job as an Opposition to try to find ways and means to help the <Col N="1354" /> Government out of the mess they are in.  The Taoiseach said when on this side of the House that it was not his job to tell the Government what to do. I tell him now it is not our job to find the remedy for the mess caused by Fianna Fáil.  If we are in Opposition, we are in Opposition, and as far as my opposition is concerned, I say they are in this mess and they have the people in with them.  In my radio broadcast the night before the general election, I said: &ldquo;If the people sow nettles, they cannot expect roses to grow.&rdquo; The nettles were sown; they grew; and they are stinging now.  If the people had sown roses this extraordinary state of affairs would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>Is it not true to say that every effort is now being made to hamper the activities of trade unions who seek wage increases for their workers?  We seem to have extraordinary ideas about trade unions.  We use every publicity means to throw blame on the trade unions for all the economic ills the country suffers from.  We never seem to think that the trade union movement caters for a vast section of our people, that even the Civil Service can be described as being part of the trade union movement.  Not only is the person who works with shovel or spade part of the trade union movement but so are the vast majority of our people, whether they work for their livelihood in offices or shops.</P>
    <P>The demands of the trade union movement have been right and justified. I would stand over that statement on any platform in my constituency or outside it.  The reason why I say the trade union movement have been acting wisely in the interests of their members is that the increases received on the occasion of the last round of wage increases has now been wiped out, in most cases completely, and workers are worse off today than they were before they received the last round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>The reason for this extraordinary state of affairs is that Fianna Fáil refused to take any action whatever in regard to the cost of living.  Fianna Fáil never had a policy in regard to the cost of living.  They were never <Col N="1355" /> concerned with the cost of living. Their main concern to-day is not with the cost of living but to freeze wages and to try to handcuff and blindfold the leaders of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies, both inside the House and outside it, will not allow Fianna Fáil to throw any blame whatever for any economic crisis that may be facing the country on the trade union movement or, indeed, on any group of organised workers who are only seeking a decent wage which will enable them to have a decent standard of living.  They cannot have a decent standard of living if Fianna Fáil allow prices to soar and the rich to grow richer, while, as we have seen in the past the poor become poorer and poorer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has rambled over countries from New Zealand to the Netherlands, the Benelux countries, Australia and so on.  I venture to say that in this country and in this city, there is a vast amount of poverty in the homes of persons on fixed incomes who have no trade union to seek increases for them or to fight for them, pensioners and others who have not received any increase whatever since the last wage increase was granted.  It must be known to every Deputy who has a serious interest in his constituency and the problems of his constituents that that vast amount of poverty exists. One indication of the poverty that exists, as a result of almost a quarter of a century of Fianna Fáil administration, is the demand on charitable organisations for help for families and aged persons, invalids, the disabled and the blind.  These persons, suffering in conditions of poverty, are expected to subsist and to meet the highest prices for essential commodities in the world.</P>
    <P>I venture to say without fear of contradiction that the Government are now reviewing their past conduct.  The slashing of the food subsidies must have some bearing on their efforts now to control prices.  The slashing of the food subsidies was one of the first factors in increasing the cost of living. <Col N="1356" /> By that action, the cost of bread, flour, butter and the necessaries of life was increased.  The Government cannot blame any section of the community for the slashing of the food subsidies. That was their own deliberate act, their own deliberate decision and policy, despite the fact that in a general election two months before that they pledged their word of honour that they were not going to interfere with food subsidies.  At Belmullet, the then Leader of the Party had asked why they should interfere with the price of bread and flour, such an important item in the diet of the poor. He was not six weeks in office when up went the price of flour.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have not changed since those days.  The method by which they were elected to office was intrigue, false promises and propaganda.  If they had carried out the promises which they made at election times, this would be one of the most prosperous countries in the world.  One thing is certain.  Fianna Fáil have never been short of promises and of plans for the future.  Like the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, their promises are eyewash and balderdash.  There are numerous plans contained in that Programme. Fianna Fáil have always had plans but these plans seem to be shelved in Government Departments, covered with dust and surrounded by cobwebs.  They do not seem to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>There is a balance of payments problem, a crisis in relation to wages, prices and the cost of living.  As Deputy O'Leary said, it is bad enough to have the prices problem and the balance of payments problem, but it is worse when that is coupled with a serious unemployment problem.  A serious unemployment problem exists and there is also the problem of emigration.  In a general election broadcast, we were told that the tide of emigration was decreasing and that fewer persons were emigrating than ever before.  Even since last April, there has been a vast increase in the numbers emigrating as a result of the lack of employment opportunities.  The blame for that must rest at the door of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The Government say that as a result of the control of prices, nobody can look for an increase in wages.  Is this the old Wages Standstill Order in disguise?  Everybody knows that the draft of the Wages Standstill Order was discovered by the late Deputy Norton some years ago in the Department of Industry and Commerce. There is nothing to stop the Government from dressing up that old Order in new clothes and presenting it to the House.  Is this effort to control prices the thin end of the wedge?</P>
    <P>The Government have not indicated the means by which prices will be controlled or what prices will be controlled. If we are to have control of prices, is it to be done behind closed doors by a group of influential manufacturers and a civil servant or two who will make a recommendation to the Minister?  Or is there to be a public inquiry as in the days of the Prices Advisory Body?  Under that system a public sitting was held. The manufacturers gave evidence; the consumers gave evidence; and the Irish Housewives' Association and other interested bodies gave evidence.  If there are to be inquiries in relation to the fixing of prices, they should be conducted in public so that anybody who so desires may give evidence.  In this way the case made by the manufacturer or whoever is seeking the increase will be made public.</P>
    <P>I hope this matter will not be dealt with by the closed door method and, if it is, it should be exposed by every Opposition Deputy.  There are usually strange and sinister movements behind those closed door inquiries which have been conducted by Fianna Fáil people ever since 1932.  I always feel that there is something shady going on when such inquiries are conducted in private.  If the Bill is to work, these inquiries will have to be conducted in public, with due notice given to everybody to enable them to come and present their case, and the findings must be published.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil tell us that everybody is to make sacrifices.  How is it that when sacrifices are required in this country, the first people called on to make them <Col N="1358" /> are the workers?  Would it not be nice for a change to hear that the Taoiseach would address his ministerial colleagues and say to them that if sacrifices are to be made, they would give the lead and contribute their share.</P>

      <P>Yes, and include him.  When we see the great extravagance of the Government and the wide, insane and unsound expenditure, when we see the wild schemes which Fianna Fáil have undertaken, when we see the manner in which they have increased certain salaries of the less productive people, I would like to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce how he can argue that the agricultural worker can be classified as living in the lap of luxury.  Now that the agricultural worker is going to get the benefit of whatever price controls there may be, he is no longer to seek an increase in pay.</P>
      <P>The Irish agricultural worker is the worst paid worker in the world today and the reason for that is that our farmers are not in a position to pay anything more.  A number of our farmers are now paying a rate in excess of the Agricultural Wages Board rate.  If we want to have prosperity, we must try to bring that prosperity, to the agricultural community.  Unless we have a prosperous agriculture, agriculture being the mother of the nation's wealth and our primary industry, every other citizen in the country must be on the go down.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons we find ourselves in this Fianna Fáil manufactured mess is that we have, over the past years and at the present time, deliberately neglected agriculture.  I would like to know how we are to increase our exports.  Our main exports are agricultural produce and livestock.  In the Budget of this year, with all the talk of assistance to help exports, not one penny piece was provided to assist agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is much talk about wages and the cost of living, there is also the great problem facing the agricultural <Col N="1359" /> community in regard to rates. That is the great problem to which the Government are supposed to be giving thought and consideration, but in regard to which they seem to be suffering from lack of practical action. Lip sympathy to those who are put to the pin of their collars to meet the great burden of rates is of little use to them.  In addition to the problems of unemployment and emigration, the high cost of living, higher prices and the balance of payments problem, we also have the anxiety of the ratepayers who find that this year they are unable to meet the demands made upon them.</P>
    <P>In addition to all those ills, we have the worst health services in the country and are lagging behind in education and in everything else.  Instead of the great future which, according to the Taoiseach on 6th April last, we were to have in this country, we are now not alone slipping backwards but running backwards.  There is no question of progress today.  Now there is a picture of gloom and despair, hard times and bad times.  I could not help interrupting the Minister for Transport and Power when he spoke of shirts made in this country.  There is only one shirt they are concerned with, that is, the hair-shirt for the people of their own country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, when they returned to office in 1957, said that they were going to put the country back on its feet.  They said that not alone did the inter-Party Government take the country off its feet but that they cut the legs from under it.  They said that they were going to cut down the number of civil servants.  They said that, but instead they proceeded to increase the number vastly.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House further beyond mentioning the fact that the most serious aspect of the whole situation is the credit restriction in operation at the present time.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us of his hire purchase restrictions.  The Taoiseach has told us our people have been spending too much.  Then we are told that money will be available for those who require <Col N="1360" /> assistance in their efforts to increase production so that our exports can be stepped up.  Nevertheless any gangster with a six-shooter in his hand is more welcome in any of our Irish banks today than a small farmer looking for a loan to help him to increase production. It is bad enough that the banks turn down small farmers who are looking for a loan but they are closing down on credit for house purchase and for house building.  How are people to be provided with new homes?  How are they to build their own houses?  We are told to increase production, to keep one more cow and one more sow, to get more stock. Where is it to come from?  The Agricultural Credit Corporation are beginning to tighten up.  The banks have tightened up long ago.  A penny piece will not be given to anyone by order of the Central Bank to all the other banks.  The restriction of credit has been responsible for unemployment. It has been responsible for stopping house building and for stopping house purchase and it is bringing business in parts of this country to a standstill.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil expect us to support that policy and say: &ldquo;More power to the banks for restricting credit.  This is a serious problem on which no one dare criticise the Taoiseach or the Fianna Fáil Party.&rdquo; If we are to do our duty every Deputy who is in the Opposition should from next Sunday morning commence a series of meetings in his constituency and expose the hypocrisy and deceit by which Fianna Fáil crept back into office after the last general election. He should explain to the public that the restriction of credit, the prices mess, the balance of payments problem, are all the deliberate policy of Fianna Fáil, and that they are now endeavouring to prevent the trade unions from seeking an increase in wages on behalf of their workers.  I hope those who are more influential with the trade union movement than I am will use all their influence to resist any attempt by Fianna Fáil to curtail their activities or to prevent them exercising their rights in seeking a fair wage, and the trade unions are <Col N="1361" /> the best judges of what a fair wage is for their members.</P>
    <P>The farmers have been so disorganised that they must be the best farmers in the world or they would have gone out of farming long ago.  Not alone had they to suffer during the Economic War&mdash;and the effects of the Economic War are still to be found deep down in the agricultural concerns in this country today&mdash; but they had to fight Fianna Fáil policy all down through the years. They had to put up with some queer characters as Minister for Agriculture from Fianna Fáil until 1948 when they got their first lift up.  When we are dealing with the economy of the country, it is no harm to say that in 1948 when Deputy Dillon took over as Minister for Agriculture, there were fewer cattle, sheep and pigs in this country than there ever were in our history since statistics were first recorded.  It was in 1948 that the figures began to creep up and up.  In 1948, there was as much ground limestone in this country as would fill the top of a clay pipe.  Before the Government of 1948 went out of office, ground limestone was delivered by CIE to the door of every farmer in Ireland who needed it.  There was a concentration on lifting up agriculture. While agriculture is down, there is a deplorable state of economic unrest and instability reaching the borderline of national poverty.</P>
    <P>This Prices Bill now shows the wisdom of the inter-Party Government of 1953 to 1955 when the Prices Advisory Body was in operation.  It was Fianna Fáil who abolished the Prices Advisory Body and said there was no use for it, that it was not effective.  As the Taoiseach said time and again, competition brings down prices, the more competition there is the cheaper everything will be.  Fianna Fáil have got themselves into this deplorable situation and I do not wish them any good luck in getting out of it. If that is unpatriotic, I take it as such. This is a political mess and those who created the political mess should get out of it.  However, if they get out of it, it will be without my support, and whatever I can do throughout the <Col N="1362" /> country to expose the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil, I shall do with the greatest of pleasure.</P>
    <P>In the words of the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, from these benches: &ldquo;It is not our job as an Opposition to tell you what to do but it is your job to do it.&rdquo; How very boldly he spoke from these benches when this country faced a serious national crisis in 1956-57.  There was no sympathy or understanding from him then.  I can remember the manner in which he would stand up in this House and point across at every one of us who sat in those benches, saying it was our fault, our muddling and our mismanagement.</P>
    <P>It is all different today.  He expects us to say: &ldquo;Yes, we are all part and parcel of this mess.&rdquo; I shall not offer any sympathy to Fianna Fáil in their difficulties which are of their own manufacture.  It is all due to the rottenness of this Government.  The sooner they are put out of office the sooner will things be put right so that the workers and the business people of this country may all enjoy an improved standard of living.  The way they have been carrying on up to the present not only reflects dishonour on Irish public life, but it demeans Parliament.  I refer to the manner in which the Government have conducted affairs particularly since the last general election. The country is in a mess.  The country was in a mess before the general election.  It has been in a mess since Fianna Fáil took office and, while Fianna Fáil remain in office, the country will continue in a mess.</P>
    <P>If we want to right the wrong, then the sooner the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party realise they have a responsibility to the people who sent them here, the better it will be.  There may be a certain pride on both sides, each side anxious for the same end. The only way in which we could shift Fianna Fáil before was by a united effort.  If there is to be an attack now on workers' rights, on the farmers, and on credit, it affects the Labour Party just as much as it affects us.  We have, therefore, something in common and it is our duty, I maintain, in those circumstances to provide an alternative <Col N="1363" /> Government, whenever the opportunity offers.</P>
    <P>In the inter-Party Government with which I was associated, I was proud of every Labour colleague with whom I sat and I have no reason to believe that I could not be as proud of them tomorrow.  The only way in which we can put that crowd over there out and remove doubts from the minds of our people, guarantee real stability instead of the crisis from which Fianna Fáil seem to suffer chronically, limping year after year into crisis after crisis, dishonest to the public, and that is, perhaps, the most serious aspect, is by making a united effort to put them out.  It is the people who vote for us and who support us that are suffering while Fianna Fáil are allowed to remain in office.</P>
    <P>The next time the people get an opportunity, they will not be as easily misled or as easily fooled as they were earlier this year.  Would I be considered unreasonable if I suggested that, now that Fianna Fáil find themselves in this really deplorable mess, they are incapable of handling the present situation and that they should give the people an opportunity now of judging them on their performance over the past few months, giving the people the true facts, which they were not given before the election, and painting the true picture, the picture that was painted here yesterday by the Taoiseach?  I venture to say that the volume of support Fianna Fáil would lose at the polls would be enormous. We would then be given an opportunity of providing a Government which would ensure that the rights of trade unionists would not be interfered with, that prices would be kept within the reach of ordinary workers and wage-earners and that steps would be taken to prevent the serious curtailment of credit which is bringing our people now to the edge of bankruptcy. Everybody connected with business knows that the present credit squeeze is causing unemployment and bringing destitution into the homes of many of our people.  That seems to be the deliberate policy-in-the-making of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened here for the past couple of hours to the various speeches from the Opposition benches.  I have not taken exception to any of the attacks made upon the Government so long as they were attacks on a political basis, but I could not quite stomach an attack made by one member of the Fine Gael Front Bench, Deputy Fitzpatrick, when it reached a personal level.  I refer to his personal attack on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whom he described as laughing at the problems of the Irish people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been as many years in this House as Deputy Fitzpatrick has been weeks.  I have been as many years in this House as Deputy Fitzpatrick has been weeks and I would commend him to make an effort to get to know the Minister for Industry and Commerce a little better and then confine himself in his attacks on the Government to a political rather than a personal level.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that I do not seek to defend the Minister merely because I am his Parliamentary Secretary. We were contemporaries at university. We entered this House together. He is a man for whom I have the greatest admiration and he is well able to look after himself when it is a matter of attacks confined to other than the contemptible level of Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>With regard to the speech to which we have just listened, it represents the nadir so far as I am concerned in all the time I have been in this House. It surely deserves the silence of contempt and I hope it will have a salutary effect on some members of the Fine Gael Party who sat listening to it, to the declaration by one of their Front Bench members that he would not reject the charge of being unpatriotic. Those are his own words.  Let him and those who are responsible for them rest with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in this debate the Leader of the Fine Gael Party made reference to manpower policy.  Since this is my special responsibility, I should like to <Col N="1365" /> take this opportunity of saying a few words in regard to it.  At the outset, I should like to say that I, unfortunately, did not hear Deputy Cosgrave speak.  I know he would certainly have been both constructive and helpful in any remarks he made in regard to the very vital function of my section of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I undertake to repair the omission and to study carefully what he said in relation to manpower.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of thanking members of the House from both sides who, since my appointment, have shown an interest in the work and have offered to be of help in the formulation of a manpower policy and its effective implementation. These Deputies have come from Fine Gael and from Labour, as well as from Fianna Fáil.  I shall need not merely their help but also the help of the organisations and associations they represent if this urgent work is to be a success.</P>
    <P>Before I say anything about what we have done or what we propose to do, I should mention that last Thursday I made my first public speech with regard to manpower policy.  I trust I shall not be accused of delay in regard to this matter inasmuch as the interdepartmental report on the administrative arrangements for implementing such a policy was not published until some three weeks earlier.  In regard to redundancy, the recommendations of the sub-committee of NIEC have not yet been received.  The occasion on last Thursday was not attended by any member of this House and, for that reason, I take this opportunity of repeating what I said then, secure in the knowledge that I shall not be boring any member of the House by tedious repetition.</P>
    <P>First, on that occasion, I dealt with the history to date of the thinking on manpower policy as evidenced by the reference to it in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and a Government pronouncement and in other pronouncements in the course of the past few years.  I take it there is no necessity for me now to go at length <Col N="1366" /> into this aspect of our problem.  The Second Programme referred, in the first place, to the compilation of more detailed information regarding labour availability and the preparation of labour supply forecasts; the provision of improved placement services and vocational guidance; the promotion of vocational mobility including retraining; the promotion of geographical mobility including resettlement and measures to deal with cyclical, seasonal and rehabilitation problems.</P>
    <P>It goes on to refer to the principal matters that would have to be taken into account and with these the House is familiar, if we take the particular pattern of the employment situation in this country: the fact that here as elsewhere there is a drift from agriculture to other employment; the fact that the assessment in the Second Programme shows the drift from agriculture is rather faster than was envisaged; the fact that we have a chronic shortage, at the moment especially, of skilled labour, and of course the necessity to take whatever measures we can to supply that deficiency; the fact that industry is facing and will continue to face competition increasingly more determined and therefore will need to adapt and that the process will involve very many changes from a labour point of view.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further in regard to this, I should like to comment on a reference by one of the Opposition speakers to this drift from agriculture. One speaker came along the other day after I had spoken and suggested that we were calmly accepting this drift from agriculture as a fact of life and were not worried about it.  He pointed out the special problems of areas like Donegal in which he had a special interest.  I want to make abundantly clear now, rather than at the end of my speech, where we stand in regard to this whole question.  The drift from agricultural to non-agricultural occupations is a phenomenon which is not peculiar to this country but which obtains in every similar country in the world.  I should hardly need to spell out here the reasons for that but America, which is referred to as a great complex of States is perhaps <Col N="1367" /> the best example of the effect that technical and technological progress can make on farming.</P>
    <P>But what we are concerned about, and what I personally am very much concerned about, is an unnecessary drift from agriculture, an unnecessary loss of skilled labour; the fact that certain areas have become depressed areas, notably some fairly close to the area I represent and in which I have always lived.  We do not calmly accept that the drift of people whom we have trained and on whom we have spent the people's money in trying to bring them up to a certain standard of skill, should leave for reasons of economic necessities and I shall deal with some aspects of that later on.  If I refer, therefore, primarily to adaptation and changes in the industrial field, it must be accepted as against the background that we are primarily an agricultural community, that agriculture is and will remain our primary industry and perhaps, incidentally, that the heart of Ireland is in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some of the suppositions in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> with regard to the important aspects of manpower policy have had to be revised in the light of experience since its publication and in saying this, I am conscious that only a very short period has elapsed since the Second Programme was published.  Conditions in the labour market have to some extent caused the revision of thinking and since I have begun to study these problems in depth, I have come to realise that there are two or three urgently important matters.  One is the provision of training and retraining facilities to supply the lack of skilled labour; another is the necessity for the provision of redundancy compensation and severance pay; and the third is the urgent need to try to forecast what our problems will be in a few years time so that we can endeavour to match demand with supply and supply with demand, although the successful implementation of a manpower policy is something very much more complicated than would appear to be involved in that rather broad statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> Where training and retraining are concerned, accelerated vocational training also will be fully discussed when the Industrial Training Bill comes to be discussed by the House later this year.  If we are to be successful in our efforts to give an effective accelerated vocational training system, we must realise (a) that we must have the physical buildings or other facilities to give to those who wish to be trained; (b) that we must have the people capable of training; and (c) that under the present structure, several years may elapse before an effective or tangible result will be visible to the people.  And, as a corollary of that, it may have to be accepted that certain changes, especially at the apprenticeship stage, are inevitable.</P>
    <P>I speak here entirely from the practical aspect of providing workers capable of supplying a necessary skill without any overtones whatsoever from the social issues involved either for the country or the individuals.  I propose to come back at a later stage to the social aspect.  Suffice it to say that if a tiny minority in a splinter union, for instance, cannot see fit to amalgamate with two or three more tiny splinter groups for the purpose of enabling an accelerated apprenticeship system to go through, we have no hope of success.  If effective executive leadership in this matter is not forthcoming from trade unions, this splintering will prove fatal to our efforts to provide the skills we so urgently need.  After all, 1970 is not a long time away.  From the apprenticeship point of view, it is less than the average period.</P>
    <P>For adult retraining, the situation is different.  That can be discussed along with redundancy.  The Government and the Minister have already made it clear that we have come to realise that the worker, as a matter of social justice, has certain rights in his job.  These rights, just as the rights of employers in regard to property, gain in value with the years.  The workers and employers are each part owners of a joint enterprise and, when the worker can no longer be kept on, he should not merely have facilities for retraining <Col N="1369" /> and providing him with a new job instead but also should have the underlying fear involved in a change&mdash;the fear of being unable to meet his commitments to his wife and family&mdash; removed as far as possible.</P>
    <P>A system which will enable that fear to be removed should, as a matter of urgent social justice, be devised.  The mechanics of that scheme is something I do not think I will deal with now, beyond saying that there are several divergent viewpoints.  These divergent viewpoints are occupying the NIEC at present and I hope, as we all do, that the results of their deliberations will shortly be available.  As far as the Government, the Minister and I are concerned, we certainly accept that the provision of a satisfactory redundancy scheme is a vital necessity, if the fear I have mentioned in regard to a worker losing his job is to be removed and if his position as a bread winner is as far as possible to be kept up while he is undergoing retraining and if&mdash;here we run into great difficulty, especially in this country &mdash; greater mobility of labour, which again will be a matter of great necessity, is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>We have discussed all these problems, and in this I certainly agree with at least one aspect of Deputy O'Leary's speech, although there were many other aspects of it which were, to say the least, tendentious.  He said that in many respects our problems are unique.  Of course, they are unique.  We have unemployment while on the other side of the channel, it is expected in a few years' time there will be 700,000 jobs and only 400,000 workers for them.  They are principally concerned with easing the bottle necks that exist already.  Obviously, if the figures I have quoted prove to be anyway near accurate, the position will be appreciably exacerbated in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, our manpower policy must be designed to provide greater opportunities, more employment and especially employment in certain areas which so far have not sufficiently benefited from the industrial advance down through the years.  In this connection it is well to refer, if only briefly, to the undertakings given <Col N="1370" /> by the Government before the last election in regard to the western seaboard. Despite the misrepresentation by some speakers in the Opposition, the Government are, and will remain, committed to the improvement of conditions along the western seaboard. When I spoke on Thursday last, I went so far as to say that if a special policy designed to meet the needs of areas like portions of my own county and of Roscommon, Leitrim, Donegal and Monaghan had to be devised, I felt it would not be beyond the wit of man to devise them.</P>
    <P>My own feeling in regard to this matter was expressed in what I said last Thursday.  In many respects I am thinking out loud about complex problems in respect of which our thinking is as yet only at a formative stage.  What we might possibly aim at in respect of these areas is the very highly skilled industry, the highly automated industry.  There are certain of these industries which have a reasonable female content of employment and, at the same time, the necessary toleration with regard to labour turnover. Obviously, then you would have the two kinds of industry, industry which requires a very high level of technical skill&mdash;this, of course, would obviously be primarily male&mdash;and the other kind of industry which would have a reasonable female content of work which would not have a special skill but would tolerate the ordinary and expected high turnover rate where women are concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the loss of such a high proportion of our skilled labour, I mention certain figures I obtained from a large industrial concern in the west of Ireland with regard to the loss by them of their skilled and unskilled employees each year.  It is an astonishing fact but the concern is losing 60 per cent of its skilled men annually.  I thought the reason was the structure of Irish society but it was not left to me to think that because the firm told me unequivocally that the reason many men were going was lack of entertainment. In other words, it was because of the failure of the structure of society to provide them with sufficient outlet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> In that connection I have misgivings about the educational background which yields this outlet, just as I have certain misgivings about the social structure itself.</P>
    <P>Quite recently talking to somebody who has a very close connection with apprenticeship, I asked what was the attitude of these young men towards their country, did they feel that they had an obligation towards it, and he replied that with few exceptions they came to him at the age of 15 to 18 years with no sense of obligation whatever towards their native land, with no idea that having been trained by and in this country they owed a duty to it.  Surely that is something upon which we must examine our consciences, whether we are politicians, teachers, or priests, or whatever we are, because if we do not succeed in removing the root cause of the <i>malaise</i>, the lack of patriotism in its real sense, then we may as well throw our hats at trying to implement a manpower policy, or a womanpower policy, for that matter.</P>
    <P>I went so far as to say&mdash;and I suppose this could be laughed at&mdash;that if we took all the teachers responsible for the moulding of our youth aside and gave them a refresher course and brainwashed them a bit, it might have some beneficial effect.  I do not wish in any sense to be critical of them but merely to say that whatever is necessary to reorient the minds of our youth, to develop a sense of their country, of their locality, their county, or province, not to mention their parents, is an urgent necessity, notwithstanding the bad example of people in politics like the last speaker from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. There are a lot of practical things you can do.  I think that there is an insufficient knowledge in the city of the country and <i>vice versa.</i> Voluntary bodies could do a great deal by collecting 1/- a week to send people to Donegal or West Cork or West Kerry to see what these people are like at home and perhaps listen to a living language being spoken, which sounds very different from anything they might have heard before; perhaps to see the scenery of the country which they never knew and certainly would not appreciate exists.  There are many practical things we could do. We should use all our media to try to inculcate not merely a practical patriotism, about which I have spoken, but by broadening the best of our training, to make the formative years of our youth exciting for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know many of the people concerned and economic reasons had very little to do with their final decision.  In dealing with this whole matter, there is this sad lack of career guidance.  I must say I was very impressed a few days ago to hear a speaker giving particulars of practical career guidance being given by junior chambers of commerce throughout the country.  There is also the excellent work being done in regard to the hotel industry by the organisation known as CERT and there are other organisations like CIE which give a practical career guidance.  I will not mention any more because I might inadvertently leave out somebody I should certainly include.  It will be one of our aims to provide a practical career guidance service, somewhat on <Col N="1373" /> the lines, I hope, of that which is in operation in Great Britain at the moment.</P>
      <P>In that connection it is not unfair to thank the <i>Irish Independent</i> for the great deal of work it has put into the series which it runs from time to time in regard to careers.  As far as highly qualified people are concerned, we should, first of all, look to the Irish abroad to try to attract them back again.  I know many such people who are earning far more than they could hope to earn here but who would be willing to return for perhaps a fraction of what they are earning abroad, if there were a reasonable or suitable outlet for them here.

      <P>To turn now to certain other aspects of our manpower policy.  The employer obviously has a very big stake, as the unions have, in the successful implementation of these aims, and obviously the existing employment service will have to be revitalised if the work is to go ahead at all.  Up to the present time the employment exchange is in fact merely an employment agency and I should have hoped that employers would realise the advantages to be gathered from co-operating with the manpower authority in notifying the existence of vacancies in good time and see that there are practical advantages, from the employer point of view, in such co-operation.  I should mention as well that employers will be asked to give a good deal of information with regard to their future intentions&mdash;the production <Col N="1374" /> side and the investment side&mdash;so that an assessment of future employment prospects can be made.</P>
      <P>Of course, all information of that nature would be treated as confidential but what is and will be increasingly important is co-operation with the authority so that possible vacancies will be notified the moment the employer knows they are likely to occur, and the revitalisation of the employment service itself so that the worker will automatically go there when he is looking for a job rather than try to go elsewhere.  This, I should mention, is a very big and in some ways insurmountable problem.</P>
      <P>The experience of other countries is that no matter how hard they try, the notification of job vacancies is to a very high proportion not done through any employment agency.  The figures vary in regard to different countries. The number of jobs filled through the medium of State employment exchanges on the lines of ours may be as low as ten per cent but is rarely higher than 25 per cent, which means that other means, newspaper advertisements and so forth, are used in preference to the employment exchange, or whatever the agency may happen to be called.</P>
      <P>However, the effort certainly will require to be made and in that connection there are varying ideas as to whether the employment exchange should be run under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce or, as it is now, by the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not propose to do more than throw that out for discussion at a later stage.  Suffice it to say that whatever is necessary&mdash; the way I approach these things is to make two and two equal four&mdash;I shall not hesitate to recommend that a particular course should be taken if I consider and am satisfied it is the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I mentioned earlier concerns forecasts.  The fact that I have left it nearly to the end does not mean it is any less vital a task.  However, the availability of the type of person needed for an effective forecast unit is <Col N="1375" /> somewhat of a difficulty and in the meantime we can only try to do the best we can at administrative level. The fact is that it is well recognised most of our experts are already very heavily engaged in State or semi-State activities, quite apart altogether from their personal occupations.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to say that the preference parents nowadays have for secondary education instead of technical education has resulted in a large surplus of boys and girls each year, armed with leaving certificates, many of whom, because their parents cannot send them to the university or because they have not the necessary level of intelligence to go on to higher education are forced to emigrate, many of them having wasted vital years during which they could have with success, following adaption tests, equipped themselves by technical training for work in industry.</P>
    <P>I should hope that this idea in parents will cease to be in evidence in years to come, that they will be helped to see that giving an old-fashioned secondary education to a boy or girl who has no special ability may be putting back that child instead of bringing it forward.  I therefore laud the work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, when in charge of the Department of Education, proposed the comprehensive school with an equivalent certificate to secondary leaving.  It is to me a source of sorrow that so many young boys and girls down the years, armed with the leaving certificate, could not be accommodated for one reason or another because the usual outlets&mdash;teaching, the Civil Service, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;had absorbed all they could absorb, which is only a very small proportion of the annual output.</P>
    <P>There are many other factors in regard to this and I do not suggest for a moment there are not, but I shall leave the subject where it is.  I have not given to the House&mdash;I have deliberately avoided giving to the House&mdash; many figures which I gave previously in regard to the ratio of workers to dependants in this country and the probable needs of industrial expansion in the next few years.  I will give only <Col N="1376" /> the figures that an annual job creation rate of some 21,500, that is, an annual three per cent increase, would be needed and, in the light of our experience so far, to achieve that is a very formidable task.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I have been promised by not merely individual members of the House but the organisations they represent every practical co-operation in the effort to implement successfully an active manpower policy here.  I value that offer of help, whether it comes from the employer or the worker, from management or elsewhere, and would like to say that so far as I am concerned, and as I know I speak for the Minister also, so far as we are concerned, there will be no favour shown to any section of the community in our efforts to make a success of this work but, also, there will be no pulling of punches if in asking for co-operation we have from time to time to state fairly brutal facts.</P>
    <P>In the overall economic situation the country is in at the moment, the ability to put one's head in the sand and to pretend that problems do not exist is futile.  The brave facing-up to an exacting situation and the logic of it and the action called for is a sign of political as well as personal bravery. This Government have undertaken, as so often in the past, to face up to reality, to tell the people the facts, to tell them what is happening and what the Government consider that the people should do and the Government should do in co-operation.  The fact that, once again, this Government have done what they have done so often before is proof that they will continue to have the confidence and the co-operation of the Irish people, despite unpatriotic statements by the Opposition.</P>

I can only say that in principle we accept the idea of redundancy compensation and compensation during retraining, <i>et cetera</i>, but I do not like to anticipate what the recommendations that will come to us will be. We have our own thinking as to what ought to be the system and in that connection I did, in response to a supplementary question by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, on 21st May, give some indication of our own thinking but we hope, and we are pressing, to have these recommendations without delay.  As far as we are concerned, we are hoping to have our legislative proposals before the Dáil before Christmas and we will try to screw all the arms we can to ensure that that objective is achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> To revert to the matter mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, I cannot <Col N="1378" /> blame the Parliamentary Secretary but it is rather extraordinary when we have been speaking about entering the Common Market since 1961, which in itself would entail some redundancy and some rehabilitation training, that, now, in 1965, we have the first effort being made by the Government to do something on this important matter and that up to the time the Parliamentary Secretary made his intimation last May, it would appear no steps were taken on this important matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, it would appear from the Taoiseach's statement that our difficulties largely stem from a trading imbalance, in short, a fall in exports and a progressive increase in imports, and that the difficulty was aggravated and triggered off by a recent cash outflow and a fall in our bank reserves.</P>
      <P>I do not think the British levy of 15 per cent, afterwards reduced to ten per cent, can have made the very great difference which the Taoiseach would like us to gather.  I feel that the primary difficulty lay in our trading position, and that was due to an aggressive policy of inflation deliberately pursued by the Government. If we had attempted to keep inflation under control and to keep the cost of commodities at a lower level, we would not now be whining so much about the difficult situation in which we find ourselves but would be in a far better competitive position as regards exports and international trade.</P>
      <P>We are now facing a hairshirt policy, judging from all the recommendations mentioned by the Taoiseach. We are all being asked to tighten our belts.  I notice that even in our capital expenditure there is to be a curtailment of somewhere about £8 million.  I have not the advantage of having had a look at the Taoiseach's speech as only a couple of copies were available and I am compelled to rely on notes which I took down in very bad writing and which I now find it difficult to read, but I understand that building, agriculture and telephone expenditure are to be particularly curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> I am particularly interested in any curtailment of agricultural credit.  As Deputy Collins and the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, agriculture is still the sheet anchor of our economy. Without denying the great importance of expanding our industrial arm, we must all realise that agriculture is the one export on which there is very little corresponding import expenditure. Beyond importing a few prize animals annually and some machinery, there is no great strain on our economy to produce agricultural export goods, particularly in the field of cattle, sheep and so on which we feed off grass.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is, and will remain, a fundamental primary part of our economy and one we can always depend on for exports without any corresponding load of imports to meet. When we come to the industrial arm, we are faced with a different proposition because we have to import increasing quantities of goods.  Any aid that we give to agriculture is something that, in the long run, we cannot afford to neglect.</P>
    <P>Despite the rosy promises by the Minister for Local Government here the other day when he introduced a large Housing Bill, I feel that we are going to have a serious curtailment in the building of private houses.  We are face to face with a balance of payments problem, and if any of us set out to build a house tomorrow, there are certain articles which must be imported, certain piping and cement. When the house is completed, we have to put in a refrigerator, perhaps an Aga cooker, perhaps beds and wardrobes. All these have to be imported either completely manufactured or in various stages of assembly, and when the house is completed, we cannot export one slate out of it.  There is no export side to housing.</P>
    <P>Building has a large employment content and all the men employed in it are using autocycles, motor cars or bicycles.  In their homes they have wireless sets and television sets and all these articles have to be imported. When it comes to building, you are tying up a large number of men and <Col N="1380" /> importing a large amount of material and there is no export side to it.  Any Government, faced with an imbalance of trade and a consequential imbalance of payments will, of necessity, no matter what they may promise, quietly issue instructions that house building has to be slowed down.</P>
    <P>This Government have the example before them of the last inter-Party Government who, perhaps, built themselves out of office.  Deputy Dillon said today that he was proud of that, that they had built so many houses that there were not enough people to live in them.  This Government, seeing what happened to the inter-Party Government, slowed down housing, particularly local government housing.  And if they did not build houses during the past five or six years when they could reasonably be expected to do so, how can you expect them to build them when faced with an economic crisis?</P>
    <P>These things should be said so that we will be alerted to these matters in the future and prepared to force the Government to get back again to the building of houses for our people.  It is easy to issue good economic statistics if you allow the people to remain in the slums.  On the other hand, if you make an effort to get them out of the slums, you may get yourself out of power.  That is what happened to the last inter-Party Government.  I feel, in view of this, that the elaborate Housing Bill produced here a few days ago will not give us houses.</P>
    <P>I was a little amazed by the sudden change of economic front in our society here.  We had our general election day on 7th April.  We had Budget day some time shortly after that.  There was no indication before the election, there was no indication on election day and there was very little indication on Budget day, that anything serious was amiss with our economy.  At every polling booth, we had misguided youths going around with the slogan: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  This was the atmosphere of euphoria which was built up to the time of the election.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that the Government were completely unaware of the darkened horizon, of the <Col N="1381" /> economic threats that were facing us. Suddenly, on 13th July, they have discovered that drastic measures must be introduced to correct the economy. I find it hard to believe that all these things happened so quickly.  I feel that we have not been told the true story, that the Government did not take the people into their confidence until they were securely in the saddle of office for four or five years.</P>
    <P>I said in the beginning that our economic difficulty is primarily a trading one, that we have priced ourselves out of the markets by a deliberate policy of inflation.  It began two years ago.  If there is a point of beginning or a point of departure, I would put it down as the Budget day of 1963 when the 2½ per cent turnover tax was first introduced.  We can all recall the stormy scenes in this House during the debate on that tax.  We can recall the reaction of the general public afterwards and we can recall the Dublin North-East by-election of May 29th fought primarily on the issue of the turnover tax and which resulted in a resounding defeat for the Government.</P>
    <P>In February of that year, the Taoiseach issued the White Paper <i>Closing the Gap</i> and it bore many similarities to the speech he made here yesterday &mdash;the same difficulty that beset us in February, our expenditure had run ahead of productivity.  Following that, which was interpreted by many as the sounding board of a pay pause, following the Budget of 1963 and following the loss by the Government of the Dublin North-East by-election, two things happened: on October 11th, 1963, Deputy Galvin died and exactly a month later, on November 11th, the Taoiseach announced that the gap between output and earned income had now closed.  The gap that was or was not there had now been closed. The red light of February had become the green light of November.  In a relatively short period, our economy had so improved that the Taoiseach was saying: &ldquo;Come on, boys; let's have a `beano'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On November 13th a Labour motion to issue the writ for the Cork by-election was defeated in this House, as the machinery had not yet been put <Col N="1382" /> right to fight a vital by-election.  On December 4th Deputy Norton died.  It was now obvious to the Government that two by-elections were impending and could not be avoided any longer. Therefore, in January, 1964, the 12 per cent wage agreement was entered into. The 12 per cent wage agreement which was agreed at the time was in excess of what the economy could reasonably be expected to stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, speaking today, sought to imply that this agreement was not initiated in any way by the Government.  Let us not forget that in relation to these negotiations the Taoiseach asked the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers to sit around the table for the third time after negotiations had broken down twice, because it was vital for him to get a national wage policy agreement in order to buy back the popularity which he had lost over the turnover tax.  We can all recall that, coming on Telefís Éireann at the time, he said to the people: &ldquo;You will all get a 12 per cent increase in your salaries or wages.  You will have a bigger pay packet on Saturday night.  Every trader will have more money pouring over his counter.  And what is wrong about that?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The majority of the voters in Kildare and Cork thought there was nothing wrong about it.  At the same time a Telefís Éireann commentator was unleashed in the streets of Cork to ask passers-by how they liked the prospect of their new increase in salaries and wages.  The Taoiseach apportioned to himself so much credit for that wage agreement that Deputy Tully, who was the only member of this House to participate in those negotiations, felt that the Taoiseach had appropriated too much credit to himself.  Now it is a dirty word.  Now all the economic difficulties in which we find ourselves are attributed to this 12 per cent wage increase.  The Government, the Taoiseach and the Miniister for Transport and Power are very ready to run away from it, having used it to dupe the people of Kildare and Cork and win two by-elections which were vital to the Taoiseach's political existence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> Let us not forget that that agreement meant the disbursement of £40 million to 350,000 people, and that local authority expenditure in 1964 increased by £17 million.  When that quantity of money is unleashed in the community and the community is supplying the same quantity of goods and services, it means that a vastly increased quantity of money is chasing the same quantity of goods and services. That is inflation.  That means that our competitive position internationally declines.  This is all the more objectionable and all the more contemptible because of two things: first, it was done not to get over a national crisis but for the purpose of fighting two by-elections; and, secondly, it was deceptive in so far as not the slightest attempt was made to control the purchasing power of the extra money which the people received.</P>
    <P>If we expect the labour side, wage and salary earners, to be amenable, surely we have a duty, having given them an increase, to make some attempt to preserve its purchasing power?  I do not by any means wish to minimise the difficulties which I understand are attendant upon the matter of controlling prices, but one must certainly raise the question as to why no attempt whatever was made to control prices.  The National Wage Agreement consequently could not be expected in those circumstances to produce the results we should all have liked to see accrue from it.  But that is not the whole story.</P>
    <P>Further inflationary efforts, too numerous to catalogue, budgetary and extra-budgetary, were deliberately put in train by the Government, again gravely prejudicing our position in the field of international trade.  If we cannot produce in competition, then we go to the wall.  Remember that at the same time as these measures were introduced, there was a lowering of tariffs and a 20 per cent increase in the import quota from 1st January, 1964.  There was an increase retrospectively in corporation profits tax in the 1963 Budget.  There was a 2½ per cent turnover tax, a 12 per cent increase in wages, and mounting rates.  There <Col N="1384" /> were budgetary increases in two successive years on beer, tobacco and petrol.  There were extra-budgetary measures in relation to telephones, postage, insurance stamps, <i>et cetera.</i> It is a long litany and I do not propose to weary the House by reciting the whole of it.  The increases were all inflationary in character and all calculated to bring us into the mess in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in laying the blame for this fairly and squarely on the Government and particularly on the Leader of the Government. I have no doubt that the Taoiseach's management of the economy has caused stresses and strains within his own Party.  That was evidenced by the fact that one of the members of his Cabinet was constrained to resign.  I said earlier that I find it difficult to understand how this particular situation in which we now find ourselves arose so precipitously.  At the time of the Budget, or just before it, we had issued to us a Progress Report on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> This report gives some of the projections for 1965.  It says in the Preface:</P>
    <P>The projections for 1965 set out in the first part of the Report were prepared by the Department of Finance in consultation with the Departments concerned, the Central Statistics Office, the Central Bank and the Economic Research Institute.</P>
    <P>A draft of Part I was made available to the National Industrial Council so that its views could be formulated and made available to the Government prior to the Budget. The Council's views are published in a separate report.</P>
    <P>This booklet was prepared by the best economic brains presumably in the country.  It gives the outlook for 1965 and the information given here seems to be at complete variance with the information given to us by the Taoiseach yesterday.  I do not know how exact a science economics is, but, if this is a sample of it, then it must still be a very inexact science indeed. We have never pretended in the medical world that ours is an exact <Col N="1385" /> science.  We call it a combination of natural sciences but there are, at least, some scientific aspects to it.  We are sometimes right.  If this is a sample of the economists' science, either we are being deliberately led up the garden path or the prognostications of these specialists leave very much to be desired.</P>
    <P>On page 28 of this document it is stated:</P>
    <P>...deficit of £30 million in balance of payments, based on projected increases of approximately £20 in both exports and imports of goods and services.</P>
    <P>That is the prognostication given for this year at the time of the Budget by all the authorities I have quoted.  Our exports are to go up by £20 million, our imports likewise, and our balance of payments deficit will remain round about where it was last year, at £30 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came into the House yesterday and gave us the trading figures for last year.  He told us that our balance of payments, instead of being likely to be of the order of £20 million or £30 million, would be £50 million at least for the present year.  This is within a couple of months of this advice to which I have referred being prepared by these various experts.  He told us that for the first six months of this year our imports have gone up by £16.2 million and our exports are down by £9.1 million. Our exports were less than half the value of our imports.  There is an extraordinary discrepancy between what this report said was likely to happen two months ago and what the Taoiseach told us yesterday is happening now.</P>
    <P>I may mention that in dealing with this balance of payments question which they originally said would be £30 million, we find a comment on this matter by the National Industrial Economic Council.  It states on page 6:</P>
    <P>In terms of constant 1960 prices, the average of the deficits during 1961-4 has been above the figure of £16,000,000 for the current deficit envisaged for the period of the second programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> It goes on to state, as regards last year, that</P>
    <P>...if the terms of trade had not significantly improved in 1964, the current deficit might well have been about £6,000,000 larger.</P>
    <P>According to NIEC, £16 million is the figure we should aim at as an average deficit until 1970: yet we are now facing a figure of £50 million.  According to the people advising us in this document a couple of months ago, our balance of payments deficit would not be more than £30 million.  Either there is some serious error in assessment or the picture is not being presented as accurately as it should be presented.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there has been a considerable capital inflow over the past few years and again the Progress Report for 1964 states on page 33:</P>
    <P>The projected deficit of £30 million in the balance of payments is likely to be covered to a large extent, if not entirely, by a continued net inflow of capital.  Any drawing upon the external reserves, which have been rising in recent years despite a current deficits on external account, is likely to be small.</P>
    <P>Apparently the outflow of capital was not foreseen or at least its possibility had not been adverted to in this Report.  We had a net capital inflow in 1964 of £36 million, and if my notes of the Taoiseach's speech are correct, I gathered from him that the anticipated net capital inflow in 1965 would be £25 million.  Either the Taoiseach is wrong or this is wrong.  It seems extraordinary, having regard to the nature of our economy and knowing how mercurial cash inflows can be, in view of the political situation on the other side of the channel that there seems to be an extremely sanguine approach on the part of our economic advisers to think, as they have said here, that the projected deficit of £30 million&mdash;the deficit projected by them &mdash;in 1965 was likely to be covered to a large extent, if not entirely by a net inflow of capital.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce or I in our professional capacities were guilty of a series of prognostications as <Col N="1387" /> valueless as these, we would not long remain in practice.</P>
    <P>The Report goes on to deal with external reserves in the terms I have already read out: &ldquo;Any drawing upon external reserves which have been rising in recent years despite current deficit on external account, is likely to be small.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach adverted to the serious position now obtaining as regards our external reserves.  Again, I could not gather quite clearly from him what the exact figures were and Deputy Sweetman who had a printed copy of his speech, speaking here today seemed to be in the same difficulty. Speaking from memory, I understood that in reply to Deputy Lynch, it was stated that our external reserves had fallen £25 million over the past six months.  The Taoiseach did mention a figure of £33 million for a fall in external reserves but I do not know over what period or whether it is over a period of 12 months.  Deputy Sweetman mentioned that at mid-May of last year our external reserves amounted to £230 million and that at mid-May, 1965 the figure was £208 million.  That would be a fall of £22 million.  Perhaps the Taoiseach is relating his £33 million to a calculation based on the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the Consumer Price Index and personal expenditure. He dealt heavily with personal expenditure.  He gave various yardsticks by which personal expenditure might be measured: we were importing too many motor cars; the yield of turnover tax was up by 14 per cent; we were spending more across the counter; hire purchase debt was up 20 per cent in 1964 and showed a sharp rise in the first quarter of 1965; our bank lending was up by £10 million in 1964 and £23 million in the first five months of this year; we are smoking and drinking more; our savings are falling; we are not buying enough Prize Bonds and Exchequer Bonds to please the Taoiseach; our imports of finished consumer goods are rising, and retail sales are up ten per cent.  Yet on page 29, paragraph 71, of this report it is stated:</P>
    <P>It is expected that the volume of <Col N="1388" /> personal expenditure will rise in 1965 by about the same amount (4 per cent) as in 1964.  The rise in prices is likely to be much less this year.  The index of consumer prices at mid-February was I per cent above the mid-November, 1964, figure mainly because of higher meat prices, but any further rise in 1965 is expected to be slight.</P>
    <P>This statement is completely at variance with the statement by the Taoiseach and with the facts as we know them here.  We are told that personal expenditure should be less in 1965 than in 1964.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the statement made here today by the Minister for Finance that for the first four months of this year the amount of credit made available by our banks was higher than for the first four months of 1964.  I do not know whether that is credit made available to the Government or whether it includes the private sector.  I find it hard to follow the Minister's statement as to borrowing abroad.  Am I to understand he has already attempted to borrow from the International Monetary Fund or some other source? What kind of reception did he get?  I gather from his speech he has already made overtures to international sources and has got the proverbial widow's mite.  When we speak of saving and expenditure, it is hard to reconcile that economically with a desire to borrow further.  Borrowing is merely a temporary expedient to replace cash outflow.  In the long term, it might be better if we did not get any money. I cannot help feeling &mdash; I am not an economist&mdash;that some more money in the Taoiseach's pocket will merely stimulate the rake's progress.  Maybe we should come to terms with the hard fact of the situation that the spending spree is over.</P>
    <P>Again, this report mentions very optimistically that, if there is no further rise in import prices and no significant wage drift, some reduction in industrial prices should be possible in 1965.  That is the loveliest statement of all.  If this economic council in its advice to the Government can foresee a reduction of prices in 1965, pray, <Col N="1389" /> what is the purpose of introducing a prices control Bill into this House? It is very difficult for Deputies confronted with information of this sort coming from the highest and most reputable sources.  It is very hard to reconcile it with the statements and circumstances as presented here by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It seems abundantly clear that in the very beginning of this year&mdash;and certainly after the trade figures for the first quarter became available when our imports had increased by £5.8 million and our exports dropped by £5.8 million&mdash;there was no justification for the semi-optimistic projections embodied in this report.  Whether the Minister and the Taoiseach were generally aware of the difficulties ahead, as they should have been, one thing is clear: they were kept very carefully from the people.  They were not allowed at any stage to mar the clarion call of &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach to give us a little more detail as to how this Prices Bill he is sponsoring will operate.  It may be that during the Committee Stage he may give us more information.  I should like to know in particular if this tribunal will be a public or a private one and if there will be an appeal from it.  No one has any sympathy with a trader who may be trying to secure extortionate profits but, at the same time, we would not like to feel that any trader would be at the mercy of a single tribunal and be deprived of some sort of appeal.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether if he finds that this Bill is not effective, he will be prepared to introduce a fully fledged prices-income policy.  I must express a certain amount of doubt as to whether, in the absense of some such development, we can ultimately secure long-term industrial peace.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy O'Leary express doubt as to whether good industrial relations could, in the present temper of workers and wage earners, be reasonably implemented.  However, I wish the Minister every success in the difficulties which undoubtedly lie ahead of him.  While I do not hesitate <Col N="1390" /> to blame his Government and particularly his Prime Minister for the difficulties in which we find ourselves, I can assure him that he will receive the fullest co-operation from this side of the House in any efforts he may have to make in future to establish good industrial relations in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on their action in introducing this Prices Bill.  It gives us an opportunity of studying the nation's economy and an opportunity to state what we intend to do to bring about a balance in the economy and plan for the future well-being of the people.  I have listened to most of the speeches since yesterday and this morning I listened to two elder statesmen of Fine Gael and also a new member, and their speeches were most depressing.  I have no intention of following their pattern or of uttering the abuse and vituperation which was poured on the Taoiseach and on the Government generally.  I do not regard the present position as a crisis; I believe it is a temporary hold-up in the march of progress.  In support of this I quote from the review of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in which it states that for the past six years the rate of growth of industrial production accelerated as compared with the previous year and that the overall growth is provisionally fixed at 4.2 per cent for last year.  The fact has been known for some time that we were spending money foolishly on imports like guitars and transistors, on things we could do without.  The Taoiseach's speech will make the people realise that while some sections never had it so good we will have to become provident if we are to bring our society back to where we want to see it.  To do this there must be provident spending and hard work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that all appeals have been addressed to the workers but it goes without saying that in any country the workers must form the biggest part of the community. It is the workers who will <Col N="1391" /> suffer most if the economy is not kept on an even keel.  I have every confidence that we will overcome this temporary setback but there are essential things which have to be done.  One thing that we have to do is to establish a proper system of industrial relations.  The fact that we have not been able to establish such a system has been a major factor in causing some of our present troubles.  Any industrial unrest or strike means very often that not alone are the workers hit in their pockets but that exports will fall.  Even in the recent bus strike, some exports were affected when the CIE freight service became involved. It is not my duty to apportion the blame for causing a strike but I suppose it can be said that there are merits and demerits on both sides.</P>
    <P>We must get our message across to the unions and to the employers that they are part of the nation and have no special rights and that if they have their privileges they also have duties. If we ask the people to rally round, they will do so.  The Irish people have always given of their best when they were up against it.  To a certain extent, we are up against it now and unless we get the co-operation not alone of the Opposition in the House but of every man and woman in the country, we may be facing very hard times. I am sure the Irish people will respond and that we will overcome the present setback and build the kind of society which everyone wants to see.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned education in a broad sense. I submit there is something lacking in our educational system because we cannot accept basic articles of agreement in industrial relations.  Status increases in income have been mentioned and in that connection I feel the lower-paid workers are being left behind to some extent.  I can see the difficulties because, all workers being subject to human weaknesses, if we were to raise the wages of the lower-paid workers, those on top would apply immediately to have the differential maintained and the spiral would go on.  If we can educate ourselves into accepting that we owe a duty to people <Col N="1392" /> who have given a lot to the country, then we shall be prepared to accept now and again little doses of bitter medicine in order that the economy of the country should grow.</P>
    <P>I have always been in favour of better industrial relations but I am not such an optimist as to believe that it is an easy thing to achieve.  Across the water, a socialist Prime Minister brought out his famous declaration of intent on wages and salaries.  Today, the unfortunate man is in hot water, not with the employers but with one of the biggest unions in the country. I mention that to show that we, who have a different social pattern, have the same difficulties.  We must realise that any nation which has solved the problem of industrial relations, like the Scandinavian nations, has full employment and high standards of living.  If we had both, we would have just what the modern world teaches, not what the Bible prescribed &mdash;it is not by bread alone man doth live.</P>
    <P>In our social pattern what we need is a plan of action which will give to each member of the community a good standard of living and at the same time guarantee his personal freedom.  That is the type of society worth striving for.  It is very necessary, of course, that we should have control of prices if we are to impress on the people that we are genuine in our efforts to provide a higher standard of living.  Nobody can suggest that wages should be tied to prices unless there is a clear rise in production because the product of the workers must bear any increase in wages.  We cannot control one without the other. If we control wages, we can control profits but first of all we must control prices.  Opposition Deputies said that the ninth round increase was swallowed by increased prices.  I do not accept that.  At the same time, if we could control prices at reasonable levels, we could then control wages at reasonable levels.  That would be better not only for employers but for the workers who must fear inflation because inflation would hit the poorer sections.</P>

      <P>That is the Deputy's opinion.  We must all face the plain facts before us.  If we do not, it is the people who will suffer.  If every section in the country make the effort, we shall overcome our present difficulties. If we do not stand together, it is the workers, the trade unions, who will suffer most.  I shall not go into the pattern suggested by Fine Gael and Labour who tried to go back and hit those in office in the past.  It is very easy to point to the standard of the workers in 1956 and compare it with today.  It is no use crying over battles long ago.  It is the future we should be thinking of and I believe there is sufficient good sense in the Labour Party&mdash;I was impressed particularly by the speech of the Leader of that Party, as I was with the Leader of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is 1965, not 1957. <Col N="1394" /> Deputy Harte is living in the past. He should realise we have moved on. The Taoiseach has outlined the determination of the Government to put things right in the country.  As I have said, he will succeed in that but it is essential that each Party and each section of the community stand behind the Government for the sake of the nation.  We have had native government for 40 years and have made some progress but the point has been reached when the rest of Europe has achieved the affluent society.  We must get down to work so hard that we can promise our people not emigration or badly paid employment but permanent employment and good conditions. These things can be achieved. If the British people and the Scandinavians can do it, so can we.</P>
      <P>Every country in the world is subject at one time or another to recession. If that is so of giants like Britain and the United States, it can be true of us.  The solution lies in our own hands.  The policy of Sinn Féin meant the development of all our resources, the employment of all our people at home.  Over the years we have made mistakes and we should have benefited by them.  Surely in 1965 we can tell our people that with their help we can overcome all obstacles and build the affluent society for which we all strive?  One Fine Gael Deputy said he would not co-operate. Once upon a time another man said: &ldquo;I will not serve&rdquo;, and we know what happened to him.</P>

I am a young man in Irish politics, but I would like to remind Deputy Moore that there is a moral <Col N="1395" /> obligation on every citizen of this country to pay attention to the past. It is by the past that we learn; it is by experience that we educate ourselves. When Deputy Moore was paying tribute to the Leader of Fine Gael and the Leader of the Labour Party, I could not help looking up the Dáil Debates as to what was said by the leaders of his Party in 1957.</P>

I never heard any Deputy take us as close to the corner as Deputy Moore did when he was speaking.  I was waiting for him to get us around that corner, but, like all Fianna Fáil Deputies, he did not get us around the corner.  The closest they ever go to it is coming up to a general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to these interruptions I would say, as the Minister for Agriculture said a few days ago, it is charitable to remain silent at times.  When this country has reached the situation in which we now find ourselves, it is right to look to the past and analyse the history of the Fianna Fáil Party, to analyse the history of Fianna Fáil leadership.  I want to associate myself with Deputy O. J. Flanagan when he said he would not co-operate with the Fianna Fáil Government. I want to say that I will not co-operate with them either.  I will play my part in the interest of my constituents and give whatever service I can for their benefit and advantage, but it is ridiculous for a Fianna Fáil Government to ask for the co-operation of Deputies on this side of the House when they told us on the eve of a general election that the prosperity which then existed was because Fianna Fáil had Lemass to lead on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that election, I had a conversation, in a very remote and rural area of Donegal, with a very humble person, who referred to the posters which were all around us asking us to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.  He said that <Col N="1396" /> what the posters really should have been was &ldquo;Let Lemass Carry On&rdquo; and he added that there was too much carry-on in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We can look back also to immediately after the Kildare and Cork by-elections when the Taoiseach was asked by newspaper reporters for a statement on the Fianna Fáil victories and he said that these were proof of the confidence of the Irish people in the Fianna Fáil Government.  When the then Leader of the Fine Gael Party was asked for his views, he said that one day the policies of Fine Gael would be vindicated and the policies of Fianna Fáil found wanting.  It does not harm us at all to look back into the recent past.</P>
    <P>We have had in this country a succession of Fianna Fáil administrations. We have had one of their leaders who guided the Irish people by waving a flag, beating a drum and blowing a horn, by fighting elections simply and solely on national unity, while, at the same time, most Opposition parties were prepared to sit down and talk with the old enemy in Britain and with our most extreme brothers in Northern Ireland.  Those people were painted as pro-British.  It suited Fianna Fáil then to wave that flag, beat that drum and blow that horn because they had nothing better to offer to the Irish people.  It was a popular thing in those days to appeal to the national spirit that then existed in the minds and hearts of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>That Government was defeated in 1948 and we then had, for the first time in this country, an inter-Party Government.  The most ardent supporter of Fianna Fáil to this day would freely admit that the only and best Government we had in this country was the first inter-Party Government.</P>

No man in the history of this country has contradicted Éamon de Valera more than Seán Lemass.  I recognise the present Taoiseach as a man of sense. I recognise that he is trying hard to <Col N="1397" /> do certain things.  I also know that the Taoiseach recognises that the administration of Éamon de Valera was wrong.  I wonder if an administration led by a Fine Gael leader had gone across the Border and sat down to talk with Captain Terence O'Neill what the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil would have said.  I wonder what castigation they would have given to the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>Many examples have been presented by Fianna Fáil speakers.  They all seem to shun responsibility for this crisis. The Taoiseach claimed credit for the prosperity of the country during the recent by-elections.  If any Opposition Deputy had tried to claim credit during the by-elections for the prosperity of the country, I wonder what the reaction of a Fianna Fáil Deputy would have been.  For instance, what would be the reaction of Deputy Collins if I had met him in Cork and had claimed that some of the credit for the prosperity then existing was due to the initiative and planning of an inter-Party Government?</P>

      <P>You probably would.  It is funny, but I would have told the Deputy to do the same if he had claimed credit for the prosperity.  I suppose it is due to the fact that both of us are politicians that we could say these things.  When the Taoiseach claims credit for the prosperity that then existed and if we allow him that credit, surely responsibility for the position in which we now find ourselves should also be accepted by the Taoiseach and by no one else?  If it <Col N="1398" /> is the Taoiseach and the Government who have guided us into this financial crisis, which is possibly even worse than they care to admit, it is their job to get us out of it or to get out of office.</P>
      <P>Why do they appeal to us to co-operate? There is no Party more capable of playing politics than Fianna Fáil.  Are they still playing politics? I am prepared to play politics but if tomorrow morning there were a general election, I am quite confident that I can earn a better living in private life than in public life.</P>
      <P>I was not here yesterday when the Taoiseach spoke but I was here today when some of his Deputies spoke.  I was here when the Minister for Transport and Power tried to enlighten the House as to the reasons why CIE cannot earn money and must receive a State subsidy each year in order to keep running.  He tried to explain to us that a train must leave at a certain hour and that service must be provided whether there are passengers or not and that one could not compare other rail services with CIE.  That is simply some of the manoeuvring of a Fianna Fáil Minister.  I should like to tell the House that the Lough Swilly Railway Company provides a better service for the northern part of Donegal than CIE provides for any rural community and pays a dividend of ten per cent each year.</P>

      <P>Has it?  That is news. Whether the Lough Swilly Railway provide a rail service or not, they provide a better service to a rural community than CIE does.  They pay a ten per cent dividend.  These are facts.  If some of the executives of CIE paid a visit to the offices of the Lough Swilly Railway, they would find that perhaps next year the Taoiseach might not have to pay as much out of the Exchequer to CIE as he has done in the past.  Remember, also, that there are never strikes in the Lough Swilly Railway.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister for Transport and Power.  When I tried to explain this to him today, on a point of information, he told us that we were not discussing the Estimate for Transport and Power, despite the fact that he used the opportunity to elaborate on his own misdoings.</P>
      <P>Very often during an election a candidate comes across a personal friend who belongs to the opposite camp.  That happened to me during the general election.  I canvassed a certain lady for her vote and she told me that she would vote for me but only because her son and I were great friends.  She said that she could not see any other reason why she should change from voting for Fianna Fáil. She asked me to look at the local dancehall which was bursting at the seams, to look across the street to see that every teenager had a car, to consider the prosperity that existed.  I remember saying to her: &ldquo;That is correct but perhaps there is poverty here as well&rdquo;.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no poverty in this locality.&rdquo;  Within ten minutes I came across a family of seven where the father had been ill for the last two years.  The mother had to work as charwoman, as cook, as nanny or at any other work she could get to earn an odd 2/6d. or 10/- to supplement the princely sum of £5 a week which her husband was getting from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Collins or Deputy Crowley or any Deputy buys a new car, the locals notice it.  If a person buys a new suit, the locals notice it. Human nature being what it is, we <Col N="1400" /> tend to demonstrate these things. When we go off to the seaside for a holiday, we do not go secretly; we let our neighbours know about it.  This causes talk.  However, when we go hungry we keep that fact to ourselves. That is the moral of this story, that there are people who are hungry and in dire poverty and unless you go looking for them, you will not find them because they do not demonstrate it.  As a result of the propaganda issued by the Fianna Fáil Party machine, people have been led to believe that there is real prosperity in the country.  If there is real prosperity, you do not have to be told about it in the newspapers, or on radio or television.  You know it because you have more money in your pocket.</P>
    <P>Is that the position today?  Is the additional money collected by the wage earner buying more goods?  Does he have more money in his pocket?  If that is the position, there is prosperity. I think the reverse is the real position. If that is so, and that must be added to the fact that there is emigration and unemployment, then the Government have failed miserably to carry out the promises which have taken them into office and which have kept them in office.  In 1957 when the inter-Party Government had much the same experience as this Government are now having, the Taoiseach of that day could have clung on to office.  If he had stayed in office for six months longer, this country's very serious trade imbalance which resulted from the international crisis over the Suez Canal could have been overcome. However, the Taoiseach of that day also experienced political upsets and he felt it was a more honourable thing to go to the country.  He went to the country and as a supporter of that inter-Party Government, I felt that Deputy John A. Costello would be returned as Taoiseach.  I did not allow for the eventuality that the then Tanaiste, now Taoiseach, would in Clery's Ballroom in this city give a promise of 100,000 new jobs.  The slogans then were: &ldquo;Get your husbands back to work; bring your sons and daughters back from England.&rdquo;  Deputy Jim Collins of Limerick remembers that, and I have <Col N="1401" /> no doubt that Deputy Collins used it in some of his election speeches in Limerick, because it was a good catch-cry. If I had been a backbencher of Fianna Fáil&mdash;God forbid&mdash;I probably would have used it.</P>
    <P>In that general election Fianna Fáil got a majority, the largest majority ever obtained by a political Party since the foundation of this State. They got a mandate from the people to create 100,000 new jobs.  How many of the 100,000 people are here today?  There is an emigration figure which indicates that roughly 360,000 people have left Ireland since 1957, three and a half times the number of jobs promised by the Taoiseach. There are unemployment figures which do not count the people who have been debarred from collecting unemployment assistance.  There are figures which indicate that 60,000 fewer people are in employment.</P>
    <P>Why is that the position?  That is the position, in my view, because Fianna Fáil want to hold on to office, because Fianna Fáil consider that the Party come first and the country comes second.  Nevertheless, they have the audacity to ask us for co-operation, and Deputy Moore and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce have criticised Deputy Oliver Flanagan for refusing to co-operate.  If the situation is as bad as it appears to be&mdash;and I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt, knowing Fianna Fáil as I do, that they are only touching the crust of it, that we are in for a worst time than the Taoiseach cares to admit&mdash;could the Taoiseach explain to me why Bord Fáilte gave £10,000 to organise the &ldquo;hooley&rdquo;&mdash;because it can be described as nothing else&mdash;at Powerscourt a few weeks ago?  That is news to the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like a lot of promises by Fianna Fáil; it is £10,000 down the drain.  We have heard a great deal about the Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and I have heard one Deputy say it should now be described as the Fianna Fáil programme for economic contraction.  We have heard many excuses put forward by Government speakers.  This country is now in a very serious financial crisis, and I would be so bold as to suggest that the rot really set in in 1957 when the Taoiseach removed the food subsidies which he promised two months before the election not to touch.  When the turnover tax was introduced, I heard the Taoiseach and other members of his Government saying that competition would keep prices down and there was no need for a Prices Control Bill.  I heard Deputies from this side of the House and I heard the late Deputy Norton say that unless the Government took immediate steps to control prices, inflation would catch up with us and that we would outbid ourselves in the export market.  How right Deputy Norton was.  However, nobody in Fianna Fáil wanted co-operation then but when they now find themselves in the soup, they ask for co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Added to the turnover tax there was the promise of a ninth round increase. We know why the workers got the green light for the 12 per cent increase. That, I might remind Fianna Fáil Deputies, was on the eve of two very important by-elections.  No one knows better than the Taoiseach that if Fianna Fáil had been defeated in both <Col N="1403" /> of those elections, his Government would not be in office today.  I do not think that is any news to the Taoiseach because any schoolchild in the most remote part of western Ireland could have told him that.  The 12 per cent increase was granted and the Taoiseach then said: &ldquo;Go and spend it.&rdquo;  There was going to be more money for spending and the people were told: &ldquo;Go and have a honeymoon.&rdquo;&ldquo;Honeymoon&rdquo; was one of the expressions used.  However, the honeymoon has ground steadily to a halt and there are divorce proceedings pending at the moment. Indeed, the wolf is at the door.</P>
    <P>Like any other democracy where you have certain individuals in control of finance, they seem to get the big idea that they are indispensable and that they are underpaid.  This is the important thing.  Any Deputy or any member of a local authority who sits down to discuss with the officials of a Department of State or a local authority knows that a person can put forward a very sincere argument indeed for an increase in wages.  Again, the ordinary workman will easily convince one that he is underpaid.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that the person who is better off is always better in the know and he can claim an increase and probably organise things so that he will get that increase before the lower paid or less informed people even know what is happening.  That results, of course, in status claims.  We had the Taoiseach's Ministers telling us here today that, when the status claims were being granted to civil servants and to members of local authorities, there was no opposition from either the Labour or the Fine Gael benches.  Why should there be? The Minister was in control.  He was in the saddle.  He told them that everybody must share in the prosperity of the nation and the first move was the introduction into this House of legislation by the Minister for Justice for the purpose of enabling him to pay the judiciary an increase of £1,500 per year, raising their salaries from £4,500 to £6,000 per year.  Surely that light was green enough as an indication to every individual to seek a status claim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Whom do we blame for it?  Do we blame Deputy Oliver Flanagan who says he does not co-operate?  Do we blame any of the Labour Deputies? Do we blame Fine Gael Deputies?  Do we blame the trade unions?  Whom do we blame?  Do we not blame the Ministers of the Fianna Fáil administration who set the headline?  They asked for it.  They have got it.  I am fully convinced that the longer we allow Fianna Fáil to stay in office the harder it will be for them to get back again.  We have had status claims.  We have had the 12 per cent increase.  All the time, right up to a month ago, and even today, some Ministers in the Government refused to admit that there is a credit squeeze.  Out of the blue the Taoiseach said yesterday that we have a very severe financial crisis on our hands.  Until yesterday, despite the fact that every financial authority was warning the Government of the dangerous signs and portents and the economic indicators, the Government refused to recognise them.  The Government said everything was all right.</P>
    <P>They appeal to us now not to rock the boat.  If it is any news to any Fianna Fáil Deputies, if rocking the boat will put them out of office, anyone who wants a volunteer to help him to rock the boat will have me beside him.  Due to these increases I have mentioned, particularly the status increases, we find today that rich people or those who were really well off have become richer and better off while those who were at the bottom of the ladder at the time of the ninth round increase are not now even on the ladder.  Any person earning £8 a week was, we will assume, entitled to an increase of £1.  Any person earning £16 a week could claim an increase of £2 a week.  But that was not good enough.  He also wanted £2 per week by way of status increase, bringing him an increase of £4 per week.  The person earning £24 per week got an increase of £3, but he also wanted a status increase of £3, giving him a total increase of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the labourer who has no status in the eyes of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Assume he was <Col N="1405" /> earning £8 a week prior to the ninth round and that he is now earning £9 per week.  The individual who was earning £16 a week is now earning £20 per week.  He is better off by £4.  The individual earning £24 is now earning £30.  If we relate these increases to the cost of living and assuming the cost of living moves one point each week&mdash;it has moved far more than that&mdash;the worker with an increase of £1 is back at the level at which he was prior to the ninth round.  The man with the increase of £4 is £3 better off while the man with the increase of £6 is £5 better off.  Surely that situation is quite wrong in a christian society.</P>
    <P>Surely, when these things were pointed out to the Government by Opposition speakers, the Government should have accepted co-operation then and recognised that these things were bound to happen.  Economics is something the ordinary man sees in newspaper headings&mdash;Economic Expansion: Economic Crisis.  The word &ldquo;economics&rdquo; analysed in simple terms is really a very simple expression. It means you have money or you have not.  Yet are either better off or worse off.  That is simple elementary economics.  Now the cost of living will go on increasing because the cost of living has increased right from the days when man gave up the barter system. If the Government do not try to control the cost of living, inflation is bound to occur.  Inflation in any society causes the rich to grow richer while the poor grow poorer.  I said earlier that the Taoiseach is a realist. I believe he is a realist though I am convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that he is a gambler.  But this is one horse he backed that did not run.</P>

I should like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring this to the notice of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;because our relationship is anything but harmonious&mdash;and I should be particularly interested in what the Minister for Local Government now has to say about it, because many people in Donegal are anxious to know what he did say.

      <P>Ón uair a tháinig mé isteach anseo chuala mé an Teachta Harte agus Teachtaí eile Fhine Gael ag tagairt don Taoiseach agus don Aire Rialtais Áitiúil agus iad ag caitheamh gach salachair dá mbhéidir leo agus anois goilleann sé orthu go n-abróinnse aon rud ina gcoinne féin.  Dá laghad meas a bhí ag an dream thall ar an Ghaeilge tráth, níl meas madra acu ar an dteanga anois.  Abraidís a rogha rud, ní stop-faidh siad mé fhaid atá an fírinne dhá innsint agam ina dtaobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blianta ó shoin do cháineadar cúrsaí tionscal sa tír seo.  Rinne an Teachta Harte tagairt do rud adubhairt an Taoiseach ag Aerphort na Sionnaine Dé h-Aoine seo caite. Tugann an aerphort sin slí beatha maith do na daoine i gContae Luimní, i gContae an Chláir agus in áiteanna mágcuaird.  Más tagairt tráthúil a bhí <Col N="1410" /> ann bhí an tagairt tuillte go maith acu. Dubhradh tráth go mbeadh na coiníní ag poc-léimrigh ar laidhréain Aerphort na Sionnaine.</P>

      <P>Táim lán-tsásta glacadh le rialú ar bith ón gCathaoir. Rinne Teachta tagairt do ghearradh scórnach na laogh mbeag.  Sin é an t-am a bhí muintir Chumann na nGaedheal ag gearradh scórnach mhuintir na h-Éireann.  Dubhradar go raibh £5 milliúin dlite do na Sasanaigh de réir dlí mórálta agus dlí na tíre ach, or ndóigh, níl cead ag éinne aon rud a rá a ghoillfeadh orthu san anois.  Tugaidis freagra ar an rud atá á rá agam anois.</P>
      <P>Caitheadh a lán airgid ar mhonarchain a chur ar bun sa tír seo chun obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na h-Éirean agus faid a bhí an beartas sin dhá chur i gcrích níor chualathas aon rud ó na daoine sin thall ach alagón agus tá sin ar siúil fós acu agus beidh go deo.  Dubhairt cuid acu gur mar a chéile agus an phlá Rialtas Fhianna Fáil.  Rinne siad tagairt don rud a dubhairt Oliver amháin i dtaobh Oliver eile.  Do chuir Oliver amháin Fianna Fáil i gcomparáid le Oliver Cromail ach, dar ndóigh, na daoine is mó a chuidíonn leo siad sliocht Chromail sa tír seo iad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coicís ó shoin do chualamar <Col N="1411" /> Teachta ag cáineadh roint na talún a cuireadh ar bun ar bhruacha an Lagáin.  Ba leasc leis go n-aistreofaí na Gaeil bhochta ó áiteacha i dTír Chonaill isteach i macairí méithe a sinsir. Sé dubhairt Oliver Cromail leis na Gaeil: &ldquo;Go Chonnacht nó go h-áit níos teo libh.&rdquo;  Ba mhaith le chuid de na Teachtai thall a rá: &ldquo;Go-hifreann nó go h-áit níos teo le muintir Fhianna Fáil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ngach toghachán ina dhiaidh a chéile do cuireadh an cheist fé bhráid mhuintir na hÉireann agus nach íontach na h-amadáin iad go dtugadar a gcuid bhótaí do mhuintir Fhianna Fáil agus gur chuireadar ar ais iad mar Rialtas! Más fíor an méid adubhairt an cainnteoir a bhí romhaim gur creachadóirí a bhí i lucht Fianna Fáil nach raibh de chuspoir acu ach muintir na hÉireann a loit, is ait an rud é gur thug muintear na hÉireann a gcuid bhótaí dhóibh.  In ionad bheith dár cháineadh ba chóir do na daoine thall cuidiú linn chun cúrsaí na tire a chur chun cinn. Níl ach cúpla fochal eile le rá agam san am atá fágtha.</P>

      <P>Lean ort má tá focal ar bith le rá agat.  Gach aon uair a chuir tú isteach orm i mBéarla a rinne tú é.  Cad chuige nach n-abraíonn tú rud éigin i nGaeilge? Deineann an Teachta Ryan iarracht ach éiríonn sé tuirseach agus deireann sé gur masla don Ghaeilge é go n-abroinnse rud ar bith sa teanga sin. Déanaigí rud éigin d'fhoghluim uaim agus b'fhéidir le cúnamh Dé go dtiochfaidh an lá nuair a bheidh sibh i ndán Gaeilge a labhairt.  Éirigí as na geáitsí a bhí ar siúl agaibh i rith na seachtaine ach tá mé cinnte nach nglachaidh sibh mo chomhairle.  Tá seanfhocal sa Ghaeilge adeir: &ldquo;Iad siúd gur mian leo iad féin do chreachadh cuidíonn an t-Airseoir leo.&rdquo;  Sin í an chomhairle a thug lucht Fhine Gael do mhuintir na hÉireann le fada an lá. Glacaidis le polasai Fhianna Fáil agus b'fheidir go mbeidh trua ag muintir na hÉireann dóibh agus go dtabharfaidh siad seans dóibh nuair a éireoidh Fianna Fáil tuirseach de bheith ag rialú na tíre&mdash;rud nach dtarlóidh go ceann i bhfad.</P>
      <P>Is beag an baoil go rithfidh Fianna Fáil ón phráinn mar a dhein sibhse san mbliain 1956.  Ní béas linne cúl a thabhairt ar an phráinn agus teicheadh ar nós na gcoiníní úd a bhíothas ag tnú go bhfeicfí iad ag poc-léimrigh ar laidhréain Aerphort na Sionnaine.
