    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has seen the recent policy statement issuing from the Conservative Party Conference which envisaged the abolition of the deficiency payments system in British agriculture; and whether the eventual disappearance of this method of subsidy which the return of a British Conservative Government would make possible, has been borne in mind by all negotiators in the present Free Trade talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy statement of the British Conservative Party refers to shifting &ldquo;the emphasis gradually for more commodities from support by deficiency payments to support by import control&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The prospect that such a change of policy may be brought about at some future time by the British Government is, of course, very relevant to the present negotiations, and is one reason why it is important for this country that these negotiations should be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The eventual possibility of Britain going into Europe will most certainly alter the present form of agricultural support.  Does the Taoiseach see this as having any bearing on the nature of our negotiations at the moment in our search for concessions on the agricultural front?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking whether Britain's admission <Col N="450" /> to membership of the European Economic Community has a bearing on this situation, of course it has a very definite bearing and, as I have already said, we regard any agreement which we may now make with the British as operating only until membership of the Common Market becomes possible for Britain and ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If concessions are gained on the agricultural front, as to the future of which there is a big question mark, in view of later developments, and if on the result of the present negotiations hangs success on this agricultural front, does this not have a bearing on the entire negotiations and is not there a possibility that we are rather searching for advantage that will disappear in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that any arrangement we might make now with Britain regarding agricultural exports to Britain will cease to operate if we become members of the Common Market and in these circumstances our trade in agricultural products would be conducted under the rules of the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get an advantage from Britain in respect of these deficiency payments, it will be very temporary if we are going into the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach what cases are outstanding concerning claims in respect of remuneration payable to recruitment clerical grades in State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department; and if he will give details in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic charge for the facility referred to is £1 10s. 0d. for one horse for each period of six hours or part thereof and the maximum charge paid for any horse stabled at the airport during the last six months was £6.  Because of the limited use made of this facility by bloodstock owners and shippers, these charges yield a meagre return in no way commensurate with the economic cost of providing and maintaining the stabling accommodation.  I find it hard to visualise any circumstances in which a horse would be stabled for a week at Shannon Airport while awaiting transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the Revenue Commissioners deduct income tax payable by postmen in any year by twenty-four weekly deductions in that year instead of by fifty-two weekly deductions spread over the whole year; and if, having regard to the hardship caused by the present system, steps will be taken to introduce without delay a more equitable system for postmen similar to the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Postmen are remunerated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; and tax is deducted from their emoluments by that Department in accordance with the usual system of tax deductions in operation for those paid by Government Departments.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this system, provisional deductions are normally made from the beginning of each tax year, that is, from April, pending the making of formal assessments in the following September and October. When the assessments are made, the rate of tax deduction for the rest of the year is adjusted so that the correct amount will be recovered by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional deductions are based on the amount of tax charged in the preceding year so that, in a case where no tax was charged in the <Col N="463" /> preceding year, provisional deductions would not be made unless there was a request to that effect by the employee concerned.  When assessments for the current year, 1965-66, were being made last month, it became known that, because of increases in wages since 1964, some employees who had not been chargeable in previous years were now liable for tax; and the tax due had to be recovered in the remaining months of the year since there had been no provisional deductions in the earlier part of the year.  Discussions are, however, taking place between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with a view to ensuring that this difficulty will not arise in future and that deductions in such cases will be made over the whole year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision and allocation of office accommodation for Government Departments is generally a matter for the Office of Public Works.  In the city of Dublin such accommodation is comprised in some 140 buildings or groups of buildings most of which are held under agreements varying from short term tenancies to leases for ever.  The annual rents payable vary considerably from nominal sums under leases for ever and fee farm grants, to present day commercial figures for accommodation in recently erected office blocks.  The provision in Subhead F3, Rent, Rates, etc., of the Public Works and Buildings Vote for the current <Col N="465" /> financial year amounts to £340,000, and the breakdown of this figure between the Departments concerned appears on page 39 of the Estimates Volume.  Approximately £155,000 of this figure relates to rents of premises in the Dublin city area.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to disclose the amount of the rents payable in respect of individual properties as the figures concerned are confidential as between landlord and tenant, and the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be in the public interest to do so.</P>

      <P>Statistics of agricultural holdings have not been compiled by reference to nationality of ownership and the required information is not officially recorded.  In general I can inform the Deputy that for non-nationals as a whole, the Register kept by the Land Commission under the Finance Acts shows that for the four year period from 1st August, 1961, to 30th September, 1965, a total of 35,581 acres, including one open mountain acreage of 5,455 acres was purchased by or leased to non-nationals subject to payment of 25 per cent stamp duty in 384 transactions with an aggregate purchase money of £2,078,535.  It is a matter of common knowledge that some of these properties have since been disposed of by the non-nationals to Irish interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, 6,818 acres were acquired in 452 transactions with an aggregate purchase money of <Col N="478" /> £3,279,894 for purposes of industry other than agriculture; and 8,922 acres were acquired for other purposes but were exempted from the higher rate of stamp duty under the relevant provisions of the Finance Acts in 187 transactions with an aggregate purchase money of £1,912,844.</P>
    <P>Section 45 of the Land Act 1965 provides for direct control by the Land Commission over the purchase of rural land by non-qualified persons.  Apart from transactions arising solely from mortgage interests or involving plots of five acres or less, the total acreage of non-urban land in respect of which the Land Commission have consented, pursuant to section 45 (2) (a) of the Act, to the vesting of interests in German purchasers amounts to 402 acres involving five properties.</P>

The rate of interest to be borne by each series of land bonds is fixed with a view to securing that the market price of the bonds shall remain at or near par for a reasonable time after they have been created.  Bonds are guaranteed by the State as to payment of interest and ultimate redemption at par but such guarantee does not extend to day to day prices on the Stock Exchange and the Land Commission have no power <Col N="479" /> to compensate owners for losses through fluctuation in the Stock Market.  Since first created by the Land Bond (No. 2) Order 1957 the interest rate of 6 per cent payable has been regularly adequate to maintain the bonds at or near par but in line with gilt-edged stocks generally there has been a fall in their value on the Stock Exchange in recent months.  I can assure the Deputy that I am watching all aspects of the situation very closely and I trust that the current price level may be short-lived.</P>
      <P>Meantime I would inform the Deputy that under section 26, Land Act, 1965, owners whose prices have been agreed in Land Bonds but whose lands have not yet vested in the Land Commission will be eligible for payment in such higher interest-bearing bonds as may exist when the lands do in fact vest in the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware of the position which has arisen concerning certain officers commissioned in December, 1962 who prior to appointment to commissioned rank had service as senior NCOs and who now find that their salaries and emoluments are lower than those of NCOs; and if he will arrange that increases appropriate to the ranks of the officers concerned will be granted forthwith.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the amount of the present pay and allowances of the officers referred to by the Deputy is less than that of certain senior non-commissioned officers. The officers in question are, however, at the minimum of the scale for their rank and the maximum of that scale is higher than the maximum rate payable to any non-commissioned officer. Moreover the officers will be eligible in the normal course for promotion to the next higher rank which carries a still higher scale of pay.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question the position is that these officers are already in receipt of the rate of pay appropriate to their rank and service in that rank and this rate includes increases in line with all recent increases granted to officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

These officers, when commissioned, were in fact given the impression that their pay would be increased.  Further, is the Minister aware that, while it is true that some of them may in time qualify for promotion, others, because of their age, unless they are promoted in the near future, will never be promoted and consequently will never benefit from the increase?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any uneasiness in the tobacco industry concerning supplies of tobacco.  None of the tobacco manufacturers have indicated that they expect to have difficulty in obtaining supplies of tobacco.

Having regard to the fact that a substantial proportion of the raw material for our tobacco industry comes from that country, does the Minister not feel he has a duty now to seek alternative sources in order to ensure the continuation of supply?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.  I am aware that while sales of turkey poults by licensed hatcheries <Col N="496" /> increased very substantially this year the preliminary census figure for June showed the reduction mentioned in the number of turkeys under 6 months old.  The reduction occurred in the numbers bred through turkey cock stations and by private flock owners. The bonus introduced in 1965 on sales of turkey poults by licensed hatcheries applied only to poults sold on the home market for rearing and fattening on the purchasers' premises. No licences have been issued during the year for the export of turkey poults to the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The advance payment regulation came into force on 10th August, 1965.  Applicants affected were notified of it at the time service was being offered them, and a general public announcement was made on 13th September when the national newspapers resumed publication after the printing strike.</P>
      <P>The amount payable is the standard rental for the initial term of the telephone agreement which varies from one year to five years according to the location of the applicant's premises. In exceptional cases, where the cost of providing service is abnormally high, the period of the agreement may be extended to seven years.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 15, as amended, stand Part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent a good deal of time on this section but I think it will be time well spent if we succeed in convincing the Minister that certain adjustments to this section are extremely desirable.  Since we last discussed the section, I put down a Parliamentary Question and I have received a reply which is relevant to this section.  The question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government the number of dwelling-houses built during each of the ten years ended 31st December, 1964 in respect of which no grant was paid under the Housing Acts.</P>
      <P>The reply to that was:</P>
      <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.  As indicated in the Housing White Paper, it is estimated that about 150 houses a year are erected without the aid of State grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> I submit this number is extremely small and that it could be even further reduced if we take into the calculation the number of people who still shy away from looking for grants because they think it might involve them in very serious delay or because of certain unwarranted fears, shall we say, of too rigid inspection.  I should say the number of 150 houses mentioned in the reply to this question are houses which, if measured, would in fact qualify for these grants.  This is one more reason why the Minister should see that it is desirable that these rectrictions or limitations on planners should be removed.  There should be more freedom for planning and imagination; otherwise, we shall get dull uniformity which nobody wants.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which should get some consideration, that is, the fact that many people still believe that when State grants are given, that fact carries an automatic guarantee of the quality of the house.  They think that with the grant the degree of inspection is such that it will ensure that at least no major defects will appear within any fairly short period.  Of course that is not so.  This might be very desirable and the Minister should express his opinion in regard to the extent of the inspection that goes with the grant because many people have found after 12 months or two years that dry rot has completely destroyed their floors because the ventilation was faulty.</P>
    <P>I give that as an instance.  Many such defects have shown up and many purchasers think, in innocence or ignorance, that this should have been covered by the inspection the State makes to ensure that houses on which grants are paid are built to a certain standard of quality and specification. That deals with the area.  It is most desirable that this upper limit of area restriction should be removed. Nothing can be gained by keeping it in the Bill and a good deal would be lost.</P>
    <P>I hope that before Report Stage the Minister will reconsider his attitude to this aspect of the Bill.  We have all tried, at some length, to get the Minister <Col N="505" /> to change his mind in relation to the grants being provided for in this Bill but so far he has given no indication that he is prepared to give way, no indication that to any degree he will improve or extend the grants which have been at the same level during the past 17 years.  It is deplorable that in the enacting of new legislation or the re-enacting of old, we should include grants of the same amounts as those provided in 1948.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister is allowing the present financial position, the credit squeeze and crisis, to affect his judgment and influence him in keeping these grants at their extraordinarily low level.  There seems to be no other good reason for their retention.  I hope the Minister will look beyond the present position and realise that this is legislation which will stand for years to come.  I hope that in such a realisation he will agree to reconsider the matter and see what can be done to improve the grants provided for in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Clinton in his plea to the Minister to remove the restrictions on the qualifying capacity of floor space of houses for grants.  Over the years houses have been built which were only a few square feet more than the qualifying size but they were ruled out for grant purposes.  The answer to the question asked by Deputy Clinton is that the number of such houses was relatively small, so that if the restriction were removed entirely, there would not be any great amount involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said last week that here we are legislating for the future. He said that another section of the Bill would apply in the matter of house building for years to come.  Surely the Minister does not suggest that grants of £300 which were payable since 1948 should be considered as appropriate in future years?  Even at this late stage, would the Minister consider having another look at the level of grants we are providing here, forgetting the credit squeeze, forgetting that money is not now available?  In the years to come grants should not be left at the level of 17 years ago.  If the <Col N="506" /> Minister attempts to tie the grants to costs, even if he put in a sliding scale which would relate to the cost of the house, a lot of good would be done and much relief and encouragement given to people to provide themselves with proper homes.</P>
    <P>We know housing costs must go up. Even the prices standstill order which became operative this morning will not affect that.  In the circumstances, would the Minister consider making some provision here for increased building costs?  He must look at this question in relative terms of £300 in 1948 and £300 in 1965 and recall the statement he made last week and realise that the figure could still be £300 in 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures produced to the Dublin Corporation at the behest of the Department of Local Government by City Hall officials show that the cost of house building has increased by 120 per cent since the level of housing grants was fixed more than 15 years ago.  It seems unpardonable that we should be asked in this House to accept as sufficient for housing purposes a grant level which, relatively speaking, was 120 per cent greater when the whole principle of grants was enacted in our last housing legislation. I certainly think it is regrettable the Minister has not had the courage to provide for at least higher ceilings as the years go on.  We know from experience that this House, like most Parliaments, moves after the need for something arises.  Here in this legislation we are already years out of date. In this day and age, we are trying to extend into the future figures which we know in our hearts and souls are unsuited to the needs and requirements of this day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to support Deputy Clinton in the matter of inspections carried out in the course of the erection of houses for which grants are paid.  The public, not unreasonably, assume that inspections will be rigid and responsible and that grants will not be paid through a Government agency, unless and until the house has been satisfactorily built. It is no comfort to people who go into a house which they contracted to purchase <Col N="507" /> to know that the housing grant has not been paid because of some deficiency in the house: it is no comfort to the purchaser to know that, because the defect is still there.</P>
    <P>I know a housing scheme not four miles from this House where the sewerage pipes were laid in the first instance with the incline towards the house instead of into the main sewer, in which the foundations were grossly below specification, below the minimum standard.  Notwithstanding those glaring defects, the houses were built on those foundations and the people have been in those houses four or five years.  It is no solution to the tenants' difficulties to know that the State has not yet paid the grants.  It is no consolation to them to realise that the defects were so glaring that they should have been obvious during the course of erection.  Even if an additional army of inspectors is required, it is most important that where the State is putting money into house building, it should ensure that jerrybuilding is a thing of the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in pressing the Minister to give the same concessions to house builders in urban areas as have been extended to those living in rural Ireland since October, 1963 The present grant of £275 has been allocated since 1948 to houses built in urban areas whereas in rural Ireland the grant has been increased to £460.  Anybody <Col N="508" /> building a private, five-roomed house, with water and sewerage laid on, can qualify for a grant of £460 in rural areas.  Surely if that is possible in the country, it is doubly desirable in towns and cities.  People in rural areas have greater advantages than those in towns and cities, particularly those depending on local authorities for re-housing.</P>
      <P>Those depending on the local authorities in the towns and cities must make a move to build their own houses.  Since October, 1963, people in the country, whether they rely on local authorities or do their own building, qualify for a grant of £460 while a person in the same district, living in a town, qualifies for a grant of only £275.  The Minister should reconsider the whole matter.  It is about time that grants were stepped up in urban areas and cities as they were stepped up in October, 1963, in rural Ireland.  An ordinary person working in an urban area for a wage must find it much harder to provide the money to build a house than a person in rural Ireland.  People living in rural areas have great advantages.  Very often they can supply their own labour during slack periods.  County councils give supplementary grants whereas very few urban authorities are paying supplementary grants to help people provide houses for themselves.</P>
      <P>I would press the Minister as strongly as possible to provide that the same grants will be available in urban areas as have existed since October, 1963 in rural Ireland.  It may be impossible to make that provision now, due to the credit squeeze, but the principle should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 is the key to the entire Bill.  I do not intend to make a Second Reading speech but I do want to say that this Bill was introduced with a flourish of trumpets and the announcement that it would be the Magna Carta of housebuilders. We find that under section 15 the very same grants are being offered to persons who wish to build houses as were made available by the inter-Party Government in 1948.  Deputy Ryan has pointed out that building costs <Col N="509" /> have gone up by 120 per cent since the Housing Act, 1948, was passed and that is generally admitted to be the case.  It is also admitted that it is more difficult at the present time to procure money by way of loans from banks or societies, or under the SDA, than was the case in 1948.  The grants are exactly the same as they have been for the past seventeen years.  That is no incentive to persons to build houses. If the cost of building a house has increased by 120 per cent, let us at least increase the grant by 50 per cent.  That would be an incentive.  Otherwise, the Bill becomes useless and may be written off.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the appeal made for the elimination of the upper limit of floor area of a house.  The Minister knows, and I know, and many Deputies know that in order to keep within the upper limit, many people attached garages to their houses and immediately the grant was given, the partition wall between the garage and the house was taken down.  That has happened down through the years. Annexes have been attached to otherwise efficiently planned houses which give the houses a monstrous appearance. I fail to see the purpose served by restricting the upper limit of floor area.  What is the necessity for it?  Is it so that grants will not be given to gentlemen who want to build mansions? There are very few people who wish to build mansions or who can afford to build mansions today.  I can see no useful purpose in retaining a clause which was embodied in an Act that was passed when the cost of house building was 120 per cent cheaper than it is today.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister, if he is sincerely anxious to see houses built, to increase the grants proportionately to the cost of building.  In that way he would provide an incentive and encouragement to people to build houses.  Although it may be some time before they can afford to build, owing to the financial squeeze, it will encourage them to plan for the future building of houses.  In that way the Bill would serve the purpose for which the Minister intended it.  Otherwise it will become a dead letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> I would appeal to the Minister seriously to consider the points made by Deputies from all sides of the House. There appears to be unanimity on this matter.  I am certain the Minister will also agree.  I do not think it will affect the financial squeeze if the Bill is amended even to the extent that the increased grants would become payable from a future date, say in a year's time, or some such date, because according to the Taoiseach's statement last night, we will have this squeeze in operation for at least a year.  By adopting the suggestion that has been made, the Minister would provide an incentive and I appeal to him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised is that the floor area limit is somewhat restrictive. This matter was raised originally by Deputy Clinton, who used the information that we tried to give him as accurately as possible last week as to the number of houses that are built which do not qualify for grants; in other words, those over the 1,400 square feet, which is approximately 150, to argue that the number is so small in relation to the total that there is not much point in having a limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not the answer I gave, then I will have to correct myself or the answer.  At any rate, the figure given is being used to argue that it is so small in relation to the whole that the game is not worth the candle, that it is not worth while having the upper limit.  I think the argument is based to a degree on that figure.  It has also been suggested that the imagination and usefulness of architects is being curbed in that they cannot be given a free rein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many factors, as Deputies are aware, curbing the activities of architects in designing houses, not least of which is ability to pay for the imaginative drawings which run beyond the 1,400 square feet and which only a small minority can afford to build and maintain today.  There is <Col N="511" /> complete ignoring of the fact that the limit is to be increased from 1,400 to 1,500 square feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a few weekends.  We have gone to the 1,500 square feet limit, an increase of 100 square feet, and the 1,400 square feet represented an increase by 150 square feet on the limit applying up to 1950. In all the circumstances, 1,500 square feet is the right size of house for the great majority of people who would be entitled to get State assistance or local authority assistance by way of grants.  It is the right size of house in anybody's language.  It does not curb the imagination of architects to the degree that has been suggested here.  I have talked to architects about this matter.  I have gone to the 1,500 square feet partly for the reason that it will allow a little more latitude but also because the demand for bigger rooms and more space is growing and the 100 square feet addition to the existing 1,400 is to some degree justified on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, while it may be suggested that because in future the number of houses over 1,500 square feet floor area will be very small, even smaller than the number over 1,400 now, the argument is all the greater for bringing them in, I do not agree. The fact that the number is decreasing would seem to be a sronger argument <Col N="512" /> for leaving them out.  If a floor area of 1,500 square feet is not acceptable to a person in future, it is not 1,600 or 1,900 but 2,000 square feet and more that such a person will be interested in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When one comes to build that type of house, whether in 1948 values or 1965 values, the total State grant represents only a fleabite in the total cost and is hardly worth the person's while to apply for, although I am sure such person would apply if the grants were handed to him on a platter.</P>
      <P>The other matter I should like to bring into focus is all this talk about the grants not having been increased since 1948.  This is the greatest cod of all time.  It has not been referred to here that the grants for those living in rural areas have now gone up to £460.  That is largely true with particular reference to the farming community, farm labourers and workers on roads.  What we are doing now is seeking to give corresponding benefits to those living in towns, cities and built-up areas.  Under this Bill, if it is properly operated by the local authorities, grants of up to one third of the cost will be given to provide sites for private houses in towns and corporation areas.  This is an application to the built-up areas of what we have already done in so far as the rural areas are concerned.

      <P>The arguments have been flowing from that side of the House and, indeed, from my own side of the House, that when we provide grants it is not the house purchaser who gets the benefit but the building contractor.  Under this Bill the site subsidy goes to acquire the land and develop it and the builder cannot get it.  The most practical way we can help those desirous of building their own houses is to make sites available to them at a reasonable cost.  If a person at the moment wants to buy a single plot for a single house, he has to pay a high price for it and God knows what amount he has to pay to put in the services.  If the local authority come in, take up a site, develop it and put in the services they can give those plots to private builders at reasonable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether we increase the grants or not and whether the private builder gets a qualified architect to draw his plans does not alter the fact that he has got the site for his house at a reasonable cost.  This site subsidy is intended to encourage local <Col N="514" /> authorities to take up lands and provide private building sites that cannot now be obtained.  We are offering the site subsidy to enable them to provide sites at a cheaper rate than they would be available without the subsidy.  This fact has been largely ignored and this is my answer to those people who say that we have done nothing about changing the grants since 1948.</P>
      <P>The amount of grant is not the only or most important factor that enables people to get together for the building of private houses.  It is only a small part of what is required.  The figures I gave the House on the last occasion was indicative of what is being done.  In 1949, only 1,500 private houses were built as compared with about 6,000 last year, and the amount of grants given is not the only important factor.  The earnings of our working population have increased by about 100 per cent since 1953 and that has had more effect on activity in private housebuilding than the amount of the grants being given today or ten years ago or 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>It is of importance that we should remember the three major improvements we are making in this Bill: increases in grants, increased provision for rural housing and the provision of site subsidies for those in built-up areas.  But this Bill also provides new grants for dower houses.  That is something new.  There are also grants for flats and maisonettes in buildings of three or more storeys, extended provision for prototype houses, the extension from £50 to £60 in the valuation limit to enable farmers to qualify for reconstruction, new grants of up to one-third of the cost for the improvement of local authority houses and the extension of the income and valuation limit for farmers and others in order that they may obtain grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year in County Dublin, if my memory serves me <Col N="516" /> aright, about 2,700 private houses were built.  It would be interesting to know the number of those houses that would qualify for the rural grant.  I would say 100 of them would not qualify. Out of the total number of houses built in the country as a whole, 6,900, it would be interesting to know how many qualified for the rural grant.  I would say the number would be insignificantly small.  Therefore, it is not fair to advance as an argument in favour of pegging down the State grants that most people in the country can take advantage of the site subsidy. That is what the Minister is doing in this instance.  He is using it as an argument for keeping the grants down. I admit the site subsidy can be a benefit where it can be availed of, but so far very few sites have been provided under the scheme and it will be some time before we have sites.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies had spoken in favour of increasing the grants.  That is true.  Three Fianna Fáil speakers drew attention to the gap between the loan plus grant and the cost of a house.  They agreed that many people are debarred from becoming owners of their own houses because of this gap, which may be anything from £500 to £800.  The recent enormous increases in the rents of workers' houses have made many of these people think of purchasing their own houses.  But these are people who have no money saved.  Still, they want to purchase a house because they realise they could be building up a capital asset for a weekly payment not much in excess of what they are now required to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, what is happening in England is this.  The Government go to a contractor building this type of house.  They have a list of a number of people in the area anxious to purchase their own houses.  They ask the builder how much he is charging for these houses and he may say £3,500.  They ask: &ldquo;How much will you take for 20?&rdquo;  They go in and buy 20.  They provide the total loan and grant to buy these houses and hand them over to these people who vacate local <Col N="517" /> authority houses.  That frees a number of local authority houses for people in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>That is an excellent scheme.  I draw attention to it because it is impossible for these people who have not saved money to meet the gap between what is provided by way of loan and grants and what the builder must charge for the house in order to get his profit. This is an aspect the Minister should allow himself to be influenced by in making a decision about these grants. It is one more reason why I believe the grants should be increased.</P>

      <P>The Minister went slightly wide of the mark when he said new grants were not needed because of the site subsidy.  He said this would compensate for the reduced amount paid in other than rural areas. I do not know whether the Minister spends all his time in his office or in Donegal and does not get about the rest of the country.  Those of us who do get around know that since the passing of the infamous Planning Act, certain individuals around practically every town in the country have made arrangements, not alone to get control of existing housing sites, but, having found out by devious ways how the local authority propose to develop sewerage and water in the area, to buy sites along where these proposed schemes would go.</P>

      <P>I made it plain I was referring simply to the Minister's explanation why this section did not require extra grants for urban areas. He said they did not require extra grants because he was in fact providing <Col N="518" /> money in another way.  I want to make it clear that the money is not being provided or, if it is, it is not going to be made available to the people we are talking about here.  I do not want to go any further on that line because we can take it up again at a later stage.  Suffice it to say that anybody who now wants to build a house in a non-rural area must be prepared to pay through the nose for a site.  When he gets the site, he can qualify only for the same grants as applied in 1948.  The Minister referred to the change in wages and costs and said people had tremendous increases in wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I wonder what the Minister did say because I did not get the drift of his argument, if that is not what he did say.  If that was not the drift, I wonder what it was.  If a man found in 1948 that, with the help of a £300 grant, he could build a house costing between £900 and £1,200 or £1,400, I do not know how the Minister can now think that a man today can build the same type of house with a grant of £300 when the house costs anything between £3,000 and £4,500.  No matter what increase in wages a man may have got, I do not know how he could possibly build his own house today with a grant of £300.  The mistake the Minister is making is that he is not relating the amount of the grant and the amount of the loan to present day costs.  If he did, we should have no difficulty in persuading him of the necessity for an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred the other day to the fact that local authorities at one time provided tenant-purchase <Col N="519" /> houses and he said Dublin proposes to do that again.  Is it not true that the Department of Local Government banned completely the provision of tenant-purchase houses?  Did the Department not state definitely that there was no provision in the Act and this could not therefore, be done?  We were doing it in Meath and we were stopped by the Department.  I take it there is no special regulation, though I am sure Dublin Deputies would welcome such a regulation, relating to Dublin.</P>
    <P>We cannot discuss section 16.  We are talking about rural houses, but, if we talk about rural, we must also talk about non-rural.  A rural area means an area &ldquo;no place in which is within a county borough, borough, urban district, town or non-municipal town.&rdquo;  I wonder if the Minister is aware that certain of his officials have decided that a rural area is an area in which there is neither public water nor sewerage and have refused to give the increased grant in areas to which that yardstick applies.  Perhaps the Minister would check on that.  If he does, he will find that, no matter what way he tries to tide over with his one-third subsidy for sites, he cannot get away from the fact that all that applies in that area is the £300 grant. If this Bill lays down what a rural area is, then the Minister should insist that the officials in his Department know what a rural area is and put a stop to the cod that is going on at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the grants payable and said that is not the complete sum applicable under the section.  Would the Minister agree that local authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to get contractors at the present time within the range of grants payable?  The cost of housebuilding has increased considerably.  The ordinary three-roomed cottage is tendered for at the moment round the £2,000 mark.  Restrictions on the acceptance of such tenders is slowing down the rate of progress.  This points to the necessity for increasing the amount of the grant.  It is a clear <Col N="520" /> indication of two developments: the grants now payable have lost the value they had when first introduced and increased costs in materials and labour adversely affect the situation. The Minister, in his experience, must have found these material factors operating.  There is a wide gap now between the amount a person must provide in order to build his own home as compared with the value of the grant and loan facilities formerly available.  I agree the provision of serviced sites within the urban areas will be a help, but that position will not apply in the rural areas because local authorities will not be able to provide serviced sites in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister has power to make regulations in relation to density of housing per acre.  I take it that will be done, in the first instance, by the planning authority in each county.  Has the Minister in mind what density he will allow within the serviced site areas?  Will this type of housing be in a more confined space than has been the practice up to this?  The Minister says other factors enter into the question of grants.  That is so, but the Minister must be aware of the difficulties local authorities are experiencing in regard to the provision of houses.  Would the Minister not consider increasing the inducement to people who might be prepared to build houses for themselves, thereby removing these from the responsibility of the local authority?  If adequate facilities were available, people in their private capacity might avail of them.</P>

In the city area, Dublin Corporation has on occasions, despite the scarcity of land, acquired land and given sites away free, fully serviced, which cost about £700, for the building of houses. Admittedly, we did reserve these to occupants of corporation houses, on the understanding that they leave their corporation house and take one of these. If we had more land, we would extend <Col N="522" /> the scheme.  The Minister has pointed out what local authorities can do.  If we take one site in the city here which has been purchased and serviced at a cost of £700, there is a grant of £700, plus a State grant, plus the full supplementary grant, which will give an actual grant of £1,200 a house.</P>

      <P>There is great need for increasing grants as far as Dublin is concerned.  Evidence to this effect has come about quite recently in regard to the commitments people are expected to meet in setting out to buy their own houses.  It was my understanding that the idea of giving grants was to induce SDA tenants to buy their houses.  The grants set out here are too low.  It is disappointing to find there is no increase, particularly in view of the fact that we have to take into consideration the cost of the house, the amount of the loan and what the intending purchaser has to lay out as a deposit. Intending purchasers of houses, in Dublin, anyhow, are being required to put down deposits of £560, £600 and £700.  One may as well ask such people to put down £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000.  The situation is ridiculous and is crying our for a remedy.  I would urge the Minister to do something about this.  If he does, he will demonstrate that he is taking this <Col N="523" /> housing situation seriously.  There are a considerable number of people who have been described as members of the working classes who are found to be entitled to a loan and grant because they are members of the working classes.  However, because they are members of the working classes, they find themselves unable to lay their hands on such large deposits.  These are the people who deserve assistance and I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and agree to increase the grants in cases of this kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister has set a headline in regard to rural houses by increasing the grant to £450.  If there is a case for increasing the grant to £450 in rural areas, there is a case for a much greater increase in the urban areas.  The cost of labour is much higher in urban than in rural areas, and various other costs are much higher.  A number of people are still able to secure sites of their own, more especially where old dwellings have been demolished.  There are old dwellings in urban areas and people deserve to get every encouragement to secure sites in these areas.  It would be a great help if a grant of £450 were given in the urban areas.  In fact if the Minister is prepared to give £450 in a rural area, its equivalent in an urban area would be around £600.  Tenders were received the other day for four bungalows in the town of Kilkenny, over £3,000 each, and these were ordinary local authority houses.  Taking the cost of building into consideration, the Minister should increase the grant to at least what is is in the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to deal with all the questions that arose because they are completely outside the section before us.  The Minister referred to the fact that there were provisions in this Housing Bill whereby local authorities could assist persons who were anxious to build their own houses by providing sites in built-up areas.  This is something which, I am glad to say, has been going on in my county for some years.  Wicklow Urban Council gives sites for nothing to people and gives them the loan, so that there is no problem whatever.  In that way you can encourage people.  Apart from the fact that you get a grant of £300 or £450, a lot of work is involved in the acquisition of a site, arranging with an architect or an engineer to design a house, and then sending it to the planning authority for permission. It is not just as simple as suggested here.  The fact is that local authorities purchase sites, develop them and make them available to applicants, and all the applicant has to do is apply, and then he either qualifies or does not, and if he does get a State grant, he is provided with a loan, and it is then a question of either building himself or getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily. He can go to the Arcade and get a plan for half-a-crown.  He can decide whether he wants to employ an architect or not.  As far as the Department is concerned, the experience has been that the State grant of £275 does not appear to be a barrier to building houses in the private sector.  Last year 6,900 houses were built, which was a record.  I should also like to point out that the experience this year has been that we are going to have another record because in the first six months of the <Col N="525" /> year there has been a substantial increase in the number of people allocated grants as against the same period last year.  The number of grants actually paid is nearly double what it was for the same period last year. This would indicate that even though we had 6,900 houses provided by State aid in the private sector last year, we are going to have a substantial increase in the number this year.  This is very welcome and, as I say, it would indicate that the grants do not constitute a barrier.</P>
      <P>It has been said before from all sides of the House that if we increased the grants by £100, or by 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 100 per cent, the people who are going to buy the houses would not necessarily benefit by a reduction in the price they have to pay.  I do not think the arguments advanced are sufficient to influence the Minister to make a change.  We are quite satisfied that the figure is such that it is an encouragement to our people who are availing of it.  The argument that because we have decided to do something for another section of the community we should also apply this generally is not a legitimate argument, in my opinion.  What we are doing in regard to rural grants is trying to provide increased grants for small farmers, about whom everybody seems to be worrying, and for other people in the rural community whose incomes are very low and who normally would not be in a position to build houses, to encourage them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You are trying to argue that because we did something for these people, we should do it for all.  There is no need to do it for the others because they are availing of the grants in increasing numbers every year.  I hope the number of people who qualify for the increased grants will increase over the years also. With the passing of this Bill, we will have every reason to believe that there will be a substantial increase in the numbers and all this will help to <Col N="526" /> increase the number of houses provided annually and lead to better housing conditions.</P>

      <P>A few days ago I had a visit from a small farmer from within the borough of Sligo.  His house had fallen into disrepair and he decided to build a new house but he did not know what the situation was in regard to the grant and he asked me to find out.  I made inquiries and I found that this man, who is building a five-roomed house within the borough, would get only £350 for his new house and he stops there.  His valuation is high and his farm is only about 30 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>His home is within the borough but I am not sure whether he has land within the borough.  This type of person should be considered.  It is a clear case of a man losing because he is within the borough, while perhaps a neighbour 40 yards away may benefit.  Recently I had an inquiry from a person with a very large family who erected a five-roomed house.  This was in County Leitrim and again the only grant he got was £350, due to the fact that his valuation was too high to qualify for the full grant.  The question of valuation should be cut out altogether in such a case and the grant should be given to the man with the five-roomed house.  As somebody mentioned already, the cost of everything has been going up for the past ten years but there has been no increase in some of the grants in the same period.  The Minister should consider this very carefully because costs of labour, materials, water supplies and everything else involved in the erection of a new house are still very high.  I should also like to say that the reconstruction grant for small farmers for a three-roomed or four-roomed house is not in keeping with present-day costs of having that house put into repair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a number of amendments to this section, all of which have been ruled out of order. One was to provide a definitive date for this section to become operative. I think it is very confusing that so many dates are mentioned in the Bill for so many different purposes.  It is well known that the Bill was heralded as far back as October, 1963, and all during the election campaign, the people were being promised a new deal in housing.  Everything said then and prior to that time would give people reason to believe that when this magic Bill came along, it would have retrospective effect.  It has taken a couple of years to produce the Bill and it is not unreasonable to suggest that <Col N="529" /> it should have retrospective effect at least for a year or two; but in many cases it is brought up to the current time.  People were entitled to expect it would be retrospective but it is not.</P>
      <P>Subsection (b) of this section, in my view, is merely a means test.  It says:</P>
      <P>the said person or occupier is ordinarily resident in a rural area&mdash;</P>
      <P>a rural area would have to be described and defined</P>
      <P>&mdash;either in an overcrowded house or in a house unfit for human habitation&mdash;</P>
      <P>all these things must be defined: what is &ldquo;an overcrowded house&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>or he is a person in need of housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds&mdash;</P>
      <P>who is to decide all these things? Consider the delays involved in deciding them&mdash;</P>
      <P>and the circumstances of the person or occupier are such that he could not provide a house for his own occupation without the aid of a grant under this section.</P>
      <P>Who could possibly prove all these things?  How long would it take? Surely we either want to give farmers grants or we do not.  I believe the subsection is deliberately put in to be a brake again and the cause of endless delays and frustration in proving or disproving that a farmer qualifies under all these individual headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely if we have the valuation of the farm and we want a few people to remain in rural Ireland, we should give a grant and have none of this means test business.  We have more than enough of that in the Health and Social Welfare Acts.  Now we are introducing another long list of qualifications that are tantamount to a means test of farmers seeking grants in rural areas.  We are increasing the grant and making it impossible for them to get it.  It does not make sense to me and it seems as if, even in rural areas, we do not want to make it easier for people to provide their own <Col N="530" /> houses.  I should like to see the subsection removed: I tried to have it removed.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in relation to it and how he can justify all these provisions before it can be decided that a man is entitled to a grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first point, it is true that the Bill took quite a long time to prepare, but on the other hand before the House is finished with it.  Deputies will realise why. It is a very big, comprehensive Bill and undoubtedly a great deal of work behind the scenes had to go into it as distinct from decisions of mine, the Government or anybody else.  The hard work of the officials dealing with the finalising of the wording that would convey the intentions of the Government does not look as if it required much thought but in a Bill such as this, it was a very onerous job and if an undue time appeared to the House to have elapsed, I can assure them that is not really so.  The time was all necessary and time over the normal hours of those immediately associated with the Bill was put in on its preparation.</P>
      <P>Regarding these dates about which Deputy Clinton complains, I should recall why 1st October, 1963 was fixed.  This was the point at which it was decided, and announced by me on behalf of the Government, that we had determined to do a job regarding further assistance to the farming community by way of increasing Government grants for housing for these people.  Once having said it, is is only right to say that as and from that date, anybody who might come into the category would be in rather a quandary as to whether he should start or not start.  Therefore, we made it 1st October, 1963, the date on which this information was first announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding 1st July, another of the dates Deputy Clinton alleges are confusing, I do not deny that they may be confusing.  The 1st July date was taken because it was the actual date of publication of the text of the Bill which was circulated on June 30th.  If we only promised certain of these provisions that are in the Bill and did not <Col N="531" /> put them in, it could have a retarding effect on housebuilding rather than act as an incentive.  Naturally, we had to fix a date and the obvious one was 1st July.  The people did not know about it until this date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton suggests we should go back further and make many of the provisions of the Bill retrospective. I should say a fairly reasonable assessment of the matter is based on this consideration: these incentives and improvements in housing legislation, whether by grant or otherwise, are intended to be new and additional incentives to get people to build more houses more quickly.  It would negative the whole argument if we were to compensate people by giving retrospective benefit to people who had already completed houses in the previous six months or two years. Our purpose is to encourage more people who have not yet felt up to the task of going ahead and building their houses to do so now under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not our aim to compensate those who have already completed their houses or who began to build on the day of the announcement of these improved facilities.  There were people who, before these facilities were announced, felt that, with the grants then available, they were in a position to go ahead and do the job. What we are trying to do here is to get the people who did not feel they were able to go on with the job to do so now.  That is the very reason why we do not go back a year or two years, much as we might like to do so, to compensate those who have already done the job.  We could with justification say to those people: &ldquo;Here is another £100 or £150.  You are entitled to it as much as those who have not yet begun to do the work.&rdquo; Our whole effort must be to get people to build, not to compensate people who have already built.  A date must be chosen and if we go back two years, there is no reason why we should not go back five years. If we go back beyond 1st October, 1965, and 1st October, 1963, respectively, there is no reason why we <Col N="532" /> should not go back five years or indeed ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister go back to October, 1963, because people who were at that time thinking of building houses were advised by officials and members of local authorities that anything they did then would qualify under the terms of the Bill then announced, that people in rural Ireland building houses will get the £450 grant from the Government, though that provision is not passed.  People undertook commitments on that basis, on the promise that they would qualify under the improved provisions of the Housing Bill.  They went ahead and built, and if they started operations before 1st July, they are cut out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree this was a much discussed Bill and people were able, from the hints given by Government speakers, including the Minister, to anticipate a certain number of improvements because of the Bill, small though the improvements may be.  A peculiar feature of the Bill is that not one date or two dates but three dates are mentioned.  Improvement grants go back to December, 1964 and then there is 1st October, 1963 and 1st July.  There were three different dates in various sections of the Bill.  The explanation given by the Minister, while good in its own way, certainly does not meet the objections to this date or the suggestion to go back a reasonable period and have one date in the entire Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the objections I raised to paragraph (b) of the subsection which involves a means test.  I should like to hear him give his reasons why all these qualifications have first to be satisfied before we can decide to give a farmer a grant to build his own house.  There are so many things that have to be proved or disproved at the whim of somebody in the area or of the Minister's inspector or whoever makes these decisions. The Minister says he is anxious to get the greatest number of houses built in the shortest possible time.  One of the best ways of achieving this is to remove <Col N="533" /> that entire paragraph, eliminating all these silly qualifications which a man must satisfy before he can get a State grant.</P>
    <P>I notice that while in the section covering ordinary grants there are three columns, the third column is eliminated in the section covering the rural group.  Apparently it is assumed in these cases that a piped water supply and sewerage facilities are never available, that the people must always provide themselves with water by digging wells and with sewerage facilities by laying down septic tanks.  That is my reading of it.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the Deputy's first point&mdash;I am sorry I overlooked referring to it earlier&mdash; the question of proving or disproving so many things by so many people does not arise.  The reason for these two sets of conditions is to widen the scope of the provision rather than restrict it: if a person does not win on the red, he may win on the black. It is not a question of proving or disproving. The provision says &ldquo;if in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; certain things are so or are not so.  The aim is to expand rather than restrict.  In regard to the columns mentioned by the Deputy, I cannot identify them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there are different and improved grants in cases where there is a piped water supply and a sewerage service on the road.  Such services are possible even in a rural area unless we qualify rural areas and eliminate any area which has not got these services.  Why is there not a third column in the second table? I should like also to ask if these conditions laid down are meant to widen the scope of the provision rather than to narrow it.  Does it mean that a farmer <Col N="534" /> who meets some of these conditions but whose valuation is more than £60 will come within the scope of the section?  The first qualification is that the valuation of the person concerned must not be more than £60.  Further down, other conditions are imposed. Does it mean the person could go up to any valuation figure if he fulfils some of the conditions laid down in paragraph (b)?</P>

      <P>There is a very big difference to the man building a house between the case where the services happen to be public services and where he has to dig a well and instal a septic tank.  There should be some compensation for the man who has to provide these services for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The converse could be true, that we should fine the man who does not happen to provide the services.  A man who chooses to build a house on an eminence some distance from the main road cannot be said to be in need of compensation so that he can put a road similar to the main road up to the door of his house. That is the logical conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow this up because of the fact that a distinction is made on page 14 in the case of the urban grant, in that it is recognised that it costs more to provide a septic tank and a well&mdash;not sufficiently <Col N="536" /> recognised&mdash;but it is recognised by the additional £25 over and above the grant applicable where the services are available.  There is no such recognition in the case of the rural grant.</P>

      <P>Reading the heading there, does it not mean that you could have under section 16 a decision by a Minister that a farmer could reasonably provide these services himself and, since he does not, he is not entitled to a grant?  Maybe there is nothing in it but Deputy Clinton has raised the matter.  The headings in the columns associated with section 15 are: first, where sewerage facilities and piped water supply cannot reasonably be provided.  That is clear enough.  The second is where sewerage facilities and water supply are provided.  Again that is clear enough.  The third is where the person, although there is not a public service available, in fact makes the provision. Now applying it to a farmer, there is the same first heading, where the facilities cannot reasonably be provided.  In that case there is provision for the grant.  Then where, in fact, they are provided, there is provision for a grant.  But there is no similar column providing for where the person makes the provision, where public supply is not available.  So that one could have a situation in which the Minister could say: &ldquo;In your case, since you have not made provision, although there is no public water supply available, you are not entitled to a grant because it could reasonably have been provided. Is there not a difficulty there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The general situation is that in this regard it is the intention <Col N="537" /> to have services provided in all new houses unless such provision is an unreasonable requirement.  If somebody is building a house, the first thing he should do, although it is not always done, is to apply and get his plans approved and his grants allocated as per the plans.  At that stage it would be determined as to whether or not services could reasonably be provided. He should get it clear at that stage that it is unreasonable to expect him to provide the services.  It is at the time of allocation, which should be before the house or any part of it had been commenced, that that should be determined.  If an applicant builds a house in the pious hope that everything will be all right and makes no provision for services either outside or inside the house and we find that it was reasonable that he should have provided these services and it was reasonably to be expected, he will be in trouble.</P>

      <P>The Minister has put his finger on a rather sore point. While for some time it was quite easy to apply for a grant and get an inspector to examine the whole situation and decide, that is not so now.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>If the man applies now and waits until the inspector comes to examine his site, he will have to wait a heck of a long time.  When a person decides to build a house and has plans drawn up, he does not want to have to wait three, four or five months for an inspector to arrive to say whether or not the plans are in order.  The Minister may say that that does not happen in every case&mdash;I quite agree&mdash;but it does happen.  Did I hear the Minister say that four or five <Col N="538" /> months is not inordinate?  I will put another name on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Four or five months is not unusual.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of other things in connection with this section.  One of them is the question of rural areas. The Minister has been referred to grants for farmers.  This section does not apply only to farmers.  That point must be cleared up.  Not alone have they been referred to as farmers' grants in the House but a number of people and a number of local authorities are under the impression that this applies only to farmers with a valuation. It should be explained fully that it applies to persons other than farmers, that it also applies to persons in rural areas who are living in condemned or overcrowded conditions.</P>
      <P>The section says:</P>
      <P>(a)  The said person or occupier is in need of housing and derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture and the rateable valuation, or the aggregate of the rateable valuations of the land (if any) and buildings occupied by him does not exceed fifty pounds.</P>
      <P>(b)  the said person or occupier is ordinarily resident in a rural area either in an overcrowded house or in a house unfit for human habitation, or he is a person in need of housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds, and the circumstances of the person or occupant are such that he could not provide a house for his own occupation without the aid of a grant under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some most extraordinary interpretations of this at local authority and departmental level.  I mentioned on a previous section that a rural area was generally considered to be an area in which there was no piped or public water or sewerage and that people who have built houses in areas which were <Col N="539" /> really rural but where there happened to be a pipeline passing by were held not to be entitled to get the rural housing grant.</P>
    <P>If we go back to page 9, to the definitions, we find in line 20:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rural area&rdquo; means an area no place in which is within a county borough, borough, urban district, town or non-municipal town;</P>
    <P>That being so, it is a little high-handed on the part of officials to rule out people simply because there is a pipeline passing their gateway conveying water from a reservoir to a town and that person gets a connection made to that pipeline.  If there is any doubt about such cases being ruled out, I can give specific instances to the Department which I took up with them myself and on which I was told that there was an authoritative ruling.  In such cases, the Minister should intervene.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it.  The section refers to &ldquo;a person ordinarily resident in a rural area either in an overcrowded house or a house unfit for human habitation.&rdquo;  It often happens that young people getting married in a rural area who have been living in a house which might or might not be overcrowded before the marriage would qualify for a grant, but if they leave that house and move into a new house directly on marriage, they are ruled out by the Department under subsection (2) paragraph (b) of section 16.  The Minister will have to have these matters clarified because an otherwise good section is being spoiled by this interpretation.</P>
    <P>There is no point whatever in passing legislation through this House for the purpose of improving any particular matter if it is left so loose that certain officials administering the Act at local authority or departmental level can frustrate its whole intention by saying: &ldquo;This is what we read out of it and it does not matter what was intended.&rdquo; Our experience of the Planning Act and the interpretation being given to what we consider to be perfectly simple phraseology makes us very suspicious indeed.  It is our job to ensure that <Col N="540" /> it cannot happen when this Bill becomes law.  We must have it down in black and white and we must insist that before the Bill goes through, not alone is the Minister satisfied but we also are satisfied that the wording is what we want it to be.</P>
    <P>The grant of £450 is a substantial amount of money but it does not bear much relation to the real cost of building a house at the present time.  If the local authority give the other £450, the person building the house gets £900 which is a substantial amount of money, but with present housing costs it is very important that the maximum benefits be got from these grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister, referring to grants to farmers, may have been contained by the fact that most people who apply for permission to build in a country area are told by the local authorities that unless they are farmers who live in the country areas, they will not get permission to build a house there.  The Minister may be surprised at that interpretation but it is an interpretation given by local authority officials who claim that they have got it from the Custom House.  Some of them are not yet aware that the Custom House has been changed to O'Connell Bridge Building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Tully has gone back to subsection (b), which confuses me.  I would ask the Minister if that subsection stands on its own.  The section says:</P>
      <P>The said person or occupier is ordinarily resident in a rural area either in an overcrowded house or a house unfit for human habitation....</P>
      <P>Does that stand if a person has an income of £2,000 a year?  The next line is:</P>
      <P>or he is a person in need of housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does that stand on its own?  I would like the Minister to define or explain the word &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo;.  Here is where we run into difficulties at local authority level and it all depends on who is looking at the section.  This is something that should be tied up <Col N="541" /> tightly in this Bill.  If it is possible to give it any other meaning, it will be given that meaning if it means the preventing of a house being built.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on that paragraph when we resume the debate but I have not yet finished with the table.  It is this difference between the two tables which does not make sense to me.  There was one question I asked the Minister which he did not answer: whether a person with a valuation of over £60 and qualified on other grounds would still qualify?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <P>I suggest it could be artificially provided.  If I had a valuation over £60, I could go in there and live in overcrowded conditions.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Agricultural Workers (Holidays and Conditions of Employment) Bill, 1965: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a proposal that agricultural workers be given an extra week's holidays the same as given to every other type of worker in the country.  I only hope the interest displayed in it is not typical of the interest taken by Deputies in agriculture and the way agricultural workers are treated.  As far as I remember, one Deputy from Fine Gael and the Minister for the Government were the only Members outside the Labour Party who took any part in the debate.  It would appear as if the agricultural worker is still considered the Cinderella of our workers.  It is just too bad that it should be so.  If that is the way the House intends to treat them, I suppose they can hope for very little from this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Replying to my Second Stage introductory <Col N="542" /> speech, the Minister agreed that the wages of agricultural workers were not princely but said that the agricultural community could not afford to pay decent wages.  That was a shocking admission from a Minister for Agriculture.  If he really believes that statement to be correct, the Minister should take immediate steps to subsidise the wages of agricultural workers directly from the State.  There does not seem to be any other answer to it.  I am not prepared to agree that all farmers are unable to pay decent wages.  As a matter of fact, I am glad to be able to say that a number of them do pay quite decent wages and give decent conditions and holidays.  I suppose I may include the Minister himself amongst them.  If some people pay decent wages, that is no reason why others who can afford to do so should get away with paying as little as they can and giving whatever conditions they can get away with.</P>
    <P>The Minister said many employers give Church and bank holidays.  Of course, they do; but many who could afford to do so do not.  There is no reason in the world&mdash;and certainly the Minister gave no reason&mdash;why agricultural workers should not be entitled to a minimum of 18 days holidays in the year, the same as workers in any other industry.  I do not know if the arrangement in regard to paid holidays is generally known.  There are only two, St. Patrick's Day and Christmas Day and 12 annual holidays.  But if it was the custom in an area to give Church holidays before the Holidays Act came into operation in 1961, then everybody in that area still has to pay for Church holidays and allow workers off with pay.  However, under a peculiar arrangment, in a week in which such a holiday occurs, the ordinary half-holiday is cancelled.  It does not have to fall on the same day as the Church holiday. If it is on a Saturday, it does not mean the Church holiday must fall on a Saturday.  This practice is carried on and in fact cancels out a certain number of the holidays they get.  That is undesirable.  It does not apply anywhere else.  The Minister should see to it that the necessary regulations are made to have that situation remedied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> The Minister said there was a close relationship between the farmers and the farm workers and he did not want to break it up.  I thought that old story was killed a long time ago.  It was killed as long ago as it was found necessary to introduce a minimum wages order.  If that close relationship had been there, it would never have been necessary to bring in a minimum wages order for farm workers.  But they were so badly paid and the farmers, who were supposed to be so close to them, thought so little of them that it was necessary to bring in a wages order guaranteeing them 24/- a week at that time.  It has improved substantially since but that does not alter the fact that, if the minimum wages order was not there, quite a number of farmers would still be paying as close to that 24/- as they could.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that he has inspectors whose sole job it is to check on farmers who do not pay the legal minimum.  I am quite sure they do not catch them all.  There are still people who believe they should be able to get away with scandalous wages.  In view of that, I do not see how the Minister can talk about a close relationship between farmers and farm workers.  The people farmers employ are doing a good job.  The farmer does not keep them because he likes their curly hair or blue eyes but because they are doing the job better than anybody else.  He pays them the legal minimum and, as I say, some of them pay more.  But there is no reason why the State should not insist that those people who work on farms, work longer hours than any other type of worker, should be forced to work in worse conditions than operate in any other type of employment.  Why they should have to do with a minimum of 12 days, plus two days, making a possible 14 days&mdash;if we take away the two halfdays, it makes 13 days&mdash;while everyone else is guaranteed a minimum 18 days, and more in some cases, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, if he thought that new legislation on holidays was necessary, he would introduce it.  I <Col N="544" /> think the evidence is quite strong enough to convince even the Minister that new legislation is necessary.  In fact, that legislation has been introduced for him and all he has to say is that he accepts it on behalf of the Government.  The Minister's attitude sums up the Government's attitude towards this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that special conditions of employment, such as operate in other spheres, are not possible in relation to farms.  I am not quite clear what he means by that.  The Minister is, I know, Minister for Agriculture but I do not think his experience of practical farming could have led him to believe it is not possible to lay down certain conditions.  Anybody who works for hire requires minimum conditions.  These conditions include hours of work, rates of wages, overtime rates and holidays with pay.  I see nothing at all wrong with laying down conditions which stipulate these things and, as the law stands at present, it does all except one of these. I refer to holidays.  It lays down that the holiday period is 12 plus 2 which, by a peculiar twist under a previous Act, makes not 14 but 13.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Agricultural Wages Board falls for discussion on this Bill.  The Minister made the point&mdash;he thought it a good one&mdash;that overtime is in fact being paid at present to farm workers.  Of course overtime is being paid and the board have laid down overtime at time and one-third for working days and time and two-thirds for Sundays for eight months of the year for over 50 hours and something else has been laid down for four months of the year starting next Monday.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister got the point, but let me repeat it: the legal adviser to the Agricultural Wages Board has informed the board that they were not legally entitled to reduce the number of hours and could not, therefore, stipulate the amount which should be paid for overtime for hours over and above 50 hours.  All I ask in the Bill is that that situation should be regularised.  I am quite sure that nothing can be done about it from <Col N="545" /> the point of view of declaring it illegal and attempting to recover the overtime paid because already eight Orders have been laid before this House and passed and I am not aware of any way in which those Orders can now be rescinded.  But I still think it is irregular and it is not a very good way of doing things to have a legal adviser saying that something is done in the wrong way.  We have an opportunity now of changing it but apparently it is not intended to take that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The board, as I mentioned last Wednesday, has quite a number of conditions laid down governing its operation, conditions which would not be accepted in any other type of employment. Nominations are made by the Minister for Agriculture and nominees are very often not attached to agriculture at all.  I am prepared to give all the evidence at my disposal, inside or outside this House, proving that people who never spent an hour in agriculture have time and again represented agricultural workers on the board. There is the case of a man who spent two years as a builder's labourer in Birmingham officially representing agricultural workers in Cavan on the Agricultural Wages Board.  County council road gangers and workers and factory workers&mdash;by a coincidence, most of them happen to be secretaries of local Fianna Fáil cumainn&mdash;have been appointed to represent the interests of agricultural workers.  I do not think that is right.  The farming community have an organisation.  There is an organisation representing the farm workers.  Both these bodies should have representation on the board.  If that were done, the whole matter could be dealt with fairly.  The present system is anything but fair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy spoke last Wednesday about the system whereby the Chairman constitutes a quorum.  The Chairman can himself give a decision. I do not know of any board here or elsewhere in which such a system operates.  If a regional board fails to make a recommendation when asked to do so by the central board, the whole matter is held up for two <Col N="546" /> months until a majority recommendation is made.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board did a good job in setting a floor to wages, but it is now an outmoded body.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept this Bill, he should take the earliest opportunity to introduce a Bill designed to treat agricultural workers as human beings and in the same way as workers in other spheres are treated.  He should take from them the slur of being second-class citizens to be dealt with differently from all other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>When the Holidays Act was introduced, every type of worker was included within its scope, except the agricultural worker.  For him, a special Bill was brought in, a Bill designed to ensure he would work longer hours than his fellows employed in other industries in order to qualify for holidays and he would get only 12 days as against a minimum 18 days for other employees.  These may be harsh statements but it is only right they should be made, particularly in view of the fact that it is no longer possible to put any Tom, Dick or Harry out on the farm.  Most agricultural workers today are a cross between an engineer and an agricultural instructor.  They must know how to keep machinery running and they must know all about the rotation of crops.  They are still the lowest paid workers in the country, working longer hours and getting fewer holidays than any other employee in the State.  This is the industry which is consistently referred to as the primary industry.</P>
    <P>I believe this matter has been allowed to drag on too long.  The Government have brought in a great many amending Bills over the past few years and, God knows, it is time they decided to consider the agricultural worker and give him something more than the very poor treatment he has got up to the present for the work he has been doing.</P>
    <P>Again let me refer to something which makes me very surprised at the Minister's attitude.  A Bill proposing the extension of paid holidays, including public holidays, to farm workers, <Col N="547" /> was debated in this House on 29th March, 1946.  The Minister of the day expressed the view that the Agricultural Wages Board had power to make provision for holidays with pay and it was suggested by him that the question of holidays should be brought before one of the board's area committees for eventual discussion by the board.  Let me quote what the Minister said at column 901, Volume 100, of the Official Debates of 29th March, 1946:</P>
    <P>If the Agricultural Wages Board makes any decision with regard to holidays, it will certainly have my co-operation, if that is necessary. There are certain decisions that I do not come into, but, if it is necessary to give legal effect to any decision come to, I will certainly co-operate as far as I can to bring the matter before the Dáil.  I expect the Dáil will be sympathetic.</P>
    <P>He concluded at column 904 of the same volume by saying:</P>
    <P>All I can say is that whatever the board may decide will have my co-operation, and if any legal action is necessary, I am prepared to bring the matter before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Following that, the legal adviser to the board states that the board have not got such power.  I bring the matter before the House on behalf of the Labour Party and the Minister, Deputy Haughey, stands up and says on behalf of the Government:- &ldquo;I oppose the Bill.&rdquo;  After the 20 years that have elapsed since the matter was before the House, the Fianna Fáil Party do not seem to have developed any greater love for the men who work on the land than they had then.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the Minister should have adopted the attitude that what was good enough for those who went before us should be good enough for us.  I had thought the Paddy-go-easy system had disappeared.  Certainly I did not think the bright young men of Fianna Fáil who were going to sweep all the cobwebs away would be falling for cliché in order to hold on to the very bad old customs which were introduced so many years ago. It is sometimes suggested that the <Col N="548" /> Agricultural Wages Board with its minimum wages regulation was born out of the brain of Fianna Fáil in 1936. That is not true.  It was introduced here during the early World War I years under the corn laws and, I believe, it was borrowed from legislation which had been passed in Australia 30 or 40 years earlier.  The same regulation as was then in operation is considered to be quite good enough for farm workers now, and there does not seem to be much point in trying to persuade the Minister or his Government to change their minds if they have not already decided to do so.</P>
    <P>If they had even accepted some sections of the Bill, I could understand it.  What I cannot understand is that the Minister should say he was not prepared to accept any sections of the Bill, that all of them were wrong. I went into great detail the last evening explaining to him what had happened when one of the area committees had had an even vote at one of their meetings on whether or not wages should be increased.  The board did not send out the decision on the evening of the central meeting when it was decided to increase wages but held it up for over a week.  Because the regional board did not reach a majority decision, the payment of an increase which had been decided by the central board was held up for nine weeks. I have asked that the regulation be altered to ensure that sort of thing cannot happen again.  Apparently the Minister had his mind made up or his mind was made up for him, and he refused to accept even that amendment of the law.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, could I ask the Minister two questions.  In section 6, I ask that:</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 5 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, shall have effect as if the words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; were inserted immediately before &ldquo;twelve members&rdquo;, &ldquo;eleven members&rdquo; and &ldquo;four members&rdquo; where those words respectively occur.</P>
    <P>I gave the reason for this the last day. I believe it should be possible to have greater representation on the wages board of both farmers and workers.  I <Col N="549" /> made the point that on occasions nominees of the Minister who were on the board as workers' representatives did not turn up to meetings.  The result was that those who were present, even though they had a very strong case, were outvoted.  If nominations were made through the trade union, as I have suggested, it would be the trade union's job to ensure that these people attended, that the necessary provision was made for their attendance so that they would not lose anything as a result of their attendance.  I suggested that the Minister should allow the nominations to be made directly through the trade union and through the employers' organisation, and even if he could not concede that, that he should increase the number from four to six, so that at least there would be more than one or two people on the workers' side when vital decisions are being taken.</P>
    <P>The second question I wish to ask him is in relation to the matter I raised last night as to whether he would investigate the board with a view to modernising it and bringing it into line with modern conditions and, secondly, if he would consider, if necessary, removing the board completely and replacing it by something like the Joint Labour Committees operating under the Labour Court.  If he is not prepared to do that, he could examine the weaknesses in the board, and I am sure the officials will be just as anxious to give him the facts as I am giving them to him tonight.  Possibly they will give them to him in a different way but I believe in calling a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Minister makes these investigations, he will satisfy himself <Col N="550" /> that the workers who are carrying on under the provisions laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board are not getting a fair deal.  He will also realise that, if he does not do this, both wages and conditions will improve for one reason only, that is, that people will not stay at farm work as long as they can get better conditions elsewhere.  It is happening in certain areas at the present time.  Deputy Sweetman commented on the difficulty farmers are experiencing in certain areas in getting farm workers.  That will become much more widespread, unless the Minister can make conditions a little more tolerable on the farm.  If the Minister goes to the trouble of checking, he will find it is not a question of ten or one hundred farm workers being affected; literally thousands of farm workers have their lives regulated by the operations of the Agricultural Wages Board and it is therefore vitally important that they should have better conditions and better wages than they have at present.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to do that, he will be doing a good job towards helping the ordinary agricultural worker.  If he is not prepared to do that, then there will have to be a fight made by the agricultural worker in a different way.  We have reached the stage now where everybody else seems to be getting the good things of life to a greater extent than the agricultural worker.  He cannot be blamed if he insists on getting a bigger share out of the small national cake which is at present being distributed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Redundant Workers (Severance Pay and Compensation) Bill, 1965: First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed:</P>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide minimum terms for the payment of severance pay and compensation for employees (employed under a contract of service or employment) and who are dismissed because of redundancy or other causes beyond their control.  &mdash; (Deputy James Tully.)</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Orders describe this Stage as a short explanatory statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Labour Party introduced this Bill, it was simply intended to provide minimum terms of severance pay and compensation for employees employed under a contract of service or employment and dismissed because of redundancy or other causes beyond their control.  At that time we were told we were living in a buoyant economy; there was no danger of redundancy or unemployment. In fact the old &ldquo;Come back to Erin&rdquo; tune was being revived and we were going to string our harps and sing it again.  Since the Bill was introduced, conditions have changed a lot. We have now sailed into very stormy waters.  We are told there is a credit squeeze and because money is scare, assistance cannot be given to certain <Col N="553" /> industries when they get into trouble. As a result the employment exchanges will be fuller than they have been for some time and in addition, the new State-owned B. &amp; I. will be carrying full loads one way to Britain for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>Despite that, the Government refused to give a First Reading to this Bill, on the plea that they themselves were introducing terms which would deal with severance pay and redundancy compensation, retraining and so on.  That may be all right in its way but the trouble is that what the Government are talking about is something they propose to do and which, with luck, we might have before the Dáil goes into recess next July.  What we want is something that will come into operation immediately.  There is no point in telling the people Deputy Treacy spoke about, or those who have lost jobs here in the Greenmount and Boyne Company, or who lost employment in the Dundalk GEC works a few months ago and the hundreds of others who rumour says will lose their jobs inside the next couple of weeks or months, that the Government are making preparations to introduce a Bill which will become law some time in the future and following that, arrangements will be made for redundancy pay and retraining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We claimed here and throughout the country during the last general election &mdash;and I repeat now&mdash;the Labour Party are the social conscience of the House. If the Government will not act, we are the people who must bring their responsibility to their notice, the responsibility to try to care for those hit by unemployment through no fault of their own.  All we sought was to have the Bill debated, and if the Government produced evidence that they proposed to introduce a reasonable Bill to deal with this matter, we should have been fairly satisfied, provided the Bill was introduced now, not in five or six months' time.  Unfortunately, the Government, as they did with the housing situation and the various financial matters with which they are supposed to be dealing, merely talked and talked and told everybody everything was grand, that there was no danger of anything going <Col N="554" /> wrong and that everything would right itself eventually.  Right round the corner was the prosperity we have been hearing about.</P>
    <P>Now nobody is making any effort to deal with the vanguard of the new unemployment wave in this country, The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to redundancy compensation being paid out of some kind of fund the Tipperary millers have. Other workers will apparently get whatever the employers&mdash;who apparently have not got very much for themselves&mdash;are prepared to give as charity.  We do not want charity. What we want is a fair do.  The workers are entitled to it and the House should see to it that the Government set about introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>What we have got is a proposal from the Government which has a peculiar sort of twist to it.  They suggest that when they introduce this redundancy compensation pay, it will be paid for by the employers and the insured workers.  The Government will not give anything.  It will be entirely apart from the Government, except for its administration.  The workers and the employers will put up the money.  Here the Government are shirking responsibility entirely.  I suggest that the Government accept this Bill.  The onus is on them to do something now and it is not good enough to say they intend to deal with it some time in the future.  It should be dealt with now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that as a matter of procedure any statements would be made this evening on this Bill.  I should like to disabuse Deputy Tully that only the Labour Party represent the social conscience of the people.  The matter of introducing a redundancy payments system is being treated with the greatest urgency.  It is a very complex matter, one on which there are widely divergent views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Tully along the various paths he chose to travel, preferring to confine myself to the clear issue involved.  It is indeed a matter of urgency that a redundancy <Col N="555" /> compensation system should be introduced and I wish to assure Deputies that I am doing everything possible to expedite this work so as to introduce the Government's measure at the very earliest date possible.  Frankly, I cannot say whether it will be possible to do so in this session, that is, before Christmas.  Being realistic, I do not think it is likely because, as the Deputy knows, a number of organisations have to be consulted with regard to the terms of the measure and we have not yet got the final replies from any of them.  Let me repeat that we shall introduce our Bill at the very earliest possible moment&mdash;I should think certainly next session.  We shall then have an opportunity of discussing the whole matter in complete detail.</P>
    <P>I should add that the inter-departmental report on redundancy became available only a couple of months ago. It was necessary to wait for it before consulting other bodies.  I hope that in the meantime Deputies, representatives of trade unions and any other people who may be interested will give us, as a matter or urgency, the benefit of their views as to how this system could best operate.  I should like to say that unemployment in large numbers in Tipperary or elsewhere is a matter of grave concern to the Government, as it is to every Member of the House.  The redundancy proposals we shall introduce will be only part of measures designed to alleviate hardship.  From my speeches in recent times, the House is aware of the general nature of these comprehensive proposals, some of which are set out in a Government White Paper.</P>
    <P>I am accordingly opposing the Bill, not on the ground that we are not fully conscious of the need for introducing this scheme, not because we are unmindful of the tragedy involved for individuals and their families, who, <Col N="556" /> through no fault of their own, cease to be employed, but simply because in a complex matter of this kind, it is better to wait until we have the benefit of the views of people who are entitled to be consulted before bringing in any half-baked scheme.  We hope the scheme we shall introduce will reflect, at least in the main, the views of the people I have mentioned and that therefore we will get the Bill speedily through the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that qualified secondary and vocational teachers who are nationals of Ireland and who have had suitable teaching experience in Northern Ireland or Britain should on returning to teach here, be given credit on a basis commensurate with their services in these areas for the purpose of computing salary payable by the <Col N="559" /> Department of Education, and that similar credit should be given to those who have already returned.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for several years, certainly up to three years.  Since it was first put down, the position has changed to some extent.  Up to three years ago, Irish nationals, graduates of our universities and trained here, who took up teaching in Northern Ireland, were not given credit for that service for the purpose of computing incremental increases paid by the Department to secondary teachers.  Since the motion was put down, I am happy to say that the Minister's predecessor saw the light of reason, saw the gross absurdity of treating Northern Ireland, part of our national heritage, as a foreign country as far as our teachers were concerned and rectified to a limited extent that anomaly.</P>
    <P>It is true to say now that our teachers who obtain suitable experience in appropriate secondary schools in Northern Ireland are given limited recognition for incremental purposes when they come back here.  I think the ceiling on that recognition is something like four or five years.  I have been taken a little by surprise tonight and my brief is not as full as I would like it to be but I am sure the recognition given is restricted and is not retrospective. It is fair to say that the concession is a limited one indeed. However, it is better than nothing at all.</P>
    <P>Emigration is a great national problem in this country.  We suffer from what it is now the vogue to call brain drain.  Many of the best of our graduates, particularly our arts graduates, who feel they have a dedication to teaching find it necessary to emigrate and seek work in other countries and in the North of Ireland.  They do that for economic reasons.  Teachers here are badly paid, particularly secondary teachers.  They are amongst that section of the community whose sense of idealism and dedication is taken for granted and abused by the nation at large.  There have been some improvements <Col N="560" /> in recent years but they do not go far enough.</P>
    <P>A graduate of any of our universities who obtains the H.Dip. and takes up teaching in a secondary school will, in his first year, be paid a very modest salary indeed.  He would normally get about £300 a year basic salary from the school but this will be supplemented, if he has the H.Dip., by £200 incremental salary in the first year. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong in this.  In other words, in the first year, he will work for approximately £10 a week, which is substantially less than a labourer's wage. It is true that in the second year the incremental salary increases to £500. At no stage in his career, even after years of service, can it be said that a secondary teacher is justly rewarded by reference to the yardstick of emoluments in other professional employment.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of that.  There is now a growing concern at the neglected state, finance-wise, of education in this country, a growing awareness of the relative meagreness of our investment in education, a growing consciousness of the great productive value of investment in education, a growing concern about these problems which is dawning in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In passing, and because this is the first occasion I have spoken on an educational topic in this Dáil, I should like to extend my congratulations to my colleague from North-East Dublin, Deputy Colley, on his appointment as Minister.  I have great expectations from his Ministry and I hope they will be fulfilled.  I feel that this motion, which caters for this aspect of our educational policy, could give him an opportunity of bringing a fresh outlook to bear on this question.  I would ask him to approach it with a very open mind.  There is a scarcity of certain types of teachers in this country, a scarcity of honours graduates for teaching maths and science in particular. These are the fields of technological education to which we must look for our economic advancement in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> In the circumstances, it seems to me to be quite unreasonable not to draw on the potential source of supply of good teachers from among the ranks of the hundreds of Irish graduates who are working in the teaching profession in Great Britain.  These are graduates who are most anxious to return to this country, men who have spent ten or 12 years in Britain, have married an Irish girl over there, whose children are now growing up and who are most anxious to bring them back to this country for their rearing and schooling. That is a problem we should approach in a compassionate frame of mind&mdash; the problem of the man who wants to come back to his own country to rear his children here in a Christian society. It makes a mockery of all our lamentations about emigration if we say to these people: &ldquo;You are not fit to come.  We want you to come back here and work for buttons.  You start at the bottom of the scale like a green graduate fresh out of university.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quite apart from those considerations, it makes good sense to encourage these people to come back here and to employ them where there are suitable openings.  Our motion is carefully worded.  We are seeking this concession for qualified teachers who have suitable teaching experience in Northern Ireland and Britain.  We are not asking the Minister to make it an open house for unqualified persons, even if they are Irish nationals, to come here.  The Minister can hedge the concession with whatever restrictions he thinks fit. If he would accept the principle that these people are entitled to a chance to return to their native country, he would be doing a good day's work and certainly would be meeting our case.</P>
    <P>Last year, at a meeting of the Education Ministers of Europe, an offshoot of the Council of Europe, a motion was unanimously passed in the presence of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dr. Hillery, which called for free interchangeability of teachers throughout Europe.  Free interchangeability presupposes a state of affairs which makes interchangeability a practical proposition for the individuals concerned.  It presupposes that if an Irishman has worked in suitable conditions <Col N="562" /> in, let us say, France, perhaps teaching English for a few years, and wants to come back here to teach French, he will get credit for his service and will not be at a tremendous financial disability.  It presupposes that if a graduate of one of our universities teaching maths or science in an English grammar school finds an opportunity of coming back here, he will not be put at a financial loss.  It is futile to subscribe to motions like this at the Council of Europe, pious expressions, unless we face up to their economic realities.  I can only presume that, in subscribing to that motion at the Council of Europe, Deputy Hillery, by implication, accepted the desirability of the financial adjustment I speak of.  He has left it up to Deputy Colley to implement the pious aspirations.</P>
    <P>In most professions it is true to say the new graduate gains much from acquiring technical training and experience outside of the environment in which he is going to spend his life. I suppose 95 per cent of the bright young engineers and technicians in Irish industry today have left the university and acquired their technical training outside this country.  I know that companies like English Electric and GEC operate most attractive apprenticeship schemes for graduates and these are availed of on a large scale by our graduates.  They come back to our growing industries and help to put us on our feet.  Applying the same reasoning to the teaching profession, it can truly be said that service outside this country is most certainly not going to do anyone any harm.  If there is any notion abroad that it is going to do harm, then the sooner it is scotched the better.  The cross-fertilisation of ideas is always stimulating.</P>
    <P>At some time in the next decade, we are going to enter a united Europe. Our present identities will be submerged to an extent, and, in a world which is getting smaller every day, it surely makes sense that we should recognise that and act accordingly. Amongst those who would benefit most from this concession are the religious orders, the Irish Christian Brothers, for example, who are more <Col N="563" /> affected, perhaps, than anybody else by the scarcity of good maths and science teachers; should they choose to bring a man back from one of their schools in Liverpool or Glasgow, they are immediately put at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported on this section, the Minister was about to give us some further explanation of subsection (b) and some examples, perhaps, of the type of person to whom it would apply.  In the course of his comments, he remarked that this subsection was intended to widen the scope of the Bill and to make grants available to a greater number of people.  That seems to me to be in conflict with the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle on my amendment which sought to have this subsection deleted.  That amendment was ruled out of order on the ground that it would impose a charge on State funds. Now, either the Ceann Comhairle is right in ruling my amendment out of order or the Minister is wrong.</P>

      <P>I can only deduce from that the Minister's statement must not be correct.  The two things cannot be right.  If this subsection will have the effect the Minister says it will, then my amendment cannot be ruled out.  I should like to hear the Minister say he either accepts or does not accept that.  In my view, this will have the effect of reducing the number of grants that may be made, if these conditions are imposed on top of the conditions set out in subsection (a).  If they can stand apart and are separate from the conditions set out in subsection (a), there is a possibility that they could widen the scope of the grants.  I should like to hear from the Minister examples of the people he has in mind who would be included under subsection (b).  Would he give us specific definitions in relation to the various conditions laid down here or will the interpretation of that be left to certain officials, perhaps one or two officials, in the local authority?  Is there any way in which to tie this up in legislation? I should like the Minister to deal with that before I come back to this table.</P>

      <P>The previous section was referred to as the town and city dwellers' section.  This section is referred to as the farmers' section.  I do not think either description is strictly true.  As I understand the section, if we delete subsection (b), as Deputy Clinton wishes us to do, this would be purely a farmers' section.  Under subsection (b), farmers or industrial workers will be eligible for the grant mentioned in section 15.  An industrial worker living in a rural area will, if he satisfies the conditions in subsection (b), qualify for a grant of £450.  It is at this point I share Deputy Clinton's concern about the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton asked for examples. I shall give an example now that I came across a few days ago.  A farm on which a man worked as a steward <Col N="565" /> and on which he had a house was sold.  He acquired a site for a house on the farm.  Living with him there was an unmarried son, a factory worker, and he put his name to the application form for the grant.  He was notified that he was eligible for a grant of only £300.  That is an example of the type of person who should qualify under subsection (b).  This steward and his family lived on and worked the land all their lives.  Due to circumstances outside their control, they had to get out of the house in which they lived. Now they find, having acquired a site, that they are entitled to only £300 by way of grant.  Perhaps, if the steward had applied in his own name, the situation might have been different, but he is an old man now and apparently it was decided that the son should be the applicant.  I believe these are the people who should qualify under subsection (b).</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he should not deduce from that that I must be wrong.  As I see it, the point objected to by the Deputy and suggested to be deleted is an additional part of the subsection that is intended to bring in more people than were originally announced to be included.  Presumably, he does not want these conditions to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have misunderstood the provision.  That is why I wanted the Minister to explain it.  I was led further up the garden by the decision of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The two are quite consistent.  One is that we are introducing something additional to what was already announced in the earlier stages about these grants, enabling a further number of people to be considered <Col N="566" /> for these higher grants.  The Deputy wants to delete this, and by so doing, leave the matter that it may be interpreted more widely than it is now capable of being interpreted.  In other words, I am prepared to go a bit further than we had intended to go but the Deputy wants to go the whole hog or near it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make representations. It is a case for making representations. Possibly the Minister is right in what he says that this will extend the scope, provided that paragraph (b) is not an additional qualification superimposed on paragraph (a).  We have all asked the Minister to give examples of the people who might come within the scope of paragraph (b), and so far he has not done so.  I want to know also on whose interpretation will it be decided whether a person is in an overcrowded house, a house unfit for human habitation or is in need of housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds?  Who will make that decision?  Is it an official of the Department?  Is it the officials of the local authorities, or is it the chief medical officer who will decide that &ldquo;the circumstances of the person or occupier are such that he could not provide a house for his own occupation without the aid of a grant under this section&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many conditions there, and the conditions are so difficult to determine, that I am greatly afraid they will be used by certain people <Col N="567" /> to deprive of grants a class of people whom the Minister has in mind as being entitled to grants.  I would like him to give us examples of the type of people to whom paragraph (b) would normally apply and if it could be tied up definitely in legislation and not left so much to the discretion of people operating the Bill afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the first and second lines of section 16 (2) which says: &ldquo;Grants under this section shall be made only if, in the opinion of the Minister, the person providing the house....&rdquo; In other words, the person who makes the decision in these cases will be the Minister or his agent, as his officers would ordinarily be regarded. As to the type of person envisaged under paragraph (b), there is an obvious example: a person ordinarily resident in a rural area living in an unfit or overcrowded house.  This seems to be the type of person we are aiming at.  Furthermore, he could be a person in need of housing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds and, this is the really important part, &ldquo;the circumstances of the person or occupier are such that he could not provide a house for his own occupation without the aid of a grant under this section.&rdquo;  It might be better if we looked at this in the reverse direction. We could readily envisage a person living in unfit or overcrowded accommodation but known to be and demonstrated to be well off, much better off than the members of the community among whom he lives.  I do not think we should be liable or compelled by law to give that person a higher grant.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to make one point clear. The position, as I understand it is, first, all this is dependent on the opinion of <Col N="568" /> the Minister.  Secondly, the provisions in subsection (2) (a) are the provisions which govern the provision of houses for farmers and those deriving their livelihood principally from agriculture. Paragraph (b) is the one which applies to those who need not necessarily derive their livelihood from agriculture. In regard to paragraph (b), take a case where a person is qualified under this paragraph on grounds of health, over-crowding or whatever you like.  If he uses his house for the purpose of some business or occupation, is it clear that is not a disqualification, that it is sufficient that it is used ordinarily for purposes of residence, that it will not militate against him that there is a business, a small shop or something of that sort carried on in the premises?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that paragraph (b) has been fairly well clarified now and we know where we stand.  I did not know where I stood up to the present.  I said I would come back to the tables again because I could not get the Minister to see the point I was making, or perhaps he did not wish to see the point.  I made a comparison between the table provided in relation <Col N="569" /> to urban grants and the table now provided in relation to rural grants and I pointed out that there were three columns in the urban grants table and only two in the rural grants table.  I was curious to know why there was not a third column in the latter table, in view of the fact that it would cost a man considerably more if he had to provide water and sewerage services by way of digging a well or providing a septic tank rather than connecting up to local mains passing his gate.  The Minister has not yet explained why this additional amount provided in the case of an urban house is not provided in the case of rural houses.  There is an extra £25 in the urban house grant and there is no such extra amount in the rural grant and no such distinction, although the Minister will have to agree that in a rural area, if water and sewerage services are passing the road where the house is being built, it will cost very much less than if the farmer had to provide these services by way of septic tank or digging a well.  I should like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being facetious when I say that we could easily insert a third column which would have the effect of giving less to those in circumstances where either or both services were publicly provided. Further, it does not follow at all that both services are going to be available in rural parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be rather unusual to find sewerage services near a farmhouse or a rural house, unless they are in some little town. Another point is that frequently, not necessarily in all cases, although there may be a water service and even a sewerage service in some of the areas, it could be that the well at the foot of the garden would be a lot cheaper to provide than it would be to connect. In general, in regard to sewerage, I think the number of cases in which sewerage schemes are readily available would be small.  The number having water may not be small, and there <Col N="570" /> will be a growing number in the years ahead, but in those cases it is unlikely that the majority of them will be so near to the mains or otherwise that it will be much cheaper to connect them than it might be to provide one's own source of supply.  To finish what I started to say, we could easily have the three columns but it would be going backwards.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what is to be the definition of a rural area.  There are many places in the country, and certainly in my constituency there are two, where you would have farmers operating as farmers and rural workers operating as such who are in an urban local area, as, for instance, in the Drogheda local area or the Drogheda borough.  These people cannot get sewerage.  They are not in a rural area such as the area which Louth County Council are administering.  Is there to be a strict definition relating to the local authority area in which people live or is it to be decided upon in regard to how they live themselves or what sort of people they are?  It is a problem we have to think about.</P>

On page 9, at line 20, it says that &ldquo; `rural area' means an area no place in which is within a county borough, borough, urban district, town, or non-municipal town.&rdquo;  We go down then to the point where the general interpretation of this would apply, that in ordinary language the community of 1,000 or over would be the guiding line in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, in the context the Deputy suggests.  Let us go back to sub-paragraph (b) of section 16.  Where the person is &ldquo;ordinarily resident in a rural area&rdquo;, is what is set out there.  Obviously, if he is ordinarily resident in an urban area, he does not and cannot, as a non-farmer, come within the terms of the improved grants.  On the other hand, when I say non-farmer, a farmer at the same time may be in similar circumstances to this non-farmer but proposes to build his house outside the urban area.  He could in those circumstances get the higher grant but the worker who is not ordinarily resident outside the urban area could not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our job on this side of the House is to look after the lowliest member of the population. It is our job to look after these people whether they are few or many.  The Minister is well aware, as he has considerable <Col N="572" /> experience of local authority areas, that in these urban areas there are farmers continuing to farm on land that will never be built on and where these workers or small farmers would if they were outside the urban area be entitled to an extra grant.  They find themselves, because of the unhappy accident of being within the urban area, precluded from such grants.</P>
      <P>Our position, I understand, is that if we put down an amendment on this matter, we may be ruled out of order on the basis of placing an extra charge on the Exchequer.  That may or may not be so, but this has arisen in relation to this Bill already and so we would ask the Minister if he would be prepared himself to insert another subsection in section 16, or anywhere else the draftsman will agree to, covering the circumstances of a person who could produce a certificate from a local authority to the effect that water and sewerage would never be provided on that land and on this certificate, provide an extra grant for a person entitled to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interject? This question of a certificate does not come into the matter at all.  I wonder if the Deputy is pursuing something that has no real meaning?  Nobody in his sane senses could give a certificate that there never would be water or sewerage provided in a certain place or even not provided within a reasonable time.  But it has nothing to do with the qualifications or otherwise of persons for these higher grants whether there would be water or sewerage.  This is not vital at all.</P>

We are precluded from putting down an amendment and having it decided. Therefore we ask the Minister, as is our right, to put it down.  We should like to know what he will say about that.</P>

      <P>My anxiety is in respect of people living as small farmers within an urban area.  They are a rarity but there are such people and we must accept them.  With the extension of urban areas, there may be more of them.  When an urban area is extended, one always finds a bit of <Col N="574" /> a rural area comes in and it may be 25 years before that becomes a suburb of the expanding town.  During that time, you have small farmers, perhaps, carrying on horticultural work of some kind, and just because they are within the urban area, they are precluded from receiving the extra grants.  I do not want any red herrings: I want the Minister to say if he is prepared to meet this type of person.  There are not 200 of them in the whole country and not more than ten or 30 of them would ever build a house.  I want the Minister to consider that for an amendment even at a later stage and see if those who have a small amount of land within an urban area and wish to build a house to live in can get the extra grant proposed under this legislation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give further consideration to the case made by Deputy Donegan? I assure the Minister I appreciate the position he is in.  In these cases it is always difficult to cater for marginal instances that will be put by Deputies. By and large, most of us would prefer that in legislation of any kind, there should be clear-cut definition.  There is a clear-cut definition in this Bill as to what a rural area is.  On the other hand, the point made by Deputy Donegan is an important one.  It is ridiculous when you think of some of the areas on the outskirts of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Take Rathfarnham as an instance. It has developed in recent years very considerably as far as housing by private enterprise is concerned.  The area I am referring to&mdash;I am sure Deputy Clinton is familiar with it&mdash; is a rural area within the definition of this Bill; yet it is now entirely built up and a person, under the provisions of this section, who derived his livelihood from agriculture&mdash;there are a number there&mdash;would be entitled to the increased grant because the area in question is not within a county borough, urban district, town or non-municipal town.  It seems to me that is the kind of case the Minister does not intend to cover but which will be covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, Deputy Donegan is pleading the case the Minister himself would like to see covered by the Bill but which is not covered by the <Col N="578" /> Bill as it stands.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty but I think Deputy Donegan has made a fair case for a handful of people in that situation.  I should be satisfied&mdash;I am sure Deputy Donegan would be also&mdash;if we had an assurance from the Minister that he and his officials would examine this further to see if this handful of cases could be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pose this question to the House?  Assuming we were all of a mind to include this handful of cases, how and for what reason would we justify it?  We would not be taking in the fellow who sweeps the streets in the urban area, not taking in the fellow who minds the car parks, not taking in the fellow who sells icecream in vans in housing estates.  How can we justify taking in the group that is being pleaded for so forcefully here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is under clause (a).  Why should we stop at taking only those who are deriving their livelihood solely and mainly from agriculture, according to clause (a) of this section, when, by moving to the other part, clause (b), we find that all these other people I have mentioned would have at least as good a case as those under (a)?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand that I am not being argumentative when I seek to justify the claims of persons under (a) who earn their living either as agricultural labourers or small farmers as distinct from those he instanced, such as corporation workers who sweep the streets, and other urban workers in an area.  The answer is: the income of the small farmer is accepted as being too low at the present time.  That is why he is being given an extra grant. <Col N="579" /> The income of the farm labourer is accepted as being too small.  Whether we are farmers or not, we accept the fact that we would like to pay farm labourers considerably more.  A man sweeping the streets has an urban wage.  In many cases in my constituency, he is one of the lowest paid of the urban workers but he, nevertheless, has an urban wage and is expected to pay for a corporation or urban council house something in the region of £2 a week if there is no differential rents scheme.  I, like the Minister, am in favour of differential rents but most local authorities do not find a majority of their members of that opinion.  That must have conditioned the extra grants the Minister is giving for housing in rural areas.  He realised that the sort of money that would have to be paid, if there were not an extra grant, would be just too much for the agricultural labourer and small farmer.</P>
      <P>My view is that the man who has £10 or £11 a week can validly be rehoused in a corporation or urban council house at a higher rent.  The man who is a farm labourer or small farmer could not pay this charge if he did not get the extra grant.  The extra grant in most instances comes to a total of £300 because there is a full supplementary grant also from the local authority.  Therefore, the question is simply and solely a question of money and we can justify the payment of this extra grant to a farm labourer with perhaps less than £8 a week, while we cannot justify its being paid to a man with £10 or £11 a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on what is really wrong.  An urban resident, on a rural agricultural worker's wage, with the big or the small grant and no supplementary grant, cannot possibly afford to build himself a house in an urban area and should be housed by the local authority and on a differential rent that he can afford.  If you put that fellow in that position, you might as well put a stone around his neck and drown him.</P>

In Drogheda Corporation, there is an extra grant of a sum equal to that paid by the State&mdash;at the moment it is a maximum of £300; in the Louth County Council area and Dundalk County Council area, there is not.  If the Minister went this far for those people, it might be a further incentive, not that the incentives have worked too well in certain instances, for the urban authority to give a supplementary grant.  The Minister cannot frame legislation on the basis that local authorities have not done what he and I agree should be done, namely, institute a supplementary grants system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the other side to this that, if as has been instanced, an urban worker with £10 or £11 a week is the responsibility of the local authority within whose jurisdiction he lives and because of the fact that he has £10 or £11 a week, can afford to pay the rent struck by that local authority whereas the man with £3 a week less cannot afford to pay it, it is ludicrous to talk about providing incentives to the lesser paid to build his own house in that locality.

If that is possible under the sky in a rural area, it is just as possible under the sky in an urban area.  With the goodwill of the farmer, the goodwill of the relative who has a site and the hard work of the applicant who goes out to get £900 in grants at £7 5s. 6d. principal and interest per £100 borrowed, he can build a house that he owns and a better house than would be provided by Louth County Council or Cork County Council or any other county council as a county council cottage.</P>

If, without this piece of legislation, they build a house a foot larger in floor area, they would be entitled to the same grant under section 15.  There is one square foot in the difference but they are entitled to the £175 if they build it that extra foot. On that ground, I say it is unnecessary and that it will lead to the building of houses that will have very limited use.</P>
      <P>This section seems to be designed to induce a farmer who is getting on in years to build substandard accommodation for himself so that he can move out and let his son carry on with the farm.  That would be very desirable, if there was nothing to prevent him getting this grant already under legislation which has been in existence since 1948.  The only case not covered in these subsections is where the Land Commission comes in to buy the house.  If that happens, the Land Commission should be obliged to provide alternative accommodation for the old people.  They should provide alternative accommodation, plus whatever they give for moving out, or include these benefits as a right.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this is an unnecessary section which gives the impression that a new set of benefits is being provided and, in my view, there are no new or additional benefits here at all.  If there are, I would like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what additional grants or benefits are provided.  I know that it will make it possible to get £175 for building one room but surely that is inducing people to go to live in very substandard conditions in their old age, which is the time when they need extra comforts.  If this provision were being made for urban areas, there would be a great deal of criticism, if there were not central heating.  Central heating is one of the things doctors say are needed for old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These substandard buildings will not be suitable for anybody else.  If you were providing under this section a house that might be suitable afterwards for a farm labourer and his family, <Col N="584" /> you would be providing a national asset, but here you will have an idle dwelling that will be unfit for any family.  It could be described as another Fianna Fáil white elephant.</P>

      <P>This is a new provision.  Heretofore you could get a grant of £175 for the provision of a three-roomed dwelling with a minimum floor area of 500 square feet. Under this provision a house of up to a floor area of 500 square feet will be sufficient to get the grant.  It is intended for the young fellow starting off in the home place who wants to make provision for his father and mother.  Under the 1948 legislation, he could get a grant of £175 but the minimum floor area had to be 500 square feet; now he can get it for less than 500 square feet.</P>

These people are getting on in years and they want some accommodation for the remainder of their time.  If they are prepared to settle in a house with a floor area of under 500 square feet, they can have that house built and qualify for a grant of £175.  This is a new provision. It certainly cannot take from the scheme in any way.  It has nothing whatever to do with section 15.  Under section 15 the minimum floor area is 500 square feet.  Under this, it can be 350 or 500 square feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister is trying to do, that is, to make it as easy as possible for an old couple to leave their house and farm to the son coming after them.  There is no doubt that this is a human problem. Some old people have sufficient accommodation to bring the new daughter into the family and live happily under the same roof; but the new woman often prefers to be in a house on her own.  Perhaps the Minister would consider extending this plan to cover extra accommodation on an existing farm by the addition of a couple of rooms and, perhaps, a kitchen?  In this way they could be all under the same roof.  Perhaps the newly-married couple would agree to live in the small new dwelling <Col N="586" /> for a number of years.  Then, by agreement, the old people would get out of the house and switch with the son when his family increases.  I would like to see them all under the same roof.  I would like to see the necessary money provided so that the premises could be extended to accommodate both families.  Perhaps the Minister would examine those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Deputy Healy has made an excellent suggestion.  This proposal had practically nothing to recommend it up to now, but now it has something.  The Minister should seriously consider it.  If the conditions of this section could be fulfilled by the addition of a couple of rooms to the existing dwelling, or at least the provision of an inter-connecting passage way or door, it would be a matter of great importance.  There is no doubt that most elderly people require some attention. If they could get that minimum attention, daily perhaps, they could live without having to go into a hospital or other institution.  That would be much more desirable.  This accommodation, that would otherwise be useless, could be used as additional accommodation for the son's family as they grew up. Personally, I should like to support Deputy Healy in this suggestion and I hope that the Minister will consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is primarily concerned with the provision of a dower house.  I would agree with Deputy Healy and Deputy Clinton.  The suggestion of a dower house originated many years ago in order to encourage early marriages in Ireland.  I have experience of one dower house that was built voluntarily at the time as an experiment, without any subvention from State or local authority funds. Being associated with housing over a number of years, I took a keen interest in it.  Some years after it was built, I went to see the old couple and asked them how they liked their new house. The answer I got disappointed me very much.  They felt they were cut off too much, even though they were within 200 yards of the old residence.  The old woman said: &ldquo;It is only a little bit better than the county home.&rdquo;  They <Col N="587" /> preferred to be within the walls of the old dwelling.  The occupants of that dower house eventually finished up by going back to the old home.  As time went on, the new couple were blessed with a family and the old people went back as grandparents to rear the children.</P>
      <P>There is a social problem here and I think Deputy Healy's suggestion is an excellent one.  The Minister should consider making provision for the addition of two or three rooms to the old dwelling.  I would give them a choice.  This is something we would all wish to see coming into operation. At the same time, I am in agreement with the section.</P>
      <P>I think there is a bit of confusion in regard to the point Deputy Clinton was making which dealt with a different matter.  In respect of the three-roomed type of house we have been building in rural Ireland, there has always been a minimum floor area of 500 square feet to qualify.  I would ask the Minister to give every attention to the point made by Deputy Healy, but, at the same time, I should like to have the section as it stands given a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the other point of view.  There is very great strength in the arguments put forward by Deputy Healy, Deputy Clinton and Deputy Collins with regard to a grant for the addition of rooms and flats to existing houses. Generally speaking, the idea contained in this section is a good idea, but, while there is great force in the point of view expressed by the three Deputies, while I would like to see that provision contained in the section, we would strengthen the legislation if at the same time we permitted the building of a house of this type, even on another holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two different sets of circumstances that can arise.  One is the set of circumstances about which Deputy Collins spoke, where the old couple, having gone to a dower house, found themselves cut away, unhappy, and eventually went back into the old <Col N="588" /> homestead.  There is also the set of circumstances which can arise where the old couple would prefer to go away to a different part of the country or county.  It is unduly restrictive in this section to provide that the grant will only be given provided they build on the same holding.  I do not think it would weaken the section, or the thinking behind the section, if it were to be provided that the grant would be available on a house of this type without necessarily restricting the building of it to the particular holding. I agree that in the vast majority of cases the situation is that described by the last two speakers, where the old couple would like to stay as near the homestead as possible.  Those probably are, as I say, the vast majority of cases, but there are the other cases and I do not think these should be cut out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things we have to keep in mind is why, by and large, there is likely to be a demand for dower houses or separate homesteads for the old people, or the not so old these days, when a young couple, a son and his bride, take up residence in the original home.  In most cases, the older woman and the young bride do not hit it off.  Is that not the real reason why semi-detached or detached accommodation must be provided for the old people?  It is a problem of incompatibility as between two people, one of whom, by tradition and practice, feels she is entitled to insist that the house must be kept in the way in which she kept it and the other of whom feels that, as a new broom, she must sweep clean.  That is the basic problem in the majority of cases.  The addition of a couple of rooms to the original homestead will not solve the problem and the idea of the dower house is to obviate the unpleasantness that can arise because of incompatibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases, of course, in which there is no incompatibility.  The older woman is of great assistance to the younger woman, does not insist on her way of doing things and takes it for granted that the young woman will step into her shoes.  Where that is the case, a reconstruction grant for the purpose <Col N="589" /> of providing additional accommodation solves the problem.  It must be remembered that if there is intercommunication, then the dwellings are not separate.</P>
    <P>The basic idea here is a dower house for the old people, a completely separate dwelling suited to their needs. The idea is to abandon the requirement of 500 square feet minimum. It has been said that nothing worth while can be built under 500 square feet.  Take a room of 160 square feet and another of 150, and add a little bit for a scullery, and you are still under 500 square feet.  This is to cater for a relatively small number of people wishing to have a separate dwelling as distinct from an addition to an existing dwelling.  Where an addition is required, the reconstruction grants will take care of that.  If a bigger house is required&mdash;three rooms, four rooms, five rooms, or six rooms&mdash;the grants available under existing law will cater for that situation.  Where it is sought to have the old people in very close proximity to the original homestead, or actually living in an addition to the homestead, I certainly undertake to look into that to see whether or not reconstruction grants are suitable and capable of application.  We provide the grants.  I shall certainly look into this from the point of view of those who may want to have some structure built up against the original homestead but without being internally connected, but I shall retain the basic idea of a separate detached dwelling, with no specification as to the distance that dwelling must be from the original homestead.  All we say is that it must be on the holding.</P>

      <P>There are those few things which require to be looked at. A great deal of what has been said here can more readily be catered for under the reconstruction section, with some amendment, if necessary, rather than by broadening this to take in everything that has been referred to.  It should be remembered that this section is designed to help the erection of a small house, smaller than normally accepted, for people in special circumstances and that anything beyond that falls in naturally under the normal grants system.  If a grant of £175 is given in this special case, undoubtedly the relationship of the grant to the total cost is more favourable than it will be when a house is built at greater cost and gets the same grant.</P>

Therefore, in regard to supplementary grants, we measure them according to what we know is happening under existing legislation, without having regard to the forward sections in the Bill which make it possible for supplementary grants to be paid in respect of dower houses, if the local authority think fit.</P>

      <P>Section 26.  We are putting in a special section to deal with a limited class and going where we have never gone before.  If such matters as building on to the existing house, connecting to the existing house, can be catered for, it is better to cater for them by maintaining the reconstruction section rather than taking away the principle we are standing for here, that is, special grants for dower houses under 500 square feet for people in special circumstances, and I will consider that very fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I would like to press on the Minister <Col N="592" /> is not to make this section unduly restrictive.  The idea enshrined in this section is a good one and it would be a pity if it broke down because the Minister makes it too restrictive.  I can think of a number of cases&mdash;I am sure most of my colleagues in the House could also think of them&mdash; where it would suit the retiring couple not to build their dower house on the holding.  That may arise because the holding does not lend itself conveniently to the erection of a second house, even a very small second house.  It can arise because of family circumstances where, as is normal enough, the family have grown up and different members of the family have gone to various parts of the country.  It may suit the retiring couple, instead of building their dower house on the holding adjoining that of the last member of the family who remains on, to go down and live near another member of the family in a different part of the country.  In that kind of case, the provisions of this section should also apply.  If a house of this type is built, even though it is on a different holding in another part of the country, the retiring couple or retiring person should not be precluded from getting the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add to Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion about not having restrictive conditions in the section.  In rural Ireland where the eldest boy of the family reaches marriageable age, it is proper that he should get married, but the father and mother are still on the farmstead and might still have other children under 21 years of age.  That being so, it is not possible for the father to sign the farm over to the eldest boy as is traditional.  If the eldest boy reaches marriageable age and has no prospects of getting the farm, he might threaten to go somewhere else, which would be against the family tradition.  The point I want the Minister to consider is that if a dower house is built, there should be no restriction on the eldest boy and his wife living in that house until such time as the farm is signed over to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has <Col N="593" /> agreed to reconsider the situation as to whether a semi-detached arrangement might be acceptable to him or whether this could be provided under the reconstruction grant in some suitable form.  Deputy O'Higgins has made a case that also merits the Minister's consideration.  Very often there is a favourite member of the family and he might not be the person who is going to live on in the household.  The retiring couple might prefer to live beside that member of the family who is near the village.  Surely the same purpose is served if that dower house accommodation is provided near the more favoured member of the family? The only point the Minister has made against that is that it would not be there for future generations but it would be there for the use and enjoyment of somebody, and that is the important thing.  Even if it had to be provided again on a future occasion, the cost is not enormous.  The Minister should accept that it would be reasonable that this type of accommodation must not be definitely provided on the holding itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention the supplementary grant aspect of this.  I presume it will be permissible for the local authority to give the complete supplementary grants up to pound for pound as they so desire, but most local authorities have a means test in the case of new houses, and these will be new houses. Is it permissible for the local authority to have no means test supplementary grants in this case?  I should like to see that when the old couple are prepared to transfer the farmhouse to a member of the family, at least they would be able to get the full supplementary grant without a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to make is in connection with the semi-detached house.  There is a lot to be said, if the parties concerned are so desirous, for allowing them to get the dower house grants by building a semi-detached house.  In some cases farmhouses may be rather small.  They would probably be all right for the old couple living there at the moment, but if they build <Col N="594" /> a dower house which is separate and the young married couple move in to the existing house, it may be that after a number of years the couple will have to think about extending the farmhouse. By that time the father or mother may be dead and the dower house, which perhaps was built separately from the original house, may be vacant.  Would it not be a good thing to have this extra accommodation available, extra accommodation which, at the time when it is needed, may not be occupied for the original purpose for which it was built?  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider allowing this section of the Bill to cover a semi-detached building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for drawing my attention to the fact that section 26 does include grants under section 16.  I could not agree with Deputy Cunningham in regard to semi-detached houses.  If a semi-detached house is built, it does not qualify for a new housing grant and therefore the house would come under a reconstruction grant which could be greater, which could be £280. Possibly that might be the way to do it but those of us who travel around the country and meet people realise that a lot of annoyance can be caused by what is described as two women under one roof.  It would be a mistake if this House encouraged the building of dower houses&mdash;call them what you like&mdash;for old people to live in, almost on the same floor as the young married couple.  Most people realise that a lot of trouble can be caused by old people living too close to married sons or daughters.  If the house is being built, it should be some distance away from the holding, if the son or father has a separate holding.  I think the idea is a good one.  Many people tell me that they would like to give the eldest son, or the son on the farm, the old house if they could find somewhere to live themselves.  Many people are unable to do that.  The provisions in the Bill will enable this but we should not encourage building on the same doorstep.</P>

      <P>Where the house should be built should be left open. For many reasons, probably for health reasons, the old couple might prefer to live in a semi-detached house, convenient to the young married son or daughter.  To be quite honest, I think that these family rows do not exist until the couple get married.  If the house was built prior to the marriage, the row would probably never arise. For that reason, it would be advisable to give them the option.  There may only be one of the couple left after a short period and he or she will probably be a heart case or suffering from something else and would like to be living either a reasonable distance from the married son or daughter, or perhaps under the same roof.  If the Minister considers building dower houses and giving grants, he should leave it open as to where they should build, but each case will have to be judged on its own merits.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 23 and No. 24 can be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) For the purpose of this section `dwelling' means a house or part of a house, used or intended to be used as a separate dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is straightforward and simple.  I felt it was necessary to remove any misunderstanding which might arise in the absence of such a subsection.  I feel sure the Minister will readily agree that it is a desirable subsection. The first part of this section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to such regulations as may be made by the Minister for the purposes of this section, make, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, <Col N="596" /> a grant to a body providing (whether by erection, purchase, reconstruction or conversion), with the approval of the Minister, one or more than one house for the accommodation of elderly persons.</P>
    <P>It says &ldquo;one or more than one house&rdquo;. It is difficult to understand why it does not say &ldquo;one or more dwellings&rdquo; because further down it refers to &ldquo;each separate dwelling&rdquo;.  I have in mind reconstruction or conversion. You could provide in the same house perhaps two or three or more dwellings and that is why I wanted to ensure that this would be qualified and that we will know exactly what we are talking about.  I wanted to ensure that such a reconstruction or conversion would qualify for this grant and that if it qualified, at least it would have minimum standards.  I consider that minimum standards for this type of accommodation would be 500 square feet.  I will say no more until I hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as I understand it, seeks to define &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>And on that basis I do not think it is necessary and might even be dangerous for the reason that the section as operated enables grants to be provided for each separate dwelling in a house.  Acceptance of this amendment might confuse the existing situation since grants for elderly persons' accommodation would generally be paid for dwellings which might have common facilities.  They might have one diningroom, one lounge and so on.  The definition sought by way of the amendment, far from being necessary to improve the situation, could lead to a restriction in that we might knock out those units which would have common dining, kitchen or lounge areas.  A definition of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; might preclude what, in practice, is allowed.  The practice is not long established but it is there and we do pay grants for separate dwellings where common facilities are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point that one subsection <Col N="597" /> of the section mentions &ldquo;house&rdquo; and the other mentions &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;, that seems at first confusing, but in fact while talking about a house, we were discussing it in the context that it may contain several dwellings such as referred to in subsection (2) of section 19.  The reference to &ldquo;house&rdquo; is to what we might call the building, as the house may be divided, except that house is defined in section 2 of the Bill already passed and under the definition, the house or building referred to there is a building within which several dwellings for the purposes of this section may be contained as a result of construction or conversion.</P>

Should not people have some advance information as to what exactly is in the Minister's mind as qualifying as a dwelling?  The Minister has spoken of common dining facilities and certain facilities used in common generally in the house and which might be desirable as an economy, but is it not necessary to have some indication of what would be regarded as the minimum standard for a dwelling?</P>

If we were to try to put everything into it, we might do what I am accused of doing, tie ourselves up too tightly. <Col N="598" /> The administration of this will have to be covered by regulations rather than by written law passed by the House because we want some freedom to meet changing circumstances which we would want to meet and which would be needed to meet cases we could not now even envisage but which might merit consideration in the future.</P>

Any Minister for Local Government may not be infallible in choosing the approved bodies and may pick a wrong one now and again.  Even if that did happen, we are still not in the wilderness because the regulations which would govern this whole operation would set out for interested bodies seeking approval of a proposal the broad conditions under which they would get grants and one of the conditions would be related to the rents that might be charged to occupiers of these dwellings.  In other words, we would say: &ldquo;If you are going to charge exorbitant rents, you will have to build yourselves.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if grants will be given for this purpose to charitable or philanthropic organisations who do not own the property or will not own it when the grants are being paid or when the house is completed?  If an old couple are living in a dilapidated house of their own, can the grant be paid to the organisation that will undertake to have either a small new house built for the couple or the existing house repaired for those who cannot do it for themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in reply to Deputy Mullen, without tying myself or anybody who comes after me so that they cannot move at all because of my statement in this House, is that luxury flat building for this or any other type of person is not welcome, so far as applications for grants are concerned, to say the least.  In our operations up to the moment, we have refused grants in certain cases of the luxury type or the high rent type of case Deputy Mullen has mentioned.  Even though our experience is very limited, we have come up against that and we have refused grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel most of this accommodation will be provided by the building of new houses.  A number of local authorities have in mind at the present time the building of new houses for elderly people and in conjunction with that, the provision of home nursing services of some description. Therefore, it is extremely desirable that written into the Bill we should have a minimum standard for <Col N="600" /> new houses.  The Minister may consider it undesirable to have a standard specified in the case of reconstructed or converted houses, and I agree with him, but in the case of new houses specifically provided for elderly people, it is extremely desirable we should lay down minimum standards.  If we are to provide suitable accommodation for old people, we must look a little ahead and make provision for some sort of central heating.  If old people go into a home, they get central heating immediately as one of the most important requirements to keep old people alive and healthy.  In those circumstances, the grant of £300 being provided here is much less than generous.  In providing accommodation for elderly people, we may for many reasons have to consider ground floor accommodation because of the various ailments they suffer from.  This form of accommodation may require fairly expensive equipment if our old people are to be given reasonable comfort and kept out of homes and institutions.</P>
      <P>It is there we shall save money.  I would appeal to the Minister to do two things.  In the case of new dwellings for old people, he should lay down minimum specifications.  He should also give a good deal more consideration to the amount of the grant and decide, if possible, to increase that grant in order to provide the facilities old people require and are entitled to.</P>

      <P>Most Deputies will regard this as being one of the most important sections in the Bill.  It opens up new opportunities for housing our elderly people and the Minister deserves our congratulations for including it in the Bill.  Not alone will the State give £300 per dwelling but the local authority will give the same amount.  Deputy Mullen mentioned control of rents.  Anticipating the enactment of this legislation, there are six bodies in Dublin city negotiating with the corporation to provide dwellings for elderly people.  One of them is the Catholic Housing Society and the other is a Methodist Church body.  I do not think either can be accused of charging too much rent for dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> Have we here a definition of &ldquo;elderly&rdquo;?  Is there an actual age limit? Must a person be very old or middleaged? During the dangerous building crisis in Dublin, we had some difficulty in deciding who was elderly.  We decided the age should be 60 years but when the situation became very bad, we reduced it to 50 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to the Bill, we are now enabled to treat our elderly people very well.  Deputy Clinton does not think a grant of £300 sufficient. Perhaps he forgot that the local authority will contribute a similar amount.  I again congratulate the Minister on introducing this section into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of what Deputy Moore said prompts me to rise again. He spoke of the type of organisation who have set out to build houses for elderly people.  They are praiseworthy organisations.  I am familiar with the efforts of the Catholic Housing Society.  The cost to them of providing accommodation for elderly people is far higher than the £600 in grants referred to by the Deputy.  It costs £1,500 per house at least.  One organisation with which I am familiar as a trade unionist contributed £1,500 to provide housing accommodation for one person under this scheme.  In that context, surely it is obvious the amount of the grant being provided here is too small?  When I referred earlier to the builders of luxury flats, I had not in mind people with no money.  I was indicating that I did not like to see a situation in which people could get on a particular wagon to make money. I am sure the Minister will take these matters into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton has a very good point about this maximum grant of £300.  If the Minister cannot see his way now to increase the figure, could he not acquire authority through this <Col N="602" /> Bill to give him an opportunity of increasing the amount in the future? Who knows what the cost of building will be next year?  These are things we must now take into consideration. A grant of £300 now may not be worth £150 in the near future.  This section was conceived with a view to encouraging and helping the provision of accommodation for elderly people.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on this section which gives an incentive to charitable bodies to cater for old people.  In Cork, a charitable organisation have set about building a home where 20 old people can be accommodated.  I can assure the House we could not have embarked on this scheme without the aid of this grant.  In Cork, the local authority have provided 40 ground floor flats for old people.  This, in turn, helps to ease the housing situation considerably because there were old people living in houses with three and four bedrooms and it is now the policy of the corporation to build these maisonettes and urge such people to leave their three-bedroomed houses and take up residence in these small dwellings.  The move has been very successful.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell me if by &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; or &ldquo;house&rdquo;, he means a one-roomed, two-roomed or three-roomed building because I do not want to see someone or other setting up a number of single-roomed buildings such as we have in a number of areas already where old people were persuaded to leave three or four-roomed houses and were told that they would get a modern flat.  That modern flat turned out to consist of a one-roomed place with a bed and a fireplace and a very small bathroom off it where they could wash up their kitchen utensils.  I do not want that kind of thing to be set down as the policy of this House in 1965 and there is a great danger that something like that will develop out of this.  The question as to whether these flats or maisonettes are to be one-roomed, two-roomed or three-roomed should be set down in the section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen referred to the cost of building one of these and I must say he is correct when he puts the cost at £1,500.  The Minister may have in mind the provision of such flats in existing dwellings, and perhaps that can be done; but we should remember, when we speak of a grant of £300, with another of £300 by way of supplementary grant from the local authority on the basis of pound for pound, that all local authorities do not give these supplementary grants.  It was only recently that in my constituency of Meath the county council decided to pay the supplementary grants for the urban councils which were unable to pay them.  The Minister must let us know what he means by &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; so that we will not have the kind of thing that has been referred to.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have already dealt with the first of these amendments and as to the second, I must say that I would not agree with Deputy Clinton in legislating for a minimum floor area of 500 square feet, while <Col N="605" /> at the same time I would agree with Deputy Tully that the other extreme is worse.  What we seem to get away from is the fact that we would hope to have more and more of our old people living in their own little homes rather than in institutions. If we are to do that, we must have the greatest possible scope within which this accommodation can be erected. It has been said that floor space of 500 square feet would be an embarrassment for old people but I will go so far with Deputy Tully as to say that I am not going to allow the pigeonholing of our old people.</P>
      <P>What I want to say is that we are talking too much about our old people and doing too little about them.  I am not throwing that at anybody but this is true.  If we can in any way meet the objections or the views of the House, we will go into the matter between now and the next appropriate Stage. Let us make up our minds to get on with the intention underlying the section in a positive way.  In that regard it is no harm to say that even at this stage, little momentum though this effort has gained, we have contributed to 300 of these old people's dwellings to date.  The demand for grants for this type of dwelling is only now getting under way and I envisage an upsurge in that demand and a great deal of headway being made in this direction in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I am trying to avoid tying ourselves unnecessarily here by declaring that no one-room dwelling will be provided in any circumstances or that nothing under 500 square feet <Col N="606" /> will be provided.  I do not believe that that type of restriction is suited to the problem which, for the first time, we are beginning to grapple with and in connection with which we have a great deal to learn, although there is a great deal of experience in other countries to be drawn on.  In other countries a great deal has been done, not all of it successful.  A great deal of work has been done in other countries at great expense that it would be better if it had never been done.  It is not because of single rooms.  That is not the only fault or the only mistake made.</P>

      <P>There is no intention to pin the Minister down but he must have had something in mind when he inserted the section and the £300 must be related to something.  It is not a figure drawn out of the air.  I, like the Minister, would not care to define now what exactly a dwelling for elderly persons should be but I would certainly agree with Deputy Tully in a general condemnation of the establishment of homes consisting of one room and maybe a toilet and a little scullery.  I would imagine that the Minister has in mind, say, a living room, a bedroom, or maybe two bedrooms, a bathroom and scullery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I repeat what I have said? If the Minister could give us a rough indication of what he had in mind, I personally, and I think I talk for my colleagues in this, would be prepared to say: &ldquo;Right; if later on you think you should specify minimum standards by way of regulation, I do not think there is anything wrong in that.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Tully would be entitled to suspect&mdash;although I would not believe it&mdash;that the Minister may condone in certain circumstances the establishment of one-room dwellings for elderly people.  Let him give us a rough idea, say, living room, bedroom, scullery and toilet.  If he did that, he would certainly allay any fears we may have that there would be exploitation in this business because, if grants of £300 are to be given <i>ad lib</i> to bodies&mdash; and I exclude the bodies which have been referred to by Deputies on both sides, which are purely charitable organisations&mdash;there could be a body <Col N="607" /> established, ostensibly to provide homes for elderly people, that might make substantial profit out of it.  Therefore, the Minister should give us a rough idea of what he has in mind and I certainly would be prepared to trust him if he went a little further and said that he would not rule out entirely one-room dwellings.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It has emerged from this discussion that recently 300 houses for old people have been constructed.  It also appears from what Deputy Wyse from Cork has told us that 40 of the houses&mdash;you could not call them houses&mdash;call them hovels&mdash;that have been built in the city of Cork consist of one room each. Everybody in the House agrees that accommodation consisting of one room in which a person has to sleep, eat, cook, wash and spend the rest of his existence is not suitable accommodation for anybody.  It is certainly not accommodation for an old person and it would be a retrograde step to pass legislation in 1965 which would accept as a standard of accommodation meeting with the approval of the Department of Local Government accommodation consisting of one room.  The House is now entitled to a clear statement from the Minister as to whether he thinks that in any circumstances a building consisting of one solitary room is up to the required standard for the accommodation of elderly people or an elderly person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be realistic about this.  We are dealing with old people and we are dealing with charitable and philanthropic organisations. We have here the city aspect where it is suggested by Deputy Clinton that these houses should be centrally heated. Well and good, if that can be done, it is desirable.  It is desirable to have a bathroom and toilet, yes.  It is desirable, as Deputy Corish has said, and to be highly recommended, that these houses, whether they be reconstructed houses or new houses, should have a bedroom or two bedrooms together with kitchen and living room.  We all know the position in the country where you have an old person or an <Col N="608" /> old couple living in what is a tumbledown shack, and there are some of them left.  It might have been at one time a three-room house but as of now there is one room left.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society or some such organisation is interested.  The person or couple concerned have no money whatsoever and cannot ever afford to pay any money as a contribution towards what should be done. The charitable organisation must provide all the money except for the grants which the Minister is enabling the Department and the local authority to pay out.  So it is purely a question of providing an <i>ad hoc</i> relief for those people which in the case of an old man of 80 will last for his lifetime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think he will be the first man to admit he made a cardinal error.  When he reads the Report, and this is one he will want to read, he will not believe he said the shocking things he did say.  Deputy Corish put his finger on it when he said that to an old man, his 81st year is just as important as his 21st.  It is a lot of cod to suggest that, when people are old and unable to look after themselves, we should be entitled to put them away into some sort of box because they have not sufficient money to pay for themselves.  Deputy Cunningham used the word &ldquo;substandard&rdquo;. If somebody is getting charity, he cannot complain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the county homes are concerned&mdash;a number of them are known by other names at present&mdash;some of them are doing an excellent job and they are very comfortable.  The only thing wrong is that they have recently become very overcrowded.  We know the reason why, but I will not go into that now.  We are trying to impress on the Minister that he should not allow even charitable organisations to erect dwellings with a livingroom-cum-bedroom in which the door can be pushed back only a foot or two because the <Col N="610" /> bed is behind it and within four feet of it is the fire on which they are supposed to do their cooking.  It is in this room they must entertain any friends. If that type of dwelling is being built with the aid of the Department's £300, I believe the Minister is making a mistake.  I agree that Deputy Clinton's suggestion for a minimum of 500 square feet is too high a standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think slightly more than half that floor space would be better.  The one thing the Minister should stamp out is any attempt by the charitable organisations to introduce these one-roomed dwellings for people because they are poor.  The same is being done by local authorities although they are not mentioned here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no bathroom or hallway.  You can get very near 400 square feet and still have very little accommodation.  What I am aiming at in both these amendments is a minimum and to ensure this minimum will not be a box room. I am afraid that is what we will get if we do not lay down minimum standards.  We have got single room accommodation in Cork already, and I should like to know what contribution the Minister has made towards those dwellings.  I know a good room might represent an enormous improvement in the living conditions the old people had previously.  Nevertheless, we must safeguard society against this sort of thing.  If not, the old people will be put into a cell and forgotten <Col N="611" /> about.  We should show our interest in them and our appreciation of the fact that, if we put them into an institution, it will cost anything up to £20 a week to keep them.  It costs £17 10s. a week for a child in a public ward today.</P>
      <P>These are the considerations I had in mind when I asked for a minimum standard.  I would be prepared to see that reduced to 400 square feet.  If the Minister thought that should be done, I would be agreeable, but I certainly would not be agreeable that it should be brought down to one room.  I should like to hear from the Minister what contribution he made in respect of the rooms in Cork.  What does this £300 provided here relate to?  Surely there must be some standard to indicate where the £300 is going?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What conditions are they living in now?  Because we have a fair idea is no reason why we should not improve the position.  Under this section we are dealing with approved bodies or bodies that may seek to be approved philanthropic and charitable bodies.  We are not dealing with local authorities who may seek to avail of the new incentives.  That will be dealt with in another Part of the Bill.  This section deals purely with the provision by approved bodies of houses for the elderly.  In no case will any body be given grants if there is the slightest evidence that they are going to make money on the grants.</P>
      <P>In regard to the provision of one-roomed cells and so on, you could have the cells, the jailers rattling the keys and so on; but when we talk about one room, we must remember that communal services such as relaxation and reading rooms, diningrooms, toilet and bath facilities will also be provided, in addition to the one room which will be a livingroom-cum-bedroom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health come into this.  I hope they will enter into it even more in the future by the provision of certain grants through the health authority to furnish these rooms after these houses and apartments have been provided, either by the local authority or by any of the other bodies, and that they will further help by providing visiting and nursing services and the various other facilities these old people will require which could not properly be provided through a Housing Act, through the Department of Local Government, or through the housing authority in any area.</P>
      <P>When we talk about rooms, it is in that context that I think of rooms, and I ask the House not to seek to exclude that type of provision and, therefore, that type of accommodation. I am not asking the House to approve of it, or to specify whether it is desirable, or a complete answer to the problem.  All I ask the House is not to exclude that type of accommodation. We are dealing with a situation which has never been grappled with hitherto. The old are increasing in number. We may have a problem to solve, a problem which little or nothing was done to resolve up to this.  Are we going to tie ourselves here in such a way as to prohibit our doing anything to alleviate the lot of these old people? Many of them are living in appalling conditions.  Very few bother about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary organisations are interesting themselves in this problem.  They are trying to do something for these people.  They collect funds and with these funds, plus the grants from the local authority and the Government, they can buy a house.  Voluntary workers&mdash;professional men and skilled tradesmen&mdash;carry out reconstruction and thereby provide really good accommodation for some of these old people.  I am not saying the accommodation provided in this way is ideal, <Col N="613" /> but we cannot hope for the ideal since we have not yet made a start even in trying to discover what would be the ideal accommodation and the ideal treatment for the aged.</P>
    <P>This is a matter, indeed, about which we should think.  Let us get on now with the work of helping the voluntary bodies with these grants, ensuring, of course, that there are no abuses, no rent-racketeering, no ill-treatment of the aged and the elderly.  It is, indeed, most unlikely there would be any abuses because these bodies are philanthropic organisations, not commercial concerns.  When these put up a scheme, we will vet it and then give the appropriate grants.  I can assure the House that in every case the money spent will be in excess of the amount of money from the local authority or from the State.</P>

      <P>What I am more anxious about is what Deputy Tully is after, where we provide these units in isolation in the vicinity of people's own homes where they have lived all their lives and the only place where they will be really happy.  I have seen these people in institutions so often; they are well looked after but they have no interest in anything around them and are just waiting to die.  That is something I want to get away from.  I should like to hear from the Minister what minimum standards he has in mind where this type of accommodation is provided in isolation, not the communal type of accommodation described by Deputy Wyse.</P>

      <P>Section 14 gives the Minister all the necessary powers and authority to make regulations as suggested by Deputies.  In this regard again we are probably taking too literally the matter of housing the elderly on this section when it relates only to the activity of one group of people, the voluntary bodies who are being enticed to come forward to do the job which we and the local authorities have failed to do.  In doing that, we must not hold out a stick to them and say: &ldquo;If you do this job, you must beware; otherwise, I can catch you out on any of the sections.&rdquo;  That is not the intention here.  We are endeavouring to harness the energy and enthusiasm of these bodies by the device of offering them certain grants because it is work about which they know a great deal, due to their activity in other spheres of social work in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to setting up minimum standards, Deputy Clinton has put his fears more specifically in regard to the provision of a single detached unit for an elderly person or an elderly couple and asks what is the minimum we hope to provide.  I would think it would be the couple of rooms, the bathroom and the cooking facilities which we would all regard as desirable.  In regard to these rooms, we are talking about single rooms which may be twice the size of the minimum size ones, more than standard-size bedrooms, which are intended <Col N="617" /> to be on the one floor without any real physical division because the aged person will find it more convenient that way, so that this bedroom and living room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Many of our people, young, middleaged and all ages, are living in these bed-sitters and living quite well.  They would not change their bed-sitters if you gave them a room in the highest cost hotel in this city.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the bed-sitter, provided it is big enough, provided the proper facilities are readily available to elderly persons, provided their food can be brought to their rooms or can be availed of, if they are sufficiently agile, in the communal dining room.  I do not think we will get anywhere by tying ourselves by law of this House to minimum or maximum standards.  If there is anything I can do by going on record in regard to this matter, I shall be only too glad to do it but I would ask the House not to seek these standards by law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant in this case is less than generous, especially if we are providing these facilities in isolated <Col N="618" /> units; there is no doubt we must look forward to more comfortable accommodation for our old people than they have been enjoying up to the present and we must lay down standards that represent a considerable improvement. If we are to provide what these people would get in institutions, for instance, some form of central heating in the isolated dwelling, this is a very inadequate grant.  The Minister says the health authority may make grants for the equipment of these houses.  If we could be assured that that is so, perhaps we could change our views somewhat, but we might need a considerable amount of equipment in many cases if we are to keep our people at home.  That is where they should be kept because of their own inclination to stay at home, because of the comfort they enjoy at home and because of the enormous cost of keeping them in institutions.  We have no assurance that health authorities will make such grants available for the equipment of the house and in the absence of that assurance, the Minister should agree to increase this grant and make that differentiation as between this type of accommodation being provided in isolation and the institutional type of accommodation described by Deputy Wyse.</P>

I shall deal with that at a later stage of the Bill but I am merely mentioning it now.  I shall be able to bring in an amendment at an appropriate stage to enable grants to be made towards the expenses of custodial staff in respect of some of these buildings to which we may be contributing under this section.</P>

      <P>On the Adjournment, Deputy Clinton gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 209 on last Thursday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I left the house last Thursday at about ten minutes to five and at that stage I thought the House was going to adjourn at 5 o'clock, but apparently it was decided to sit until 5.30 to continue Question Time.  In this way, the question which I thought would not be reached was in fact reached and answered by the Minister. I had another appointment at 5 o'clock and I left to keep that appointment.  If I had been here, perhaps I would have been able to deal with the Minister's reply by way of supplementary questions. I had not got that opportunity and consequently I was forced to ask permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  It is no pleasure to me to bring the Minister back here tonight and certainly it is no pleasure to me to be here having been here all day discussing the Housing Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that if the Minister really knew the history of this proposal in relation to the building of a vocational school in Clondalkin, he could possibly have given me the answer which he did give me.  I asked him if it was a fact that the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee had been instructed by his Department not to proceed with the building of a vocational school at Clondalkin because of a shortage of money at present.  The Minister replied that that is not so and he went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has informed the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee that the proposal for the building of the school must be <Col N="620" /> considered in conjunction with the result of a survey which I have instituted in relation to the existing provision for post-primary education throughout the country and the needs which must be met in particular areas.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the building of a vocational school in Clondalkin has long gone beyond the proposal stage.  Unfortunately to some extent I am responsible for this idea of a survey because I remember going to see the Department in relation to the purchase of a site at Walkinstown and we had a discussion about this and the desirability of providing more vocational schools in the county.  I said that I felt we were not providing anything like the number of vocational schools we needed in Dublin and that it called for a complete survey of the area, bearing in mind the factors which would influence where vocational schools would be required.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Department seized upon this and every proposal that we have made since has received this sort of answer.  Even when it is more than obvious that an area needs a vocational school and that it is not going to interfere with any other vocational school or any other school, we get this answer which I feel is nothing more than a delaying tactic and a brake on expenditure.  If the Minister was honest enough to say to me: &ldquo;We have not got the money&rdquo;, I would not mind.  With the consent of his predecessor, we purchased a site in Clondalkin about seven years ago.  Four years ago, with the permission of the Department, we started planning and we had an immense amount of difficulty getting these plans through the Department.  I am not suggesting that the fault was all on the Department's side but it was not unusual for the plans to be held in the Department for two, three or even as many as four months before certain queries came back to us.</P>
    <P>I was not satisfied, as a member of the vocational education committee, that our architect was doing his job as fast, or perhaps as well, as he should do it, but the fact is that we <Col N="621" /> proceeded to the point where we got the plans fully agreed by the Department and where we were told by the Department: &ldquo;You can go and get tenders.&rdquo;  We got the tenders.  We went to some trouble going through those tenders, discussing them with the architect and deciding on the tender to be selected.  The lowest tender was selected and agreed and we reached the point where we had even appointed a clerk of works.  When we told the Department that we had reached this point of looking for the money to sign the contract and proceed, we got this sort of communication back:</P>
    <P>With further reference to your Committee's proposal to provide a new Vocational School at Clondalkin, the Minister for Education directs me to refer to the speech which he made when introducing the Estimates for his Department in the Dáil on 16th June, 1965, and, in particular, to the following paragraph of that speech;</P>
    <P>and this is in inverted commas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>At a further level in the academic ladder it may be questioned whether the frequent juxtaposition of secondary and vocational schools does not, through avoidable duplication, occasionally result in some loss in teaching power and a failure to utilise existing resources to the full. Is there some room in some places for a certain amount of bilateralism? This is a problem that calls for consideration but it is one that can only be resolved by a readiness on the part of all concerned to join forces in a spirit of co-operation for the benefit of our children.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:</P>
    <P>With the object of ensuring that avoidable duplication will not in future occur, and that the fullest and best use will be made of available resources, the Minister has decided that all proposals for the provision of additional facilities for post-primary schooling must be considered in the light of a general survey of the existing provision throughout the country for post-primary education, and the requirements which must be met in <Col N="622" /> particular areas.  This survey has already been instituted and pending its completion in so far as the Clondalkin area is concerned, sanction for the execution of the work on the proposed school must be withheld.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister: Have we gone crazy altogether?  Clondalkin is a community of 10,000 people.  On one side of it, we have Ballyfermot which is two-and-a-half to three miles away. We are building a vocational school in Ballyfermot which will be totally inadequate for the population there. We have a small school in Rathcoole two miles away and it is overcrowded. We have no vocational schools nearer than those in the city and it is impossible to get into these schools.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister allowed us to proceed and to go to all this trouble and expense over the years and now we get back this type of answer which I am at a loss to describe. It certainly is not an answer worthy of the Minister.  If the Minister said honestly: &ldquo;We are embarrassed now; we have not got the money, but as soon as it becomes available&mdash;and we hope that will be soon&mdash;we shall let you proceed to build a school but you cannot just sign the contract now.&rdquo; But that is not the answer.  We have instead the sort of answer that really means nothing in the light of the position in which we find ourselves in Clondalkin and in the light of the position in which the people of the area find themselves.</P>
    <P>I have brought the Minister back tonight; that is no pleasure to me, but I feel I have a duty and responsibility to my constituents in the area to get something more adequate than the reply I got from the Minister the other day.  I can only describe it as dishonest and misleading.  I should be very anxious to hear what the Minister has to say now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should deal with Deputy Clinton's allegation that the reply he received from me the other day was dishonest.  He thinks the reply I should have given was that we did not have the money.  Has it occurred to <Col N="623" /> Deputy Clinton that the Government have issued a White Paper in regard to the capital development programme, stating how we must cut down and why we must do so, and that it would have been very much simpler to have replied to the question by referring the Deputy to this and saying that pending the improvement in the financial position of the country, this project must be deferred?  Rather than give that reply, I chose, as I think I am obliged to do, to give the honest answer and not the dishonest answer suggested by Deputy Clinton.</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that if we had unlimited millions of pounds available tomorrow morning for the building of vocational schools, Deputy Clinton would have got the same answer as he got last Thursday.  It is clear from what the Deputy said that he does not quite understand what is involved.  I cannot blame him; it is very difficult to communicate exactly what is involved to the House and to the country generally.  In that connection, I might mention that I am shortly sending out to every vocational committee and every secondary school a circular endeavouring to explain what we are doing, what we aim to achieve and how we aim to do it, some of the difficulties we expect to encounter and suggestions as to how we might tackle them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better say it again.  It is no problem to say we have not got money but that is not the true answer.  Deputy Clinton does not understand what is happening in post-primary education.  He talks about vocational schools and secondary education.  What I want to make clear is that we have to think in terms of post-primary education.  Deputy Clinton is aware of the fact, I presume, that a start will be made next autumn to have vocational schools provide courses leading to the Intermediate Certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that.</P>

    <Col N="624" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is also aware that a vast number of children leave the national schools and do not get any further education, in fact about one-third on the national scale.  I want to make provision for these and see that all our children get post-primary education, and in order to do so that, we must ensure that we have the schools and teachers, all the facilities that are involved in the way of science laboratories, teachers and so on.  In the past our post-primary system grew up haphazardly.  It has served us well but we have now reached the stage where we have approximately 900 post-primary schools spread throughout the country and we must ask ourselves where do we go from here.  One aim is to provide post-primary education for all the children.  To do that, or to have any hope of doing it, and to have any sense of responsibility to the tax-payers in doing it, we must ensure that all our existing facilities are used to the full.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute what Deputy Clinton said about the pressure on vocational schools in his area.  It may be the secondary schools in his area are under equal pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  It may be that there are some which are not under that pressure and that we can partially meet the problem in the area by utilising some space which might be available in some primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one wants to tackle this problem in any realistic way, one must stop and see what we are trying to do and where we go from here. One must see what one has got and what is needed.  Deputy Clinton would have us go ahead and build this school without any regard to what is coming in the next few years.  It is quite possible that as a result of the survey to which I have referred today, we shall say to the vocational committee of which Deputy Clinton is a member: &ldquo;This school should be twice or three <Col N="625" /> times as big and should have the following facilities&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will put on his thinking cap, I believe he will find there are methods by which he can get much greater use out of the facilities there at present.  It is being done in other parts of the country. The point I want to make is that we want to approach this matter on a planned national basis and that is what we are doing.  Deputy Clinton should remember that Clondalkin is not the only place with this problem.  The same situation is arising throughout the country.  I know this is very frustrating for people who have been working for years to get plans through.  I understand that, but I ask them to consider the long-term interests of the children. Are we to do a patchwork job or do it right to the fullest extent of the resources which we can put into education? If we are to do that, we must plan.  I understood Deputy Clinton's Party had been converted to some extent to planning.  This, I am afraid, is one of the drawbacks of planning: somewhere you have to draw the line and consider where you are going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy while he was speaking.  I hope he will extend the same courtesy to me. I want to make it clear that this is part of an overall plan and is in no sense an effort to fob off committees or the necessity to incur capital expenditure. There is no secret about the fact that we must cut down capital expenditure. It would be much simpler to give that answer but it would not be true. The truth is that we are trying to develop our post-primary education on a planned basis.  One must pay a certain price for doing that, but in the long term our children will gain very much as a result of what we suffer in the short term.  I trust Deputy Clinton will be able to see that.  I feel convinced that he will see it, and while I do not expect him to tell me he has seen the truth, I think he is honest enough to say it to himself when he does see what happens.</P>
