      <Col N="1764" /> In page 3, before paragraph (b) to insert the following new paragraph:</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I was telling the Minister that this amendment would not give him any great additional power but that he certainly should not find it embarrassing in the sense that it would be a discretionary power which he might or might not use.  It is hard to see, therefore, why the Minister continues to resist it.  If I rightly understand the Leader of the Labour Party, what he means is that this would act as an added deterrent to those who might have in mind the idea of increasing prices in a quiet, steady manner which might not draw any special attention to what they were doing&mdash;prices might be raised in such a way that there would not be any spectacular rise at any time.</P>
      <P>If it were known to all that the Minister had this power to require manufacturers, wholesalers and importers to give advance notification of any intention to increase prices, the very existence of this power might in itself overcome the necessity for further measures to resist that type of price increase.  I feel that the present situation may be such as to call for measures additional to those proposed by the Minister in this Bill.  The question may become sufficiently serious for that and accordingly the Minister might be well advised to accept the additional power proposed in the amendment.  The fact that such a power is there will, as I have said, hardly be an embarrassment to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> There is need for reasonably stringent measures in this matter of prices.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Donegan say we were supporting the Bill not because of any increases that had taken place up to the present time. I am sure the Deputy will not mind if I disagree slightly with him in that attitude.  Increases have taken place which, in my view, could not have been justified.  The ordinary person realises this only when the commodities reach retail level.  Where the increases began is hard to see but many people know that prices have rocketed unjustifiably in the past year or so.  All the measures necessary must be available to the Minister.  If the Minister starts to use the powers he has been given unreasonably, then we will come back and talk to him again.  I think that is most unlikely.  I know that can happen through people further down the line being over-officious but probably if the Minister looks at it in the light that this is discretionary power that is suggested in the amendment he should take his attitude might be different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been thinking about this amendment overnight.  Last night I adverted to one particular commodity, namely, meat, which would not be covered by the wording of the amendment.  We had, I think, a slight disagreement as to whether or not there were meat wholesalers in this country. The truth as far as the meat most of us eat is concerned is that there are meat wholesalers and large export concerns. If there are a few wholesale butchers in Dublin, it is the exception that proves the rule.  Therefore, the wording of this amendment would not cover meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt, therefore, that I should have a look at other commodities.  When I began to do that I realised that there are many commodities, particularly in the horticultural and agricultural line, which are either sold direct by farmers to retailers or, alternatively, are sold in places like the fruit market by a factor for a commission.  That is also the case in regard to direct sales.  At the present moment if a farmer sends <Col N="1766" /> a half ton of new potatoes to the fruit market, they are lifted at five or six o'clock in the morning and the sale, while there is a commission on it, while it goes to the factor, is direct from the farmer to the retailer.  Sales often take place from farmers to hoteliers, restaurateurs or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Milk, in many areas, is still sold direct from the farmer to the consumer. This is something which I consider will end as pasteurisation wipes out that sort of trade.  When you leave Dublin city, at the moment, you start to leave the sort of things covered by the amendment and, even in Dublin city, meat is not properly covered by it.  Deputy Tully, who lives beside me in County Meath, will agree that there are many commodities, such as agricultural and horticultural products, which vary very much in price.  While we agree with the spirit of the thing and while we feel that something should be done in this matter, the amendment as it stands is probably, without criticism of anybody, not worded in the complete manner that would be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was introduced by the Government, we are told, for the purpose of trying to do something about rising prices.  The amendment has been put in by the Labour Party for the purpose of assisting the Government to catch a number of people who we believe will otherwise get away with it for months.  I consider there is nothing at all unreasonable in asking that people who want to increase prices should notify the Minister's Department that they propose to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan has referred to a number of items which are, in fact, excluded at the present time.  They are excluded from the main Bill.  There is no point in showing things that were never intended to be included and saying they are not included in the amendment.  We believe that if we could get the Minister to accept the amendment and thereby get the additional assistance, if you like free, from the people who want to increase prices, he will not have to have Deputy Paddy <Col N="1767" /> Smith's field full of inspectors going out to look for evidence.  If we can give him some authority which will allow him to obtain that information without the necessity of having all these inspectors surely this should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Government on this because it brings us back to a suggestion made on Second Reading, which I did not agree with then, but which I am coming around to now, that this is a gentle hint or a gentle way of saying this cannot continue.  It appears as some people said, during the Second Reading, with which I did not agree, but which I must now agree with, that the Government do not intend to do one damn thing about it.  They want to give the impression to the country that they are doing something about it but any attempt that is made by any of us to do something about it will be strangled by the Government.  If that is the attitude, the Dáil will certainly not adjourn tonight or tomorrow night because we will ensure that the Bill will have the necessary teeth and the Government, willy nilly, will have a thorough Bill which will keep prices down.</P>
    <P>We believe, as was pointed out last night, that what we are now doing, should have been done 18 months ago. Even the late assistance given in this case to ensure that no further increases in prices would take place is not enough.  The Minister could have engaged his staff going back on unreasonable increases which have occurred since the ninth round of wage increases and the turnover tax if he had the necessary authority to ensure that anybody who was trying to sneak by with increased prices&mdash;they are trying it at present and will continue to do so&mdash;would be unable to do so.  In order to ensure that they could not do that, they should be obliged to notify him of any increase about to take place and then be asked by him to justify the increase.  If that were done, a lot more work could be carried out by the Minister's Department. That is why we put in this amendment <Col N="1768" /> and the Minister should be prepared to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in regard to being here tonight or tomorrow, I want to make it clear that I shall be around anyway.  It is only some of the other Deputies who may not be here. This does not influence what I will do with the Bill.  My only real objection to the amendment was that it might reduce my effectiveness.  While it might complete the picture of the Bill as it appeared in the Statute Book the across-the-board application of the powers which this proposes to give me could reduce the effectiveness of my Department and myself in reducing prices.</P>
      <P>After having listened, and having let this matter be debated further, I gather that the House is prepared to see these powers used in a selective way, that you would name certain commodities if prices were going to be increased.  This would be unmanageable. As I told the House last night in regard to selective arrangements to prevent price rises, I have proposed much stronger powers of my own.  I have a standstill order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave my advisers out of it.  I have not finished talking.  I have been thinking this out myself during the night without the help of any adviser at all.  If I accept this amendment, I want the House to understand what I am accepting.  I do not want it to be used as a stick with which to beat me afterwards.  You do not want widespread control of things which do not affect ordinary people. You do not want to have anyone controlling something which does not affect the cost of living.  You do not want these people reporting.  I am not objecting to getting power which would make the Bill effective.  I am objecting to getting power which, if used indiscriminately, would reduce my active effectiveness.  I do not think that there is anything really wrong in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment, does he believe that there is an obligation on him to make an order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy stands by what he said last night and allows the Minister the discretion to use these powers selectively&mdash;if the Government give him the powers under an order, which is another step&mdash;I have no objection to accepting the amendment. I have stronger powers in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That was what we suggested last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to intervene for a moment because I think the Minister's approach of selectivity is probably the correct one.  Some years ago when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;at that time the Supplies and Services Act was in operation&mdash;the procedure was that the manufacturers and groups of traders notified the Department in advance of proposed price changes.  My recollection is that this was on a selective basis.  It did not apply to commodities that did not affect the cost of living. One item that comes to mind at the moment is soap.  When the price of imported raw materials rose&mdash;and the price of this commodity is liable to fluctuations because the prices of the raw material, the oils, vary&mdash;the manufacturers notified the Department or came to the Department and had discussions. In certain cases the prices they suggested were considered appropriate and reasonable.  My recollection is that after discussions, and when the whole question had been considered in consultation with the trade interests concerned, a price was decided upon, and whether or not it was considered reasonable the trade interests accepted the opinion of the Prices Section of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis it seems to me that there is no fundamental objection to notification.  On the other hand, it would be ridiculous to expect commodities which have no direct effect on the cost of living to be notified to the Department, although very often it is not possible to specify in certain cases whether the article has an effect <Col N="1770" /> on the cost of living.  Certainly the procedure that was in operation under the Old Supplies and Services Act was that there was notification either by the firm concerned or, in the case of a number of firms, the organisation representing them, and after discussions, a price was fixed.  If the price suggested was regarded as excessive, a reduction was effected.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficiently realised that while at first glance a suggested price increase may seem unreasonable and excessive, when it is examined it may often be found to be reasonable, taking into account the cost of the imported materials, the labour costs, and possibly the costs of distribution.  In that connection, I think there is a good case for an examination of distribution costs.  Only last week a small group of grocers had an interview with me and gave me particulars showing that weight for weight in comparable commodities produced here, there were wide discrepancies in prices.  These were packaged goods and there was a remarkable difference in the price levels.  There was no obligation on the manufacturers to specify the weight. It would be difficult for the public to realise the difference because the commodities were sold in packaged form and it was not necessary to specify the weight.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's approach to this question on a selective basis is a practical method of dealing with it. The powers in the amendment are not objectionable but, at the same time, if operated on a general scale, they might clog the working of the whole prices section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we made it clear last night that we were concerned about the prices of certain commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the amendment if the Deputy will show me how he visualises it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say first that last night we insisted that we wanted notification in respect of what can clearly be regarded as essential items: foodstuffs, clothing and commodities which affect the cost of living index <Col N="1771" /> figure when there is an increase in prices.  This Bill is a permissive Bill, and even if the amendment is accepted the Government and the Minister still have discretion as to whether or not they will use this power.  We will try to insist that they will use it.  There is nothing sinister in what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Deputy to show me how he visualises it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We want the Government to declare that the condition of the national economy is such that they will make an order to empower the Minister to do certain things, and we want them to make that order.  We believe that such an order should be made and we believe that the Minister should have the power to insist that manufacturers, wholesalers, and importers of certain commodities which he regards&mdash;and which people generally regard&mdash;as having an effect or a bearing on the cost of living, should be required to notify him before increasing prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I had in mind also to give the House the information that in regard to certain commodities the Minister may say that whether or not there is notification, there will be a standstill.  There is nothing objectionable in what the Deputy says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not a lawyer, and I am not a lawyer, but did his advisers tell him that if this amendment goes in as it is, there will be an obligation on him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I thought the Deputy might ask later on why I did not do a blanket one, where I thought the cost of living was excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on that amendment, I would hope that when the Minister got those powers, he would be very careful and very chary of using them.  Prices are very difficult things, in the main, to control. I can remember very clearly the operation of prices some years ago and they had a very adverse effect on the whole economy, an adverse effect which was pointed out, if the Minister remembers, in the famous IBEC Report brought out by a group of Americans. The Government of the day brought them in and they issued a report that profit margins in this country were insufficient.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned putting a standstill on prices. We had on Second Reading a disagreement as to whether or not the standstill would go on first and the investigation would follow, if the Taoiseach and the Government felt that prices were excessive.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that this was not so and that the investigation would come first. Would the Minister say a word on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying that is what I said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that what the Minister said is that investigation would come first and the standstill order would follow, if it were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see the powers in the Bill, one is that in certain commodities in a temporary period there would be no increase in prices.  Power is in the Bill to make a standstill order.  In accepting the Labour Party amendment, one could also say that in regard to certain commodities, there would be prior notification of an intended increase in prices.  There is power in the Bill in the case of an increase in prices to say: &ldquo;Go back to where you were and stay there until I investigate it.&rdquo; Or, in the case of starting off in a couple of weeks' time, you can go back on prices which have <Col N="1773" /> already been raised by having an investigation into prices as they now exist.  That is the way I see the powers in the Bill.  The Bill would seem to cover every possible contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we are in order in having a practical discussion on this matter.  It is true to say that a price which might appear to be excessive might, in fact, not be excessive.  Again, without criticism or difficulty, I think it was Deputy Larkin who said last night that a wage increase could be proved to have a two per cent factor in the average of price increase.  I am taking that immediately as correct.  When you take certain commodities and the fact that labour is involved in different stages of their manufacture, you find this two per cent, as Deputy Larkin said, multiplies itself, two by two by two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Two per cent on the aggregate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>An example is a loaf of bread.  You start off with the flour-millers' workers' wages, and I presume that is two per cent written in on the average.  Then you come along to the baker; that is a second progress.  You then come to wrappers and you have to buy wrapping paper. After that, there is a highly expensive delivery service, if the bread is delivered. There is the situation where a commodity would seem to have increased disproportionately in price, where there would, in fact, if there has been a wage increase, be three or four separate wage increases written into the cost of the final commodity. I am not making a case for bakers or millers.  I am merely mentioning something that came to mind when listening to Deputy Larkin.  It is a question of whether or not the Minister could go wrong, if he is prepared to do as he says, to fix prices under a standstill order first and investigate later.</P>

We are now furnished with an amendment proposed by the Labour Party which calls for prior notification of any price increases.  I wonder have we considered what this will mean?  If this is to be the procedure, the net result will be simply to reduce the quality of the goods the people will get.  Could anybody tell me in this House how you fix the price of tea?  There are coming into this country not less than 60, probably 80, grades of tea graded in halfpennies. You can buy tea at 1/-, 1/0½, 1/1, 1/2½, 1/3.  Yet, you say quite blandly that you can fix the price of tea.</P>

    <P>I should be very concerned to see an attempt, a serious, genuine, honest attempt, made in this country to establish a prices incomes policy.  I said repeatedly when leading this Party during the general election that to get <Col N="1778" /> a prices and incomes policy effectively operated depended mainly on persuasion and co-operation and that no matter how many teeth we put into the machinery to achieve the end of an effective prices and incomes policy, the measure of our success or failure would be whether we had to use the teeth and if we had to use teeth to enforce it then we should have failed.</P>
    <P>I have always been able to deal with trade unions on a rational basis if they understand your case and believe that substantial justice is being done.  I have dealt frequently with employers' associations.  On the whole, I have found employers to be reasonable men, not angles any more than trade unionists are angles but reasonable men, providing they believe you are dealing honestly and frankly with them.  I should not be honest if I said to the members of the Labour Party that I believe their amendment will secure a genuine price control.</P>

We went as far as necessary, back to the roots of production, to secure that the price of bread would be kept at a certain level, and we kept it there.  Ultimately, as Deputy Corish knows, it cost the Exchequer £9 million a year in order to see substantial justice done to the manufacturer, the distributor and the consumer.  We kept prices at the level we thought just and, on that basis, we kept a degree of stability in our <Col N="1779" /> economy in times of unparalleled difficulties which we think reflected great credit on our exertions, though we got damn little thanks for it.  We were not looking for thanks: we were doing our job.  I salute the memory of those who did it fearlessly, which is more than some people do.  I do not believe this Government have the slightest intention of operating an honest incomes and prices policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with that view but, in fact, I am not. Amendment No. 1 raises the issue as to whether you can effectively control prices by imposing on manufacturers, wholesalers and importers an obligation to notify the Minister in advance of their intention to increase prices. I am trying to demonstrate to the House that that is simply whistling down the wind, and if we imagine that this device will produce the results we hope for, we are crazy.  But, of course, the people who will get the blame are not the wiseacres in Oireachtas Éireann, nor yet the Minister. Ultimately, the people who will get the blame are the bureaucrats for not doing their job but they have been given an impossible job.  We shall have to ask them to do what it is humanly possible to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in making laws that are certain and clear so that the people will understand them, that the people can trust them and that those whom we charge with the responsibility of enforcing them will be given a possible task, but, at the moment, we are giving them an impossible task.  I want to say about this whole idea that if it is designed to protect our people from getting less value for the money they have to spend, it is useless.  All that it will do is that, for the same expenditure, they will get less in volume or quality of the commodity <Col N="1780" /> which they seek to buy.  Make up your minds to it.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to say this.  Let us dismiss from our minds that this procedure will make any real contribution whatever to the problem with which we are at present faced in this country. This is like taking out a tin cup to bale out a boat into which the tide is coming over the gunwale.</P>

As long as they are there, we are going to pursue a policy, as I warned this House before, which is the policy of a gambler.  We are going to stumble along the road to inflation.  With the inevitable result of inflation coming upon us, we are going to try to remedy it with a Prices Bill.  We are going to cynically declare when we produce the Bill that we do not believe it, but it is a good alibi.  This will not stop prices going up.  What will happen if you get devaluation?

I would be grateful to those who propose this amendment to tell me how they propose it will provide protection for the woman who wants to buy tea, soap, margarine, pepper or bacon.  In my submission, what the amendment will achieve is not to control the prices of these commodities but to guarantee that the woman who goes out to buy them will get somewhat worse value for her money than she has got heretofore.  I do not think that is serving the purpose the Labour Party have in mind.  It is certainly not serving the purpose I had in mind when I spoke of a prices and incomes policy being necessary for this country if we are to be protected on the slippery slope Fianna Fáil has led us and down which we are slithering at present.</P>

      <P>One must wonder about the benefits of a good night's sleep, or should I say, a bad night's sleep.  What we have heard this morning is more revealing than what we heard last night.  Last night, the Fine Gael Front Bench indicated they were with us on this amendment.  I was glad to hear the Minister say what he said this morning.  But then Deputy Dillon gets up and starts lecturing the Labour Party about this whole matter.  I recall Deputy Donegan saying last night that price control was Fine Gael policy in the last election.  It is far too easy for people to ask how do you do this and how do you do that.  Deputy Dillon spoke at great length and asked how do we fix prices for this and that.  We could also ask: how do you fix wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon is reading into this amendment something that is not there.  We are simply asking for arrangements to be made for these people to notify price increases to the <Col N="1782" /> Department.  That will mean they will have to be prepared to make a case for such increases.  I will expect the Department to ensure that whether or not they are justified in their intentions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me no reasonable person could object to this amendment.  I do not know what the attitude of the Minister is in regard to it.  I am told now that he is accepting it.  However, I am surprised at the remarks of Deputy Dillon in this regard. It seems to me to be falling in line with the trend developing here since the advent of Fianna Fáil in 1961.  I am referring to the idea propagated by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party that opposition is impolite, unnecessary and uncalled for; and that in fact the function of an opposition is much the same as the function of a suggestion box in a factory.  In other words, he wants a suggestion box opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked how is this Bill <Col N="1783" /> to be made effective.  It is the job of the Government to make it effective. If they fail to make it effective, it is the fault of the Government.  I cannot see how it can be reasonably argued that this Bill and this amendment will not help to bring about a better situation in regard to prices than the one now existing.  The present situation with regard to prices is absolutely chaotic as we well know.  Prices are running away from wages like race-horses running from the tape and no effort has been made to relate the two. This Bill is an effort, inspired, fought for and secured by no other Party than the Labour Party.  I remember when we talked about the need for price control in this House the Taoiseach and his Ministers and Party were unanimous in rejecting the idea that price control would be in any way effective.  The Taoiseach is on record on numerous occasions to that effect. He has had to accept common sense and logic.  He has had to accept the Labour Party position in this matter.</P>

The amendment is to the effect that manufacturers, wholesalers and importers be required to notify the Minister of any proposed increases in the prices charged by them for their commodities. That is common sense.  What point is there in having a Prices Bill unless there is some kind of standstill? In effect, this is a standstill being placed on prices.  If this were not in the Bill, I can see similar instances as occurred in certain trades in this city within recent months in relation to prices taking place rapidly.  In spite of what might be argued here by representatives of special vested interests in this House, not all wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers are saints. Not all of them are devoted to either the First or the Second so-called <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> In fact, I would suggest that the great majority of them are devoted to the accumulation of the highest possible bank balances they can assemble.</P>

      <P>It is very relevant because prices were going up out of control then.  A demonstration was given in this House.  I do not want to delay with the details because it is only relevant to the point of what the difficulties are.  I refer Deputies to the debate at that time.  There are real difficulties in controlling prices, as Deputy Dillon, amongst the many things he has said, pointed out, but that does not mean that these difficulties have not to be faced or that an effort has not to be made to deal with them in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>This amendment gives power to the Minister in that regard and the only objection to it which I, like the Minister, would like to have clear is that it is to be applied selectively and in accepting it, the House should be clear that it is for selective application that this amendment is designed, not for global application because global application would fail in effect and would also, as the Minister said, gum up the works and prevent action or concentration on what would be the more important issues at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not think we need anybody in this House to tell us or to demonstrate by way of example how difficult it may be to provide machinery to have an absolute control over prices.  The Members of the House ought to appreciate what we want, what the Minister appears to want and what the Members of the Fine Gael Party appear to want, in so far as the House agreed that this Bill be given a Second Reading. All the snags Deputy Dillon pointed out in relation to certain selected commodities are there.  However, what has been the position over the past 12 or 18 months?  What is the alternative to a measure like this? The free-for-all we have had in the past 18 months encouraged by the Fianna Fáil Government, encouraged by the neglect of the Fianna Fáil Government, by their various statements to the effect that competition will ensure that prices will reach a reasonable level?  These statements were repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice. All this was discussed on the turnover tax in particular.</P>

      <P>Is this on the section?  There is an answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to Deputies and to the Chair that all these amendments are amendments to a section that deals with price stability. I, therefore, say that in respect of any of these amendments we are entitled to talk about prices generally.  However, I do not intend to proceed in that manner in view of the fact that there is somewhat limited time, so with the permission of Deputy de Valera, I will come to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suggest that the period for the order which the Government might make is too short.  First of all, the Government make an order.  When they will make this order, I do not know. Whether it will be done in the immediate future, in the recess, I do not know. <Col N="1788" /> That is the discretion which the Government themselves have.  In any case when the Government are satisfied, and I quote again: &ldquo;that the condition of the national economy is such that it is necessary to maintain stability of prices generally, the Government may by order authorise and empower the Minister to do from time to time any or all or some of the following ...&rdquo;. In page 6 it says: &ldquo;An order made by the Government under this section shall remain in force for such period (not exceeding six months from the date of the making thereof)&rdquo;.  That is the order declaring, let us call it for the want of a better word, a special occasion or an emergency.</P>
    <P>Within that period, unless the Government order is extended, the Minister must do certain things.  I suggest that if he has to do certain things and to make orders himself that are to obtain for six months, by the time we come to the fifth month of the Government order, he may not have got through his job of inquiring into the prices of various commodities.  Therefore, it will always be necessary for the Government to extend the period of their order beyond the six months.  The period of the Government order should be 12 months in order to allow the Minister time in which to do any or all of the things contained in this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>The order is made, say, today.  What does the Minister do?  Does he put a price freeze on every commodity and does it operate straight away or does he wait for two weeks and say he is going to investigate the price of soap, for instance?  That will take a certain amount of time.  If he is going to investigate canned foods, footwear or clothing, it will take time for him to accumulate all the information and to put certain submissions before the tribunal.  It may well be that by the time all this is done and the Minister decides to make an order, the Government order may have expired.  The extended order need not necessarily operate for 12 months but it would give the Minister latitude to do what he needs to do in respect of certain commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In our view a period of 12 months is too long.  Price changes can occur and it would mean that if an order were made by the Minister for 12 months and he made it in the belief that price changes would not occur and then price changes did occur, the situation could arise that the person who is selling or manufacturing an article might be involved in considerable loss.  There is the fact that a continuance order may be made. Six months is long enough and if the Minister's investigations are not completed in six months, the continuance order can be sought.</P>
      <P>Out of this section and out of this amendment has come the point that what the Taoiseach said was right, that if a price is apparently&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; deliberately&mdash; excessive, that price will be controlled by standstill order and that then the investigation will take place.  In other words, as I said on Second Reading, and I was contradicted by the Minister, this is a Wild West show: shoot first and ask questions afterwards.  If the Minister sitting in his Department in conference with his officials feels that the price of a commodity is excessive, he will control first and investigate afterwards.</P>

      <P>The point was made by Deputy Corish and the Minister nodded his head that control was to take place first and investigation afterwards. I immediately took up the point as I had taken it up on Second Reading. I also adverted to it last night and now I have had it confirmed to me again by the Minister that that is what will happen.  As I have said, we believe six months is an adequate period, if we have to have this Bill which we do not think is a wonderful measure.  Let it not be thought there is any great divergence of views between Deputy Dillon and the rest of us here.  This is an instrument which has been brought in by the Government and of which we do not think a lot.  However, it is here now and as responsible legislators, we have to consider it on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot conceive of a situation where the Minister's activities which he would consider necessary would be brought to a sudden end by the Government refusing to extend by a continuation order the order which gave him the powers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would be engaged in certain activities and would go to the Government for his order.  If it were felt that his activities should continue, I cannot conceive of a situation in which the Government, having been convinced, would not give the Minister the powers he needs.  The six months is to show, as I said on Second Stage, that we have not changed our ideas about competition being the best regulator of prices.  We foresee, however, and have always foreseen, the possibility that in certain economic circumstances, extra powers should be available to the Minister to control prices.  I have never minimised the task. <Col N="1791" /> As far as we are concerned, we believe the situation will be of a temporary character and all that is necessary is power for the Government to make an order should the situation warrant it. That is a reflection of our thinking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we have moved this amendment is that we feel the action that would have to be taken would be taken in circumstances in which it was more or less called for, in a situation which cried out for intervention. We regard six months as too short for really effective intervention in the field of prices.  Manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers could do too much manoeuvring.  We ask that the period be extended to 12 months to ensure that there will be no ambiguity about the possibility of Government action and no room for mistake as to the function of the Government in this field of prices.</P>
      <P>It is true that there is power to seek an extension of the six months' period but it is our belief that, in order to intervene effectively in this so-called competitive arena, for the purpose of regulating prices or achieving some kind of equilibrium, a 12 months' period is essential.  Having taken all the factors into consideration, that is the only realistic period from the point of view of Government intervention.  I said last night that I regarded this Bill as a figleaf designed to cover the Government's nakedness because of their inactivity in relation to rising prices. We feel that those who control the market place would be quite competent to defeat any policy in relation to increasing prices.  We live in what is euphemistically called a free economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We consider a 12 months' period more realistic than a six months' period.  We believe the time has come when there is need for the mailed fist where prices are concerned and a 12 months' period is a better indication of the seriousness of governmental intervention in this particular area.  We believe there are some scalps to be got in this &ldquo;Prices Wild West&rdquo;.  Control is not just an academic exercise.  We believe, in the light of past experience, and because of the increases that have occurred, that the situation calls for a 12 months' period.  We know there is power to seek a continuance order but we believe there must be a psychological approach to price regulation and a clear demonstration that the Government are quite serious in their intention to intervene at this late stage in a really decisive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment is not accepted, the message conveyed to the country will be that this Prices Bill is a sterile thing.  If this Bill is to bring about restraint, and prove a deterrent and a dissuader, all those concerned must be fixed with a reasonable period of time.  We regard six months as totally inadequate.  We appreciate that there can be a continuance order but, in an economic atmosphere in which trade unions and other groups are expected to enter into long-term contracts, which they are expected to keep for periods of 2½ years, then it is only right and proper that in a measure designed to control prices, a reasonable period of time should also be provided.  We regard 12 months as a reasonable period.  More important still, it must be made clear to all facets of our economic life that price stability and price control are to become an integral part of Government policy.  A period of six months will convey all too clearly to the vested interests involved, as it conveys to us, that they can easily afford to stay their hands and refrain from increasing <Col N="1793" /> prices for six months.  After all, six months is not a very long period. Assuming this Bill would go by default at the end of six months, we would once more find ourselves in a period of spiralling prices all over again, and at an accelerated rate. Again, we would have serious disruption of our economy.</P>
      <P>Talking in terms of time, this prices measure should be a continuing measure and not merely something of a temporary nature for as long as economic circumstances ordain.  So long as we have people suffering under a burden of unfair prices and so long as other sections of the community are committed to agreements for periods of upwards of 2½ years, then so long should we have in operation a measure designed to control prices. It is intrinsically wrong to expect the trade unions and Congress to embark once more on a national agreement for a period of two or three years, while, at the same time, expecting a measure in relation to such a vital matter as price control to last not more than six months.  The mention of a six months' period in this measure detracts from the intrinsic worth of the Bill and from the fact that it should be a measure of great moral suasion designed to persuade those concerned to exercise restraint in the matter of prices.  That restraint, so far as any reasonable Government are concerned, should be a continuing action and not merely for six months or a continuation of that period but for as long as is required, in order to ensure stability and decent standards for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different amendment.  What the Deputy is advocating now is something without a term of time in it.  It is the intention of the Government to make orders when the economic situation warrants it and to continue such orders so long as is necessary, for 12 or 18 months or more.  Later in the Bill, I am seeking powers which the draftsmen tell me are needed on a permanent basis to extend the prices advisory committee's powers to different levels where prices are regulated.  These will not be limited by any time and will give the Minister <Col N="1794" />&mdash;if passed by the Dáil&mdash;power to continue orders beyond any period named in the Bill or in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it makes any difference whether the Minister accepts the amendment or not because the subsection specifies a period not exceeding six months.  A period not exceeding 12 months or 24 months does not make any difference to the Minister because even if it is written in here, the Minister may make an order not exceeding three months, if he so desires.  Subsection (4) then gives the Minister powers for the making of continuance orders if he sees fit.  In other words, every six months, as in the case of a person applying for a driving licence and not getting it, we can have a look at the situation.  It makes no substantial difference to the Minister's powers or the Bill whether he accepts this amendment or not.  If the Labour Party think it will have a better psychological effect to have the term as 12 months instead of six months, it is hard to see why it should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties that could arise if you fix a price for 12 months is that a mistake could be made in the first instance by fixing too high a price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo; refers to time.  I am discussing an excessive price being fixed through a wrong calculation or something of that kind which would set the price pattern for 12 months.  It would be possible during that 12 months that factors could arise which would justify a substantial reduction in price.  These things do happen.  For instance, the world price of sugar has fallen and last year there were increases in the prices <Col N="1795" /> of commodities containing sugar and these have not gone down.  The price of cocoa I think is now one-fifth of what it was but the price of chocolate and other such commodities has not gone down.  If you fix too long a period for these things, you may have a situation in which prices will be artificially maintained and will be unnecessarily high.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I think I can understand the justification for the Labour Party amendment.  You could have a situation in which the raw materials could be in stock, more than a year's supply.  Or we could be producing all the raw materials here and we could have so arranged the economy that there would be no justification for an increase in the price of these materials during the year. Similarly, we could have a more practical and better form of national wage agreement which would be expected to operate for a year or two years and all the contributory factors in the price range would be, or should be, static for the period and that is a justification for having an order made for 12 months in advance.  Why the Minister seeks to limit himself exactly to six months I do not know.</P>

But the Minister can get the Government to repeat the order and if they think the economy warrants it, they will naturally make continuance orders.</P>

      <P>The Minister may by order revoke or amend an order made by the Minister by virtue of this Part, including an order under this subsection.</P>
      <P>In effect, whether we have six months or 12 months written into the section we are dealing with now, it makes no effective difference to the Minister's powers.  I think the Labour Party are more concerned with the psychological effect of having 12 months there instead of six months but the Minister can at any time, even within a week after making the order, revoke the order.

If the same economic circumstances continue, we can extend them for any group of six-month periods.&rdquo; This arrangement gives greater flexibility.</P>
      <P>I began to explain earlier that we believed that competition is the best regulator of prices but we found there may be certain economic circumstances where this does not work and that is why we need these extra powers &mdash;to meet such economic circumstances which we believe will be temporary when they appear and should be dealt with on a temporary basis.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;our philosophy was based on the assumption that competition was the best way.  We foresaw the possibility of an economic situation which would require a more active intervention and I do not think anybody in this House is underestimating the task of regulating prices.  I think we all appreciate the difficulty. But we foresaw the possibility of economic circumstances arising which would make it worthwhile and necessary for the Government to take fairly strong power, such as the power of standstill, which is a very strong power, but it would not be desirable to have <Col N="1798" /> all these powers all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's refusal to accept this amendment is indicative of the Government's intention to avoid, if they can, doing anything about prices, to make the first possible excuse not to use the machinery for the benefit of the consumer.  The section gives the Government power to make an order which will remain in force for six months.  We are concerned that once that order has been made, every possible opportunity will be given to the Minister to deal with the situation arising from increases in prices.  While we on these benches are not here for the purpose of talking about prices from a national point of view, we have repeatedly pointed out that there has been a crisis in the economy of the citizens for quite a long time.  The balance of payments difficulties may have been a recent development but there has been a crisis in the economies of the families which make up this nation for some time, a crisis about which the Government have done nothing.</P>
      <P>We feel that when the Government declare that an order is necessary, at least they should make an order which will enable the Minister to act in the interests of the ordinary consumer. That is why we think the period should be 12 months.  The Minister tells us that the Government may extend the period for six months and again for another six months.  The dogma of Fianna Fáil, which also appears to be the dogma of Fine Gael, is that the only way to deal with prices is to let the power of competition operate, the only way to deal with anything is to let exploitation be the measure.  We feel strongly that once this order has been made, it should remain in force for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose, for the sake of argument, the Minister felt it necessary to impose a number of standstill orders on the prices of various commodities and following that, decided it was necessary to have an investigation.  The decision to hold an investigation might not be made until one, two, three or four months after the orders were made.  At that stage are the Government likely to <Col N="1799" /> make another order extending the period for another six months in order to afford the Minister or the Prices Advisory Body the opportunity to recommend that some action should be taken within the period of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what the Minister said, there appears to be no doubt that the Government will use the first possible excuse to terminate an order or let it lapse after six months. We believe that this crisis the consumers are experiencing has not just developed in the last few weeks or months, and unless there is positive and continued action over a period in regard to people who increase prices without having regard to the position of the consumer, and unless machinery is set up to exert some control over them, then clearly this will not be effective.  Accordingly we press the Minister to accept the 12 months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill is necessary because since 1957, and particularly since 1961, the Government have allowed things to get completely out of control.  The economy has gone wrong as a result of Government action through the turnover tax and all that followed from it.  The powers being sought by the Minister under the Bill are extreme powers; they are powers which bring back the memories of some of us to the days of the war and to the Department of Supplies. We should not forget that the order which the Minister or the Government makes under this section is not an order prohibiting an increase in price after an investigation to determine whether or not that price is fair or excessive; it is, as the Taoiseach said on the Second Reading of the Bill, a control first, to be followed by an investigation. Deputy Donegan and I <Col N="1800" /> both said that it is a question of shooting first and asking the questions afterwards. Therefore I think that a period of six months is adequate.</P>
      <P>It may turn out in some cases where a standstill order has been made that, upon investigation, a proposed increase is fair and reasonable.  On the other hand, if after an investigation, it turns out that the proposed increase is excessive, the Minister has the machinery under this section to extend his prohibition for a further six months and for a further six months, <i>ad infinitum</i>, as far as I can see.  If this were an order made after an investigation into a proposed price increase, then I would consider 12 months a reasonable period, but having regard to the fact that it is an on-the-spot prohibition and that the investigation is only to take place afterwards, a period of 12 months is too long.</P>

      <P>We have said time out of number that this country needs a broad incomes policy.  We are not entirely happy about this Bill or about the effort to have <i>ad hoc</i> limitation of prices.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers to the necessity for setting a pattern of price movement.  I have already said what the danger will be if we set prices for a 12-month period.  If we do that, the danger is, as I have pointed out, that we may set them at too high a level. The fact that the Minister has power in the Bill does not mean he will use that power.  The possibility, the probability even, is that once the bureaucrats fix a price, they will be extremely loth to modify it within the period and the danger is that prices might be set at too high a pattern for too long a period.  If we had a permanently sitting consultative council representing all sections of the community, then there would be a permanent system for control, in a sensible way, of income movements which include prices as a major factor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say briefly that it is a pity we all seem to be at variance.  I believe sincerely that the investigations which will go on will, in some cases, produce unfair prices.  This may shock members of other Parties.  In the rise in costs that came about from various factors, the ninth round of wage and salary increases was one factor which in the case of some commodities led to increased prices to a very considerable degree.  If we make an order for 12 months, we give power to the Minister to fix a price and this means that with the pressure on the section of the Department dealing with price investigations, this fixed price may remain in a pigeonhole for 12 months.  In a period of inflation, this may mean the price fixed might be lower than the cost of production.  If that happens, production stops and men are dismissed. It is a basic fact of production that people do not go on making things if they are losing money on their manufacture.  Deputy Corish is right when he says we have a vested interest in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is quite right.  I should like to make it quite clear that we do not wish to get into an argumissed <Col N="1803" /> ment with the Labour Party.  The context in which we are discussing the Bill is one in which the Minister has gone to the FUE and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to seek restraint on both sides and one of the instruments of this restraint is the Bill before the House.  It is quite right that Deputy Corish should have a vested interest here.  However, in all friendship, I say he is in error in favouring 12 months because so long a period would be unfair when one considers the pressure there will be on the relevant section in the Department.</P>
      <P>I say six months is enough, in view of the fact that the Minister may make a continuation order.  We must realise we are going far when we arbitrarily fix prices which may appear excessive but which may not be excessive at all. Deputy Larkin said the ninth round of wage and salary increases affected prices by only two per cent.  Deputy Cluskey interjected that this question should be aggregated.  I have pointed to the case of bread.  It would be affected by an increase in the wages of bakery workers, an increase in the wages of transport staff, an increase in the wages of vanmen.  This would have a snowballing effect on the cost of the commodity.  Deputy Cluskey's point of two per cent aggregate may be true and the investigation carried out by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions may be correct, but in respect of some commodities, it is untrue.  It must vary in relation to the labour content involved in the production of the commodity.  Nobody, even those in the Labour Party, can dispute that. Presumably, there are items in which the increase in cost because of the ninth round would be only one per cent but there are other commodities in respect of which it would be ten per cent.</P>

      <P>I am accepting the aggregate.  I have no evidence either way and I accept, as I must under the rules of order, that what the Deputy says is true.  However, he will find that a lot of the investigations will <Col N="1804" /> prove that the increases in prices were justified by costs.  Twelve months, therefore, is too long a period.  Think of the row there was some years ago when there was talk of a wages standstill order.</P>

      <P>It seeks to ensure that the Government would make a 12-month order empowering the Minister to make six-month orders.  Is it not rubbish, therefore, to talk about maximum prices for 12 months?  The six-month period is there and the Minister can operate a six-month order within the global order of 12 months.  That is the only reason we put down this amendment, to allow the Minister time to manoeuvre.  Is that clear?  Does the Deputy not agree, therefore, it does not mean orders in respect of prices that will obtain in six months.  Deputy Donegan said that if the amendment is accepted by the Minister and inserted by him, there may be orders that will obtain for 12 months.</P>

      <P>I think the Fine Gael Party can be absolutely confident in the Fianna Fáil Party that they are not going to go wild about this Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not going to freeze prices all round. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Fianna Fáil Government are not going to investigate too many commodities but as long as this Bill is on the statute book, as long as the Minister has power and as long as the Government can make these orders, we will try to insist here that they will investigate and that they will control prices, where a tribunal has decided they should be controlled.  We do not object to all factors, including wages, being taken into consideration when prices are investigated.</P>
      <P>I do not think it unfair to suggest there has been a change of attitude on the part of the Fine Gael Party overnight, with regard to this Prices Bill. That was demonstrated by Deputy Dillon.  He wrote off this Bill completely and merely used his contribution here as a general attack on the Fianna Fáil Party.  He may be right in what he says about the Fianna Fáil Party in respect of other things.  We are concerned here by the fact that the Government, at long last, have shown some signs they are concerned about prices.  It ought to be said, too, that the trade union movement, of which practically all of us here are members, understand, as other Parties here must understand, that there has been a voluntary control by the workers for the past 18 months in regard to wages.</P>

We want to ensure in this instrument, by the action of the Government, that any increases that the workers have got over the past 18 months, and may get in the next 12 months, will be real increases and will not be taken from them by any undue price increases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 16, to delete &ldquo;declaring&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment notified by the parliamentary draftsman.  The word &ldquo;declaring&rdquo; is not necessary in the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>22B.  The Minister may from time to time by order provide for the establishment, constitution and powers of bodies of persons to advise him in relation to any or all or some of the powers and functions for the time being conferred on the Minister by virtue of this Part.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This enables the Minister to set up a body or bodies, and in that context I should like to explain that the prices advisory committees which it is now possible for the Minister to set up are limited in their personnel to be selected from a panel of 12 people&mdash; a panel already in existence under the Act.  They are limited in their numbers to no fewer than three and no more than five.  This section enables the Minister to set up a body without limitation in numbers, or without any restriction on personnel, and in the order or appointment, the Minister can give them whatever powers he possesses under the Act&mdash;powers to summon witnesses, to examine on oath, <Col N="1809" /> and any such powers necessary in any particular case or set of circumstances. This is looking for more flexibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the principle of the Minister's suggestion, but there is one question in our minds as to the powers of these bodies.  What are the limitations that can be put on the powers of these bodies?  The Minister seems to have indicated that they can have any sort of powers.  Will they have powers to go in to a business premises and demand to see the books?  Is there merely a limitation in the ordinary common law that would debar him from giving very excessive powers or is he bound by the powers enshrined in the Bill?  We would want a rather more detailed explanation of the powers of these bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but these are not limited powers.  As the Deputy knows, they are quite extensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we know sufficient about this.  In any case, prices advisory bodies have not been eminently successful since 1958. There was provision for prices advisory committees in the 1958 Act, I think.  A panel was established by the Minister and, incidentally, he invited the trade union movement to nominate, I think, two members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The panel is created on a sectional or vocational basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1810" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to go back a little.  He invited the Trade Union Congress to nominate members over a number of years and I think it was for about three years.  None of the nominees submitted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was ever asked to act, so much so that they told the Minister they were resigning and did in fact resign.  In recent times, that is, since the introduction of the turnover tax, these Prices Advisory Committees were reconstituted and the Trade Union Congress did supply at least one nominee and they did investigate the price of soap, canned foods and houses. I think they were the three main items. I do not know what these advisory bodies will do.  Will they, as the Minister said in reply to Deputy Donegan, act only in accordance with the provisions of this temporary measure and have no other outside functions that would hold them, in accordance with the powers conferred on the Minister by order of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear in any case.  We would like to know if, in fact, they will be constituted as a tribunal which will be empowered to look for certain information and empowered to look into price increases in public, making their reports available to the public.  The Minister will note we have an amendment asking for a permanent tribunal.  This amendment is designed to have a prices tribunal established permanently, apart from any of these emergencies, because we believe there will always be an emergency as far as prices are concerned. This establishment of price advisory bodies is a temporary measure, so to speak.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate at this stage whether he would be prepared to accept our amendment for permanent establishment of price tribunals to act on the direction of the Minister where it is considered there are undue price increases, that is, without any emergency order being made by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is going back to the basic question of seeking these <Col N="1811" /> powers at all, back again to the Government philosophy in relation to prices in normal circumstances, which is that competition, if free and unhampered, is the best regulator of prices.</P>
      <P>This amending legislation is introduced by the Government because the Government foresee possible economic situations where temporary extra powers of this nature may be taken and may be useful.  So in this section the body set up would be for a temporary period by Government order. It may be extended by a continuation order for 6/12 to 18 months but certainly in a situation assessed by the Government to be an economic situation which warrants this interference. I have left it flexible and I have sought flexibility right through this amending legislation, but the type of body to be set up, called a tribunal, would hear evidence or demand documents and would have any of the powers the Minister has to hear this evidence in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Where in the Bill, or in this amendment, does it say they may sit in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make an order empowering them, just the same as I have for what I do.  In fact, I shall have to.  My private investigations are open to the public in this Parliament. I can by order say this body will be a tribunal to hear such and such a case in public.  They will have all the powers I would have in carrying out the investigations, powers given to me under section 22 (a) (i) (b) and (c). When I say I am making it flexible, apart from any tribunal investigating a particular case, I could set up a body which would advise me on the whole field of prices.  I said last night that I intended that my first act when I have the powers would be to investigate at once the distribution costs of meat and potatoes and, at the same time, to set up a body which would advise me on whatever other commodities should be investigated immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a function for a body which would not have the functions of a tribunal.  This section gives me flexibility <Col N="1812" /> in that I can set up a tribunal type of body, or an advisory body, or a body to direct my other investigations and, as I said before, the powers to investigate are the swift powers which a Minister can use at once, the powers of the Prices Advisory Committee which I am asking the Dáil to extend on a permanent basis, and the power to set up an investigating body to hear in public the case for or against price increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to whether the Minister has power to direct that the inquiry will be in public. Would the Minister point it out to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to specify it in an order.  You do not need power in the Act to do that.  There is nothing in law to say that an investigation carried out by the Minister must be secret.  It is the Minister who decides it is proper, or for the public good, or for any reason, that an investigation is better carried out in private or in public. There is nothing in the law to prevent me deciding what shall be done in private.  I mention the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; but there is nothing private or secret because investigations carried out are subject to Parliamentary Questions.</P>

I would understand a tribunal to be a judicial body which could in fact say that price is excessive and that the price should be fixed at such and such.  In that way the tribunal would be advising him but would be a judicial body.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to ask the Minister a question.  This amendment confers on the Minister the power to establish bodies and to provide for their constitution and powers.  I should like him to tell the House what powers he proposes to confer on these bodies. I presume he has in mind some general or definite powers.  I think that when power of this sort is being conferred on the Minister, he should give the House as much information about it as possible.  I was not here for all of the discussion on this amendment but since I came into the House, I do not think the Minister has made it clear what powers he proposes to confer on the proposed bodies.</P>

      <P>Our only problem concerns later on.  We are anxious that the Minister should be under no impression that, by selling this amendment to us, the later rather more ambitious improvement in the Bill which we suggest would go by the board; in other words, that the Minister would say to us: &ldquo;On the one hand, you provide now for temporary powers for me and these should be quite sufficient in the circumstances and I see no reason for your later tribunal.&rdquo; The only reason we would agree to support this amendment would be by regarding it as a frill, if the Minister wants additional frills, so to speak, on advisory bodies.  We have had rather unhappy experience of the operation of these bodies in the past, their secrecy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this is a departure but it has elements of the later tribunal we suggest.  We consider that the tribunal would be a more realistic proposition than this kind of temporary measure here suggested.  I am sure that by order, the Minister can provide most things under this Bill.  Our concern was to bring out in black and white what we should like this Bill properly to perform and to rescue it from the machinations of the Minister's mind on this matter.  I know that the Minister has these powers in the recesses of his mind.  We want to bring out accountability to Dáil Éireann for movement in prices.  The more this Bill contains an accountability clause the more successful and realistic the Bill will be.  Our anxiety is that this amendment should be seen in no way as removing the necessity for having this tribunal that we also wish to have included in this Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I want some clarification.  This is <Col N="1815" /> possibly the most important section in the Bill.  This is the executive arm of the Bill.  It seems to me, as far as I can glean from the Minister's rather scanty dissertation on the subject, that he means to set up two rather different things.  He means to set up advisory bodies on a vocational basis, purely advisory and, naturally, vocational, because they would cover different aspects of the economy.  They, I presume, would advise him on the aspect of it with which they are familiar.</P>
      <P>Am I to understand also, that apart from these numerous advisory bodies, the Minister would have one prices court, shall we call it, though somebody called it a tribunal?  If he is, will people give evidence there in public under oath and will rebutting evidence be allowed?  Will they have legal representation and, above all, will it be subject to appeal to a higher court and where would they have the appeal?</P>
      <P>Finally, who will determine the cases referred to the prices court?  Take an outside body who feel aggrieved and who make representations to the Minister and say they believe prices to be excessive and the matter is referred to the prices court.  Will that be a quasi-judicial body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>My microphone was covered and the Deputy did not hear what I said earlier.  When I was talking about people selected on a panel, I was talking about prices advisory committees already in existence but which are restricted in their numbers and the panel from which they can be chosen under the 1958 Act.  I want it, as it were, to set up bodies without restriction in relation to the numbers or the type of person on them.  In no part of this legislation am I seeking to transfer my responsibility.  It is in relation to my investigatory powers that I would have this body to be able to carry out in public and seek evidence under oath and seek and demand the production of documents and books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have confused the Deputy by my earlier remarks in relation to my powers.  These bodies should be set <Col N="1816" /> up to hear a case in the form of a body to advise me in the application of my powers under this Bill but in all cases the decisions must be made by the Minister.  It is his responsibility and there would not be an appeal from the Minister's decision.  It would not otherwise be possible to manage price control especially on the temporary basis on which we see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

I am seeking a flexible power which could be applied in many ways because, as everybody has acknowledged here this morning, the control of prices will be a very difficult task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but we are conscious of the disadvantages in a so-called free economy.  You could be courting ridicule to say at any stage that you could control prices here.  We wish to found a different type of system under which we would make the Minister's job easier in the future, if he is around then.  This is so flexible and can mean so many things that it creates a problem for us.  Our attitude to this Bill is to make it as effective as possible.  Admittedly, you cannot globally survey a prices measure in the economy we have but we should bring it down as much as possible to fundamentals to deal with particular situations and we should bring it down to black and white.</P>
      <P>To help to make this more effective, the Minister has powers under which he can do almost anything in any circumstances. In some of our amendments, we have suggested timing for different actions.  That is why we suggest a prices tribunal.  This advisory body can be a public hearing or a technical advisory panel.  What we had at the back of our minds was our experience with the prices advisory committees. The trade union movement was extremely disappointed.  Trade unionists were participating, so to speak, in an alibi that there was some machinery to deal with prices when in fact there was not.  There was no publicising of the affairs of these committees. Nobody knew how decisions were arrived at.  At the end, you merely had a bleak announcement that such and such a price increase could not be offset and had to take place.  I consider that 22B is so flexible at the moment that more information would certainly be required.  If the Minister wishes to turn it into a public body, he should suggest at this stage what his attitude is to our amendment for a prices tribunal.  If he says this could also be a public hearing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I have already referred to this change in the powers of the prices advisory committees in existence under the 1958 Act.  Under that Act their powers are limited.  I have a series of amendments which the draftsman tells me are necessary to put this on a permanent basis.  They are meant to extend the powers of these prices advisory committees.  At the moment they can investigate goods at manufacturer level, but not at the wholesale or retail levels except in a situation of emergency which causes a scarcity.  We seek to extend the powers of these committees to investigate prices and costs and services at all levels.  There is also an addition in the extent.  In the 1958 Act their investigations are limited to selling and services.  By definition, I want to add in &ldquo;works and processes.&rdquo; This arises from the extension of their other powers.  This first amendment is a definition amendment consequent on the extension of powers I seek for the prices advisory committees.</P>

      <P>In page 10, after subsection (1) to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) An inquiry under this Part of this Act shall be held in public and a person so affected by the inquiry will be entitled either to appear in person or be professionally represented.</P>
      <P>We put down this amendment for the purpose of seeing to it that a seller or manufacturer of goods who was the subject of a standstill order would be in a position to have the inquiry into price held in public and also to appear himself or be professionally represented.  It appears to me that the Minister's amendment No. 4, as he intends to implement it, would take care of the first part of our amendment. I would be interested now to know if it would be the Minister's intention, where he sets up a committee under amendment No. 4, to allow persons affected to be either professionally represented or to be present themselves, to make their own submissions on the relevant price.  If that were so, it would satisfy us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading these amendments, I got the impression that the Deputy felt that people would be on trial.  I see the application of this Bill as a fact-finding investigation and it would not put any person on trial. I am just wondering if the Deputy had that idea in his mind, that somebody would be on trial and would need to be represented.  It would not serve the purpose of the Bill if a person sent a professional representative on a defending basis.  If a person cannot come for good reason, everybody will accept that, but, generally, in relation to the whys and wherefores of price increases, I would prefer if the person responsible and dealing with it gave his own evidence.  Such investigation would be carried out by a body set up and &ldquo;publicly carrying out&rdquo; would cover that point.  The departmental <Col N="1824" /> investigations, of course, are subject to question here in the Dáil.  The inquiries may be in public or may not but I think the whole spirit of the Bill is that it should be fact-finding investigation rather than putting anybody in the position of defending himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but our anxiety is that a person might find himself affected by a price fixing order and would have no recourse to anywhere where he could make his case.  If the committee set up by the Minister under amendment No. 4 does not look for information from the seller or manufacturer affected, then that person has not the right to give them information. The Minister has indicated that either the committee or the departmental officials would be prepared to accept submissions from the person affected.  That suits us all right. The assurance that the departmental investigation is subject to question here which must be answered and that the committee investigation would be in public would further help us in our difficulty.  The Minister said to Deputy Corish, when amendment No. 4 was under discussion, that the investigations would be in public.  I understand him now as saying that they might be in public or they might be in private.  I should like the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>

      <P>There is no fixed rule. This would be a decision to be made by, I presume, a reasonable Minister. The investigations would be fact-finding as to the cause of prices, and so it would be almost essential to have the person primarily concerned there himself. There may be circumstances in which a man, for health or other reasons, would not be able to give evidence and certainly I would expect a Minister to behave reasonably and allow him to be represented but the idea of being professionally represented brings up the notion that the man is on trial and has to be protected by, say, the legal profession.  If that is what is in the Deputy's mind, I think this investigation would be on fact, not on the person's guilt or otherwise.</P>

      <P>May I take it what the Minister has in mind is that the appearance of an individual trader before the committee would be the exception rather than the general rule, that ordinarily for the purpose of furnishing facts, the Minister would look to the trade organisations but would be prepared to hear a specific person if that person applied to be heard?  Ordinarily, such information would be given by the professional staff of the organisation representing the group of persons concerned in the manufacture or distribution of the commodity being examined.</P>

In some cases the Minister or the body set up by him may think it desirable to require a person to give evidence but I imagine this would be more at manufacturer level where one person could influence prices.  In the sphere of trading, it is unlikely that one person would have a wide effect on prices and be called upon himself. However, power is being sought to call upon people to give evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after subsection (1) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>( ) A person affected by an order under this Part of this Act may appeal against such order to an Appeal Tribunal constituted as hereinafter set out.  The Appeal Tribunal provided under this Part of this Act shall consist of a Chairman nominated by the Chief Justice and of one representative nominated by the Federated Union of Employers and one representative nominated by the Irish Trade Union Congress.</P>
      <P>There should be an appeal in the case of a person who feels he has been improperly treated in respect of a prices standstill order or any such operation under this Bill.  This is the form of appeal board that we suggest would meet the case.  I am sure the Minister would agree that only a small number would be on the board, which would mean he would get a decision very quickly.  Even the Revenue Commissioners mentioned by Deputy Hogan cannot make a decision from which there is no appeal.  There is an appeal to the court.  We agree with the Minister that that would be an unwieldy procedure in this context.  Our suggestion is the appeal board of three as set out in the amendment.  This appeal board might never be asked to sit but it should be there.  It is possible, although I am not very good on that line of country, that without such an appeal board, some of the terms of the Bill may be unconstitutional as far as the individual citizen is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>On the surface, it would appear just that we should have an appeal but the orders mentioned in the Deputy's amendment are ministerial orders fixing prices, imposing a standstill on prices or charges or revoking a ministerial order.  The ones that are likely to give rise to appeal are those fixing prices or imposing a standstill.  This power is sought by the Government in circumstances where they regard it as essential to the economy to control prices.  It is not a permanent part of our normal, everyday <Col N="1830" /> existence.  An appeal beyond the Government in such circumstances would not seem to be logical.  It would also make the machinery slow and unwieldy.  I do not see the logic of having an appeal beyond the Government in the case where the Government are acting to protect the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government may be acting to protect the economy, as they think, but if a price is fixed for a commodity which means that a particular manufacturer, importer, wholesaler or retailer has to sell at less than the cost to him so that he is put out of business or suffers loss of business, then there should be an appeal against the decision that could bring about that state of affairs.  Our intention in putting down this amendment was to make this appeal board as simple and as small as possible, to make it so small that a decision would be forthcoming very quickly.  The Minister has described how he intends to make these advisory committees which he is setting up work, and it appears to me that in these committees agreement on prices may be got in 90 per cent of the cases with representatives of the producers, manufacturers and so on, before the price fixing order is made. It would be only in a very rare case that a company or citizens might find themselves in the position of being unable to carry on because of what they regarded as an error on the part of the advisory committee which advised the Minister and on whose advice the Minister acted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would do well to accept this amendment.  It would be wrong that people should have no appeal in these cases.  The Minister has qualified his statement in regard to the operation of these advisory committees in public.  They will work in public or in private or there may be a departmental investigation which is subject to question here.  He says that whether it is in public or private will depend on which is more suitable in the particular instance.  I can agree with him very much in that.  At the same time, one must face the fact that if an advisory committee is instructed <Col N="1831" /> by the Minister to sit in private and produces a price for a commodity in respect of which the Minister makes a price fixing order then a citizen, a company, or any other group of handlers or producers may find themselves with no public hearing of their case, a decision made and no right of appeal.  This seems to me to be going too far.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope&mdash;I think the Minister similarly hopes&mdash;that this legislation will be on the shelf in six months time and will never be used again. This is a crisis measure directed, of course, to the Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers and it would be wrong, I think, if any group should find themselves the subject of an order after an investigation behind closed doors and without any right of appeal.  If the Minister will not meet us, we will not withdraw this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more inclined to keep the responsibility with the Minister.  I cannot see any action by the Minister which would put a firm out of business.  I agree there should be appeal to the Minister but I do not see the implementation of these powers in the same way as the Deputy appears to see it.  Certainly I do not see any Minister taking action which would put a firm out of business. I refer to unreasonable action.  At the same time, appeal from the Minister, while one might think it would be used in the odd case only, could be used in every case to delay and to negative the effect of action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it would be used in every case.  One must remember that action under this Bill will be taken always in a time of political exigency, a time in which the Government are under heavy pressure because of balance of payments problems or other financial crises.  In that context, there will be the temptation on the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day to restrict prices to a lower level than might be perhaps financially desirable. The case I am worrying about is that in which the advisory committee at the <Col N="1832" /> behest of the Minister acts in private and produces a price which the producer or the manufacturer regards as uneconomic.  In those circumstances, I believe there should be appeal machinery.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 2, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Prices Act, 1958, is hereby amended by the insertion after Part III of the following Part:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Part IIIB.  Establishment of Prices Tribunal.</P>
      <P>23a (1) The Minister shall establish a Prices Tribunal consisting of seven members including a Chairman and Deputy Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> (2)  The Tribunal shall be empowered to do from time to time any or all or some of the following, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enquire at public investigations into:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the prices charged for a specified commodity or specified commodities or for any commodities as respects the prices for which the Tribunal is satisfied that an enquiry should be held.</P>
    <P>(ii) the charges made for rendering a specified service or specified services or for any services as respects the charges for which the Tribunal is satisfied that an enquiry should be held.</P>
    <P>(iii) the charges made for carrying out (other than under a contract of service) specified work or any work as respects the charges for which the Tribunal is satisfied that an enquiry should be held, and</P>
    <P>(iv) the charges made for carrying out (other than under a contract of service) a specified process or specified processes or any processes as respects the charges for which the Tribunal is satisfied that an enquiry should be held,</P>
    <P>(b) require any person to furnish to the Tribunal any information in his possession that the Tribunal may reasonably require for enabling it to exercise its functions under this Part,</P>
    <P>(c) require any person to furnish to the Tribunal any books, documents or records in his power, possession or control that the Tribunal may reasonably require for enabling it to function under this Part.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Tribunal shall publish a report on each enquiry held under the preceding subsection and shall, if it sees fit, make recommendations to the Minister on the matter.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may require the Tribunal to conduct an enquiry into <Col N="1835" /> the price charged for any commodity or service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In some of the changes already suggested we dealt more or less with the main provisions of this Bill.  We have made up our minds fully on the changes we should like to see in the Bill.  One of the principal changes we would like is investigation in public and we suggest that the investigating machinery should be a permanent feature of our economy.  This distinguishes our approach from that of either Fine Gael or the Government Party.  We are wholly behind the establishment of a permanent tribunal to investigate price increases.  We do not believe every single case would come before that tribunal, because, as the Minister has suggested, there will be a number of committees engaged more or less on investigation.  With all these extra powers and automatic notification, the Minister will have quite a file of information before him prior to any case being heard publicly before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>We regard it as of paramount importance to have hearings in public and, from that point of view, it is important that this should be written into the Bill.  We do not believe, like Fianna Fáil, that competition is enough.  Neither do we believe, like Fine Gael, that exhortation and persuasion are sufficient.  In the situation confronting us, we believe that for quite a period ahead the matter of prices will be one of increasing concern to us.  Therefore, we must, with the limitations of having to depend on the Government Party to implement these proposals, see to it that as far as possible our fundamental policy is carried out.  We must do our best to make this machinery effective and it is in this spirit we suggested the prices tribunal.  We feel it is essential if the Government are to be serious about controlling prices.  We do not believe that the previous section, 22B(4), is a realistic answer to the problem.  We have gone exhaustively into all the different forms of machinery and as a result we feel we should give our support to the particular proposal now before the House.</P>

      <P>When this was mentioned before, I tried to show the differences and similarities in the establishment of a prices tribunal as suggested by the Labour Party amendment and the establishment of a body under an earlier amendment of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. There is no essential difference in the powers of the body which the Labour Party want us to set up with powers to investigate prices of goods and services, power to require a person to furnish documents and books and records or to require a person to give evidence, power to publish a report.  Any of the bodies I have set up could be made into such a tribunal and given such powers.  There is no essential difference in their functioning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need it.  The essential difference is that the Labour Party want to have this on a permanent basis.  That is where we differ fundamentally.  I sought power to set up bodies such as this in circumstances where the Government decided an order was necessary for the sake of the economy.  There are restrictive matters in this amendment.  It limits the investigation power to one seven-member body as distinct from the variety of investigating machinery I sought, and got, from the Dáil this morning.  It would be restrictive in that sense, but the area of investigation and the type of investigation are the same.  The fundamental difference is in having a permanent tribunal which is something I cannot accept.  I have got permanent powers of investigating by extending the powers of the prices advisory committees. We have made a permanent change in the 1958 Act which will not be dependent on an order of the Government and I think that is all the power we need.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When introducing his Estimate, the Minister stated in so many words that he was adopting the long statement of his predecessor in office, that he was prepared to leave it at that and that if it was desired, he would repeat his predecessor's statement.  I gathered that he was completely satisfied with the state in which he found the Department of Defence and that he did not find it necessary to depart from the policy of his predecessor.  That is a pity because I do not think that the country in general is satisfied with the Department of Defence.  It is a Department which could be improved by a considerable amount of fresh thinking and a fresh approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor in introducing the Estimate paid tribute to our Defence Forces who served in the Congo and in Cyprus.  I wish to join in the tributes paid to those men and to say how much their sacrifices and services overseas have been appreciated by the people.  However, it is not sufficient that it should be left at that. The services of these men overseas, in some cases outstandingly meritorious service, exceptional gallantry, should be rewarded in some tangible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand no living Irish soldier who served in the Congo has been rewarded for exceptional bravery by way of promotion, special medal decoration or in any other way.  I further understand that a commission set up in 1962, presided over by Colonel Coogan, inquired into the Congo service and made recommendations. Has the Minister acted on those recommendations or has he given consideration to the reports submitted to him?  I am quite well aware that every Irish soldier who served in the United Nations Forces for 90 days is given a medal.  I am also aware that there is a roll of honour in the Church of the Sacred Heart, Arbour Hill, where the names of members who died while serving in the Congo are inscribed.  I am also aware that a special medal for <Col N="1840" /> exceptional meritorious service has been awarded to one soldier who sacrificed his life to save that of another, but I think some tangible recognition should be given to living soldiers, NCOs and men, who displayed exceptional bravery in the Congo.</P>
    <P>If we decide to do this, we will not be unique.  It is a fact that the Governments of Sweden and India have recognised and have rewarded exceptional meritorious service and exceptional bravery on the part of their soldiers serving in the Congo.  It is a fact that some of our officers, NCOs and men who have served in the Congo, who came back here, left the Army shortly afterwards.  That possibly would not happen if they had been given promotion in recognition of bravery or if they had been recognised in some other way.  I hope, therefore, the Minister will look into this suggestion and that he will in particular give serious consideration to the recommendation of the Coogan Commission.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this question of service with the UN, I propose to mention the cost of that service.  The overseas cost of service in the Congo was discharged by the UN.  I know from statements made in the House and elsewhere that the entire cost of the Cyprus forces&mdash;sending men there, keeping them there, equipping them and providing them with transport&mdash;is being borne by the people of this country without any contribution from the UN or anybody else.  The time has come when we should seriously consider whether we are being too generous in undertaking this service, this obligation, at considerable expense to ourselves.</P>
    <P>This year the Estimate provides for between £500,000 and £750,000 to cover the cost of sending those men to Cyprus, of keeping them there and of equipping them.  My opinion is that we have more than discharged our obligations to the preservation of world peace by making available men without being asked to do so at our own expense.  Speaking in round figures, we are responsible for and have provided either one-sixth or one-seventh of the total peace-preserving force in Cyprus. <Col N="1841" /> I also understand there is a substantial proportion of our entire armed forces &mdash;something between one-sixth and one-eighth&mdash;serving there.  It is to the credit of this small country that we should play our part, indeed more than our part, in the preservation of peace in these countries but it is going beyond what can reasonably be expected of us that we should be at a substantial loss in doing so.</P>
    <P>I understand that, the UN not being in a position to put up the necessary finances, several countries such as Britain, France and the US. are prepared to discharge the costs of these peace-preserving forces in Cyprus.  I should like the Minister to tell us about this when he is replying.  Indeed what I have just said was applicable when this Estimate was first introduced: I thought even at that stage this country should not be forking out millions of pounds of our resources. If that were true then, it is much truer now, having heard the Taoiseach's speech on the state of the economy last week, on the necessity for tightening our belts, for spending money only on essentials.</P>
    <P>Do not take me for one moment as saying that the sending of our soldiers to the Congo or Cyprus is not a very worthy and laudable project.  It is indeed.  It adds immensely to the prestige of the country that we should have done so, but I say that when the money to cover the expense involved is available from an outside source in an honourable way, it should be accepted.  I trust, therefore, the Minister will look into that aspect of our overseas service and will take it up with the Government. I trust the Government will see fit to accept recoupment of the outlay we have incurred.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word in a general way about the various barracks and the land attached to them in and around Dublin city.  When these barracks were built, it was necessary that they be located in and around the capital city of the country because transport was slow and if an emergency arose the troops would be primarily required in and around the capital city. That state of affairs has changed. <Col N="1842" /> Transportation and the movement of troops from one end of this island to another can be effected very quickly now.  Therefore, the time has come when we should consider the decentralisation of the troops and barracks in Dublin city.  I believe that there are six barracks in and around Dublin city with about 154 acres of land attached to them.  Most of these buildings are old and are probably not very well suited for housing soldiers in up-to-date conditions in this modern age. We could, by the sale of some of these buildings, attend to two things at the same time.  We could provide building space where industrial development in and around the city of Dublin could take place.  We could transfer the troops outside the city even a considerable distance to more suitable buildings.</P>
    <P>At Question Time last week the Naval Service came up for mention.  I gathered from the Minister's reply to a question that since the introduction of the Estimate, and since he assumed office as Minister for Defence, he has been reconsidering the position of the Naval Service.  Deputy Booth, when he spoke on this Estimate in March last, said our Naval Service is a joke at the present time.  We should face up to that and ensure that the position is improved.</P>
    <P>The three-mile fishing limit has been extended to six miles by the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, 1964, and within the foreseeable future the fishing limit will be extended to twelve miles.  As I understand it, the entire fleet, if one might be pardoned for calling it so, in regard to fishery protection along the coast consists of three corvettes.  These corvettes were built for the British in 1940-1941.  They saw service during the war and we bought them, I understand, in 1947, or thereabouts. The best information I could get on the subject tells me that these vessels are entirely unsuitable for fishery protection work at the moment. I am told they are completely unsuitable because of their age and because they are what is known as deep drift vessels which cannot get into many of our harbours.  They are slow and require a large crew.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, when <Col N="1843" /> introducing his Estimates, said he found it extremely difficult to maintain the personnel in the Naval Service.  If my information is correct, that is not any wonder, I am told the corvettes in which these men are asked to serve are uncomfortable vessels.  They require a comparatively large crew and, indeed, they are so uncomfortable that they are bound to drive men out of the service.  From a practical point of view, the speed of trawlers which are likely to infringe our fishing rights, I am told, has been increased to 15 knots and they can trawl at 10 knots.  It is a fact that the speed of these corvettes is inadequate to pursue or arrest any of these trawlers which can trawl at ten knots.</P>
    <P>We should not be extending our exclusive fishing limits to six miles and then 12 miles unless we are prepared to provide suitable vessels to enforce our exclusive rights in these limits.  I am told that such vessels are available and can be procured.  Again, the Minister should look into this aspect of his Department and see to it that our exclusive fishing rights are protected and ensure that such corvettes and other types of vessels as are necessary, are procured and are maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say a lot on pensions because there are other speakers to come after me who will deal with that subject.  In his few short remarks on the previous day the Minister said that the question of the abatement of Defence Force pensions where the recipients are in employment if remunerated from public funds would come up for consideration.  We note that since the Dáil was elected, the Pensions Abatement Bill was introduced and, by virtue of that, civil servants who leave the service to take up other State or semi-State employment will not have their pensions abated.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister proposes doing something about this matter so far as the Army personnel are concerned.  I would like the Minister now to give us an assurance that the Army personnel will be treated at least as generously as Civil Service <Col N="1844" /> personnel have been treated under the Bill which has gone through the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That was not clear from the Minister's previous statement.  If that is true, I am glad to hear it.</P>
      <P>There is another hardy annual that crops up here and that is the question of special allowances payable to people who hold an IRA medal.  Notwithstanding the fact that I think the Minister will not agree with what I am going to say now, I am strongly of the opinion that these people are not treated generously.  The means test is too severe.  Very few of these people are left now, and they are getting fewer and fewer every year. Most of them now qualify for special allowances, provided they have a medal, on the question of age alone. The question of ill-health has become less of a factor because most of them have reached the age when they are unable to provide for themselves or work.</P>
      <P>A suggestion has been made to me that the means test should be abolished altogether.  I might not go just as far as to urge the Minister to abolish the means test altogether.  That might be going too far, but it should be relaxed, and considerably relaxed, and should not be carried out on the same basis as the means test for old age pensions.  These special allowances should be paid on a much more liberal basis, to ensure that these people are not only able to keep body and soul together, but are able to live out their lives in comparative luxury.  I would go so far, and I do not think we would be going too far if we went so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a note here which is a little out of date, but it is no harm to mention it.  It deals with the provision of <Col N="1845" /> Army lorries during the transport strike.  Happily, that strike is over, and let us hope they will not be wanted again for that purpose for a long time. It is very seldom that our Army are given the opportunity of proving themselves in a practical way.  I suppose, again, we should be grateful for that. When an emergency like a national transport strike occurs, it should be possible to provide Army lorries at very short notice.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to whether the Government did not provide the Army lorries for a considerable time as a matter of policy, or whether it took the Army as long as it did to get the lorries on the road.  If it took the lorries that length of time&mdash;I think it was about a fortnight&mdash;to get the lorries on the road, that is a reflection on the Army.  It should have been possible to provide them much sooner.  I think the announcement was made at the end of one week that the lorries would be provided on the following Friday.  I should like to hear the Minister on that matter.  As I said, if it took so long to put the lorries on the road, I am afraid that is a reflection on the Army or on the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a brief word or two about the FCA.  The FCA is run on a purely voluntary basis.  Unlike its counterpart in England, I think the men are not paid anything at all while training, that is, while training at home.  I know they are paid Army rates of pay and a small gratuity while in camp.  The Minister should consider paying these men so much per hour while they are training.  I think that should be done. It would provide a more efficient force, and would give the officers more control over the men.  I think they do two hours training per week with a field-day of four hours per month.  It would not cost very much to pay them something, and if that were done, I think it would have the effect of keeping up membership.  I understand that to qualify for a grant a company must have 150 men on the roll.  I am informed that at the end of the year there is sometimes an all-out effort to build up the strength to 150 men, <Col N="1846" /> without regard to the type or quality of the men recruited.  It is just kept up in order to qualify as a unit.</P>
    <P>I also understand that there are complaints about the type of uniform, that it is unattractive to the extent that some men are ashamed of it.  That is something that should be looked into and improved.  There are complaints, too, that in some places there is not an open or long-range firing range within a distance of 40 miles, and that they have to travel up to 14 or 15 miles for short range firing.  Either the FCA should be taken seriously and equipped suitably as a part-time force or it should be disbanded.  I think that would be a mistake.  The FCA performs a very useful function, but it should be properly equipped and properly remunerated on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>I am told also that the FCA complains that it is not given proper equipment for training.  For example, I understand that if there is a firing competition, let us say, with Gustaf guns, the men do not see the guns, or have an opportunity of using them, until the actual day of the competition.  This is hard to believe, but if it is true it does not make sense.</P>
    <P>These are points that occur to me and which I put to the Minister for his attention.  I trust he will look into it. There is one specific case I have been asked to deal with of a man who has served in the Army for more than 31 years.  There cannot have been many such men in the past, but now that the age limit has been extended, there may perhaps be a good many of them. When a soldier's qualifying service is 22 years or more, the pension payable to him is increased by 1/- per week in respect of each year of his qualifying service in excess of 21 years, but not in excess of 31 years.  I am convinced that what I have just stated is accurate, and I fail to see why the 1/- per week should stop at 31 years.  If a man is being kept on in the Army for more than 31 years, the 1/- per week&mdash;or whatever the rate per week is that is added on for pension purposes &mdash; should be continued to be added on until he leaves the Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> I have a feeling this state of affairs was brought about before the retiring age was increased but if it is an oversight of that sort, it is an oversight that should be remedied, and remedied retrospectively, to cover people who have left the Army and who are not entitled to this very small, if not miserable, addition to their salary.  On that I shall conclude and I hope the Minister will bring some new thinking into his Department and that he will brighten and shake it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  Being a colleague of mine from County Meath, I am glad to see him in that position.  I know he is interested in the welfare of the Army and that conditions in the Army are bound to reflect that interest over the next few years.  In passing, I should also like to say, casting no reflection on Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, how sorry I am that the person making the case today for Fine Gael was not the former Deputy Seán MacEoin who made the case for many years.  I hope he has completely recovered.  His contribution to the debate on this Estimate was something to which we all listened with great attention.</P>
      <P>Because of the fact that this is a resubmitted Estimate, I do not propose to detain the House or the Minister very long.  I intend to refer to a few matters which were not referred to, by me anyway, on the previous occasion and which I think will bear reference now.  I shall take them as I have got them.</P>
      <P>First of all, the question of pensions has been mentioned.  One of the things I cannot understand is why we have not yet reached the stage at which the pensions of those who retired in years gone by, and who still have to live up to a certain standard, are not brought up to the pension level of those retiring at the present time.  I hope the new Minister will pay attention to that and to the lot of the old-time soldiers who have been out of the Army for a considerable period and who cannot be said to have anything like a decent pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> Again, would the Minister consider doing something about a gratuity as well as a pension for NCOs and men?  A gratuity is given to officers after their long service but no gratuity is given to NCOs and men after a long period of time.  Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan</i>) said it was a period of 31 years but I know people who have been in the Army longer than that.  They get no gratuity after 31 years service but they get a pension. I think it is about time they were put on the same basis as officers.</P>
    <P>The good old story of the Army uniform comes up every time in the debate on the Estimate.  A certain number of improvements have been made by the Army authorities but a lot of attention is still needed in this regard.  Is it too much to ask that an effort be made in 1965 to dress our soldiers properly?</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about those who went to the Congo and to Cyprus.  It is grand to be able to point to these things and say that our soldiers went out there and were of the best.  I do not think the role of the Irish soldier should be gauged or measured by what he did or did not do in the Congo or Cyprus.  Irish soldiers are recruited here for the purpose of serving this country.  The one thing that annoys me, and has always annoyed me since my own time in the Army, is the fact that while there is an emergency, soldiers are wonderful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and when the emergency is over, people do not like to be seen associating with them in uniform.  It is too bad that should be so.  Even now the novelty of the Congo and Cyprus is wearing off and the wonderful reception given to soldiers coming back from the Congo is forgotten.  We are bringing them in now in the small hours of the morning and we do not want people to know they are coming back.  They would not get much of a reception anyhow.  I honestly feel the people of this country need a good kick because of the way they are treating the members of the Defence Forces.  I think <Col N="1849" /> young men particularly who join the Army and who volunteer for service in this country are entitled to the greatest respect they can get.  They have not been getting it.  I think the Minister should try to have that respect instilled into the people of the country and he will get the thanks of the serving soldiers and of those who were formerly in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The pay of the serving soldier has been improved somewhat over the past year or so and I hope to see it improved still more. Men will be encouraged to join the Army because the rate of pay they will get will be comparable with what they would get in outside employment.  That should be the aim and it is not too much to ask that that should be done. We are moving slowly in that direction but we still have a long way to go. The young single man starting off has a long way to go compared with his counterpart in civilian life.  If we want to induce men into the Army, we must encourage them to come in and nothing will encourage them as much as LSD.</P>
      <P>With regard to the strength of the Army, I have crossed swords on this question with the Minister and his predecessor.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how the figure of over 7,000 NCOs and men and over 1,000 officers can be given as the present strength of the Army.  There is a twist somewhere in this which I hope the Minister will be able to straighten out for me.  Does the Minister state that the number of people at present serving in the Regular Army is over 7,000 NCOs and men and that the number of officers is over 1,000?</P>

      <P>I am absolutely amazed because I have a fair idea of how they are scattered around the country.  I have been doing arithmetic, <Col N="1850" /> and it does not add up to 8,000.  If the Minister says that is the situation.  I accept his word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter which has caused discontent. It is the question of promotion.  I think a man in the Army should be promoted according to his record.  If his record is bad, he should not be in the Army; and if his record is not good, he should not get promotion, no matter what shade of political opinion he has. Nobody from the Minister down should attempt to interfere with promotion in the Army and nobody should tell the Army authorities that a man must get promotion because he was driving a car for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael at the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we do not want to see civilians interfering with Army promotion.  That is the way it was, and that is the way it should remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pension abatement was mentioned by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan).</i> The Minister says they will get the very same treatment as those in other branches in civilian life.  That is not enough.  During the discussion on the Pensions Abatement Bill, it was eventually proved that there was one man, an officer of this House, who was the only person affected by the date of retrospection and because of that, he was not included to the same extent as everybody else.  The Minister would not be breaking his heart if he went back to 1st February, 1964, which is the date on which the general Civil Service increases were granted, and applied the abatement to this particular person with effect from that date. Then, everybody would be happy.  If a number of people were involved in <Col N="1851" /> the Minister's responsibility it would be one thing but only one person is involved here.  Therefore, the Minister should see to it that it is attended to.</P>
    <P>Special allowances have been referred to.  Again, it is a subject on which I have very strong views.  If somebody qualified, because of Army service, for a special allowance&mdash;and that person must be in dire hardship before he would qualify&mdash;and if he is fortunate enough to get some temporary improvement in his income, I think it is a shocking thing to send down an official to re-investigate that person's income and deprive him of a few shillings which do not mean the snap of the fingers to the Department but which mean an awful lot to the person concerned.  I have in mind one particular man who was a tailor in his young days.  He was in very bad health and, because of that, he was unable to carry on as a tailor.  He got temporary work round the town patching clothes. Eventually, he got a special allowance. Recently, I discovered that an official of the Department re-investigated the case of this man.  Because, on the day on which the re-investigation took place, the person concerned was found patching somebody's suit, for which he got about 2/6 d, his special allowance was terminated.  We say that these things do not happen.  I can give positive proof that this is so.  It is just too bad when people like that who did serve the country when men were needed should have to stop people in the street such as myself and the Minister and other persons to ask for a few shillings to buy a meal because the State would not face its responsibilities. It is a disgraceful situation which should not be allowed to continue.  I do not want to say anything more about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the men who have been discharged, and particularly those who have had service overseas, I think the Army should take greater interest in the employment position of those people.  ONE did, for quite a considerable time, attempt to find employment for them.  They got very little co-operation in their later years <Col N="1852" /> from the Army authorities.  We have now reached the stage where people who, for one reason or another, are leaving the Army are very often unable to find employment in this country and have to emigrate.  There was that infamous incident of the Congo hero who was lauded by everybody in O'Connell Street, Dublin, when he came home but who could not get even a labourer's job in the Office of Public Works when he came back here despite the rosy promises made to him.  We think and I think that there should be more co-operation between the Army and ONE. People leaving the Army should be directed to ONE and told to contact that organisation and an effort should be made to recommend them for employment. A lot of them could get good jobs if they could get assistance but they are not getting that assistance.</P>
    <P>A question which was before us here for a long time was that of helicopters. There was the implication that anybody who said that helicopters should be obtained for the Army was talking through his hat.  They have been obtained and they are doing an excellent job.  We should get more of them.  We were told that a nest of three is necessary in order to make one operative.  We are badly off for that type of machine and we require some more of them not alone for fishery protection but for humanitarian purposes.</P>
    <P>What Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan said about the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is true.  The wastage is colossal. The number of people who join and to whom uniforms are issued and who then turn up only a few times afterwards is colossal.  There must be an answer to it.  If, as we claim, the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is an adjunct to the regular Army, then something should be done to try to make it a more permanent force.  Whether or not the answer to it would be more parades or a better type of uniform or even part-time pay which might attract some people and which might not attract others, I do not know.  The Minister should have a complete investigation into the matter.  I honestly <Col N="1853" /> believe that, at the present time, apart from a small number of dedicated people in each area who have been in the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil since its inception and who are keenly interested in keeping it going, and a number of army officers and NCOs who are trying to train the men, the majority of those associated with the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil will never make soldiers because there is absolutely no incentive to them to try to become soldiers.  Therefore, I should be very grateful if the Minister would make an attempt to do more about this important matter.  During the latter days of the Emergency, we all know that the Local Defence Force, which subsequently became the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, was a very useful arm of the Army and it could be the same again but that will not be possible if we do not do something about the haphazard way in which it is at present run.</P>
    <P>I shall not say anything about Civil Defence.  I gave my full comment on it. I said everything I wanted to say when this was discussed here before.  I hope the position has improved.</P>

      <P>I should like to add to what has been said by Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan and Deputy James Tully, with a lot of which I agree.  I believe it is necessary that the new Minister for Defence should be aware of the problems that confront the Army.  There are many irritating factors which are causing dissension and, in fact, causing young men to leave the Army at a time when their services are needed.  This is one section of the service in which many improvements can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many improvements and new thinking are necessary.  The thinking up to now has been along the line away back in 1922.  I believe that this line of thought should now be <Col N="1854" /> abolished and that there should be a new line of thought.  No doubt, many improvements have been brought about in recent years but too many of them misfired because there was no proper understanding of the factors involved. The officers, the brass hats, who in many cases dictated the terms, were out of touch with the private soldiers and the NCOs.  The commissions or committees set up to advise should include NCOs and ex-servicemen who are fully conversant with the situation.  I feel that so long as the Civil Service and the brass hats continue to dictate, then many small irritating factors will continue to be lost sight of and the efficiency of the service will not increase.</P>
    <P>The question of the private soldier is in immediate need of attention.  If there were no privates there would be no generals and whereas there are many generals it is much more difficult to get a private soldier.  I feel that very much more must be done to better the lot of the private soldier. When he joins the Army, he reaches the 3-star stage in one year and then, after two increments, there is no further incentive for him.  I feel it is necessary that the lot of the private soldier should be examined comprehensively. I would say that right away the Minister should make an order that the private soldier will no longer be used as an officer's orderly in married quarters.  This degrading situation has caused many men to desert.  They have been used for all sorts of services in married quarters.  I feel that the day has come when that must be abolished so that the private soldier will not have to polish and scrub in married quarters.  The most potent weapon in the Army is the tongue of the officer's wife when a private soldier is servicing the officer's quarters.  That particular service should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>At the moment NCOs and privates have 14 days' leave.  That should be increased.  It would not cost the State one penny.  These people are on call for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at a time when the rest of the community, industry and elsewhere, are <Col N="1855" /> working a five day week.  Therefore, it is desirable that their leave should be increased to bring them somewhere in line with the remainder of the community. An officer gets 42 days' leave and the private soldier and NCO 14 days' leave.  This concession would assist private soldiers and NCOs in many ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an increase last year of £5.2 million in the net external assets of the banking system and of departmental funds.  In comparing net external assets for past years, it is usual to use the December figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy must be aware that, except for a slight fall of £.3 million in 1960, the external assets increased steadily from 1957 to 1964 inclusive, adding £59.1 million over those eight years.  This year these assets have fallen each month in succession to the extent <Col N="1856" /> that they were reduced by £33.5 million between December, 1964 and May, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>While I have no official information on the matter, I understand that an application has been made to the Dublin Corporation for planning permission to erect an office block on the site of the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for regret that public support for the live theatre has diminished in Dublin, as in many other cities, and that, in consequence, this situation has arisen in regard to the Gaiety Theatre.  Public moneys are, however, already heavily committed to cultural objectives in Dublin, including the re-building of the Abbey Theatre and the erection of the Kennedy Memorial Hall.  Financial conditions at present make it extremely difficult to accept any addition to these commitments, particularly in relation to an individual theatre.  I should add that my predecessor had consultations with leading dramatic groups and other interested persons on the possibility of some State support for the professional theatre in the country as a whole.  I have been having similar consultations and I propose to continue them.  I cannot say, however, at this stage what the outcome is likely to be.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 21 and 22 together.  The factual information sought is in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the first part of Question 22, as a result of the long drawn out period during which eighth round revisions were being considered and effected, a number of disparities and anomalies arose when later settlements outside the Civil Service diverged widely from those made at an early stage.  In outside employment the situation was restored by certain subsequent adjustments, for example, the Labour Court's Recommendation No. 1712 which revised the eighth round settlement for Bord na Móna clerical staff.  In the Civil Service the clerical grades were among the first to effect eighth round settlements in <Col N="1870" /> 1961 and, when much higher rates began to emerge outside, these grades pressed claims for corresponding revisions. The Post Office Clerks' claim, which was &ldquo;based primarily on the principle of fair comparison with the rates of pay in operation in good comparable employment outside the Civil Service&rdquo;, was the first to be dealt with and early in 1964 the Civil Service Arbitration Board awarded a revised scale, with effect from 1st October, 1963.  The findings in this and other cases indicated that the Board accepted that the status of the grades concerned had deteriorated by reference to the terms of comparable outside employment and claims of this type came for convenience to be described as &ldquo;status&rdquo; claims.</P>
    <P>Adjustments of eighth round settlements in the Civil Service, in common with the earlier adjustments outside which gave rise to them, carry the ninth round addition of 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>MINIMUM and maximum of the standard rates of pay for general service grades in the civil service on 1 January in the years indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether Dublin Corporation have received an application for planning permission for the redevelopment of the site of the Gaiety Theatre which would entail the demolition of the theatre; if he will state the statutory powers available to the corporation to prevent the closure of the theatre; and if, having regard to the desirability of having an adequate number of places for public entertainment and education, particularly in the nation's capital city, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Dublin Corporation that on Tuesday last they received an application for outline permission for the erection of an office block on a site at 46-50 South King Street, the site of the Gaiety Theatre.  If there are objections of a planning nature to the redevelopment proposed, permission may be refused by the planning authority but this would not prevent the closure or demolition of the theatre.  Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a planning authority may include in their development plan an objective for the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  The demolition of buildings is not normally subject to planning control but the exemption does not apply in the case of any particular building which is the subject of a preservation objective.  In the interim period prior to the making of a development plan, demolition would be subject to planning control if the planning authority by resolution declare the preservation of the building <Col N="1888" /> to be an objective which they propose to include in their development plan.  The application of these provisions in the present case is a matter for Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>My statement of 15th June set out the steps taken by me, in consultation with the building societies and other interests, to ensure that available capital resources for the financing of private housing are used to the best advantage.  I understand that the agreed arrangements are working well and are helping to relieve pressure on the building societies, who, I am informed, are clearing off their backlog of applications at a good rate.</P>
      <P>The increased limits which I introduced in respect of local authority house purchase loans are now being operated by both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  I understand that, following recommendations made by me, the previous restrictions as to ground rent and residence qualification have been removed and that there is already a marked increase in the number of loan applications being dealt with by these authorities.</P>
      <P>The provision of direct Government assistance to the building societies is not contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and the information which he says he has, is the Minister not aware that several applicants whose loans were approved at the beginning of 1965 have been told that the money will not be made available to them until November, 1965, at the earliest? Having regard to this, would the Minister not, as an emergency step, make available capital in the meanwhile and be repaid by the society in November when the money will become available to the society?  Surely there is at least £1 million left in the kitty to deal with the housing crisis or are we so bankrupt that all housing must stop until the Government get going again when they borrow the money from abroad on unknown terms?</P>

It is the practice to object to at least one surety in order to delay action.</P>

      <P>The practice of local authorities in this regard is purely one they have taken on themselves.  If restrictions are being applied that are unduly oppressive in regard to the issue of loans, I should like to get details of them.  No instructions whatever of the nature suggested by the Deputy have issued from my Department to any local authority.  In fact, the contrary is the case.  We have been giving instructions and advice to them to operate these loans under the SDA having regard to limitation of the loan and the limitation as to the income, that only those conditions need be applied.

      <P>The Army Pensions Acts provide that where an application for a special allowance has been refused no further application shall be entertained within a period of 12 months from the date of refusal.  Under the Acts, however, I have discretion to entertain a further application made within 12 months after the refusal, if the applicant produces satisfactory evidence that he complies with the statutory conditions in regard to means and incapacity. Where an applicant has been turned down and produces such evidence within 12 months after the refusal his case is reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I have received no communication from the Donegal Game Council.  The arrangements made recently apply to all nonresidents, and are not confined to persons coming from the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Any concern about the new arrangements must, I feel, be based on a misunderstanding.  The purpose of the new arrangements is to avoid inconvenience and delay in the case of visitors who fail to apply in time to my Department for firearm certificates. These certificates are normally applied for in advance to my Department, and are issued by post without restriction for shotguns and sporting rifles, subject to payment of the prescribed fee. Under the new arrangements, officers of the Revenue Commissioners keep a small supply of firearm certificates at the various entry points, and issue them, so to speak &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo;, to visitors who had left their applications too late to enable them to be issued direct by my Department.  The new arrangements provide a reasonable facility for visitors by enabling late applications to be dealt with in a businesslike manner.</P>

Plans were subsequently made to provide 13 satellite transposers in areas where the surveys showed that they were essential. Some of these transposers have already been brought into operation and it is hoped that the remainder will be provided by the end of the present year.  The Authority realises that, inevitably, there will still be small pockets of poor reception, like part of the town of Fermoy.  Disproportionately heavy expenditure would be involved in filling in many of these small areas at this stage but the Authority intends to review the whole position <Col N="1912" /> when the present satellite transposer programme has been completed.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,959,800 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain Services administered by that Office; for the Pay and Expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Defence).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to consider the question of an extension of annual leave for NCOs and men.  I <Col N="1915" /> feel also that consideration should be given to the matter of good conduct pay.  At the moment, the private soldier who reaches the maximum pay after ten years has no incentive to soldier on.  Good conduct pay would give him that incentive.  It would be good for his morale and for the Army in general.  I suggest also that the Minister reconsider the question of grade pay. Its abolition was disastrous and there are good grounds for its reintroduction. It would lead to more efficiency in these groups.  I have particularly in mind in this respect Army drivers, who do a substantial amount of extra duty, particularly during weekends in connection with the FCA.  They are responsible for the transport of important groups of between 30 and 40 men and their services are worth something more than those of ordinary soldiers.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of children's allowances, an officer's child who is receiving full-time education qualifies up to the age of 21 years but in the case of an NCO or a man, it ceases when a boy is 16 or a girl 18 years.  Apparently, according to the framers of this scheme, the NCO and man were not supposed to have children educated at university level.  I submit that where the child of an NCO or man is receiving full-time education at university level, the qualification for children's allowances should extend to the age of 21.  I feel sure the Minister is in sympathy with this suggestion.  After all, the NCO and man deserve all the assistance they can get to educate their children.</P>
      <P>On the question of suggestions for betterment, the NCO and man are not heeded at all by those in authority. It would cost nothing to consider the suggestions emanating from the lower ranks&mdash;to have them compiled and analysed and, in many cases, implemented. NCOs and many private soldiers are intelligent and are capable of offering suggestions which could be implemented for the good of the Army in general.  It is a fact that all the committees sitting in the Army are composed entirely of officers, to the exclusion of the lower ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> The Minister must give serious new consideration to the question of married quarters.  It is a matter of great importance which must be tackled with courage and understanding.  The present military quarters are completely undesirable and absolutely out of date.  Married quarters should be built outside the barracks.  I believe new married quarters are desirable and essential in Dublin.  The money for this should not come from the Defence Vote but from the capital Budget.  Immediate consideration should be given to the question of providing married quarters outside the barracks.  I know one married quarters where a civil servant, whose brother had a house, is living.  The brother sold the house and went back to the married quarters.  There are young soldiers living in one or two rooms in this city.  They are calling for proper accommodation.  These young soldiers who, through no fault of their own, have very bad living accommodation, should receive consideration.  This matter should be tackled at the earliest possible moment.  Some of the people who are at present in married quarters have given no service to the country at all.</P>
    <P>The occupants of married quarters in Arbour Hill Barracks need protection from people living in flats in the vicinity.  The married quarters are being damaged by some of those people.  The people living in the married quarters have to pay for the damage done, whether it is broken windows, damage to gutters or any other damage.  There should be some sort of control exercised over the people living in the flats adjacent to the married quarters.  The people living in the married quarters should get some sort of protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is quite right when he indicates that there should be a new approach to military stations, particularly the two major barracks of Cathal Brugha and Collins in Dublin.  Heating in those barracks is non-existent as are services. There is great need for reconstruction, proper billets and suitable accommodation for the men who live in those barracks.  They come from <Col N="1917" /> good homes and they should be given proper accommodation.</P>
    <P>The military barracks in Templemore was given over to the police force and was completely renovated. The people who serve in the armed forces are serving the nation honourably and they need proper accommodation. They need new billet accommodation. The question of protection from fall-out which will be necessary is a must and will come up for consideration in the future.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has already stated that the amount that would be procured from the sale of these barracks would be adequate to build a new barracks on the outer perimeter of the city.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about the apprenticeship school at Naas.  This is something which should be encouraged but, unfortunately, there are people in the area adjacent to the school who are enticing young men out of it by giving them the necessary finance to buy them out of the Army.  The money is repaid over a period of three or four years. These are bonded men and this is a very undesirable situation.  I feel that the cost of buying oneself out after having been trained in the apprenticeship school, before the nine years' service has been completed, should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is the joke of the century.  The material and the ships available are not adequate to meet the present day situation.  I believe this matter will have to get early consideration. The present type of ship, the corvette, is not at all suitable.  We need a dual purpose ship, something small with the necessary firing power.  That kind of ship will give proper protection to our fishing fleet.  They should also be equipped with the necessary technical aids which can be operated by both civilian or naval personnel.  These vessels could inform our fishing fleet of the shoal movements, etc.  It is not a defensive monster we want but something which will protect our fishermen and give them necessary information. The design of our ships will need to be improved to meet the new situation, particularly in regard to the 12 mile limit.  There may be difficulties in the <Col N="1918" /> operation of these matters but I do not believe they are insurmountable.  We should be able, in time, to produce something which will meet our requirements.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the question of medical facilities for the wives and children of NCOs and men.  Those people get facilities while they are in hospital but they are on their own when they come out.  They should certainly get some consideration when they come out of hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the gratuity on retirement, which was mentioned by Deputy Tully, this is an absolute necessity.  When a man reaches the end of the road he gets 21 days pre-discharge leave.  This, to my mind, is another joke.  If the man obtains employment in CIE he can avail of this leave to set himself up in civilian life, as was indicated during the introduction of this scheme.  If he gets a job in the barracks as a civilian, he cannot obtain resettlement leave.  That is necessary in order to help him to resettle himself during this vital period.  There should be no restriction.  Whether a man gets work in the barracks, CIE or anywhere else he should be given the facility.  No matter where the person gets work outside he should get the same facilities. It is wrong that any restriction should be placed on the person who gets civilian employment in a barracks. That is not the case in regard to officers.  It affects only NCOs and men.  The lower ranks are trampled on.  I feel a gratuity on retirement helps a man to get over many of the problems that arise on pre-discharge.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk about the Reserve.  Those who were in the Reserve service from 1927 to 1938 who do one month annual training get 12 guineas.  Those who were there immediately after the reorganisation of the Reserve get £9.  They get £5 after training and £4 in December. There are very many reservists in Britain who would like to do reserve training but they cannot afford to come home.  Those people get a warrant from Dublin Port or the <Col N="1919" /> nearest port to their home military station.  The question of travelling from Liverpool, Birmingham or London, or wherever they may be living, is not taken into consideration at the moment.  That matter should be taken into consideration if we are in earnest about this matter, if we wish to have an effective Reserve and if we want to keep it.</P>
    <P>The question of annual grants and promotion within the Reserve for NCOs and men should get some consideration from the Minister.  There were 20 commissioned from the ranks in 1962.  The concession those people got is approximately eight months' service. For pension purposes the matter was adjusted.  Many of them have served over 21 years.  Some of them have served 22 or 23 years.  It was indicated during the Emergency that the NCOs were the backbone of the Army.  They guided the inflow of the young officers into the Army at that time.  They were good men and have often been referred to as the backbone of the Army.  Those men were promoted because of necessity.  We now find that a young officer who came into the Army four years ago from the College with a commission, and is now 23 or 24 years of age, is receiving pay greater than that of the man who was serving before he was born and who is now commissioned.  The Minister should reconsider the situation and at least give them something that will enable them to reach the maximum on the captain's limit on retirement.  In the case of a sergeant-major commissioned with this group, he would be receiving £50 in excess of his pay if he remained an NCO.  There is much scope in this question, and there are so many factors involved that the fullest consideration should be given to it.</P>
    <P>In the case of officers, a retiring age of 54 or 56, or whatever it is, is too early.  I know there are difficulties in regard to promotion, but nevertheless they are in an unfortunate situation in relation to placement and resettlement. These men come out of the Army at the time when they are rearing their families and need assistance, without <Col N="1920" /> guidance or resettlement.  The question of resettlement must be tackled by the Department.  We are told that there is no problem, but I know there is a problem.  Resettlement is a personal and a human problem.  I have been dealing with the resettlement of ex-servicemen for 12 years and I know their problems, their needs and their wants.</P>
    <P>There is need for an advisory service to tell the men that when they reach a certain age, they will probably be in married quarters and will not be in a position to get a loan or a grant if they do not make arrangements now.  This advisory service should deal with career planning, education, housing and other matters.  At the moment when a private soldier or an NCO is released from the service, he should have something in excess of a builder's labourer, but when he reaches the labour market, he is ill equipped. Where do we find these people?  They are the petrol pump attendants throughout the country.  We must have career planning.  At the moment they have no technical assistance, and when they reach the labour market, they are in a very poor position indeed.</P>
    <P>We know that the local authority regulation is that a man is old when he is 40, and there is nothing for him but the petrol pumps.  That day is now gone, and the resettlement of our discharged personnel should be tackled in a realistic manner.  We have heard talk of a manpower authority in connection with other sectors, and there is no reason why our soldiers could not be dealt with in the same way.</P>
    <P>Disabled ex-servicemen are entitled to very special consideration.  The occupational hazards of a soldier's life are high.  We have seen in the Congo and elsewhere that they can receive injuries with long-term effects which debar them from gainful employment. I should like to pay a tribute to the ABF and the Organisation of National ex-Servicemen and other voluntary organisations for the help they have given.  I should also like to pay a tribute to the individuals and employers who seek to employ disabled ex-servicemen in their concerns.  There <Col N="1921" /> is much more I should like to say but I am conscious of the time squeeze which is on at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to consider each and every one of the items I have mentioned.  I shall raise all of these items again by way of question and supplementary question.  The Minister is a very reasonable man and having listened to the problems, I am sure he will take them into consideration.  Something needs to be done.  Let us forget the brass hats and remember the men with experience, the officers and NCO ranks, and the serving personnel who are on tap all the time to deal with the problems that could cause grave embarrassment and complete disruption at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a reasonable man, but the Minister is a Fianna Fáil Minister, and Fianna Fáil Ministers, and Fianna Fáil Governments take years, and years, and years, and years, to learn anything. Eventually after years, and years, and years, of being asked, begged, cajoled and threatened in this House, they do what they are asked to do during a recess.  We had the instance of the helicopters.  For years they were asked to provide helicopters.  The need for them was pointed out from the Fianna Fáil benches, from this side of the House, by my colleague, Deputy Esmonde, and myself.  We were told we had no use for helicopters, and that we could not have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was the near terrible tragedy off Carnsore Point when the lifeboat could not be launched in the most terrible seas, and the nearest available help was from one of Her Britannic Majesty's aircraft carriers in the Bristol Channel.  They put to sea and rescued the men in very trying conditions.  I may say that they were very badly thanked by the Minister's predecessor, and by the Minister for External Affairs, who should have had the ordinary, common, civilised decency to thank the British Admiralty and the captain and officers <Col N="1922" /> and men of the aircraft carrier.</P>
    <P>The Government then woke up and decided they would not be under a compliment to Her Britannic Majesty in the future and they bought three helicopters.  They bought them in France.  I want to say that the Minister's predecessor should have bought them from the British.  The reason is that we are out of balance in our balance of payments with France, and we are in balance with Great Britain. The British also think it worth while to buy our commodities.  In fact, they bought so many bullocks from us last year that they saved our balance of payments and the national exchequer. In future, when making such purchases, the Minister should give consideration to the countries that are in balance with us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs trotted off to the continent and got a 12 mile limit for our fisheries.  I approve of that.  I compliment him in regard to the matter of the base lines. I shall not go into detail but the base lines are very important.  We have seen our shores being plundered by Russians, Poles, Czechoslovakians, and God knows who else.  They do not have the type of trawler with which the Irish people are familiar&mdash;50 feet or 70 feet trawlers.  They have enormous ships with crews of 40 to 60, and if a shoal is running, they catch more fish in one night than would be caught in one of our well subsidised harbours in a year.</P>
    <P>We have three or four boats and may God forgive the Minister for Defence who bought them.  I should like to find the man who sold them to us.  We should employ him; he was a right salesman.  He sold us three dud corvettes. At the present day only one of them can go to sea.  So bad are the conditions on these corvettes that we cannot recruit our navy to full strength even if the other two corvettes were shipshape and seaworthy.  Yet this goes gaily on without anybody doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>The last speaker from the Fianna Fáil benches, I was glad to see, pointed it out to the Minister.  For years and years we have been pointing out to the Minister that we should have a cutter.</P>
    <P>But that will not do at all.  On 5th <Col N="1923" /> November, 1964, I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Defence in which I asked him:</P>
    <P>(a)  the number of armed ships or boats of his Department (1) in commission and (2) not in commission, (b)  the name or the number of each ship, and (c) the tonnage, horse power, draught, cruising speed, top speed, type of armament, and complement of each ship or boat.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not answer all of my question.  This is what he said:</P>
    <P>My Department has three armed ships, viz. <i>L.E. Macha, L.E. Maev</i> and <i>L.E. Cliona.</i> Owing to a shortage of key personnel, it is possible to have only one of them operational at any one time.</P>
    <P>That was admitted here in the House. Now we have another Minister trying to get us 12 miles more of coastline to protect, but nothing has been done about it.  If the Minister sends recruiting officers to any port recruiting men for the Irish Navy, nobody will join. I think it is a frightful state of affairs. The reason they will not join is that they know the conditions on these rusty old boats and know there are risks in going to sea on these boats which are liable to spring a leak any minute.</P>
    <P>I am chiding the Minister for not mentioning in his brief anything about cutters.  The Minister is not being nice to me and we are reasonably good friends.  But my spies now tell me that the Minister is now going to buy cutters, at least one.  When he would not make the announcement in the House, I might as well make it.  I believe the Minister is interested in the cutters that were recommended to him by members of his own Party and by people on this side of the House.  It is about time, and I shall tell the Minister the importance of this.</P>
    <P>I met a Dutchman in Dunmore East; there was a dispute which I was trying to fix up.  I was getting tired and I said: &ldquo;Damn the herring.&rdquo; He caught me and nearly broke my arm and said: &ldquo;Don't say that; we were prepared to <Col N="1924" /> go to war three times for that; you are a foolish people with your wonderful fisheries out there and you are letting everybody fish there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was told by the people in Dunmore East about the enormous armada that was there during those days, and these people were allowed to sweep our shores.  There is not an Irishman who would not be mad at that.  They were our fish in Irish fishery waters and were being plundered by this armada from all over Europe.  I saw ships that were arrested and brought into Waterford and they had thousands of barrels of fish that were all caught well inside the three-mile limit because it was there the shoals were running.  It was only a three-mile limit then; it is now 12 miles.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall not have to come back in October and ask about the replacement of the corvettes.  I hope the Minister will have them replaced and that he will not have to go all over Ireland looking for recruits.  If he gives men a reasonable rate of pay, there will be plenty of young men coming forward to go into the Irish Naval Service.</P>
    <P>So far as the Army is concerned and so far as the people of Ireland are concerned, the Army might as well be an underground force.  We never see them.  We read about them sometimes jumping at occasional horse shows.  That is only very occasionally. We have a great Army Jumping Team and the people would like to see them jumping in Tipperary, Cork, Waterford or Galway, and not always here in Dublin.  We always have them in the Dublin Show and indeed we are very proud of them there.  I would point out to the Minister that one of the things they are short of in the Jumping Team is horses.  We had a horse, The Gallow-glass, that had something wrong with his wind.  He was one of the best jumpers we had and the poor fellow had to go all around Europe.  He was dragged everywhere and never had any relief.  The only way you can have a great equitation school is to have lots of horses.  The best judges will be available and you must buy a fair share of horses.  We are well aware of <Col N="1925" /> the great promotion our Army Jumping Team can give this country. It is a wonderful thing to have an Army Jumping Team going abroad in competition with the world.  We can say to ourselves that we are taking our place proudly among the nations of the earth and winning these great trophies.  It was an occasion of pride when our Irish Jumping Team won at the great horse show in Rome and it was telecast at the time all over Europe on what was the equivalent of Eurovision.</P>
    <P>I shall say something I have said on this Estimate for years and years.  Many people notice these things and many people from abroad have noticed what I am going to tell the Minister.  If you go to a horse show abroad or here in Dublin, you will find all these immaculately-dressed riders representing the various countries and you will find well turned out men representing Ireland. But the men representing Ireland are professional soldiers who have to live on their salaries.  I have been pleading with the Minister that an extra subvention should be given to the actual jumping team to put them in the position of not having the old Martin Henry practice, but of being able to buy the best cut breeches possible and the best boots that can be made.  I am very proud to say this, and this is the second time I have said it to the Minister, that here in the city of Dublin we have excellent military tailors, but they are very expensive for the ordinary person.  When our men are being sent abroad each season, they should be in a position to be as well turned out as anybody else.  They should have spares because it rains even in foreign countries and a man can get drenched.  I saw one of our officers a few years ago at a show.  He had no change and he had to stand shivering but he came out and won.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter, which is a small one.</P>
    <P>We never see the Army in Waterford and we have very fine barracks there and the security force has been maintained in case of emergency.  I do not want a garrison kept in Waterford but would it not be a good thing if <Col N="1926" /> the Army were sent from Dublin to Kilkenny, from Kilkenny to Waterford, from Waterford to Cork, from Cork to Galway, and so on, as an exercise and as good an exercise as soldiers could have?</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say that we have the best of everything but our Army No. 1 Band is one of the finest military bands in the whole business.  It never comes down the country except on some enormous State occasion.  I do not see why it should not be made available in various centres of population, especially when agricultural shows, for example, are being held.</P>
    <P>We see the Army parading the streets of Dublin on St. Patrick's Day and we note that the only self-propelled gun in the whole Army is produced in public on that day.  I think it is only a museum piece.  It looks a very ferocious gun.  It is enormous and it looks all right coming down O'Connell Street.  But we have no self-propelled artillery.  I do not think there was a full battalion armed with fully automatic weapons until the occasion arose when we sent troops to the Congo when we were supplied with arms by other countries.</P>
    <P>It was stated here this afternoon that we have competitions in the Army in respect of the best Gustaf gun.  A lot of soldiers taking part in that competition never used a Gustaf gun until the actual competition and it has been said that there is not even enough ammunition for the Gustaf gun.  If we are to have an Army, we might as well have one with up-to-date weapons. We might as well have an Army that knows what modern field warfare is. The only way they can know all that is to have the proper equipment.  That has been denied to them by the Department of Defence for, I would say, the past six or eight years.</P>
    <P>On the subject of Army pensions, the case of a very old man who died some time ago and whom I knew as a boy comes to mind.  He was one of the most prominent Sinn Féiners in the south of Ireland, I would say.  His name is to be found in a whole lot of newspaper articles which one comes across and from which it is clear that he was one of the prominent people <Col N="1927" /> taking part in actions and occasions that are now part of our history.  This man was known to be an officer in the Old IRA.  He was a member of the IRB.  He was very prominent in 1916 and during the Anglo-Irish war and the Civil War.  He would have taken the part of the Government side at the time in the Civil War and later that was not in his favour.  He did not apply for his pension until very late but he had a miserable job.  When, at the end of his time, he did apply he got £7 a year or something like that because the referee did not recognise his services.  He is dead now and I shall say no more but that was an instance of a great injustice.  There are not an awful lot of those men around the country now and the Minister should take it upon himself to look after their interests.  They are all getting very old.  What needs to be done for them would not cost the State very much money.  In spite of the scares by the Taoiseach about a shortage of money, we are not short of money for those men and this is the time to be generous to them in the latter end of their days.</P>
    <P>I had occasion some years ago to come to Dublin in regard to the case of another Old IRA man who was vilely treated.  A special allowance was paid to him.  The money meant something to him but what meant more to him was the fact that he had been recognised.  It has actually put him on his feet and he was a better man physically after it.  I would ask the Minister to look after all that.</P>
    <P>Army lorries were sent to various areas during the recent bus strike. They were in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  We are taxpayers in Waterford city and Waterford city is spread out over a large area.  From some of the principal factories on one side of Waterford city to the other side, there is a distance of from six to seven miles.  I hope it will never happen to us any more but if anything like that should happen again I do not see why Army lorries should not be sent into Waterford from Kilkenny or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>The length of time and the hangover <Col N="1928" /> that occurred between the decision of the Government to put lorries on the streets and the actual time when the lorries appeared did not reflect credit on the Minister's Department or even on the Army.  Many of my constituents and people in other parts of the country said to me that if the Army were hit with an emergency they wondered how long it would take them to get out their transport.  We were of the opinion that with the discipline and with the running of military posts and barracks, everything was prepared and ready to move out at the drop of a hat.  I would say that there must be some laxity in that direction.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I come to one of my favourite topics.  The Minister is to buy cutters. I hope he buys enough of them.  They should positively be stationed in areas. There should be at least two cutters in some of the Donegal ports and a small station there.  Then, we come down the coast to where suitable places can be found and where our rivers are valuable along by Galway and the Kerry coast and along into Cork and Waterford and Wexford and then up along the east coast to Arklow, Howth and Clogherhead.  We must do this.  We must not allow these magnificent shores to be butchered and plundered.  I commend the Minister. I believe he will do it.  I look forward to that day.  I now give him notice that, if I am alive, I shall come in here when the Dáil reassembles and I shall roast him alive if he does not replace these three old rusty buckets.</P>

      <P>There are not so many of them left now and the least they should get is decent treatment from the Minister's Department.  I brought to the Minister's attention some months ago the case of a man living in a small farm away in the Doneraile Mountains.  He has to travel two miles on foot to get to his house, because you could not <Col N="1929" /> take any car into it.  It is a good house, which gave refuge to the men on the run.  This man played his part with them.  After eight months of full consideration of his application by the Department, he was awarded the princely sum of £9 per year or 5d per day. That was his reward at the end of his days for his service to this nation in her hour of need.</P>
      <P>A man is not entitled to this allowance unless he has a medal or a medal with bar for active service.  But there is a re-investigation into medals given 20 years ago and an attempt to find out any means by which the man can be deprived of his right.  In this particular case, I am informed that another gentleman has paddled in the long boreen for another look.  It is about three months since I had a letter from the Minister's Department telling me this gentleman from Social Welfare was taking a look.  The man concerned has heard nothing since.  I suppose they are hoping he will die.</P>

      <P>I will deal with you in a minute.  We heard Deputy Tully talking about the treatment men got after the Emergency.  It is very bad recruiting policy for the young people to see the manner in which the old lads were treated&mdash;those who came out without any pay to offer their lives for the protection and safety of this country. The Minister should deal with this at once and deal with it generously. This man, who was offered the insult of 5d per day, was found after a full investigation to be crippled and unable to work.  The bit of mountain was totted up.  If the civil servant who did the totting up was landed down there for a couple of months, his outlook on life would be changed altogether. That is what should be done.  The gentlemen who do the investigating should be compelled to live in that man's position for a period and made to learn the hard way the same as that man did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we will have a holiday now after another fortnight or three weeks.  When that holiday comes, I <Col N="1930" /> suggest the Minister take Deputy Lynch with him and go for a trip aboard the <i>Macha.</i></P>

      <P>If they took a trip in that, by the time they were finished discussing how they were to get back, I think they would decide that something else was necessary.  The only defence arm out of which the Irish people get any return is the Naval Service because it is used for the protection of our fisheries.  But I challenge the Minister to take a trip on that boat and come back without looking for a month's sick leave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <P>Surely, since we have extended our fishery limits, something more is needed for the protection of our fisheries?  You will not get that protection from the two ex-British tugboats lying around down there.  If either of them goes out for a day, it is laid up for a month.  The Minister should deal with that.</P>
      <P>The other matter to which I would direct the Minister's attention is housing. During the past 15 years whenever a member of the Defence Forces in one of the Minister's houses in Cobh applied to the local housing authority for a house, the inspector of the housing authority condemned the house in which the applicant was living.  It was left to the local authorities to provide housing.  The regulations that apply to the ordinary man living on the mainland whose property is condemned in that manner do not apply to the Department of Defence.  In that case the house is reoccupied during the following month by another family who, again, will be seeking a transfer out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> In relation to an area where Army and Navy personnel are stationed and which is the headquarters of the Navy, would the Minister not open his heart and say that he will do something in regard to the housing of that personnel? Not one penny has been spent by the Department of Defence in respect of housing in Cobh.  In Haulbowline the roofs are off the houses.  Is it not time to take nine or ten acres of land on the mainland in Cobh for the purpose of providing houses for married Army and Navy personnel?</P>
    <P>There are five or six fathers of families who have to travel from Youghal every morning to work at Haulbowline.  They have to pay their bus fares, which represent a considerable sum out of the miserable wage they get.  They have no hope of getting a house in Cork or of getting a transfer to a place where they would get a house.  Their families are living in houses provided by the Youghal urban council.  In order to attend to their duties, these men have to travel from Youghal twice a day.  It is time the Minister took steps to see that these people are properly housed.</P>
    <P>These are some of the main matters I intended to deal with.  I understand that the House is anxious to finish business and I am reserving other matters.  I would suggest very seriously to the Minister that for the sake of the good name of the nation and of this House, he should take in hand the position of unfortunate Old IRA men who have to apply for the special allowance.  This House would not be here but for them.  At least, they should be dealt with in a humane and decent manner.  I do not think the award of £9 a year to any man could be described as a decent award, coming from a Department of State that is supposed to look after the welfare of these men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise three points on this Estimate.  One of them has already been dealt with, that is, the question of the abatement provisions. The Minister will be aware from discussions here that his colleague, the <Col N="1932" /> Minister for Finance, undertook to consider sympathetically the question of making abatement retrospective.  While it is true that it has been made retrospective to January last, it still leaves one isolated case where a person has not benefited and for some time will not benefit by the abolition of the abatement provision.</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion in the Seanad on this matter, it was suggested that this case could not be described as a hardship case.  That was a somewhat unfortunate suggestion for the reason that although the person in question received an increase under the ninth round of 12 per cent, because of the abatement provisions, the said payments were deducted and consequently, although nominally benefiting, in practice and in fact the abatement wiped out the benefit which should have accrued.  When we were abolishing the abatement provisions which apply, we should have gone the whole way and certainly one isolated case should not be left.  It was always an inequitable arrangement and it is still inequitable to leave a single case outstanding. Further consideration should be given to that matter.</P>
      <P>In connection with the pensions provisions, while the increases apply to retired officers including some of those who have retired for some years, the position is that, because of the method by which pension has always been calculated on the basis of pay at retirement, a number of retired personnel who are retired for six, seven or even five years find that their pension is lower than that now applicable to persons who have retired at a more recent date and who held the same rank and had the same qualifying length of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in the past it was a reasonable method of calculating a pension to base it on pay at retirement, with the rises consequent on the cost of living that have been granted to serving personnel and, in recent times, to retired personnel, although on a lower basis, it does seem inequitable to continue to pay pensions at a lower rate merely because a person retired at a lower salary than that which now obtains for <Col N="1933" /> his fellow soldier, or fellow civil servant, as the case may be, who retired at a later date.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the proposals in respect of pensions in the two orders should be further considered in order to raise the pensions of persons who retired some years ago.  There is not a great number involved but the hardship on the individual is quite considerable in view of the rise in the cost of living and the depreciation in the purchasing power of money.  These people who retired under the age limit operating in respect of the various ranks now find that people who retired at a more recent date have a higher rate of pension.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that requires further consideration.  The necessary steps should be taken as soon as possible to amend the order so as to apply the same rates of pensions.  In other words, a person in a particular rank who retired some years ago should be entitled to the same rate of pension as is paid to a person who had attained the same rank and who retired this year.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make relates to a specific group of officers who feel they have been and, in fact, have been, adversely affected by reason of the granting of permanent commissions to a number of officers whose seniority was based on the fact that they were commissioned as officers in the Regular Army and granted commissions on the basis of the ranks they held in November, 1946.  I refer to the cadet class of 1943 who were commissioned as officers in 1945, were promoted lieutenants in 1947 and captains in 1955.  The position is that in 1946, approximately 300 temporary officers were granted regular commissions as lieutenants and captains, that is, something like a year and five months after the 1943 class were commissioned.  As the Minister is aware, these officers were listed senior to the 1945 group who were commissioned in June of that year.</P>
    <P>Promotion, with few exceptions, depends on seniority and in certain excepted cases, accelerated promotion was given to offset the seniority block <Col N="1934" /> created by the temporary officers.  I understand that 13 temporary officers who did not qualify for a cadetship in the 1943 competition were appointed in 1944 after a short course and promoted lieutenants in June 1945, captains in 1948 and commandants in 1963.  The cadet class preceding the 1943 class were promoted captains in November 1948, that is, seven years before the promotion of the 1943 class, and they now anticipate promotion to commandant.</P>
    <P>While most of the 1943 class can never expect promotion, the position is that, although, so far as I am aware, this class have satisfactory records, have passed the staff course for promotion, in fact, specially designed to qualify officers for senior appointments, they will never, because of the present seniority list, benefit by the promotion. As I understand it, between 1965 and 1973, the total number of estimated vacancies in senior rank will amount to 109.  This is based on the present retirement age but does not allow for death or voluntary retirement.</P>
    <P>Because of the decision to grant regular commissions to these temporary officers, a number of the officers to whom I have referred are now junior in rank to them.  The Minister ought to consider temporary arrangements which would allow special promotion in respect of these officers whose record is satisfactory, who have passed the necessary course and who, because of circumstances completely outside their control, will never benefit by it.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-line officers, doctors, engineers or others with professional qualifications, automatic promotion operates.  In addition, I understand that on the present wartime basis in the case of personnel serving with the United Nations troops abroad, many of the ranks are appropriate to commandant rank and in certain circumstances captains from the Army here are holding this rank.</P>
    <P>The Minister might look into this matter and consider the position of these officers.  I understand that as the present anticipated promotion will operate a number of them will have <Col N="1935" /> to retire in about 11 years' time when they will be 54 years of age.  It will be difficult for people of that age to find alternative employment, and they are retired at an earlier age then they might reasonably have anticipated if their promotion arrangements had proceeded in the normal way from the time they were originally commissioned in 1943.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing this Estimate, I referred to its introduction some months ago by the previous Minister for Defence.  I mentioned the comprehensive statement he made in bringing in the Estimate.  In doing so I had no intention of avoiding a debate on the Estimate as it stands which, I may say in passing, is exactly the same Estimate. Neither had I any intention of avoiding answering any questions.  I made it quite plain in my statement that in so far as I possibly could, I would deal with whatever questions were raised during this debate to the best of my ability, and that I knew that Deputies would take it into consideration that I have been only a very short time here as Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>I regret the absence of General MacEoin as much as the Deputies opposite, the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party who made reference to his absence from this House. It is a matter of further regret in that he is a person who, like myself, served in the forces in the early years of the formation of this State and was a member of the pre-Truce armed forces of the country.  It is a bit of a break to find so many of these men departing from the scene both in their private life outside and as members of this House or of the Seanad.  I hope he will have a happy time in his retirement and that he will enjoy reasonably good health in spite of the fact that he suffers serious disability as a result of the service he rendered to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan seemed to think that the public were not satisfied with the defence policy as pursued by various Governments here.  This is a rather wide question and one on which <Col N="1936" /> it would take a long time to give an opinion and to go into detail.  In view of the fact that this Dáil session is coming to a conclusion, I do not think I will go into that matter at length. The defence policy of the State has been outlined on many occasions previously. Armed forces are raised here for home service and for the protection of the State against any outside aggression. Defence policy is governed, of course, by the ability of our people to provide the necessary funds for the maintenance of a defence force.</P>
    <P>Every country is faced with the same problem as that with which we are faced.  They spend as much as they can afford on defence and the maintenance of the Defence Forces, leaving, at the same time, sufficient capital available for the ordinary economic life of the State.  We are a small population; we are not a very rich country.  We are not in competition with large powers which can maintain fully equipped defence forces but, nevertheless, the defence forces we maintain are capable of performing the tasks to which they are set.  Over the last few years we have succeeded in providing the necessary establishments to go abroad for service with the United Nations in their peacekeeping activities in a number of countries.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Defence and as a member of the Government, I wish to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Defence Forces and particularly to the members who have carried the flag of our country in such excellent fashion over the past few years.  Our troops are very highly thought of.  They take a high place in the military activity of the United Nations.  Our officers are regarded as men of competence, quite capable of taking important posts in the service of the United Nations and are regarded as equal to, if not better than, the personnel from other countries.</P>
    <P>I have been asked a number of questions in the course of this debate. Some Deputies referred to the military barracks here in Dublin and the land that goes with them.  The suggestion is that other uses could be found for these barracks and the land attached if they were made available.  It was <Col N="1937" /> said that the barracks are old.  We know they are old.  They were built many, many years ago by the British and I think the time has come now when we should have a look at them.  I am having this matter examined but I should like to make it clear that no quick decision can be reached because there is a great deal involved, e.g., the location of troops in both peacetime and wartime.  Barracks must be available into which to put troops in the event of these older establishments being disposed of.  It is incumbent on us to make provision for the wives and families of the men and for stores and equipment.  Financial considerations must also be examined before any decision can be taken.  The problem is complicated and has many facets to it.  However, I am having the position examined but, in view of the implications involved, no early decision could be expected by reasonable people.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised with regard to pensions, improving conditions, uniforms and so on.  I shall look into these matters when I read the debate and examine the points that were made.  My task would be a very extensive one, indeed, if I were to deal with all the suggestions made. I would, too, need a very much larger amount of money than is provided in this Estimate if I were to implement all the suggestions put forward.  As Deputies are aware the Minister for Defence is confined to the Estimate passed here unless he is prepared to resort to the undesirable practice of coming into the House later on seeking a Supplementary Estimate.  As I have said, I shall read the debate when it becomes available and Deputies can rest assured that I shall not ignore their representations.</P>
    <P>With regard to recoupment of payment for service abroad with the United Nations, that matter is under consideration.  It is a matter really for the Minister for External Affairs.  We are prepared to accept payment in certain conditions and a claim is being prepared for submission, through the Department of External Affairs, to the United Nations for all extra and extraordinary expenses incurred by the <Col N="1938" /> Government in contributing a contingent to the United Nations Force in Cyprus.  I am unable to say what the outcome will be.  Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out that we have contributed our share&mdash;he actually said more than our share&mdash;to these operations.</P>

      <P>There was a recommendation that meritorious service should be recognised. Proposals for awards are being examined and will be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. Awards will not be confined to personnel that have served abroad.  If personnel at home are entitled to awards they will receive whatever awards are decided upon.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the Coogan Commission.  I do not know of any Commission under that name.  I presume it is the proposals to which I have referred the Deputy has in mind.</P>
      <P>Several matters were raised in relation to pensions.  The normal minimum service for pensions in the case of NCOs and privates is 21 years.  The 1/-per week for additional service above the 21 years is governed by the pension scheme, which provides for ten incremental years after the 21.  That is the position at the moment and I do not think there are any alterations contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to children's allowances and instanced the different basis as between officers and men.  Under present conditions men's children's allowances are more favourable in some respects as compared <Col N="1939" /> with officers' children's allowances but the allowances are payable over a longer period for officers' children who are attending secondary school.</P>
    <P>The pre-discharge leave with pay and allowances is up to 90 days depending on the length of service.</P>
    <P>The question of the placement of discharged soldiers in employment and the suggestions made by various Deputies in regard to fitting personnel for possible employment when they leave the Army is a very big one.  I shall consider it, so far as I can, within the means at my disposal but I cannot give any firm answer to the proposals made here.  So far as the Department are concerned, we go as far as we possibly can to give employment to the NCOs and privates who leave the Army where civilian posts with the Defence Forces are available. It is the practice of the Department to recommend soldiers with good discharges to employers throughout the country.  I notice that Deputy James Tully said that outside employers do not co-operate sufficiently with the Department in this regard.  This is a matter for regret, and I should be only too glad if employment agencies outside, owners of factories or businesses, would give at least equal, if not preferential consideration, to men leaving the Army with good discharges and physically fit and capable of doing the work required of them.</P>
    <P>The provision of houses for married personnel is regarded as being primarily the responsibility of the local authority but the Department, out of moneys made available by the House, supplement that, where possible, by providing houses for military personnel where they feel the need is greatest. There is a limiting factor in the amount of money available.  The Department have built houses in various centres and will continue to do so where possible but they cannot under any circumstances accept full responsibility for the provision of housing for Army personnel, even where it involves the reconstruction or replacement of very old houses that came into our possession from the <Col N="1940" /> British authorities.  We shall do the best we can to meet the demand and wherever we are unable to do so the personnel must rely on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch referred to the Equitation School and officers' uniforms and he asked that some allowance should be paid to these men.  The officers of the Equitation School are paid an extra clothing allowance towards the cost and upkeep of their uniforms.  This applies to our jumping teams who take part in competitions with teams from much wealthier countries than ours.  They do not always have the same pay or allowances as officers of other jumping teams.  We cannot avoid that: we must take our place in these competitions as we are. We try to help our personnel on such missions as far as possible.  Our jumping teams at home and abroad compare favourably with the teams of other nations.  The Equitation School here has won many honours in show jumping inside and outside the country.</P>
    <P>On the question of letting the public all over the country see the Army, we send equitation teams to shows in every county as they occur and our soldiers are seen on the streets and in the garrison towns.  Unless we parade them up and down the country roads as showpieces, I do not see much more that can be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cost of living increases on the pensions of retired personnel, these are granted on the same basis as to other retired State pensioners. The increases are decided by the Minister for Finance, not by me. Married officers get a gratuity on retirement; unmarried officers do not. Married soldiers get a married pension in addition to the basic pension but, as Deputy Tully says, they do not get a gratuity.  That is the present position, at any rate.</P>

      <P>Deputy T. Lynch spoke about the helicopters and wanted to know why we did not buy from the British.

In answer to a question, I said that I was having this whole matter examined and so I am, but I have not decided to buy any class of ship.  I want to make that clear to Deputy Lynch who seemed to think that the decision had been taken to buy ships.  That is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>These three ships have a history.  Deputy T. Lynch said he would like to meet the man who sold them and he had something to say about the man who bought them, but I would like to say something about the men who decided to refit them in 1956 or 1957.  The <i>Macha</i> was refitted at an estimated cost of £60,000.  The matter was mooted in 1955 and in 1956 a decision was taken and the work was put in hands in 1957.  It shows that the Deputies in the Fine Gael Party should have a word with their own colleagues who made that decision.  They had advice from marine surveyors certifying that that particular ship would stand service for a long number of years, that it was suitable to the work it was purchased for and a suitable vessel for Irish service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that the following year and in the year after both the incoming Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence continued the good work of fitting the other two ships.  The operation cost about £150,000.  I do not know whether the three ships were certified suitable for fishery protection, that they were seaworthy, that they were ships which were worthy of being put to sea in the roughest sea or suitable to the class of seas encountered by seamen on the western coast.  I am having this question examined but it will take a long <Col N="1943" /> time to carry out a detailed examination. It will require a large amount of capital to replace ships for this service. I admit that one corvette in service is totally inadequate for the protection of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>We have a problem other than the problem in regard to the ships and that is in relation to the recruitment of personnel for this service.  No matter what reason is put forward it is a fact that our young men are not inclined to enter the Naval Service.  It could be that they are not inclined to enter any naval service.  It was suggested over the years that they were not being paid enough. Recently the pay of ratings was raised and they received extra pay for certain services.  The question of similarly increasing officers' pay is now under consideration.  I do not know if it is going to make much impact on recruits into this service.  We can only muster sufficient personnel to man one of the ships.  It is true, of course, that these ships require a much larger number than a more modern vessel to handle and maintain and put to sea, but the fact is we have them and I can do nothing about it at the moment until I have the matter examined and am in a position to formulate an opinion from the information I obtain.  I will have to satisfy myself on whatever proposals I shall put before the Government and it will be for the Government to decide how this situation is going to be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want notice of that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the question of IRA pensions and special allowances. The question of special allowances is one that may not be fully understood by most people.  We had two main service pensions Acts, one in 1924 and the other in 1934.  Under the service pensions Acts some 18,000 people qualified for military service pensions, such as they were.  As time passed, it was felt that people belonging to certain specified organisations should not <Col N="1944" /> be permitted to live in poverty.  That is exactly how the situation then was being looked at.  It was decided by the Government to bring in this system of special allowances in order to give to the recipients a certain amount of money per year to enable them to live and which would be in addition to any income they might have.  The matter is fixed by legislation with an appropriate sum.  The appropriate sum is different for the various categories and cases, the married man with children, or the man over 70, and so on, but it works on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a special allowance a person must satisfy certain prescribed conditions.  One of the conditions is that he must be the possessor of the General Service Medal.  This is awarded on the basis that the person concerned had three months' membership, not service, of one of the specified organisations up to and including the 11th July, 1921.  When you come to deal with a special allowance for a person with a military service pension, you know where you stand.  That person went before a referee and obtained a Military Service Certificate which shows that he had a certain number of years of active service.  When you come to deal with a man with a 1916 medal, you know that he had service in one of the organisations which took part in the Insurrection of 1916.  When you come to deal with an applicant who has a disability pension, you know that he had service in the course of which he contracted a disability or received a wound.  When you come to deal with Medal applications, however, you find, from the records, that in many cases the applicants' names are not even on the company roll, that is, the company of which they claim to have been members.  It is true that in many cases applicants for medals some years ago obtained medals and their names were not on the company rolls.</P>
    <P>We find now, when the medal has to be duly awarded to enable the person to get the special allowance, that some of the officers who certified do not certify any more.  When you come to deal with the local company, you find that the local captain or lieutenant is <Col N="1945" /> not alive.  When you get in a certificate saying that the applicant was not a member of the company, what are you to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very seldom that you do not get a reply.  You have to decide that such a person is not a person to whom a medal was duly awarded. You could not operate this scheme without a means test.  Men who have a pension in the disability category note the fact that their neighbours who had very little service, who were merely members, are getting special allowances at the rate, say, of £150 a year when they themselves are in receipt of service pensions of not more than £25 or £30 a year.  We have to try to deal with this matter as fairly as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>The means test for special allowances has been relaxed over the years, and we disregard increases in the various social welfare benefits.  The first £60 of the military pension is disregarded in the case of persons under 70, and the first £30 in the case of persons of 70 or over.  We disregard the value of children's labour under 18 years of age and the first £50 of any cash contributions by members of the applicants' families.  We disregard children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts.  We disregard public assistance and free maintenance which imposes a hardship on the provider of the maintenance.  Gaeltacht grants are not taken into consideration and certain development grants are disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, in accordance with the Budget statements, to increase the appropriate annual sum as from August next.  I do not think there is any necessity to relax the means test any further in relation to special allowances. As far as I am concerned and as far as my Department are concerned, we are as sympathetic as we possibly can be in the matter of applicants for special allowances.  The Department are not responsible for the investigation of means.  The means are investigated by the social welfare officers and <Col N="1946" /> the reports come to the Department.  It is on that basis that the means are assessed.  Anybody, public representatives included, who wishes to get information on the assessment of means of an applicant is entitled to it and this assessment can be contested with the Department of Defence.  That may not be generally known.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, any case of that nature that comes before me will be dealt with as sympathetically as I can possibly do it because my personal sympathy lies with that type of case.  It is not true to say that it takes a long time to investigate applications.  Provided the person is more than 70 years of age and has a duly awarded medal it seldom takes more than two months.  Such a person does not have to be medically examined. If he has not a duly awarded medal, it can take more time because of the complications I have mentioned and the delay in getting certification to make certain that the people for whom this money is provided get it rather than people who might not be entitled to it.  I do not think there is anything further I need add at this stage.  I should remind Deputies that there will be opportunities in the next session for dealing with many other matters in connection with my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak in any general way about education. Deputy Jones has dealt with this in a very comprehensive way, much more so than I could attempt to do.  I should like, however, to make a few comments about educational facilities in my constituency in County Dublin. Development is taking place there at a very rapid rate.  This continues, but the educational facilities being provided are not keeping pace with it.  We had experience in certain areas less than a <Col N="1949" /> year ago where large numbers of children could not gain entry to primary schools because there were no schools available locally and the schools that were in existence were completely overcrowded.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the advent of prefabricated schools and the co-operation of site owners in coming to the rescue at the eleventh hour&mdash;very much so in some cases&mdash;hundreds of children who needed admission to primary schools for the first time would not have been able to gain entry into any school unless their parents were prepared to send them long distances at considerable expense and at considerable anxiety for their safety.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that there is a great lack of anticipation and of planning in relation to schools generally in an expanding area like County Dublin.  There should be better liaison between the local authorities, the school managers and the vocational education authorities so that there would be a continuous survey in relation to population trends and the general need for educational facilities.  I know that in many parts of rural Ireland the shoe is on the other foot&mdash;schools are emptying. Here we have not sufficient schools and the need for them is becoming a greater problem every day.  It is extremely important that that problem be dealt with urgently.  Even the schools we have are suffering from quite a degree of overcrowding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Minister may say about the supply of teachers, I submit it is totally inadequate.  It has been said repeatedly that we have reached the stage where we have no class of more than 50 pupils.  I ask the Minister to check that up because I personally do not believe it.  As well as that, I still hold it is an impossibility for a teacher adequately to educate young children when there are 50 in the class.  I do not believe&mdash;I do not say this lightly&mdash;that we have anything like classes of 50 with a fully trained teacher in charge all the time.  There are many instances of teachers being absent for unavoidable reasons of one sort or another.  There is no replacement and the children are just being <Col N="1950" /> minded, but not taught in the schools. That is no reflection at all on the teachers.  They are an excellent body of people.  I believe the whole trouble is that they are not coming up in sufficient numbers and are not available in sufficient numbers.</P>
    <P>I know an effort is being made all the time to provide additional teachers. The demand for them is increasing all the time.  I am not quite clear what exactly is the problem, whether it is that we have insufficient accommodation in the training schools, or whether it is we have not sufficient trainees coming up.  If the problem is a question of accommodation, there should be a far greater effort made to provide suitable accommodation for the training of teachers because it is a definite and obvious loss to children, and something which they never catch up on, if they are in classes with too great a number of children, especially if they are not particularly bright children.</P>
    <P>I always feel that, if anything, there is too much concern for the brilliant child and not enough concern for the backward child.  The parents who are unfortunate enough to have a child who is inclined to be backward have a very big burden.  The unfortunate child himself finds it difficult to make his way in the world.  I have heard this sort of reference from time to time &ldquo;for all children who can benefit&rdquo;.  Will anybody show me the child who cannot benefit?  It is a quite wrong reference to make or to use. When you say &ldquo;for all children who can benefit&rdquo; that includes every child. It includes even mentally handicapped children.  They, too, can benefit.  Therefore, it is a completely wrong phrase to use.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the necessity for anticipating educational needs, the need for making a survey and for keeping that survey continuously under review. We, in County Dublin, who are members of the Vocational Education Committee, got a survey made about six months ago because we were anxious to build a number of extra vocational schools in County Dublin.  The need is there and we wanted to supply the need.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable, in a county where <Col N="1951" /> we hope to expand industrially and where the whole standard of living of the people in the county depends on industrial expansion and increased exports, and where they in turn depend on the technical skill and ability of the people who are going to operate these industries, that we are not as concerned as we should be to ensure that every area is fully supplied with vocational educational facilities. We have been unable to get any reply from the Department so far as to what is their reaction to that survey.  The survey is sufficiently long with the Department for them to be able to say: &ldquo;If we are to provide the facilities that should be provided you must have a school there, there and there and in the long term, schools so-and-so elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have one obvious area that is in existence for very many years.  There is a teeming population there.  This area, which is on the fringe of a highly industrialised area, is in Crumlin-Walkinstown. There is no school there. We went to a lot of trouble, of course, late in the day, to look for a site.  That is always the difficulty in an area which is built.  A community is formed and then we find that there is no central situation and no possible site for a school.  Eventually, through, let me say, the generosity of a developer there, we got a suitable site but there is some difficulty with the landlord in relation to building a school on that site.  We need to use compulsory powers in order to get that site.</P>
    <P>I took this matter up with the Minister's predecessor and for some reason, at that time, he was not satisfied that it was necessary to proceed along those lines in order to secure the site.  I would like to tell the Minister, and impress upon him, if we are to get sites in most of the areas, where the need is greatest in County Dublin, we will only be able to get those sites by compulsory purchase order.  If we are denied those powers we will have no schools in those areas.  I would like the Minister to appreciate that fact.  We have the power and we should be allowed to use it as soon as possible. Otherwise we will be falling far behind, <Col N="1952" /> as we are at the moment, in providing vocational needs for the people whom we are expected to look after in those areas.</P>
    <P>Whenever we place a proposal before the Department, the officers of the Department are very attentive to it. I know we had a case where it took us approximately three years from the time we submitted plans to the time we could say we could go ahead and build a school.  That happened in Clondalkin and by the time we were ready to start building we found the school was only half big enough.  This has been the practice all over the area. The question of economising in the size of schools is really deplorable.</P>
    <P>We built a primary school in Clondalkin and, in spite of the fact that I had been with the Minister on a number of occasions to increase the size of the school&mdash;I know the school manager comes into this as well&mdash;and impress upon him the rapid rate of development taking place there and that the school was ridiculously small &mdash;there was deplorable overcrowding in that school&mdash;a year later we had to come to the aid of the school with a rush-up prefab in order to accommodate the children.  This practice is repeated in almost every area in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is no foresight in regard to the building of schools.  The cost of building has enormously increased. Every year building costs are rocketing. Prices are increasing all the time. There is a lack of planning, foresight and liaison among the people who have the responsibility for providing educational facilities for the people. An effort should be made, in planning a community, to ensure that public buildings, such as schools, health centres, recreation centres, libraries and all other facilities should be the centre of the community.  In many cases it would assist mothers who were taking children of tender years, perhaps, one to school and another to the health centre on the same morning, if they were close by. It would also be a great help from the point of view of school medical examinations if we had the health <Col N="1953" /> centres close to the primary schools. The examinations could go on without disrupting the work of the school.</P>
    <P>I rose mainly to make those few comments in relation to the difficulties we are experiencing in County Dublin, and that are pretty general also, and to ask the Minister to pay some attention to them.  I do not intend to speak in a general way because I know that if we are to leave this House tonight, we will have to curtail ourselves in the contributions we make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to repeat what I have said on many occasions in the past.  I want to ask the Minister to use his good offices to see that an extension of the night lectures at University College, Galway, is provided.  The facilities are required; the demand is there.  In an up and coming town like Galway, it should be provided.  I should like the Minister to use his good offices if at all possible for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be equally brief because I know the situation in regard to time.  I want to ask the Minister something which I asked his predecessor, and something which I think is of public importance.  Will he produce the statue of George Bernard Shaw which is in the National Gallery for public display outside the National Gallery?  This was a great Dublin man who contributed much in actual cash to the enhancement of the arts in this city.  This splendid representation of him, which is now to be seen in a secluded alcove in the National Gallery, should be on public display.  I cannot understand why this has not been done, because I understand from those who appreciate sculpture that this statue is of outstanding merit and design, and should be on public view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from that, for a long time I have campaigned to try to have the Shaw statue removed from seclusion and displayed in some place like St. Stephen's Green.  Shaw had historic associations with the Green. He passed through it on his way to work when he worked in Molesworth Street, not far from this House.  He <Col N="1954" /> may have been a controversial figure in other times.  Some people may not have thought well of him, but he was a great humanitarian and a great Irishman.  He spoke out for this country when there were few people to speak out for it.  As we all know, he bequeathed very considerable sums of money&mdash;a substantial part of the income from <i>My Fair Lady,</i> for example&mdash;for the benefit of Dublin. The Minister is a Dublin man, and I am glad to see a Dublin man in that Department at long last.  I ask him as a Dublin man to give sympathetic consideration to my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House unnecessarily, but there are several points I want to raise which I have been trying to force home to the Minister and the Department by Parliamentary Question.  It is not always as easy to express oneself by way of Parliamentary Question as it is in an Estimate debate.</P>
      <P>First, I want to deal with the question of school transport.  I do not think the Minister and the Department are realistic with regard to school transport. There are some archaic laws in existence which lay down that a person must have ten children, to start with, for a transport scheme and that the family must live within a certain distance of the school.  I understand the position is that they must live within two miles of the school unless the children are between the ages of ten and 14 years.  What happens if they live four or five miles from the school? Very often there is no school nearer. That is the type of scheme the Department have been operating for years, and are continuing to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that at the moment a certain amount of town and country planning is going on.  Previously cottages were built in outlying districts but now they are being built around centres of population.  There are still people living in outlying districts and they should get the consideration to which they are entitled.  The reason they do not is that the bureaucratic grip that controls the country as a whole is pretty strong but is nowhere stronger than in the Department of <Col N="1955" /> Education, and refuses to allow any fresh thinking.  I ask the Minister, as a new Minister, to break that bureaucratic grip and to introduce a proper up-to-date transport scheme so that people who live in districts remote from schools will have the opportunity of sharing in the benefits to which their more fortunate brethren are entitled. That is my first point, and I could enlarge on it, but as time is supposed to be limited, I shall pass on to the next question.</P>
    <P>The next question is the question of retarded children.  I do not believe the Department have any policy in regard to retarded children.  I do not believe they have ever had a policy, nor do I believe that they have ever done any rational thinking on the subject outside the city of Dublin.  I belong to a philanthropic organisation in my constituency. Many people who were interested got together and endeavoured to start a school.  We were frustrated from start to finish by the Department and the then Minister refusing to have any consideration for us.  We were told we had to have over 20 retarded children to start a school&mdash;21, I think it was.  I pointed out in return to the Minister and his officials that it was quite impossible on the law of averages to get 20 retarded children within a rural district.  Of course I got no satisfaction.  I was told that if we had 40 children, they would give us assistance to start a school.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us is there any place in rural Ireland in which he would get 40 retarded children unless he went to a town with a population of, perhaps, over 10,000. Even in a town with a population of 10,000, on the ordinary law of averages which obtains all over the world you would not get that number of retarded children.  I want to know what the Minister's policy is in this regard?  Are retarded children still to be taught in ordinary schools as they have been throughout the years.  The reply is an easy one: a commission has enquired into the subject and the Minister has not yet had time to study the report.  I should like the Minister to remember that these children are growing.  This <Col N="1956" /> procrastination and frustration have been going on and the children have been getting older.  It is a source of anxiety to parents that the children are getting beyond the age for education.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to hear from the Minister what his policy is, and whether he proposes to permit schools to operate outside the city of Dublin and the bigger centres for this type of child who is less fortunate than his brothers.  If he does not intend to do so, it would be better and fairer for him to tell the House and the country that he has no policy and intends to do nothing.  I do not wish to blame the Minister directly.  He has only taken over the Department but I do wish to point out that so far as any up-to-date thinking on the matter is concerned, it is entirely negative in so far as the Minister for Education and those who advise him are concerned.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to raise is the question of the vocational school in the town of Wexford.  Vocational education, as I am sure the Minister will accept in the age in which we are living, is becoming daily and hourly more important.  Deputy Clinton also dealt before me with this matter in relation to County Dublin where he lives.  We have in Wexford town, a town with a population of about 10,000. The vocational school in existence there at the moment is over 100 years old and cannot accommodate the pupils.  It has no facilities such as central heating.  Even if it were extensively renovated in every way possible, it would not meet the problem of today. In spite of repeated applications on behalf of the vocational education committee, of which I am not a member, this body has been told the school will be renovated and that a sum of £50,000 will be spent on it.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that expenditure of this £50,000 is total waste of money because, even if the money is expended and the building is renovated, it is not big enough to cater for the demand for vocational education in the area.  Furthermore, there is a site immediately adjacent to the school which would take a new vocational school, big enough to provide <Col N="1957" /> for all the existing pupils and those who may come in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to is fire-fighting.  When we had newspapers in this country, and I hope we shall have them soon again, one hardly took up a newspaper without reading of some tragedy in relation to small children being burned, often at the expense of their lives, or being mutilated. Usually in these cases one reads that parents were called out and that small children were left in the house and very often there were children of schoolgoing age in the house.  If they had been taught in school to deal with fire and fire-fighting, they would perhaps save themselves.</P>
    <P>This is a matter I have been repeatedly raising in this House by way of Parliamentary Question. Indeed, it is nearly as old a theory as the helicopters and the Naval Service. Had the different Ministers for Education considered allowing fire-fighting training in the schools, valuable lives would have been saved.  It is a very necessary training.  Ten minutes a week would be sufficient to deal with the question and lives would not be lost. I should like to ask the Minister to give that consideration as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have just said, I want to express my appreciation to the Deputies <Col N="1958" /> who spoke on this Estimate for the constructive way generally they have approached the problem of education in this country.  Very many points were raised.  I cannot hope to deal with all of them but I do want to make it clear that the fact that I do not deal with certain points does not mean I am paying no attention to them.  Perhaps I might be forgiven if I start by taking up with Deputy Esmonde the rather strong strictures he made on the Department of Education and which he developed into a stricture on bureaucracy which he said was exemplified and typified in the Department of Education.  He was speaking of the school transport services.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that Deputy Esmonde has got the wrong end of the stick in this regard.  He said the regulations forbid the provision of transport for people living beyond a certain distance from a school.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  The restrictions do not allow for transport for children living within three miles of a school where they are between the ages of five and ten years, and four miles where they are over ten years of age.  Therefore, it is the exact opposite of what Deputy Esmonde was saying.  I feel that strictures based on these misconceptions were perhaps unwarranted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones made a very comprehensive and constructive speech.  I should like to refer to a few points he made.  He referred to the subject of civics.  We all agree that civics are desirable in the schools.  As I mentioned in my Estimate speech we are a little further than saying they are desirable.  We are doing something about them.  Civics will be on the course very shortly in secondary and vocational schools and will be on the course also in the national schools, if certain negotiations which have to take place between my Department and the national teachers are successfully concluded, as I have no doubt they will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones said that civics are admirable but he asked where teachers would find time for these things in the curriculum.  I should like to point out <Col N="1959" /> that as far as I know we have in our primary schools the shortest school-day in Europe.  I think recognition of this fact by all concerned should enable us to evolve a satisfactory solution to the problem of finding time for such subjects as civics, physical education and environmental studies.</P>
    <P>The question of the supply of teachers was raised by Deputy Jones and by, I think, Deputy Clinton.  I should like to point out that dealing with a problem like this is somewhat of a long-term nature.  My predecessor took the necessary steps to deal with it, as a result of which a building scheme is taking place in St. Patrick's Training College.  As a result of this additional accommodation, we will be turning out annually 150 teachers more than our normal requirements.  We shall start on this next year and all these additional teachers will be used to improve the pupil/teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned one point which I mentioned when speaking on this Estimate in another capacity, that is, the necessity to develop the critical faculty amongst our children.  This, I think, is of very great importance.  I feel that there are many things we can do to develop these.  It is important that we should realise that when schools encourage their children in such things as debates, drama, wide reading outside the course, and so on, they are contributing very much to developing the critical faculty and should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>The provision of an assembly hall in a school is a great aid to widening the scope of the education available. This is one of the reasons we insist, when we give grants for secondary schools, on the provision of an assembly hall in the school.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary made a number of points but one of them I want to take up with him, concerning something I said in introducing my Estimate.  I said we are frequently criticised in regard to our educational system and that we do not give credit where we are perhaps slightly ahead of others. He seemed to cast doubt on the possibility <Col N="1960" /> that we could be ahead of others on any aspect.  There are some aspects in which we are ahead.  I will mention one of them.  Since 1958, we do not recruit any untrained teachers.  As far as I know, we are the only country in Europe and perhaps the only country in the world which can claim this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to our educational system as being too compartmentalised. I agree with him thoroughly and referred to it in introducing my Estimate.  My efforts have been and will be directed to getting rid of that compartmentalisation, in so far as it appears to retard our educational process.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also referred to the fact that education, other than primary education, is not available to all children. I feel that it is of prime necessity &mdash;I also mentioned this in introducing my Estimate&mdash;that we direct our efforts to ensure that post-primary education is available to all our children.  I want to tell the Dáil a little more about the methods I propose to use in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I should say that the Department of Education under my predecessor was carrying out a survey which is being continued at present and which, when completed, will enable us to say, in regard to any particular area in the country, what the approximate post-primary school-going population is and is likely to be at different years ahead; what post-primary facilities exist there at present&mdash;and this includes vocational and secondary schools and in some cases it may include space available in primary school buildings; what language laboratories we have and the science teachers, art teachers, music teachers, people who are in short supply, we have, so that we shall be able to say, in relation to any area, what it needs for post-primary education for all the children; what it has at the moment and what is needed to add to that in order to provide for that area.</P>
    <P>It seems clear to me, if one is to be practical in approaching this problem, that we must build on the basis of our existing facilities.  Therefore, what we have to do is to say, in a case, for instance, <Col N="1961" /> where a secondary school has a science laboratory and an adjoining vocational school has not, that the students of the vocational school doing science should be enabled to use that science laboratory and <i>vice versa.</i> Further, where there is a science teacher available he should be made available to all the children and not merely to those in the particular school in which he is employed at present. Where necessary, we should add to an existing vocational school or an existing secondary school in order to provide the necessary facilities for that area as shown by the survey.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that this scheme envisages the provision of what we know as the academic secondary education in the vocational schools as well as in the secondary schools.  It also visualises the provision of much of the kind of training given in vocational schools in the secondary schools&mdash;in other words, both the vocational and the secondary schools will, I hope, tend to lean towards the comprehensive system and, by full utilisation of all our existing resources, we can, with some confidence, tackle the problem of providing post-primary education for all our children.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the national average is that one-third of our children do not receive post-primary education; two-thirds do.  But, of course, in certain areas the proportion who do not receive post-primary education would be much higher than that.  This is something which I think is of great urgency and which I am tackling on the basis I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention that in my opinion the existing courses available in either a secondary school or a vocational school do not suit the needs of all our children.  There is a third stream, a stream of children whose aptitudes and intelligence are such that many of them in secondary schools will pass the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates but the courses provided for them are not adequate to their requirements or to the kind of life they will lead when they go out into the world.  There are also the same type of children in vocational schools. <Col N="1962" /> I want to see that we will provide courses to suit these children.</P>
    <P>It should be clear to the House, I think, that my approach to this is based on utilising what we have as best we can, as efficiently as we can, without regard to the divisions between our various sections of education which have existed, for historical reasons, in the past.  By this, I do not mean that we want to abolish the existing systems but we want them to adjust to the requirements of the nation and where distinctions exist for no reason other than the fact that they are there we want to get rid of those distinctions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by a number of Deputies to the necessity for vocational guidance.  In introducing my Estimate, I indicated that the employment of four psychologists in the Department of Education is, I hope, a first step in dealing with the problem of vocational guidance which consists basically of two difficulties: (1) the ascertaining of the children's aptitudes and capabilities and (2) the provision of knowledge for the children and their parents of what positions, jobs, openings are available for the children who have the particular aptitudes.  The engagement of the psychologists is the beginning of what I hope will eventually be a service which will be available to all our children and to their parents to indicate as accurately as this can be done the aptitudes and intelligence which the children have and the general kind of occupation they ought to follow.  The next step, then, is the provision of information for the parents and the children, and, having been given that information, what opportunities are available.  A good deal of work will have to take place on this but I regard it as a matter of some importance and intend to see that we will make progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy O'Leary, but he was not the only one, referred to my statement in introducing the Estimate about the proposal to double the amount of scholarships.  I want to point out it was my predecessor in office who, by way of the Scholarships Act, 1961, was the <Col N="1963" /> first to provide Exchequer assistance to local authorities in providing scholarships.  As a result of that Act, the number of scholarships then available was trebled.  As I have already said, I now propose to double the existing number.</P>
    <P>Having said that in my Estimate speech, I said something else which all the Deputies who have referred to this seem to have ignored.  I said: &ldquo;The number of scholarships expected as a result of the foregoing grants are based on the proposed amendment of the 1961 Act only and do not include the possibility of other measures to increase the number of scholarships.&rdquo; This last sentence was utterly ignored. I want to point out to the House that this is not the last word on scholarships at all.  Our ability to increase the number of scholarships available will be dependent on the degree of economic progress this country makes.  This is a matter we might all do well to consider when we are talking of economics, industrial relations and other matters. Our ability to increase our educational provision is vital for the future of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe, in a maiden speech on which I should like to congratulate him&mdash;it was a very thoughtful one&mdash; referred to the necessity for the production of books suitable for this country.  I am glad to be able to tell him and the House that the school library scheme is already giving the necessary encouragement to some of our publishers to embark on the production of such books.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully referred to the school libraries and said he hoped they would not be just reference libraries.  In fact, they will be, as he said, just reference libraries.  But I think he may be under a misapprehension about them.  Already in the areas in which these school reference libraries exist the results obtained have been most impressive and encouraging. I have already referred to Limerick, and I hope I will be forgiven if I refer to it again.  I have seen the results there and have been most impressed by what has happened. As a result of close co-operation between the city of Limerick and the <Col N="1964" /> county of Limerick librarians and the schools, there has been developed a phenomenal interest in books among young children, who have been encouraged to take on projects based on the reading they do and produce work based on these projects.  I personally have found the results most encouraging. We have had similar good results in other areas.  The object of providing the reference libraries is of course to enable teachers to train children how to use books and, in co-operation with the local libraries, to encourage the children to go further and use the books available in the local libraries.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that for the exhibition to be given to teachers in the counties just starting the local libraries have been asked to buy £200 worth of books? Would the Department be able to make any subvention to that?  Otherwise, the scheme will be a failure.</P>

      <P>As far as the Department are concerned, we have had, with the willing co-operation of the British Ministry of Education, a school inspector over there studying what is being done in Britain in regard to school libraries.  In the training colleges, I have authorised the appointment of lecturers in school librarianship. Courses are also being made available to trainee teachers in the use of library books.  It is a matter of very considerable importance that all children should be educated in the use of books.  This is real education and, as far as I can encourage this, I intend to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy P. Hogan requested information as to the number of secondary school science laboratories in respect of which equipment grants had been given and the total amount of these grants.  The relevant figures to date are 57 and the sum involved £68,515.  There are many other allocations at various stages of being dealt with in the Department.</P>
      <P>Another point to which Deputy P. Hogan and others referred was the amount of the State contribution in regard to the Scholarships Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of local authorities.  I want to make it clear that, if the equivalent of the produce of a rate of 2d in the £ has been reached, the State contribution is not one for one but one and a half for one.</P>
      <P>Another point I should perhaps mention, because judging by some of the statements made, there is some confusion about it, is that the 1961 Act also provides that the total sum for post-primary scholarships shall be double that for university scholarships.  This is an equitable distribution, having regard, on the one hand, to the numbers pursuing post-primary education and, on the other, to the numbers pursuing university education and the relative cost of the two forms of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy James <Col N="1966" /> Tully, particularly since he is now present, for his very gracious remarks and the compliments he paid me.  I appreciate them.  He asked me how many secondary schools were availing themselves of school television and the answer is 350.  There was also a reference by the Deputy, which was then topical, to the examinations and the bus strike.  I am glad to be able to tell him and the House that we have not had even one instance reported of a pupil having missed the Intermediate or Leaving Certificate examinations as a result of the bus strike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly earned their certificates this year!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another question the Deputy raised was whether the sum of £3 7s 6d in respect of industrial school pupils was the total amount payable. The answer is no.  The teaching costs are paid for separately.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also referred to what he thought was a practice of school managers who were in the process of getting new schools and who allowed the school to deteriorate while waiting for the new one in the belief that, if they did it up, they would lose their place in the queue.  There is no basis at all for that.  The Department never used the fact that a school has been temporarily repaired as a reason for changing its place in the queue.  It does of course sometimes happen from the manager's point of view that, once he has applied for a grant and got sanction, he says it is not worth spending money on this and does not do it, but if he does so in the belief that it will hold him back in getting a new school, he is mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore made an appeal to our industrialists to be more generous in providing money for scholarships. I should like to endorse that plea heartily.  While some of our industrial firms have given a fair measure of support to educational activities, there is very much more scope for this and, indeed, as some Deputy pointed out, some of the activities in which industrial firms indulge for the purpose of publicity, presumably, could with justice be described as being of lesser importance than the work they <Col N="1967" /> could do for the country by endowing educational activities, particularly scholarships.  I should like to add my voice to that of Deputy Moore in appealing to industrial firms to consider this idea as a very useful way in which they could help the country from which they are making their profits, with no disadvantage to themselves from the point of view of income tax.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of Irish in the schools.  I do not want to develop this topic but there is one aspect of it I want to mention.  It has come to my notice that in the case of Irish people who emigrated and then were able to return here and whose children were educated for some time abroad, these children, on attending Irish schools, were very much behind children of their own age group in the matter of Irish and found it very difficult to catch up and, therefore, were unable to sit for the Intermediate Certificate examination and were obliged to pass in Irish in the Leaving Certificate examination.  This in some cases proved impossible, through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I have given a great deal of thought to this matter and have come to the conclusion that to ask the children I have in mind to make up Irish from scratch in a short time is unfair to them in relation to their fellow pupils.  In addition, there is the consideration that to do so is liable to create in the minds of these children and of their parents a resentment which in the long run might do harm to the cause of the language which would perhaps outweigh any advantage that might otherwise accrue.  In these circumstances, I have decided that from now on such children may, if their parents so wish, select another language instead of Irish for the purpose of recognition generally and for the award of the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply only to children who have received their earlier education abroad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and who have received it while their parents or <Col N="1968" /> guardians were abroad.  It does not apply to Irish people who send their children abroad for education.  If they wish to do that, they are entitled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Six Counties would be considered &ldquo;abroad&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I made a reference when introducing the Estimate to the necessity to have another look at the problem of small national schools and since then I have been having another look at the problem.  It seems to me quite clear that we have to take a very firm decision on this matter of the small schools.  For quite some time the Department have not been building one-teacher schools except in the case of schools for minority religions who are in a special case but we in the Department of Education have good reason to believe that in the case of small one-teacher and two-teacher schools, in general the educational attainment of the children is, on average, two years behind that of children in larger schools.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious matter.  Consequently, I have made up my mind that it is a matter I will do something about.  I know we are going to run into considerable opposition, most of which will be based on misguided sentiment, and I would appeal to Deputies to consider the interests of the children and not to lend support to the kind of agitation which will arise and which has arisen in cases such as this.  I would remind Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches that Deputy Dillon, when he was Leader of their Party, on numerous occasions expounded the view that it was necessary to have larger schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is, of course, that a teacher, no matter how good he is, if he is trying to cover all classes, just cannot do this.  It is not physically possible.  Therefore, I intend, in so far as it is feasible to do it, where, say, the question of building a new school arises or where a teacher is retiring, to examine the position in each case to see if it would not be possible, instead of building a new school or replacing the teacher, to have the <Col N="1969" /> children attending that school attend a central school, to enable us to have a bigger school with more teachers, if possible, one teacher to each class. This, of course, implies the provision by the State of transport for the children concerned.  This is an absolutely necessary element and will be carried out.  I do not think I need dwell further on that matter, except again to appeal to Deputies, when the objections come, as they will, to remember that the educational interests of the children concerned are involved and not to allow sentiment to stand in the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a question to the Minister at this stage on that point? Does the Minister imply at this stage in regard to a two-teacher school whether a boys' school or a girls' school, that the standard of the pupils is, on average, two years behind the standard in the ordinary school?  Is the Minister making that assertion now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Perhaps I may have been&mdash;not intentionally&mdash;slightly misleading in what I said.  The two years refers actually to one-teacher schools but the two-teacher schools present, not quite in as acute a form, the same problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the parents are realising that what I have said is true and are sending their children to the bigger schools.  I should also mention that so far as the teachers involved in the closing of these schools are concerned, they will not lose.  For instance, a principal teacher in one of these schools who as a result of this arrangement goes into a central school will be what is known as a privileged assistant, that is, he will retain all his allowances. He will not lose money as a result of this arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that perhaps some of that comes from the fact, not necessarily in any sense a fault of the teacher, from the small numbers, that pupils are losing competitiveness?  If <Col N="1970" /> there is only one teacher, there must be a small number of pupils.  It is as much a problem of the children not having the competitive spirit amongst themselves to the same degree as would exist in bigger schools?</P>

First, the training of teachers of all kinds is something we intend to have another look at.  There are many things about it that we might consider improving.  It is a very technical matter and not something on which the Department of Education as such is going to make up its mind.  We hope to get outside expert advice on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examination techniques are also matters that will have to be looked at, that is, whether we are putting the right questions in the examinations, whether the examinations are doing what they are supposed to do, whether <Col N="1971" /> they are tending to cramp the education being provided for children.  There are very big questions involved here but I do intend to examine this whole matter of examination techniques and see if we can devise a system which would be, perhaps, more efficient, better suited to what we are trying to do and not have the effect of cramping courses in certain schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton raised a question as to what is happening in County Dublin.  I am sure what I said at the beginning about the survey we are carrying out in the Department will reassure him that we are alive to the problem and are working on it.  I should mention that the development section in my Department, the setting up of which I announced in introducing the Estimate, will have as one of its functions the completion of this survey, the assessment of the results and the application of those results then all over the country.</P>
    <P>The question he mentioned of compulsory purchase powers is one I intend to look into.  I do not want to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; at the moment. He also complained that primary schools in built-up areas are being built too small and that prefabricated buildings have had to be added.  I do not suggest that what I am about to say is true in all cases but experience has shown that in a newly-built area the school-going population in the early years rises to a crescendo and then starts levelling off.  Eventually it levels off at a fairly steady pace for the remainder of the life of the school.  It seems from a long-term point of view the best way to deal with the problem is to build the school to the size at which it will level off and deal with the situation at the beginning by means of prefabricated buildings which can be moved to the next school that is being built.  What Deputy Clinton described as lack of planning and foresight may, in fact, be an example of planning and foresight.</P>

    <P>Tá dhá aidhm leis an leasú atá dá bheartú anois ar scéimeanna aoisliúntais na múinteoirí náisiúnta.  'Sé an bun atá leis an gcéad cheann ná foráil a dhéanamh chun na cnapshuimeanna ar a dtugtaí deontais ex-gratia a híocadh faoin leasú scéime 1953 le múinteoirí a chuaidh ar phinsean roimh 1 Eanáir, 1950 d'athríomhadh sa tslí go dtabharfar an chreidiúint chéanna dóibh i leith a gcuid seirbhíse is a tugadh do na múinteoirí a chuaidh ar phinsean i ndiaidh an dáta sin.  I mí na Márta, 1960, ghlac an Dáil le Vóta chun an soláthar cuí a dhéanamh i gcóir an chostais bhreise sin agus rinneadh íocaíocht leis na múinteoirí, nó lena mbaintreacha, bunaithe ar an triochadú cuid in ionad ar an gcéadú cuid den tuarastal inphinsin i leith gach bliana dá gcuid seirbhíse idir an bhliain 1905 agus an bhliain 1934.  Bé méid na n-íocaíochtaí a rinneadh ná £328,070 agus sé an scéim leasaithe seo an ionstraim reachtúil a rialaíonn na híocaíochtaí sin.</P>
    <P>Is é an dara cuspóir atá ag an leasú seo ná éifeacht a thabhairt do mholadh a rinneadh ag an Chomhairle Idir-Réitigh do na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £11,942,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of a Grant in Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in something of a difficulty in presenting this motion <Col N="1976" /> because, as Deputies know, my predecessor in office, Deputy Hilliard, submitted this Estimate to the House on 10th March last, and the Vote was agreed to after debate on that day. Deputies will find the record in the published Report, volume 214, number 11, columns 1617 to 1702.  It is only because of the dissolution of the Dáil in the meantime that the Estimate has to be re-submitted.  Deputy M. E. Dockrell will be moving the reference back and, accordingly, I assume that there are some aspects of the Department's policy which he wishes to have discussed afresh.  While I am anxious to be as accommodating as possible in meeting the desires of Deputies, I assume that they will not wish me to repeat the explanations previously given of the variations between the details of this year's Estimate and last year's, or the general statement on the Department's programme given so recently by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>In the very short time since my appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I have been occupied in making myself more fully acquainted with the problems of the various services conducted by the Department and it is my intention to pursue actively the programme already placed before the House, with a view to giving satisfaction to the public, who are the Department's customers, and to securing that the maximum efficiency and economy be effected in the operation of the services so as to keep costs at as low a level as possible.</P>
    <P>There is just one change since the Estimate was previously before the House, to which it is right to draw attention, namely, a revision of our forecast of the amount of telephone capital money likely to be required in the current year.  As Deputies are probably aware, the accounting practice is that telephone capital works are paid for initially out of Vote moneys and recoupment is made from telephone capital funds.  It had been expected, when the Estimate was being prepared, that £7¼ million would be spent this year, but, on reconsideration of the position when the Capital Budget was being put in final form, we found that the best estimate that could then <Col N="1977" /> be made was £7 million&mdash;the figure that appears in Table 3 of the Capital Budget, 1965, page 9.  In effect, we now expect to underspend the provision under Subhead F, Engineering Stores and Equipment, by £250,000 and, in consequence, to receive £250,000 less in recoveries in respect of Telephone Capital Expenditure under Subhead T.1, Appropriations in Aid.  The net totals of the Estimate and of the Vote moved by my predecessor and now moved again by me are not affected.  I should like to make clear that this change does not indicate any reduction in the amount of work we intend to do this year but, rather, a later estimate of the amount of payments we are likely to have to meet within this financial year.</P>
    <P>With the exception of this change, which was merely one of forecasting expenditure, such developments of Post Office activities as have taken place in the short interval since the Estimate was previously before the House have been in accordance with the long-term plans then described and hardly require to be mentioned in detail.  However, as I have already indicated, I am at the disposal of Deputies and if there are any matters on which they wish for further information I shall be happy to do my best to provide it when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>With regard to broadcasting and television, fresh legislation is being prepared and will be brought before the House later in the year.  In view of this fact, when the period of office of members of the Authority who had been appointed to serve from 1st June, 1960, expired on 31st May, 1965, the Government decided that the appointments then to be made should be for a term of one year only, pending the enactment of the new legislation.  Some changes were made in the membership of the Authority and I take this opportunity of thanking in particular those members who were not re-appointed for their valuable contribution during the early formative years of the service.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Post Office services proper, I shall do my best, when replying to the debate, to deal <Col N="1978" /> with any fresh questions which Deputies may wish to raise in respect of major matters concerning the Broadcasting and Television Authority's development, and matters in which, as Minister, I have a statutory function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I have heard the Minister's explanation and I can assure him that we do not expect him to have anything very new to say at this juncture.  He has been in office for only a very short period.  However, his predecessor on 10th March last referred to the outstanding numbers of people who were waiting for telephones and it is in relation to telephones and the telephone service that we move to refer back this vote.</P>
      <P>Telephones are a vital part of the machinery of the business community and of the country generally.  It is because of that that we have taken a rather serious view of the Vote on this occasion.  We want to pinpoint and drive home to the new Minister and to the Department that the country generally is not getting from the Post Office the service it should get where telephones are concerned.  We are experiencing a big commercial drive and we want to ensure that this new drive is adequately backed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from the point of view of telephone connections and the telephone service generally.</P>
      <P>What I have to say will, I think, strengthen the Minister's hand ultimately in his dealings with Finance from the point of view of getting a really adequate sum for capital expenditure on telephones generally.  On March 10th last the Minister's predecessor gave a number of figures, in cluding a figure of 1,173 people waiting for telephones for over six months.  One could see that fairly energetic steps were being taken to deal with the situation, but, nevertheless, not quite energetic enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago a number of Deputies visited Shannon.  They saw certain new industries, some just opened and some on the point of opening. I was interested in one entirely <Col N="1979" /> new industry employing Irish girls and some young men.  This firm deals in computers.  As far as I could gather, the stuff is fed into computers in England and then sent to Shannon to be processed.  This is material with regard to wages and complicated matters like that.  When this firm is in full production, I understand the United States will be one of the suppliers. Some of the big companies, it is expected, will send stuff and this will go back to America and the final figures will then go back to England also.  The point I am making is that an industry like that is entirely dependent on speed of communications and the accuracy of our telephone and telegraph services.  An inefficient telephone system can have very bad effects on a country.</P>
    <P>There are too many people in the queue for telephones.  Telephones are not being installed fast enough.  I know the Department have a technical problem of training engineers and so on but that must be faced in a really big way so that the backlog can be dealt with.  There is a number of complaints about delays in getting answers and about trunk calls.  I constantly get complaints about delays and about difficulty in dialling the various services: people do not get a response quickly enough.  I have personal experience of inaccuracies and of telephones that either give an engaged tone or appear to ring so that it seems that nobody is bothering to answer. Quite frequently one finds that no call was received at the other end.  That is very frustrating and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this type of technical fault is cut down to a minimum. It has a very unfortunate effect on business when a firm is blamed for not answering a telephone which, in fact, did not ring.</P>
    <P>I was interested in some comparative figures for the number of telephones in relation to the populations of different countries in 1964.  Ireland has 67.8 telephones per 1,000 of the population.  The United Kingdom has 174.1 and Sweden which has one of the highest in the world has 422.5. What is of interest is that we have one <Col N="1980" /> of the lowest rates per 1,000 in Europe.  I am sure that the Minister will wish to see that position altered as rapidly as possible.  Without unduly labouring the matter, we need more telephones and we need a very close watch kept to see that the technical standards in regard to the telephone service are of the highest order.  I also appeal to the Minister to do here what is done in other countries&mdash;make a considerable reduction in telephone charges on Sundays and/or make a considerable reduction after 6 o'clock in the evenings.  In the long run that would help the telephone service.  If people are encouraged to instal telephones they will not use them exclusively in the cheap periods.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister on that subject.</P>
    <P>Turning to the radio and television side of the Department, these services continue to instruct and entertain us. Both in television and radio those concerned do a very good job considering the limited amount of money available. Compared with what big countries can spend on broadcasting, we are really doing it on a shoestring. Taking that into consideration we put on very good shows.  I should first like to speak of the Radio Éireann Orchestra which is under the baton of Mr. Tibor Paul.  It delights us with a very fine variety of classical programmes. The Sunday night concerts are always completely booked out in the Gaiety Theatre.  That is a very good thing and it shows the support a classical orchestra can get in Dublin. I should also like to refer to Mr. Eimear Ó Broin, a very able and gifted young man, who does a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes on that orchestra.  I congratulate all concerned, the musicians and the Department generally, on never lowering either the standard of the performance or the choice of programmes. One can lower somewhat the standard of a big orchestra by not attempting the most ambitious pieces but the Radio Éireann Orchestra has been built up to rank as one of the first-class European orchestras.</P>
    <P>That goes for the light music section also.  The Light Orchestra is very <Col N="1981" /> good and I congratulate it also, because it is no easier to play much of the light music than it is to play what is called very classical music.  Light music is not necessarily any easier or any simpler to play.  I would say that we have orchestras which, when the Kennedy Hall is opened, will be worthy to play in a hall dedicated to the memory of that very great man.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with television programmes in any great detail but I should like to see as much use as possible made of our local talent, both in regard to music and in regard to plays, our actors and actresses.  We are very fortunate in this country in being one of the places in the entire English speaking world which probably produces more first-rate artistes per thousand of the population than anywhere else.  Our figures may be a bit low with regard to telephones per thousand but I would say that they are pretty high on first-class actors and actresses.  I am glad to see that television gives these people the chance of earning a living in their own country and I should like to see more and more home produced plays and as little as possible of imported films.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that some of the imported films are necessarily objectionable but these canned features are not good.  One thing which I find especially ridiculous is the canned applause.  A joke which might raise a smile but no more on the face of an average Irish person seems to rock these simple souls in the audience who were present when the film was being made&mdash;but, of course, in fact the applause is added afterwards and very often it gives a very unreal effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to plays on television and other features, I would like to say that advertising time must be watched. In other words, you can break up a programme, whether it be a play or a film, too much by putting in too many intervals for advertising.  I know that advertising revenue is of importance but one has to watch that the entertainment and interest of the viewers is not sacrificed to the revenue from advertising.  After all, each owner of a set is paying £4 a year now and he or <Col N="1982" /> she is entitled to the maximum amount of clear viewing without having to watch too many advertisements. I noticed that in other countries advertising time is very closely watched by the parliaments concerned and by groups of people and I would suggest that the Minister should advise the Television Authority to keep a very watchful eye to see that these times are not exceeded.  Radio Éireann does good work in its own way also. It, of course, has not now the popular appeal that television has but it is very good in its own way.  There are many first class artistes of various sorts working for Radio Éireann and giving us very good entertainment on a very limited budget.</P>
    <P>I turn now to postal facilities, the question of letters, parcels and so on. In the city we have, of course, more deliveries than in the country areas but we still have a very small number &mdash; I think there are only two &mdash; of deliveries per day.  I would ask the Minister and his Department always to bear in mind that the post is very much the handmaiden of industry; it is not just a question of facilitating private individuals communicating with each other, just as it is not, on the telephone side, a case of the housewife or the private individual who wants to ring up a friend, although there is nothing wrong with that, and it is a very important part of both the postal deliveries and of the telephone service.  These two sections have an enormous impact on business. Postal charges, as we know, have gone up a great deal and one of the difficulties about the price of letters is that it has cut into a type of business, namely circularising, of which a lot of businesses did a great deal in the past. Now it has become increasingly difficult, because of the expense, to use circulars as much as industry would like.</P>
    <P>I have been looking back on the telegraph and postal and telephone services over the last number of years and apparently the telephone services have always seemed to pay, the post used pay but does not pay now, and the telegraph services apparently always lose and still continue to lose. <Col N="1983" /> It would be interesting to hear if the Minister has any comment which would throw fresh light on that situation in the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hold up the House unduly.  The services are improving but the telephone service has not improved from the point of view of the backlog of individuals awaiting telephones. When I say &ldquo;individuals,&rdquo; I include businesses.  It is much more serious for them to have to wait.  I would urge on the Minister the urgency of dealing with this backlog and the great importance of ensuring that the standard of service is kept as high as possible because, of course, everybody who dials a number and does not get through instantly gets very annoyed.  I tried to ring a Garda station a couple of nights ago and it took me five minutes to get through.</P>

When I had finished dialling, it seemed to slip and went back to the general dialling tone. These are the things of importance, from a technical viewpoint, which should bother the Minister.  The public get very annoyed and frustrated when that happens.  I do not know whether it is a general complaint all over the country but it certainly is in Dublin exchanges which, I am told, are overloaded. I urge on the Minister to push forward his programme of capital investment in the telephone service with all speed.  It is of tremendous importance to keep our standard as high as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say how glad I am to see Deputy Joseph Brennan here as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I would wish him a long reign but I do not think that would be very satisfactory for me. Before the general election, I dealt at length with this Department and do not intend to detain the House very <Col N="1984" /> long on this occasion.  However, I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions. If he is unable to reply to them when concluding, I hope he will do so later by letter.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to deal with the matter of mail deliveries.  The service is being taken on more and more by motorised postmen in place of personnel who formerly did it on foot or on bikes.  I understand arrangements have been made for consultation with the union before new motorised posts are set up.  When that happens, I understand that two posts are to be amalgamated into one motorised post. In this connection I should like to know exactly what is meant by consultation. Is it consultation with the representatives of the 70 head office districts at local branch level?  When a motorised post is being set up, is it the idea that when posts become vacant in future, every two will be put into one?</P>
      <P>If so, what is to happen to existing postmen who cannot or will not become drivers?  Is there to be a certain amount of redundancy because of the change in the system?  Older men, particularly, must be considered in this respect.  Are we to take it that all future motorised posts will be full-time and that there will be no part-time appointments?  Of course part-time appointments are not favoured by anybody.  I should like to know also whether the system of putting motor cycles into certain services instead of vans or cars is to be extended. I do not think that would be a good idea.  The Department might save a few shillings a week because they would have to pay the person on the motor cycle less.  Can I take it that in future vans and cars will be used rather than motor cycles to do this type of work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Postmen's uniforms is another matter I should like to raise.  Can the Minister say if it is proposed to improve the uniform?  We know the design has been changed during the past couple of years but the quality of the cloth has not been improved.  We still have the caps which, after a shower of rain, leave us with blue men because the dye comes off in the rain.  The cloth <Col N="1985" /> being used at the moment seems to be like hessian.  It is badly knit and does not keep out the rain.  Postmen, it has truly been said, are the public face of the Post Office.  Why should we maintain a system in which, it appears, the one uniform was designed for every postman in the service from a suit made for a fellow who was not too well made himself but on whom it was never fitted?  That is the type of uniform we see on most postmen.  Can we take it there will be a standard cut uniform for postmen?  I understand an effort was made to present the Department with a special type cloth and a suit design.  What happened?</P>
    <P>On the question of buildings, I am sure the Minister is aware that a number of old ones need replacement.  What is happening about Navan post office or, as it is known to the Department, An Uaimh?  Will that post office be replaced in the near future or will it be left there until it falls?  Going nearer to the Minister, what about Donegal? Something must be done there also. In Navan, there is not sufficient accommodation. I understand the telephone exchanges in Bantry and Skibbereen are entirely unsatisfactory, though we were told some time ago they were to be brought up to date.  What are the reasons for the delay?</P>
    <P>I must say the telephone service generally has improved.  On the other hand, the rate of connections does not seem to have improved or is it that the people who come to me happen to be people who do not have the best luck in this matter?  Every week I meet people asking why telephones for which they asked years ago have not been installed.  It is useless telling them that the lines are overloaded and that they must wait until the new system is introduced.  In most cases they can point to a neighbour who applied for a telephone several months after they did and got it without any difficulty. Can the Minister tell me if there is any hope of getting the service more quickly to people who have been waiting for long periods?</P>
    <P>I find it necessary at this stage to refer to one other matter because a <Col N="1986" /> certain amount of confusion has arisen&mdash;it did so during Questions today.  In speeches here status pay has been referred to.  When we refer to status pay, in these benches we refer to people who got increases out of turn.  We are not talking about the amount of money given to a number of people, including civil servants and Post Office personnel, who got increases in wages they should have got years ago.  It is necessary to clarify that because there seems to be an awful lot of misunderstanding about it.  Some people think officials in the Post Office got increases out of turn and that they thereby set in motion another wage increase round.  That is not true and it is necessary to make the point clear.  The so-called status increases they got were in fact the arrears they should have got many months, sometimes many years, before.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister to ensure that in future, when there is a general round of wage increases, the employees in his Department will be kept in line with what is happening elsewhere and that they will not be left behind for a couple of years, then find themselves getting an increase and having the finger pointed at them by people who say: &ldquo;Those people are getting an increase out of turn and we must get up to them now.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I rise to protest in no uncertain terms against the recent production shown on Telefís Éireann.  I do so on behalf of the parents who found their children were viewing a filthy and foul-spoken production.  It is a sad day when we are not sure of the type of production which can be put across on our children.  It is rather strange that the <i>News of the World</i> said that such a production was not fit to be seen on the BBC.</P>

It is a sad day when such stuff can be shown by Telefís Éireann.  Telefís Éireann should have some standard of decency and it is about time the Minister put his foot down in regard to a matter of this sort.  I protest against this in the very strongest measure.</P>
      <P>With regard to a different topic, I should like to see Telefís Éireann having talent scouts out to tap the latent talent we have throughout the country. We have Dublin jackeens with beards and what-have-you.  It is all right to see them once.  We saw them with bottles of stout at the fleadh ceóil.  They made a big business of it.  We have very good material throughout the country.  We had them at the fleadh ceóil but they were not out with porter bottles, beards or what-have-you.  Some of them were good all right but it was the others whom Telefís Éireann told us about on the news.  This latent talent throughout the country should be tapped and given its chance.  Mind you, God did not give all the talent to Dublin.</P>

      <P>I want to mention two small matters to the Minister.  One matter refers to the provision of a telephone at Guileen, Whitegate, which is four miles from either a priest or a doctor.  There is no means of obtaining one during the night, if one is needed, except on foot.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should look into this particular matter.  My friend from Galway, in his protest, reminded me of two Deputies who were coming up here to Dublin.</P>

He was describing the high kicks of the ladies there.  The following week he was up again and he went to the Gaiety.  The old lad who had all the complaints about the disrespectful talk was sitting in the seat in front of him.</P>
      <P>The other matter I want to speak about is in connection with advertising. Some of our Irish industrialists have come to me about this matter already. I wonder would the Minister tell us is it correct that there is to be a pretty stiff increase in the advertising charges on Telefís Éireann?  I wonder how is that increase to be explained to the prices board or the prices commission when we come to deal with it now? Will it be explained on the ground that we are paying more to the bearded gentlemen alluded to by the Deputy opposite a while ago?  Is it because we have to increase the fees to the gentlemen who off and on appear on the screen that we have to increase the charges for advertising on Telefís Éireann?  I should like the Minister to make it clear, if there is to be an increase, if an increase has been proposed already and if it is as high as 50 per cent, or what percentage is it? Those are just a few matters to which I should like an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I rise to deal with one net point, that is, the telephone system.  This is the year 1965 and communication by telephone has now ceased to be a luxury.  It has ceased to be an exceptionally fast system of communication.  It is the normal system of communication that every businessman relies on to carry on his normal business.  As a matter of fact, if a person were deprived of the telephone in this year and age, it would take him perhaps hours to do something that he should be able to deal with in a matter of minutes.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister and to <Col N="1989" /> the Government to get ahead with the completion and the supply of telephones to everyone in the country who wants them.  This is not something that will be a charge on the Exchequer because, as I understand it, the telephone system is one section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which is paying its way.  It is only a matter, therefore, of providing the equipment, providing the men and getting on with the work.</P>
      <P>I hope, now that we have a new Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that matters will be attended to much faster than they were previously.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  Like Deputy James Tully, I could not be expected to wish him a long reign but I wish him a fruitful reign.  I wish him a period of office during which a lot of work will be done in his Department.</P>
      <P>So far I have dealt with the problem of telephonic communication in a general way, and I may be pardoned if I become parochial now.  The county of Cavan is one of the few counties, if not the only county, that has not got an automatic exchange.  This is something with which the people of Cavan are very dissatisfied.  To come to the town of Cavan, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs acquired a property known as the Central Markets in the centre of the town over two years ago&mdash;as a matter of fact, I think it was in 1962&mdash;for the purpose of providing a new post office and an automatic exchange.  Nothing has been done with that building yet. It is lying there, and not only have the Department failed to use it, although the local urban council gave it to them for a song, but it is an eyesore and a derelict site in the centre of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come to my knowledge recently that the Department propose to spend money on the existing building by erecting some sort of additional exchange in the garden of the old building which they hold under a lease with only a few years to go.  As I said in a communication to the Department recently, far be it from me to dissuade the Department from providing <Col N="1990" /> much needed additional telephones in the town, but it appears to me to be a waste of money to spend it on a building which they will be handing over in a short time, when they have a fine new building in the centre of the town on which they could get on with the work.</P>
    <P>I had a telephone call yesterday morning before I left Cavan from a very staunch supporter of the Minister, a travel agent, who rang me in desperation to complain about the telephone service in Cavan.  He stressed the fact that he was not complaining about the personnel who were doing the best they could, but was complaining about the lack of equipment and the lack of installations there.  He had in with him yesterday morning an American priest and a German tourist, and he had sent them out to walk around the streets of Cavan, while, as he told them, he was waiting on a call to Dublin to deal with their problems. We hear all sorts of pleas in regard to tourism, but when tourists meet with that sort of service, and that sort of delay, they cannot be very impressed.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the personnel in the post office in Cavan are the soul of courtesy.  As a matter of fact, one wonders how they keep their patience, working under such conditions as they are expected to work under, and putting up with so many justified complaints as they have to listen to from subscribers.  I do not expect miracles from the Minister.  He has been in that office only a short time, but I do think we would have done a good day's work if we could impress on the Minister that this is something that should not be dealt with as Departments are wont to deal with things.  Sometimes it occurs to me that Departments of State must believe that the life of man is about 500 years, because four or five years to a Department seem to be nothing.  It is a substantial length of time in the business life of a man.</P>
    <P>They seem to pass things about from one section of the Department to another and they seem to consider and reconsider them.  I urge the Minister to bring a breath of fresh air <Col N="1991" /> into his Department&mdash;and I am not saying it is any worse than any other Department.  It has inherited an easy and ponderous way of dealing with things and the idea that a year or a few years are neither here nor there. We have only our lives to live, and we all wish to avail of such modern methods as are available to the rest of the world, particularly telephones and rapid communications.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get on with the business all over the country, and I particularly appeal to him to give Cavan a fair crack of the whip. Cavan is one of the Cinderella counties, and it is not getting a fair crack of the whip from his Department and, indeed, some other Departments.  I appeal to him to get on with the building of the new post office and the automatic telephone exchange in the town of Cavan for two reasons.  First, they are badly needed and, secondly, the site which the Department acquired is an eyesore in the centre of the town, a derelict site, which has done the town a lot of harm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate, like the previous speaker, to dwell primarily on the delays involved in the installation of telephones.  I must question the kind of test which the Department apply to priority rating for the installation of telephones.  I know there is quite a backlog of arrears in my own constituency of South Tipperary in the provision of this essential amenity.</P>
      <P>It is disconcerting for a public representative to have to repeat time and again the urgency of the installation of telephones, not merely for the ordinary person but also for people in business who are dependent in very large measure on telephones.  Grocers, building contractors, publicans, people of great importance in our community, are held up interminably awaiting this modern amenity.  I appreciate that certain preliminary work must be carried out before one gets a telephone, and that the laying of trunk lines is a very important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary purpose in questioning the kind of test the Department <Col N="1992" /> apply in regard to who is entitled as a matter of urgency to a telephone, is the fact that within recent weeks I was obliged to make representations to the Department, and to the Minister directly, in regard to a party I consider to be not merely of great local importance in my constituency, but of great national importance and, may I say, of great international importance. Some delay ensued before I received an acknowledgment of my recommendations and I was obliged to talk to the Minister and tell him who the personalities involved were.  The talk on that occasion was very heartening to me, and I assumed the telephone would be installed without further delay.  There was further delay and I had another talk with the Minister. My concern can be imagined when I finally got the usual reply that some considerable time would elapse before this telephone could be provided.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to mention the parties concerned because they are people who, in my opinion, have brought great fame to this country. They have brought quite a sizeable amount of revenue to this country as well and have brought the fame of Ireland abroad into the world by reason of their proficiency in balladry. They have been primarily responsible for the resurgence of Irish balladry all over the world.  I refer to the Clancy Brothers.  This group, on whose behalf I made representations, who are selling more records in this country than any other group of artists or group of singing personalities, including the Beatles, could not be provided with this telephone until some time had elapsed.  It is rather startling when Her Gracious Majesty the Queen could confer the signal honour of MBE on the Beatles, that the Minister, in spite of representations by me, could not provide a telephone for the Clancy Brothers.  I question the wisdom of doing this kind of thing to people who, as I have said, have won world renown for their outstanding ability as ballad singers and who have brought substantial revenue to this country as a result.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House, having regard to the arrangements that have been made but there is another matter that concerns me and I shall mention it briefly.  The kind of efficiency in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in recent years has been such that I sincerely hope the Minister in his capacity will improve it.  It seems to me utterly degrading that senior officers of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are sent down the country to apply a system of time and motion study to unfortunate <Col N="1994" /> postmen and various other categories of workers in the postal service.</P>
    <P>These officials walk or cycle out behind these unfortunate men and time them in respect of every house they are obliged to visit with a letter or parcel.  As a result of this unsavoury and degrading practice the amount of time previously allotted for the carrying out of the job is reduced. This creates an element of redundancy in the various regions.  To call this efficiency, to my mind, is a retrograde step.  I submit to the Minister that there is a more honourable, Christian and a fairer way of determining redundancy within his Department than by this kind of unchristian imposition on these workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House.  I just wish to mention a few points in which I know the Minister as a Donegal man will take special interest.  Knowing him as I do.  I shall not have to mention the matters here again.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating him on his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and, like my colleagues, wish him happiness while he is there but, at the same time, hoping that he representing Fianna Fáil will not be in that office too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I feel the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, like myself, must have received many representations about is the practice regarding postal addresses in County Donegal. I should like to tell the House that if one wishes to post a letter to Malin Head, one must put Lifford on the address.  That tends to mislead people into believing that Malin Head is a suburb of Lifford.  Likewise, if you wish to post a letter to Arranmore Island, you must put Letterkenny on it.  I have discussed this with Post Office officials and I feel that a serial code, the same as in the city of Dublin, of 1, 2 and 3 to cover Donegal town, Letterkenny and Lifford would be more of a guide to tourists and to people who do not know the geography of Donegal as well as the natives of the county.  I hope that the Minister will take special note of that.  I have raised <Col N="1995" /> the matter many times in this House before.  I think some stubborn civil servant in his Department knows he made a mistake and is not manly enough to admit it.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to take up with the Minister and I am sure he has received representations on this as well.  In Donegal, if we wish to telephone someone in Great Britain, the call is channelled through to Dublin and from Dublin to Liverpool and ultimately to the destination which we wish to contact.  When the Minister's predecessor was in office, I asked him would he consider, in co-operation with the Northern postal authorities, using the line between Belfast and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the case of a constituent of mine whose daughter was working in London from whence he received a telegram that she was involved in a motor accident.  He booked a call immediately to London and was told that there would be four to five hours delay.  He lives in a very remote part of Donegal but he made his way to one of the larger towns and he, again, booked a call explaining to the telephonist the urgency of it.  The telephonist in his anxiety to help decided he would get through to Derry.  He routed the call through Derry and had the London number on the line in three minutes.</P>
    <P>This particular constituent of mine, trying to figure out why this could not have been done in the first instance, approached a senior officer in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs only to discover that the officer was more interested to know who the telephonist was who put through the call, and broke the regulations of the Department by going through Derry, than he was in the predicament in which this constituent of mine found himself.</P>
    <P>On the following day, to avoid all the red tape in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, this man went to Derry city and booked a call.  I would venture to say he got the call quicker than if he had rung Lifford. He told me he had the London number <Col N="1996" /> on the line in two minutes.  This is no news to the Minister: I know he has received many complaints similar to this and I hope he will give special attention to it.  I hope that when next he presents his Estimate to this House all of these matters will be remedied.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I must refer to the delay in the installation of telephones. I am told by an official in the Department that the worst county in Ireland for the installation of telephones is County Donegal.  I do not know if this is due to the practice of the Minister's predecessor in the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry is more interested in Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves than he is in County Donegal. If it is the position that County Donegal is the worst off county in respect of telephone installations, then I protest in the strongest possible terms. I trust the Minister will bring the installation of telephones there up to the average of that of every other county in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is a particular point I would like to raise in relation to a person from rural Ireland who comes to Dublin and wishes to contact home by telephone.  He goes into a telephone kiosk in some part of the city and books a call and the operator informs him that there will be a delay of one hour or more.  If he changes his mind and wishes to contact the operator to cancel the call, it is nearly impossible to get the same operator on the line again.  In view of the fact that operators do not disclose their names&mdash;and obviously it is a very good idea that they do not&mdash;I suggest that each operator should have a number so that when a person would find himself in this dilemma, then, on re-dialling the exchange, he could ask for the telephonist of that number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Blame Deputy Corry who, I believe, was waiting there until I got on my feet so that he could interrupt me.  I feel that the Department should pay night telephonists more money so as to get volunteers to do this type of work.  I have spoken with a few of the senior officials in the Department who must take their turn at this type of work and they do not wish to do it, despite the fact that they are being paid overtime for it.  If the Department would pay people who are unemployed or who have part-time jobs, I think they would have volunteers to do the work.  All the civil servants in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs recognise that one of the biggest problems at the moment in rural Ireland is to get night telephonists.  I cannot see why they should not pay night telephonists and discontinue this practice of paying senior officials of the Department who do not want to do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I cannot understand is that when the Department re-issue stamps, they continue to use the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  What is wrong with the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;?  If a letter goes to America, it used to have &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; on the stamp and any returned American to this country continually refers to the &ldquo;Free State&rdquo;.  I can visualise, in ten or 15 years' time, this country being called &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; due to the fact that the Government persist in the use of the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; on the postage <Col N="1998" /> stamps.  I feel that &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; should be the word to use and that we should be proud of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned a famous programme on Telefís Éireann on Sunday night week last.  I did not see the particular programme but, from what I hear, it is something that should be condemned from the highest sources.  I hope we do not have a repeat performance.</P>
    <P>I feel that something is wrong when Telefís Éireann collect money from advertisements and also collect money out of taxation to produce a programme. The BBC charge for a licence.  Ulster Television do not charge for a licence: they can produce the programme out of the money they receive from advertisements.  However, Telefís Éireann have to have a go at both sides.  Deputy T. Lynch, speaking about the difference between Sweden and Ireland, said that possibly the prosperity in Sweden is due to the fact that they have not a Fianna Fáil Government there.  Maybe the same applies in relation to Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a warning that most people in the country believe it more as day follows day that Telefís Eireann is heading towards a propaganda machine for the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is a national authority. I feel that if the Government deserve praise, they are entitled to get it. Likewise, if they have to be criticised they should be criticised and in no uncertain terms.  It must be an offence for any member of the television authority to criticise the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that I disagree with the direction of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the closing of sub-offices. If it is necessary to close these offices, surely the Minister should take into consideration the possibility of allowing the telephone communication to remain in them?  In answer to a Parliamentary Question which I put to him the week before last, he informed me that it is uneconomic to do so. In a case like this, I feel that economics should be a secondary consideration. We should respect the aged, the <Col N="1999" /> infirm and the people who, for one reason or another, just cannot go to the nearest town to make a telephone call or go to a post office for a service which was available in their own locality until then.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well while he remains Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise only two points on this Estimate.  The first is in connection with the transmission of mail from Ireland to Britain. In my constituency, as the Minister will ascertain, there is a very forward-looking industry which has set up a subsidiary company in England for the purpose of the development of exports. Having regard to the way that company is placed, it is impossible for the work to be done here in connection <Col N="2000" /> with the ordering and clerical work unless there is a really first-class postal service between Droichead Nua and the London area.  The present situation is that it is not satisfactory.  I can remember when I was a child that if you posted a letter in Naas or Newbridge, it was always delivered in London the next morning and <i>vice versa.</i> That is not so now, even though we have air services.  I understand the reason is that all airmail deliveries are routed through Manchester.  The Minister may say this is an arrangement made by the British Post Office.  It may be, but I am sure it could be changed if pressure were put on them, in particular, pressure in relation to payment for the services required.</P>
      <P>The present position is that you have to post a letter before mid-day in the London area if it is to be delivered in Droichead Nua the following morning. That is a very bad service in these days of air services.  I am apprehensive that, unless a guarantee of better delivery can be given, a good part of the mechanics of distribution of the factory's wares may have to be moved over to their office in the London area rather than carried on in my constituency. That would be a disastrous thing, both from the point of view of the town where the factory is situated and from the national point of view. From the point of view of balance of payments, it is obvious we must do everything possible to ensure that as much as possible of that type of work is done in Ireland.  In that way we would have a plus on our balance of payments returns rather than the minus we would have if it were done on the other side.</P>
      <P>I would urge very strongly on the Minister to seek with the British authorities a revision of the methods adopted, if I am right in thinking that it is at their request that all airmails are routed through Manchester.  I would ask him to arrange with them that mails coming from the south of England be routed through one of the airports there rather than sent up to the north.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I wish to deal with is telephones.  It is an old hobbyhorse of almost every Deputy.  I should <Col N="2001" /> like the Minister to tell us when are we going to get a reasonably efficient telephone service.  We could all understand it if we were told flatly it would not be all right until such and such a time and until such and such work is done, but what infuriates people more than anything else is to be told time and again that the service is perfect as it is.  I wrote to the Minister nearly six weeks or two months ago about an instance when I had occasion to dial 10 to get an operator and 41 pips sounded before I got any reply.  How that can happen I do not know.  There is some improvement, but it is not a unique experience at all that such long delays occur in relation to answering of calls.</P>
    <P>In the last five years the commercial community have moved over far more to telephones.  The advent of automatic connection should mean more secrecy in relation to telephone conversations, and that has undoubtedly meant greater usage.  The telephone is an essential means of communication for the business community, but unless there is to be a better service at some point of time, it is a bleak prospect. I would ask the Minister to indicate when he expects to be able to provide that service.  His predecessor always took the line that he had inherited the bad position in 1957. Eight years have elapsed since then. Fianna Fáil are always claiming that they are able to provide everything required at once.  Surely if that is so&mdash; I do not accept it is&mdash;the results should have been seen?</P>
    <P>I would urge that there should be greater frankness.  I am bound to say that on the only occasion I came across the Minister performing an official function in my constituency, I found a great improvement in frankness compared with his predecessor. It is only fair that I should say that. I must confess on that occasion I was astounded at the intricacies behind the scenes of an automatic telephone exchange.  If the members of the public were taken more into confidence, I believe there would be greater appreciation. Certainly, as a result of what I saw that day, I have a greater <Col N="2002" /> appreciation of how things can go wrong, having regard to the intricacies of the machinery.  What is required is more public relations of that sort to relieve one's annoyance and to ensure that the public realise a day is coming&mdash;we hope in the immediate future &mdash;when there will be a reasonably efficient service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it my duty as a rural Deputy to protest against the inadequate telephone service.  No later than yesterday in my own constituency, I booked a telephone call to Dublin, a distance of 100 miles.  It took me 1¼ hours to get through.  In another half-hour, I would have been in Dublin in my car.  That is a desperate situation in which to find ourselves in 1965.  We have got the usual answer from the Government benches over the years that the lines are overloaded. As Deputy Sweetman said, surely in seven successive years of Fianna Fáil Government, they should have tried to do something about the situation and provide a reasonable service?</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention the delay in dealing with applications for telephones.  But when I get a letter from constituents looking for telephones in their business or farms, I often wonder will they be better off when the phone is installed.  When people who have no experience of phones make application for one, they think they will be able to get in touch with their local doctor or veterinary surgeon in a few minutes.  However, when they have the phone for a short time, they discover they could be there much more quickly in their cars.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister is prepared to improve the service, particularly in the rural areas, I doubt if there is much need to instal telephones at all. In my constituency the delay is two years.  When one sees the advent of an automatic phone service in the cities and urban areas, one feels the attitude is that anything is good enough for the unfortunate people in rural Ireland.  I believe the Minister will pay some attention to people living in rural areas, seeing that he himself comes from a rural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we are getting any <Col N="2003" /> charity from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Within the past year, the charges for telephone service, telegraph service and postal service have increased.  Telephone subscribers and people who purchase stamps are paying a good price and are entitled to a much better service than is provided. I often wonder how long the Department would last in the business world. The Minister should give that question some thought.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across the case of a telegram sent from England announcing a death.  The telegram was received at a rural post office but was not delivered to the addressee until the next day.  I checked with the local post office and was informed that there was no obligation on them to deliver the telegram.  It is an extraordinary position that there is no onus on the Post Office authorities to deliver a telegram until the day after receiving it.  A person may have to emigrate to England through no fault of his own. If he dies in England and if a neighbour sends a telegram to inform his family, it would appear that there is no onus on the Post Office to deliver that telegram until the following day when the postman is going on his route.  The Minister should give some thought to that matter.  Telegrams should be delivered immediately, even at extra charge.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of postal addresses, to which my colleague, Deputy Harte, also referred. For instance, if somebody's address is Mohill.  Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, and if a visitor to this country wants to find the address, he will drive to Carrick-on-Shannon only to discover that he has gone through Mohil, ten miles away, and has to drive back.  That is bad enough but there is a worse situation again in my constituency which has been so divided by the Fianna Fáil Party that one wonders sometimes where parts of it are. Arigna is in Co. Roscommon.  The postal address is Arigna, Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim.  It is difficult to explain to strangers the intention of the person who is responsible for arranging these matters.  The Minister <Col N="2004" /> should see what can be done to remedy this matter.  In the case I mentioned first, if a letter is addressed to &ldquo;Mohill, County Leitrim&rdquo;, it will find its destination.  In the second case a letter addressed to &ldquo;Arigna, Keadue, County Roscommon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keadue, Boyle, County Roscommon&rdquo; will find its destination but &ldquo;Arigna, Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim&rdquo; is completely silly.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully referred to postal deliveries in some part of the country.  I should like to bring him up to date.  My information is that in my adopted constituency, quite recently, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs decided to have letters delivered by van and one of the Department's vans is being driven up and down every by-road and side road and <i>cul-de-sac</i> in Roscommon on postal delivery service.  I cannot understand that.  It may be that they did not want to appoint a postman here. It would be much more economic to pay a man the small wage postmen were being paid than to have a van with a driver being driven up and down every by-road and high road.  It crossed my mind that the reason they did not want to appoint a postman was that there may have been two or three ardent supporters of their Party looking for the job and any way out should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Any time I have troubled him I have found him very courteous and helpful.  I hope he stays there as long as the Fianna Fáil Party remain in office.  I hope that will not be too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to share with Deputy Reynolds his last two sentiments and to wish the Minister personally well in his office.  He is not the worst of Fianna Fáil Ministers.  That in itself is a compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I share Deputy Reynold's horror at the thought of a van going up and down every by-road, side road and <i>cul-de-sac</i> in Roscommon.  Having endured such an ordeal in a private car some months ago in a very good <Col N="2005" /> cause, I know the damage it can do to the chassis of both vehicle and person.  It does seem to be an excessive waste of capital equipment.  There are other mechanical means of getting about the country, such as scooters and motor cycles, which would seem to be a more useful way of providing a speedy postal service.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a matter that I promised the Minister I would deal with, that is, the question of the outrageous restrictions the Department is putting on the efforts of Dublin Corporation to provide master aerials for flat schemes in this city.  We are increasing the number of flats for the homeless people of Dublin.  This is a trend which is almost certain to increase as years go by.  The flat dwellers are not permitted by Dublin Corporation, for good and sufficient reason, to use all the chimney pots and all the roof space on these flats for the erection of individual television aerials.  It has been done in some cases and, to say the least, the result is not aesthetically beautiful.  There are considerable risks involved for the individuals who erect these aerials.  The corporation have suffered their erection in a number of cases, not wishing to be unduly restrictive on their tenants and not wishing to deny them a facility which is available to every householder in the city and every tenant of a corporation house, but, because of the attitude of the Department, the corporation are unable to erect economic and sensible television aerials to serve these flat schemes.  The rule of the Department is that no master aerial may be put up to serve any more than ten units of housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Under pressure, here, the other day, the Minister conceded that the reason for this was that they did not wish these people to receive on their sets any programme except that sent out by Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch can make very useful contributions and can always tease out the little irritants and the little things which are preventing the proper fabric from being knitted. That is the real reason and the Minister has given us to understand that he does not wish to permit people to watch any other programme not only because of the political considerations but also because he fears it might have an effect upon the advertising revenue being earned by Telefís Éireann.  I do not believe there is any justification for such fears.  Radio Éireann has to compete with stations as far away as Sweden and Italy.  Even on the cheapest sets, Radio Éireann has to compete with innumerable programmes being put out by several countries, Britain, France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Italy and sometimes one can get reception much further afield.  Notwithstanding that, Radio Éireann, according to the official figures &mdash;and I have no reason to doubt them &mdash;is able to show at any given moment, except when programmes in Irish are on, that it has the highest percentage of listeners here.  The advertising revenue of Radio Éireann is satisfactory and I am not aware that any of the advertising space it has available is not being taken up.  The Minister should be courageous enough to permit people to have a choice in the television programmes they may see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, in Dublin we intend to increase the number of flats.  They will be erected to higher levels and it is imperative, if the people in these flats are not to be penalised and unduly restricted in their television programmes, that master aerials be erected.  I would plead with the Minister not to allow the silly attitude of his predecessors to continue to operate while he is Minister.  We cannot succeed in <Col N="2007" /> keeping out foreign programmes by erecting a green fence around this green island of ours.  It cannot be done in this day and age with vastly improved communications and increasing distribution of the printed word.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to be imposing this restriction on Dublin Corporation in their wish to erect master aerials when Telstar, Early Bird and other satellites of this kind are being sent up and when international reception of television programmes on an increased scale will be a matter of common experience within the next decade.  To impose this restriction now when technical advances will be able to overcome the restriction within the next decade is stupid and shortsighted in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Another matter in respect of which I wish to criticise the Minister is the delay in the production here of machines to sell books of stamps.  It is fantastic that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the largest buying agency in the State, is unable to acquire such a machine.  One can buy coffee by machine, cocoa by machine, tea by machine, stockings by machine, cooked meals by machine.  Every kind of inconvenient thing can now be produced on the drop of a coin with the exception of postage stamps produced by An Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa i bPoblacht na hÉireann.  How stupidly can the Minister perform here? I do not think he is being fair to himself when he states in the House that there are difficulties in designing a stamp vending machine to turn out books of stamps in exchange for a coin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be beyond the resources of the engineers of this country and of the manufacturers of stamps and stamp books to produce a machine, stamps and a stamp book which will work satisfactorily.  It is fantastic to think that it has taken over half a decade to produce this. What are the economics in regard to purchasing stamps after hours?  There was a time when Dublin people who urgently wished to post letters after hours could go to the GPO where there was an office open all round the clock. That was closed down some years ago. Apparently we could not bear the expense of such a service for the people of Dublin but we can bear to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year on the provision of a round-the-clock service for foreign tourists who fly through Shannon Airport.  In any event, we withdrew the 24-hour service in the GPO and now if a person wishes to send, say, three letters after hours, they must find 15 coppers in order to purchase three stamps.  Any person would find it extremely difficult to acquire 15 coppers after midnight unless he had laid them in store.  With the devaluation that has taken place in money, it <Col N="2009" /> is more than likely that most people would have half a crown.</P>

It is improper conduct on the part of the Department to disconnect the telephone service of a person while that person is legitimately questioning the account, and this has happened.  It happened to one gentleman who refused over a number of years to accept the accounts from the Department.  On each occasion on which he carried his account beyond a month his telephone was disconnected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After some three years of protesting <Col N="2010" /> on his part, the Department went to the trouble of going to the local exchange and they found, as a result of that visitation, that he was quite justified in his complaints because calls made by other subscribers were registered against his number.  He then received a casual apology, and no more, though in the interval his credit had been damaged in the eyes of those who tried to communicate with him and found the telephone disconnected, thereupon assuming the account had not been paid because the subscriber did not have the wherewithal to pay it.  Other subscribers have on occasion not received accounts sent out&mdash;no delivery service is perfect&mdash;and they have also suffered the ignominy of having their telephones disconnected.  All we ask is just a little bit of good manners from the Department and, if we get those, the Department will find that subscribers will not be unreasonable in their demands.</P>
    <P>There is also the deliberate sabotage in the Department when people omit postal district numbers.  Before these numbers were introduced, correspondence posted in Dublin was delivered within a matter of hours.  Now, if a person omits the postal district number, it may take three, four, or five days for the letter to reach its destination, although the address may be in all other respects perfectly satisfactory. Clearly this is deliberate sabotage on the part of the Department.  It is a deliberate punishment inflicted by the Department on those who omit district numbers.  The practice is unworthy of the Department and should cease forthwith.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion before to protest against the variation in the service which people in different parts of Dublin receive.  If letters are posted in the centre of Dublin before 11 a.m. they are delivered that afternoon in Rathmines and Rathgar.  If they are addressed, however, to Drimnagh and Ballyfermot, they are not delivered until the following morning.  We have, I think, a right to protest against this discrimination.  All citizens are entitled to receive the same service.  I ask the Minister to ensure that all sections of <Col N="2011" /> our people receive the same treatment and that this special treatment accorded to some areas is not accorded at the expense of people in other areas.  When I select these particular districts, I am speaking about areas within my own constituency and I am, therefore, perfectly familiar with them and have been able to check with recipients of correspondence from myself the time of delivery.  The present system seems to me to be an unpardonable differential in the treatment of these people.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions I recently elicited some interesting information with regard to the number of stoppages of work due to industrial disputes.  The figure has varied from 36 per cent to 51 per cent of the total in respect of State-sponsored bodies.  In other words, State-sponsored bodies have been responsible in some years for as much as 50 per cent of the total stoppages of work due to industrial disputes.  It was unfortunate, to say the least of it, that we had the dispute between the Department and the subpostmasters, who had served the people well for many decades.  It is also unfortunate that this acrimony is still dragging on.</P>

      <P>Long may that continue. It may well be that the Minister has not yet got his feet set in the ways of his predecessors.  I hope he never will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the industrial relations leave much to be desired.  I do not think he can say that he and the male telephonists are the best of friends. The efforts made by the Department to break the organisation these telephonists established for their own protection were most undesirable and I hope that the differences that still exist between the telephonists and the Department will soon be resolved.  In <Col N="2012" /> this day and age, the Department should not refuse to negotiate with a body which represents some 95 per cent of the telephonists.  Yet, that is what they have been doing.  These men are doing responsible work and, if their co-operation is not available, the whole service will come to an end.  I am not suggesting that their co-operation has not been available.  I think it is, and under extremely trying circumstances, and I trust the Minister will not try them any further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the advantage of an automatic telephone service, particularly where secrecy is concerned.  I share his opinion, but that has not been our experience in Dublin. The live theatre may be on the way out but the number of opportunities for entertainment are not decreasing. All one need do is use the telephone frequently and one will get unlimited opportunities for eavesdropping.  These opportunities are increasing.  I should like to know what the Department is doing to diminish these opportunities. People are entitled to expect that a phone can be used for confidential conversations, but that is not so.  Those who have serious confidential business to discuss are reluctant to use the telephone, even in urgent cases.  That should not be so.  Whatever overloading exists or whatever deficiencies there are should be remedied before any other load is put on the existing system.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I obtained from the Minister interesting information as to the number of lines available and still unused in Dublin exchanges.  The number in many areas exceeded the 200 and the 300 mark.  Yet, in many of these areas, subscribers are waiting for telephones and have been waiting for a considerable period.  I should like an explanation as to why there are such a large number of unused lines at so many Dublin exchanges when there are so many applicants waiting for phones for such a long period.</P>
    <P>Television and radio are an extremely important means of communication.  As one who has not got much leisure either to listen or watch, I cannot claim to be very expert, but, during the last <Col N="2013" /> week, I did have some moments of appreciation of President Nkrumah of Ghana telling his fellow citizens and the world that on Ghana television there would be no opportunities for watching American gangsterism.  I should prefer television to go off the air for a number of hours every day than see the type of American gangster films and so-called American domestic films so frequently shown on Telefís Éireann.  I cannot understand why, if we have to use canned films, we cannot go to other markets for them.  Why must it invariably be sterile, uninspiring, damaging stuff, most uninteresting stuff, from America?  I use the word &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; because that is the most polite word one can use in Parliament when talking about the distractions put out from Telefís Éireann in the name of entertainment. It may be good enough to hold the attention of some people until the commercials come around again but it is certainly not the type of thing we ought pay for at all.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to use his good offices with the television authorities to see that they go out into other markets to purchase canned television.  I appreciate the economics of the matter and that it might be more costly to produce live television than some old films from America and elsewhere that may be available at relatively cheaper rates but America is not the only place with stocks of TV film.  It is deplorable that we must confine ourselves to the limited American market to pick up what we need to keep our TV service going.</P>
    <P>If canned television must be used, I plead with the Minister to ensure that we go into other markets, the British and European markets, where some extra entertainment might be available. If it is cabaret, it does not matter very much from what country it comes. There are other films that are better and, as I think the Minister well knows, they can be obtained.  If the service were not in need of improvement, the Minister might not have any reason to fear that people would not look at Telefís Éireann.  That appears to be his fear, as I said at the outset, in view of his reluctance to permit the <Col N="2014" /> installation of master television aerials. If it is a good service, the people will watch it and if not, they will turn to another channel.</P>
    <P>I believe we are unduly critical of the home-produced programmes, just as we are unduly critical of anything we do ourselves.  I should much prefer a home-produced programme that exasperated or infuriated me to the boring drivel that Telefís Éireann send out from the US and the various other channels from which they purchase television entertainment.  We wish the station and all associated with it well, as we do all in Radio Éireann, in their efforts to produce for the people of Ireland the kind of programmes they want, programmes that have some meaning for Irish people.  That cannot be said about the drivel which one finds so boring in the canned entertainment.</P>

      <P>I shall only ask a question I have been trying to ask for quite some time.  Perhaps I can do it now.  Will the Minister tell us what steps he is going to take to have the backlog of telephone applications filled and telephones installed?  We have been telling the Minister and his predecessor that people are waiting for telephones for four or five years and the stock answer we get is that the staff are engaged on other work.  We have been exhoritng the Minister and his predecessor to increase the staff installing telephones.  In the city of Waterford, I know that only about three men are engaged on telephone maintenance in the whole city and, so far as installation is concerned, one might as well be in the South Sea islands.  I hope to hear from the Minister on the subject of installations when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I also want to ask a question I tried to ask in the normal way but I found it was rejected by the Ceann Comhairle.  I have heard considerable criticism about the fact that Irish productions used on Telefís Éireann&mdash;plays and other productions of that kind&mdash;are not stored either for reproduction or resale and that a considerable amount of money is lost in <Col N="2015" /> that way.  We buy a considerable amount of canned stuff but sell nothing.  I should like to hear the Minister comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest scandals in connection with this Estimate is the failure to instal telephones. I have been listening for four years to alibis, founded on the proposition that we are awaiting trunk lines or new exchanges.  Sooner or later these alibis will cease to suffice and I think the Minister should be able to give greater reassurance than he or his predecessor has been in a position to give in respect of the absurdity of our failure to provide telephones for all who want them, more especially when we realise that the telephone service is the one section of the postal services which pays its way.</P>
      <P>It is a fantastic comparison to see in the United States a private telephone company advertising for users, clamouring for people to multiply the number of telephones in their houses, and to find ourselves after years of planning, still in the position that we cannot, or will not, supply people with telephones, although if we did, it would involve no charge on the Exchequer; on the contrary, it would become an abundant source of revenue.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to direct the Minister's attention to the fantastic postal arrangements for parcels at present.  It is a service I do not often employ but recently I went to post books and for a parcel of books for which I formerly paid 6d., I was asked to pay 2/8.  I suggest the rates for parcel post have reached fantastic heights.  One becomes accustomed, I suppose, to meeting the charges on ordinary letters but it comes as a shock in the case of parcels.  I do not think people realise the burden that is thrown on traders or on the ordinary citizen by the increase in postal charges which seem to me to have reached tremendous heights and with special reference to parcel post, these rates seem to be far in excess of what should be necessary for the economic transport of parcels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with my colleague, <Col N="2016" /> Deputy Ryan, about the quality of entertainment provided by Telefís Éireann.  I remember trying to ask myself what is the primary function of a television service.  That is a question I think Deputies should ask because the Director General of Telefís Éireann has to ask himself that question.  I think we are bound to answer it by saying that the primary function is to entertain.  If it does not entertain, people simply will not look at it.  By and large, comparing the quality of entertainment provided by Telefís Éireann with that provided by ITV and other commercial programmes in Britain, and indeed with commercial programmes in the US, I do not think Telefís Éireann has any reason to hang its head.  The plain truth is that the advertisements are a damned nuisance and I think most viewers would look at the BBC in preference either to ITV or Telefís Éireann simply because of the intervention of advertisements, but once we took the decision in the Oireachtas to make the television service dependent in part at least on the revenue from advertisements, we have no reason to complain about the television authority if they carry out their injuction.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the attraction of Telefís Éireann is very materially abridged by the number and length of the advertisements but I am told that unless that number of advertisements and that amount of time is devoted to them, the revenue we expect the service to earn will not be available.  Having made due allowance for that, I do not think it reasonable to say that there is an excess of puerile entertainment on Telefís Éireann as compared with any other station.  We must bear in mind that the station must provide what the bulk of the public want.</P>
    <P>It might be very edifying if the station produced nothing but Beethoven and Mozart in music and nothing but classics in literature and drama but the bulk of the public might not want to look at that.  Mark you, some of us might get a bit bored if we spent all our time listening to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy.</i> I have been <Col N="2017" /> trying to wade through that recently and I find it an extremely burdensome undertaking.  Certainly I would not do it for entertainment.  Doubtless it would be more edifying if more drama were broadcast but there are times in the lives of all of us when one enjoys looking at a western from the cinema. I should like to ask my colleague if it has not occurred to him that one of the reasons Telefís Éireann is constrained to turn to the United States of America for the source of canned material is the language?</P>
    <P>I regard myself as being reasonably fluent in French and having a bowing acquaintance with German, but I would not like to be entertained listening to a French or a German play because it would put an undue strain on my linguistic capability.  The output of material from American studios is vast and readily accessible.  I do not think the output of that material from British cinema studios is of anything like the same volume.  I suppose that sometimes it ought be possible to get superior material if a more prudent choice were exercised.  I am sure that Telefís Éireann are not in a position to get exactly what they would like to get because in dealing with these distributing companies, I rather imagine that sometimes a body like Telefís Éireann may be constrained to accept what is offered and not allowed to choose all the stuff they want but are constrained if they get some choice item to take something not quite so choice as well.  Certainly those engaged in the cinema business find themselves in that dilemma.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us some of the problems that Telefís Éireann have to encounter when seeking to get the best they can offer in television programmes.</P>
    <P>I want to say something that may cause a scandal but which requires to be said.  Television is a medium of terrifying power.  I often think that television is a very much more formidable instrument than the atomic bomb. The worst the atomic bomb can do is to destroy your body but television can destroy your mind and your soul as well, particularly in the case of young people, if they are perennially <Col N="2018" /> exposed to it.  Therefore, a very great sense of responsibility is incumbent on whoever has charge of determining what is to be broadcast.  On balance, Telefís Éireann has discharged that responsibility reasonably well and has provided a standard of entertainment which compares favourably with that available from other sources.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to the Minister, and it is a matter of the gravest moment for this State and all the people: I am prepared to concede Telefís Éireann a very wide discretion in comment and debate about our proceedings in this House but I feel there is incumbent on Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann the obligation, particularly during a period when there are no newspapers in circulation, to provide an objective record&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;objective&rdquo;&mdash;of what has transpired in this House.  I think Radio Éireann make a fair effort to do just that; Telefís Éireann do not.  Most of their reports of the proceedings in this House are tendentious in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly well aware that a good many people are reluctant to comment on this, lest they themselves get the rough end of the stick, but as far as I am concerned I do not give two fiddle-de-dees what Telefís Éireann says or does not say about me, but I certainly care very deeply about what Telefís Éireann says or does not say about Dáil Éireann, because whether we like it or not, the independence and the standards of all our people ultimately depend on what transpires in this House.  It is of vital importance, one, that our people should know broadly what is said in this House and, two, that the proceedings of this House should be honestly presented to them, objectively, leaving it to the people themselves to judge.  I do not think that is being done.</P>
    <P>I do not want to form or make any rash judgements but I want to make this perfectly clear, if that lack of objectivity is not the result of misguided effort but is in fact the result of a carefully conducted campaign by certain Ministers of the Government to control and influence the reporting on Telefís Éireann, it will be dealt with <Col N="2019" /> in this House specifically and by name. Now, I do not expect perfection of anyone but I do expect those charged with this immensely grave responsibility to discharge that responsibility honestly and scrupulously, and I do stipulate as a very minimum requisite that there should be an objective report of all that transpires in this House, leaving comment on our proceedings to some other programme.</P>
    <P>In so far as Telefís Éireann fail to discharge that duty, the time has come either for them to improve their <i>expertise</i>, if that is what is lacking, or else to banish out of Montrose any ulterior influence that has no proper place there.  Now, a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.  Scandals are not desirable if they can be avoided but the exposure of corruption is a <i>sine qua non</i> of a clean democracy, and as long as this House functions, let the Minister be certain of this, corruption and interference with a medium of public communication will not go unexposed if it is suffered to continue.  Lack of <i>expertise</i> is another question, and if that be the reason for the inadequacy of the reporting of the proceedings of this House, then someone should put his hand to its correction as soon as may be.  The whole situation is immensely unsatisfactory and the cause of widespread comment.</P>
    <P>We are not ordinarily a very charitable people.  As Dr. Johnson said, the Irish are an honest people; they tend to speak ill of themselves.  A great many of our people felt the absence of objectivity was evidence of improper interference with the discretion of the television authority.  I am prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt, that it may be due to lack of <i>expertise.</i> If it is, it can be easily corrected; if it is not, then rather more disedifying suspicion requires it to be examined in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to give credit where credit is due and I should like to know from the Minister whether he agrees with me that the burden on Telefís Éireann of carrying so large a volume of advertising is creating an injustice for them which is rather more than <Col N="2020" /> they can be reasonably asked to bear? The time has come when we should consider this question very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They love the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they love it but I think the Minister does and that the Minister for Finance does. Have we, perhaps, reached the stage when, realising how the burden of advertising militates against the popularity of Telefís Éireann <i>vis-á-vis</i> BBC television or ITV, Telefís Éireann could find the revenue to deliver them from the obligation to use advertising material at least for a period every day?  I suppose the bulk of the viewing in this country is done between 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock at night.  I fully appreciate that these are the hours for which advertisers are prepared to pay the highest fee.  I do not know what is the total revenue collected by Telefís Éireann between 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock each night but would it not be possible to consider whether we should not find the revenue to deliver them from the obligation to inject advertising matter into those hours, if not each night, at least during certain nights every week?</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ryan that we should try to raise the standard of our television service.  As I have said, advertising militates greatly against that objective.  If we could reduce our obligation in that respect, I believe we would do a service of great benefit to the country.  I ask the Minister, when concluding, to let us hear his views on the possibility of meeting that situation; of dealing with the telephone service, the cost of parcel post and the proper reporting of the proceedings of this House, which I think Radio Éireann is making a much better fist of than Telefís Éireann have been doing heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing the Estimate, I said I should endeavour to deal with all the points raised by different Deputies but I expressed the hope that they would not duplicate the points made last March when the Estimate was introduced originally. While we had a fruitful discussion, <Col N="2021" /> many of the points made last March were brought up again and I feel sure the House will not expect me to deal with all those in detail or in fact to deal with all of them.</P>
      <P>The debate was well-balanced and for me, not being long in the Department of which I am now political head, most interesting.  As I expected, the emphasis was on the question of the provision of extra telephones and on the waiting list we have to deal with.  I do not intend to deliver an oration on the question of telephones but I should like to emphasise one or two points, in all sincerity, in respect of this service.</P>
      <P>Deputies, in the main, answered the question themselves when some of them said that unless we gave a better service to those who have it already, we would be better off not adding new subscribers to the circuit.  That, largely, is the answer.  The abnormal upsurge in the number of applications for telephones is not merely outside the technical scope of the Department in the matter of new services but is outside the scope of the existing service to carry.  While I do not derive any pleasure from it, I should like to tell Deputies that across the Channel the Postmaster-General is in the same position I find myself in, not through any incompetence on their part. Recently the Postmaster-General in Britain, addressing a branch of the trade union, referred to it as an explosion of demand.  They were the words he used to describe the number of new subscribers.</P>
      <P>We have had to meet the same thing and it is amply borne out by the fact that in 1960-61 the amount set aside for capital development on the telephone service was £2 million and that in this year it is £7 million.  That in itself is not merely an indication of the magnitude of this problem: it is also proof that the effort the Post Office is making to grapple with the problem and get it under control has reached massive proportions.  Some Deputies spoke as if we were standing still and doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the quarter ending on 30th June last, we installed more than 4,000 telephones. <Col N="2022" /> That seems big for the period. Our plans are aimed at making even greater progress as the year goes on. During that quarter, a huge number of new applications came in.  The number of applicants each year seems to increase and this rate of progress makes the problem more and more difficult to catch up with.  Particularly in relation to the service in rural areas, as far as I can see, the difficulty is this: once new telephones are installed in private houses, all the friends and neighbours of those new subscribers want telephones, too.  When a telephone is installed in a rural area in a private house, nearly invariably there are five or six new telephone applicants from the same area.  The highest percentage of applicants for new telephones is in respect of private subscribers.  Of course we give priority to business applications, to professional applications&mdash;to applications related to the commercial life of the country.  For that reason most of those on the waiting list are private householders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of application is important but in some areas it becomes disadvantageous to existing subscribers to add new installations.  In this respect, some parts of the country are more fortunate than others.  This does not involve merely the installation of telephones: it involves the problem of providing thousands of extra miles of cable each year, of the installation of equipment, of the provision of a service capable of dealing with this great expansion.  Side by side is the matter of bringing the automatic system to the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the problem is threefold. In order to measure the rate of success which the Department are achieving, in that respect one should <Col N="2023" /> look at what we have done and are doing rather than think about what we have not done and are not doing. We always hear about the telephone cail that took an hour.  We do not hear about the hundred on the same line which got immediate connection.</P>

They are very important in the commercial and social life of the people.  The upsurge in the number of applications is indicative of a better standard of living and of an expanding economy generally.  No person is more anxious to improve matters in this regard than I am.  During my short time in the Department I have had a look at the various departments in it and I can say with confidence and sincerity, that the officials there are dealing with this problem in an organised, dynamic manner.  I do not like to hear Deputies on the other side of the House sometimes making reference to the Post Office, which is a reflection on the officials.  I do not mean the Minister. He is always fair game for any criticism there may be.  My predecessor and previous Ministers paid the same tribute to these officials on the technical side and the administrative side. They are working as earnestly as they can and they are as anxious as any of the Deputies or as I am to project an image of a Department doing a good and essential job which is one of the most necessary features of our expansion and our whole commercial effort in this country.</P>

      <P>There will be 18,000 this year and the better the service we give them the more we will have. Thank God the time will come when we will have caught up on them.  That will happen before very long.  I never can visualise the time when we will not have complaints about the Post Office. I want to deal with some of the points raised by the various speakers but before I do that I want to deal with some of the matters which were mentioned <Col N="2025" /> generally by all.  I dealt with telephones in a general way because it was one of the matters referred to by everybody who spoke.</P>
      <P>Another point of general interest was the reference to Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  I shall not go into detail with regard to programme transmission.  Programming is a matter for the authority.  It is of concern to me naturally and I want to thank the first speaker, the shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy M. E. Dockrell, for the very reasonable approach he had to this whole problem, both in regard to telephone communications, television and radio.  I thought Deputy Dillon's reference to programming was very sound.</P>
      <P>When one is speaking about the whole question of Telefís Éireann you will always find that somebody will find some fault with some programme or another.  It is hardly necessary to repeat &mdash;this is something which has been said very often&mdash;that there will never be a television medium or a radio medium, for that matter, that will give complete satisfaction to all its listeners or all its viewers.  Nobody for a moment expects that but I would agree with what Deputy Dillon has said.  The television medium here in comparison with that of any other country in the world comes out reasonably well on top.</P>
      <P>The television medium here is not by any means a bad service.  We hope it will be better.  If I have any complaint to make now I would repeat what my predecessor said when introducing this Estimate before.  He said that the service had outgrown its infancy. It has now reached adolescence and we can look to it to improve in the direction the majority of the people would hope it would.  There is one thing I would hope and that is that it would have a more distinctive national character.  We do not want it to be a replica, a repetition or a shadow of any other foreign service. I would like it as much as possible to have an Irish character&mdash;such a character that when you switched to Telefís Éireann you would know it was not UTV, BBC or any other continental station.</P>

      <P>The absence of any serious comment on any particular programme is in itself a tribute to the service generally.  There were only two Deputies who selected any particular programme for serious comment.  The fact that only two referred to the production of <i>Stephen D</i> does not call for any special comment from me.  I heard people who said that they did not like it and I heard people who said that it was an excellent production. For that reason, as I said, the responsibility for programming is the business of the television authority and I am not going to deal with this in any detail.</P>
      <P>I want to make some reference to what Deputy Dillon said in regard to political broadcasts.  I do not, for a moment, accept what he implied&mdash;that it was due to corruption, that it was due to some more subversive means, or lack of expertise, that there was a wrong slant and a lack of objectivity in the reporting of the proceedings of this House.  By that he implied that somebody in Fianna Fáil was arranging that there would be a Fianna Fáil slant given to political broadcasts. There was no such effort made and it is hardly necessary to say it.  I suspect that Deputy Dillon's reference and threat are mainly designed for one purpose, to ensure that he continues to get the huge amount of publicity on Telefís Éireann which he has got over the past three years.</P>

That he should be the one to accuse the Authority of being slanted towards this side of the House is more than I can comprehend.  He got more than his share of favourable publicity from Telefís Éireann.

Deputy Dockrell did not raise any really controversial points.  He referred to the need for a better balance in the commercials.  Sometimes one might feel that the number of commercials is overdone, but I do not think it is unduly overdone.  If one takes into consideration the percentage of the total time occupied by advertisements, they certainly do not take up undue time.</P>

      <P>I could not tell the Deputy, but that brings me to Deputy Ryan's question which was touched on by other speakers about communal aerials.  In reply to a question earlier today, I said that a small communal aerial would serve ten houses, or a complete block of flats.  I am not competent to deal with the technical side of this matter, but I do not think we should go to the expense of erecting a huge communal aerial to enable the occupants of a block of 10,000 houses to view external programmes which are in competition with our own revenue earning service.  Deputy Ryan talked earlier about the people of Ballymun not having this huge aerial which would relay external programmes, and he finished tonight by referring to the terrible rash of external programmes we were importing into our own service.</P>

Some time ago in Donegal a number of sorting officers were appointed to ensure that every area would get quick delivery.  That necessitates using the name of the town for that particular area.

      <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of postal rates.  Everybody knows there was a simple answer to that in recent times.  Everybody connected with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, down to the postmen, has got a considerable increase in his or her rates of pay and that must be reflected in the postal services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite right that the telephones show substantial profit. Postal services in recent years are showing a loss but on the overall we try to make it balance out.  Telegrams show a heavy loss always and the agency work is done just at the cost of doing it, so that any pay increase given in the postal services is naturally reflected in the charges.  It has always been traditional to try to make the Post Office pay its way and, at the same time, keep abreast of every modern advance there is.  There is no Department of State in which so much technique and skill and knowledge is necessary in the technical field and there is no Department in which there is so much advance each year in the equipment used.  We are keeping abreast of all these advances in accordance with advances in all other countries of the <Col N="2034" /> world.  If Deputies say they do not know, I think they pretend not to know what goes on behind the scenes.  Deputy Sweetman was very honest to admit that there were intricacies, as he saw when he went behind the scenes.  I feel that if many people who complain saw the complications and intricacies of the mass of equipment attached to one simple automatic exchange, they would appreciate all the difficulty there is and the organisation that is necessary by highly skilled people to ensure they give an efficient service.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Ryan's book of stamps.  We could get a machine out tomorrow to dispense books of stamps.  But, if the machine does not dispense the stamps efficiently, if it despenses 10,000 books and then fails, there is a complaint.  In this case people are dropping in halfcrowns instead of pennies and people will not easily accept the loss of halfcrowns.  I should like to say that until these machines, which are being tried out now, come as near as possible to 100 per cent efficiency, I should not like to see them installed.  If they are installed in haste and without a properly prepared book of stamps to dispense, Deputy Ryan will put down Parliamentary Questions in this House every day about how inefficient they are.  We have to deal with these things.</P>

During the course of the building and during the course of the changeover, as the Minister will appreciate, many services inevitably fall very far short of the standards which are desirable.

      <P>There are two points which I should like to raise.  Deputy Sweetman referred to the high pressure on the switchboard.  I am sure he will agree with me that, in the presence of that phenomenal pressure that does exist on our switchboard, we get a service that is wellnigh incomparable.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am often astonished at the way they deal with the mass demand made on them.  Another matter which I wish to mention and which was raised with another Minister concerns the pensionable status of certain of the Oireachtas Staff, mainly ushers, I think, who were left in the position that the early years of their service in this House were deemed to be unpensionable years of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine it is true to say of us all here that we desire that a discretion should be exercised in this matter to provide that these public servants would not be deprived of the pensionable rights they would enjoy had their early service been recognised as established. I can quite understand that the Minister is ready to say that he personally would be sympathetic but that if a precedent of this kind were once established it would create chaos and confusion in the Civil Service.  That is not so because when I was Minister for Agriculture I had an exactly analogous problem on my hands relating to <Col N="2038" /> the poultry instructress supervisory staff.  I found that three old ladies, who had spent nearly 40 years in the service of the Department, were going out without any pension because, through one of those anachronistic arrangements dating back to the days of, I think, Sir Horace Plunkett, they were treated as unestablished civil servants.</P>
    <P>I forget whether it was Deputy Sweetman or the then Deputy McGilligan whom I approached but I put the case before him and said it was intolerable that these ladies should be launched out, in the autumn of their days, with no provision made for them.  It was determined that their service would be regarded as established service and they all got their pensions.  I admit that there were only three or four of them, which was a very small number, but the Minister for Finance of the time took a reasonable view and said that, whatever the arrangements might be, we could not allow that to happen and what was necessary was done. Those ladies have all lived to bless the prudence of the then Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the present Minister for Finance is cold-blooded or indifferent to problems of this character but I urge upon him that I believe every Deputy, as well as he, would wish to see this matter attended to.  It cannot make much difference to the revenue of the State but it could make a considerable difference to faithful servants of the State and of this Oireachtas.  I would ask for the sympathetic consideration of the Minister for Finance in relation to that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the points as they were raised.  Deputy Sweetman referred to the completion of the alternations now going on in Leinster House.  As the House is aware, the Press block was the first to be completed.  That was completed last February.  The new office-restaurant block and the installation of mechanical and electrical services is proceeding satisfactorily.  The block will be ready for occupation in January next.  It was hoped to have it <Col N="2039" /> ready for the Autumn session.  Perhaps it is due to the building strike that it has been put back a couple of months. I did not quite grasp the import of Deputy Lynch's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Lynch said, I do not think we could fault to any extent the service we have got in the past couple of weeks from whatever facilities are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very big job.  However, I know it is very important in relation to certain matters that come before us that the preceding week's debates be available in some printed form.  A reasonable attempt was made to provide these debates in printed form.  I know it hindered a lot of Deputies in dealing with certain measures, particularly the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  It is a point worth looking at.  If anything can be done without undue expense, certainly I will be favourably disposed to doing something about it.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Dillon's point, this is something that has been raised over a number of years.  I do not think the analogy he drew is a proper one. As far as I could understand his case, the poultry instructresses he had the Minister for Finance for the time being look after were not, I gather, in receipt of any superannuation allowances.</P>
      <P>The case of the members of the staff here who had long service, some of which was unestablished, is on the same basis as unestablished service of other persons working in the Civil Service complex.  I do not think it is correct for Deputy Dillon to suggest that, if we deal with this class now in a preferential way, we are not going to create a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know to what extent Deputy <Col N="2040" /> Sweetman received representations from people that they should get more favourable recognition for unestablished service as far as pensions are concerned.  I certainly got many, even before I became Minister for Finance, from all kinds of public servants who had unestablished service, followed by established service.  This is a matter governed by the Superannuation Acts and they give the same treatment for pension purposes to the people Deputy Sweetman has in mind, that is, that their established service can be recognised fully but only one half of their unestablished service.  As far as I know, that is common right through the public service.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in which certain long serving members of the staff in Leinster House have preferential treatment. Where they have, on reaching the age of 65, over 16 and under 26 years pensionable service, then they are given a notional increase in pensionable service up to 26 years in order to improve their superannuation payments. That is a preferment these officers enjoy beyond the general run of civil servants and public servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give an assurance that when any Bills have been signed by the President in present circumstances, some type of copy of that Bill will be available to the public?

Something will have to be done, whether by way of sharing the typing around other Departments or not, but typescript copies of the Acts as passed must be available for the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This year the Finance Bill was introduced at a much later stage following the Budget than is customary.  I think the Minister realises, as a result of the discussion which took place here, that that procedure is most unsatisfactory and is indeed an inefficient way of doing important business.  Every year the Finance Bill is a highly technical measure which requires a good deal of research and consultation.  It was very difficult this year, because of the short time available, to undertake the necessary research and, because of the added difficulty of the printers' dispute, <Col N="2042" /> it was virtually impossible to have consultation with outside interests.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has received, as other Deputies have, representations from interested groups. In a great many cases, these representations arrived late for the particular Stage.  Undoubtedly, that was contributed to by the fact that the newspapers were not available and also by the fact that the Bill was so long delayed after the Budget.  As a result of the general lack of publicity, many individuals had to ascertain the position in whatever way they could.</P>
      <P>On this I should like to join in the very deserved tribute paid to the staff here for the remarkable manner they have enabled the work to be carried on. Nevertheless, anyone who has endeavoured to follow the proceedings found it very difficult with the typescript compared with the normal manner in which the debates are printed.  I should like therefore to suggest to the Minister that whatever steps are necessary should be taken in the future to ensure that the Finance Bill is got ready within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that certain aspects of the Bill may not be known until the Budget is decided but once the Budget is decided, it ought to be possible to introduce the Finance Bill at greater speed.  In fact, if the Bill had been introduced more quickly after the Budget, it would have been possible to have had a more satisfactory discussion. The fact that it was introduced so late meant that Deputies had to make up the necessary facts about it quickly and very often, because of the amount of research and discussion involved, inadequately to the extent that it requires further consultation.  I have already paid what I believe is a well-deserved tribute to the skill with which my colleagues devoted their energies to that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister was new to the Department and, naturally, had to deal with a number of matters that he had not in some respects certain experience of but I am sure he appreciates that the position this year at the end of the session in respect of an important measure of this sort was unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter which I wish to ask <Col N="2043" /> the Minister about is this: has he any information on the causes of the movement of money from this country to Britain or to other outside countries and, if so, can he indicate the reasons that have been given to him?  I understand it has been suggested that there are two possible reasons, the first being, so far as Britain is concerned, the fact that higher interest rates operate there and the second reason being&mdash;on this I would be interested to hear whether or not the Minister has any information&mdash; the change in the legislation which imposed an obligation on banks to disclose details of deposits made with them in individual cases.  It is suggested that the legislation compelling the disclosure of the extent of deposits resulted in people moving money elsewhere. I would ask the Minister if he can generally indicate what reasons have been given for the movement of capital from this country in recent times.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to refer to is a matter which I raised here by means of Parliamentary Question, that is, the position of finance companies or institutions which offer substantially higher rates of interest.  Most of them, so far as I am aware, are external institutions which operate here or have branches here.  The Minister said that he had no power to deal with this matter but that banking legislation was in contemplation. It is a matter that we should take cognisance of and we should certainly express concern if there is any doubt about the credit-worthiness of these institutions.  We have had here in recent years one example of a case in which a great number of people were induced to invest in a certain undertaking.  In matters of this sort, <i>caveat emptor</i> may be the rule but, nevertheless, a number of people were induced to invest and considerable sums were lost.</P>

      <P>May I say, in reply to the first point, that I appreciate completely the difficulty experienced by the Opposition in relation to the late publication of the Finance Bill this year? As Deputy Cosgrave said, there were many contributing factors, one, of course, being the general election taking place roughly about the time the Budget would have been introduced, followed by the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Deputy Cosgrave was generous enough to refer to the fact that I was new to the Ministry of Finance.  I am not going to suggest that that newness was not a contributing factor to some degree to the late publication of the Finance Bill.  As the House is aware, I came in almost immediately prior to the Budget and then, having framed the Budget and having put it through the House, I had to tackle the provisions that were put before me for the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>If that had never occurred, I felt that the time had come when some little change in procedure might be contemplated.  As the House is aware, there are many matters included in the Finance Bill which are necessarily included but which are not particularly applicable to the Budget.  I propose in this year to ensure that matters such as the matters the Revenue Commissioners would like to submit, apart altogether from the budgetary provisions, will come to me at an early stage in the year, so that, having had the opportunity to examine them and get Government decisions on them, where necessary, the actual presentation of the Finance Bill after the Budget has been put through will be expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach announced the other evening that I also contemplated suggesting a change in finance business generally as presented to and debated in the House.  There is a great deal of overlapping and there are debates, for example, the debate on the Vote on Account, which take place <Col N="2045" /> at a time when the type of information that it would be essential for Deputies to have is not at that stage available. I propose to suggest that there would be a certain rationalisation of the finance and economic debates in coming years and I propose to suggest legislation accordingly.</P>
    <P>However, I hope that the combination of circumstances that happened this year will not occur again but that, even if it does, other administrative, if not very revolutionary, changes I will propose will expedite the issuing of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other problem Deputy Cosgrave has raised, the shortfall in bank deposits here, in availability of capital, has been caused more by a drop in the money coming in rather than an increase in the money going out.  It cannot be denied that there is some increase in the outgoings by reason of the very favourable rates of interest being offered in Britain. Anybody who takes up the British Sunday papers or in some cases, our own Sunday papers, when they are available, will see the extent to which some borrowing corporations, in many cases municipalities and other local authorities in Britain, offer very attractive rates.  So I cannot deny that it is probable that some of the drop in available money could be attributed to that factor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave did ask me a question some time ago as to the effect the foreign finance houses operating in this country had and I am afraid I was not able to give any precise information about that, nor am I able to do so at this stage.  With regard to whether the obligation imposed on banks under the 1963 Finance Act to make returns of moneys on deposit earning a rate of interest of £15 and upwards caused a drop in deposits, I made inquiries about this long before I became Minister for Finance and I was told at that time, and subsequently on making inquiries as Minister for Finance, that that was not a significant factor in the drop in deposits.</P>
    <P>I might say in passing in that respect that it is very easy for people to hide away money in this country.  They do not have to stash it away abroad.  There <Col N="2046" /> are many outlets for that purpose. Naturally enough, it is only when people want to use money that their having it is disclosed.  In any event, in the recent Finance Bill, I raised the amount from £15 to £50 interest on deposits which would be required to be disclosed in future and to the extent that the disclosure of these deposits to the Revenue Commissioners has caused a drop in the amount of deposits, that will be cured.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave intimated, it is not easy to control the flow of money because that is an exercise which would not be peculiar to us.  There is a free flow of money between this country and Britain and we work out considerably on the credit side in that two-way flow. However, I mentioned in reply to Deputy Cosgrave's Parliamentary question that I proposed to introduce new legislation to see what could be done especially from the Central Bank's point of view and generally speaking, on the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I hope the situation will show an improvement as a result of the action I propose to take.</P>

Very often taxpayers have received, to my knowledge, invaluable assistance from the officers of the Revenue Commission to resolve problems for which they themselves or their advisers found it impossible to find a solution.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had occasion to raise in the House over the past year the unfair practice of the Civil Service Commissioners in disqualifying a candidate in a certain examination without giving him the reason for the disqualification.  Only following acrimonious questions in this House and correspondence over a period of more than two years were the reasons finally given.  The Minister, who was a practising lawyer before he became a Minister, would appreciate the necessity for informing any accused person of the offences with which he is charged.  It is a necessary prerequisite of justice.  If the person is to be disqualified in an examination, whether it is for copying from another candidate or getting assistance from books and so on, he should be told precisely the nature of the offence he is suspected of having committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the person can answer a charge satisfactorily, he must know the nature of the charge against him.  In this case the nature of the charge was not made known until a period of over two years had elapsed from the time the original complaint was made. It so happens that this candidate has not yet got through.  I do not know if the matter has been satisfactorily dealt with.  Such an occurrence can blight a person's career.  This man's chances of promotion in his job are now gone forever.  I am not concerned <Col N="2049" /> whether the person in question was in the right or in the wrong but I am concerned that the Civil Service Commissioners should not have informed this person who was suspected of an offence the precise nature of the offence, with the result that he was not in a position to know what defence he should offer to the suspicions against him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment also on the question of the Local Appointments Commission disqualifying a candidate after he has, in fact, been notified that he has passed an examination, passed his medical test, and has actually been filling the job for a number of years.  He is then disqualified without any reason being given.  This happened to a very decent man in the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Possibly he is the same person about whom Deputy Ryan spoke.</P>
      <P>For a number of years he was employed as a temporary postman.  He did a confined examination for a permanent position.  He was placed seventh at that examination, seventh in the whole country.  After he had been notified of the fact that he had passed and that his medical history was satisfactory, he was informed he could not be employed.  The matter was discussed by way of question and answer on a number of occasions here but no satisfactory explanation was given.</P>
      <P>I think it is a shocking thing that that young man, his wife and family should be left under suspicion, the suspicion that he did something which prevented him from being appointed as a permanent postman, despite the fact that no evidence whatever was submitted.  I am sure the Minister will, as his predecessor did, and as I am sure his successor will, keep the man in temporary employment, but it is just not good enough that the Local Appointments Commission should be entitled to stain a man's character without giving any explanation.  The sooner that sort of thing is cleared up the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one case, but the fact that one decent man has had his character besmirched because of the failure of the <Col N="2050" /> Local Appointments Commission to give the necessary information, should be sufficient to warrant a change in the law.  I suggest that the Minister should do something about it now. The very least the man is entitled to is information as to why he was turned down.  If he got that information the possibility is that everybody would be satisfied, but every effort to get that information has been foiled by the Local Appointments Commission who say they have decided that they will not give any explanation.  I know of one or two other cases.  They were not so serious because the information that the person had been successful was not so widespread.  Consider the position of a young man rearing a family in a country town subject to all the embarrassment caused by this stupid regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

Now this is only a hazy recollection. There was some omission on his part which he did not repair.  Had he repaired the omission, he would have got the information he sought.  Nevertheless, I sympathise with the point of view put forward by both Deputies. Without examining the whole matter more closely, however, I should not like to give an undertaking that I would direct, if I have that power, the Commissioners to desist from that practice and conform with what would appear to be reasonable requirements. In my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I know that, on certain occasions, when industrial grant applications were made and refused, the reasons for the refusal could not be disclosed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the representations made to his predecessor concerning parity in relation to retired State pensioners, civil servants, Army personnel, gardaí, teachers, and so on.  The Additional Estimate provides for certain increases which were granted in the Budget.  So far as I am aware, the increases granted range round about 9 per cent <Col N="2052" /> and apply to categories of pensioners who are retired for some years and whose pensions are substantially lower than those of their colleagues who retired since.  I know the stereotyped answer always given is that the Minister would like to do more but that pensions are based on pay on retirement. While that is true in relation to the method of calculating pensions, it must be remembered that the system was adopted at a time when money substantially held its value and there was no great variation between one period and another.  Nowadays cost of living increases are regularly given to serving personnel and, with a certain time lag, increases have been granted over a number of years under various Pension Increase Acts to bring up retired personnel, but not to bring them up to parity with those who retired at a later date.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to have a fresh look at this situation.  Undoubtedly, the commission, committee, or interdepartmental group which considered this recommended certain increases, but I understand from some of those concerned that the lower paid pensioners consider that the personnel on that body were not sufficiently conversant with the conditions of the lower paid categories and consequently did not in their recommendations advert to their circumstances.  The Minister will appreciate and understand the position of a State pensioner, whether he is an ex-civil servant, a garda, an ex-member of the Army, a teacher, or something else, who held five, six or seven years ago a particular office and who retired on reaching the age limit and was awarded a pension based on pay at the time of retiral, who sees his colleague, who retired, perhaps, this year, or last year, and who filled precisely the same office and retired at precisely the same age limit, but, because he retired five or six or seven years later, and pay increases in the meantime had been granted, retired at a substantially higher pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in present circumstances that is inequitable and unfair and has caused, and is causing, considerable hardship.  Undoubtedly some of these increases will modify or ease the problem <Col N="2053" /> but I want the Minister to consider sympathetically, and I hope in a practical manner, the problems of a great many State pensioners.  This is undoubtedly a diminishing charge, particularly in the case of those who retired a number of years ago on relatively low pensions.  I want him to consider the possibility of providing for those retired for some years parity with their colleagues in whatever department or section of the Service they served and who retired under the present appropriate salary scale for the particular category concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to what Deputy Cosgrave has said, I think it is generally accepted by those who have studied the matter that State servants who retired many years ago are now being treated rather shabbily.  The Committee did not do them full justice, if they did any justice at all.  It would be a sobering thought if the existing civil servants would appreciate the fact that the retired State servants were the civil servants of some years ago and that they themselves will be the pensioners of tomorrow.  If they took that into consideration, perhaps the recommendations they make on the question of pensions would be more human than they appear to have been over the past few years.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that in the months immediately preceding 1963 the Minister's predecessor appeared to be attempting to equate the pensions. Suddenly he stopped, and there must be a reason for that, although I have never been able to find it out.  I suggest that if the Minister is going to look at that situation, he might possibly go back to the position in 1963 and see what it was that caused the then Minister to stop making adjustments which up to that time appeared to be leading in the right direction and appeared to be about to straighten out all this mess concerning retired State servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that there is a mass of documents available, if he wants to study this matter.  I do not propose to use even the one I have here tonight because of the time factor <Col N="2054" /> but I would suggest to the Minister that he might usefully, when he has time, go into this whole question because it is causing a lot of discontent among people who gave very good service to the State.</P>
    <P>A deputation of members of the House proposed to wait on the Minister but because of the fact that he had a very heavy day yesterday and an equally heavy evening this evening, we did not ask him to meet us but, if for no other reason than that, I think the Minister might consider what has been said on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse what the Leader of my Party said.  It is unfortunate that we have stopped the trend towards closing the gap between the recently-retired and the long-retired State pensioners.  The time to consider pensioners is the time when there is a general agreement on wages or salaries and at any time when the State is estimating the cost of these increases, an effort should be made to close the gap and provide all pensioners, instead of giving them the pension related to what they were earning when they retired, with a pension which would be a percentage of the pay paid to the rank which they occupied when they were serving.  In other words, their pension should be related to the current salary and not to what these people were paid ten or 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>Probably as people become older, their expenses increase and as that happens, the support which they might have received from single members of their family is cut off by reason of marriage of their children or their movement away from home, but their medical expenses may increase and the rates threat is forever increasing for these people while their pensions are paid at a rate which bears no relation to the burdens they have to bear in the autumn of their days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One understands the great problem facing any Minister for Finance in trying to close this gap but I think we members of this society who might be regarded by some people as being on the right side of 60&mdash;perhaps as far as <Col N="2055" /> age is concerned we might be; but not in wisdom&mdash;would be prepared to postpone their own selfish advances for some months in order to give parity to these pensioners because if the Lord allows us to live sufficiently long in this world, we shall all be pensioners some day.  I should like to see that before the young generation today become old, justice would at last be given to all pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend to which Deputy James Tully and Deputy Ryan referred as having stopped was never in fact there.  An attempt was made in recent and successive years to make increases available to keep pace to some extent with the cost of living increases but the type of parity suggested by the Deputies was never part of the trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that in the years 1962, 1963, 1964, increases were given totalling in all about £1.4 million. That averaged something less than £500,000 a year.  The increase that is being given this year following the report of the committee on post-retirement adjustments in public servants' pensions amounts to about £600,000 a year, so that there is that amount of increase available at any rate.</P>
      <P>This is a very wide field and like many other things appertaining to the Department, it is fairly complex. Superannuation is something that I have always regarded as a matter that requires very close study.  I have not had time to give it that close study but naturally I must do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was at one time Minister for Education and, therefore, he will have some knowledge of the matter I now propose to mention. This is one of the largest centres of archaeological remains in Europe. These archaeological remains are being <Col N="2061" /> progressively eliminated by the ordinary processes of agriculture and the only means of preserving them is through the medium of an aerial survey of the country such as has been carried out in the six counties of Northern Ireland, in the entire island of Great Britain and most of the continent of Europe.</P>
      <P>For some extraordinary reason, into which I do not propose to go in detail now, the Ordnance Survey have never been given the facilities or the direction to carry out a similar aerial survey here. It is a matter of fact that a peripatetic survey does not record on the Ordnance Survey maps such data as can be identified by an aerial survey and it is notable that the peripatetic survey does not reveal many of the archaeological sites that exist. I have already stated in the House and now wish to repeat that, when I was Minister for Agriculture, I arranged to have an aerial survey made of Cruachan. On the peripatetic survey there are seven sites recorded on Cruachan, the traditional home of Queen Meádhbh and King Ailill.</P>
      <P>The aerial survey was examined by the Dublin Museum authorities and, if my memory serves me aright, 29 archaeological sites were recorded for the first time in recorded history. I have reason to believe, and my belief is sustained by the Royal Archaeological Society, that a similar state of affairs exists in relation to practically every part of the country. The tragedy is that with every year that passes, a number of such archaeological treasures are being expunged. In connection with town planning and certain other operations, limited aerial surveys are being made and there is now a considerable amount of overlapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For technical reasons, it is desirable that aerial surveys should be lateral surveys rather than vertical surveys. If the Ordnance Survey would carry out an aerial survey of the whole country, it would be of use not only to archaeologists but also to the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Local Government and <Col N="2062" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with the Geological Survey Office. I urge on the Minister and the Government, both for utilitarian purposes and for the preservation of the history of the country, that they should give the necessary direction to have a full aerial survey of the 26 counties carried out by the Ordnance Survey so that it could be correlated with what has been already done in the six northern counties, thus having this country properly surveyed as practically every country has been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two representations on this Vote.  I thought Doctor Bowdler had finally died and was buried years ago and I think it is a public scandal that An Chomhairle Ealaíon should resurrect him.  They have perpetrated the outrage of bowdlerising the poems of Emily Lawless. The publication was a most admirable thing to do.  But they did not publish all her poems but made selections from three volumes, one publicly published and two privately published.  Can one conceive it to be true that An Chomhairle Ealaíon took these excellent poems and bowdlerised them?  The poems were published as her poems with large lumps cut out of the middle of them.  Whatever literary outrage was perpetrated by the Hun, I submit the bowdlerising of Emily Lawless's poems in that fashion outdid it as an outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon, I believe, were the source of the recommendation adopted by the Government, communicated to us, that we should erect a theatre concert hall that would cost about £2 million as a memorial to the late President Kennedy and that there should be an annual appropriation of between £10,000 and £20,000 a year for its maintenance.  This proposal has been adopted by the Government on the submission of An Chomhairle Ealaíon at a time when we are pulling down two fine theatres in the city.  We pulled down the Theatre Royal and now we are going to pull down the Gaiety.  We are going to build another <Col N="2064" /> theatre out at Ballsbridge at a time when we cannot keep the Gaiety open.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, now that we are on this Estimate, to suggest to An Chomhairle Ealaíon that they should examine this whole question again.  I venture to suggest to the Minister that if it has now transpired that we cannot keep one theatre going by public support, we ought to review the whole question as to whether this proposal for a memorial to President Kennedy is a suitable one at all.  When you think, if we are right in our calculation, that the proposal of An Chomhairle Ealaíon is going to cost a capital sum of £2 million and an additional sum of £10,000 to £20,000 a year to maintain over and above any receipts that may accrue from its use, we could give in perpetuity about 100 scholarships, at least sufficient to bring Irish students to any academic institution in the world, America, the Continent or anywhere else.  Surely it would be worth considering this whole proposal and arranging for such subsidy as may be necessary to keep the Gaiety Theatre in existence as a concert hall or any other purpose that would be suitable and to vote the capital sum for some educational project to perpetuate the memory of the late President of the United States.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling this Estimate should not be allowed to pass without at least inviting the Minister and Oireachtas Éireann to look again at this recommendation of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which commends itself to the Government, and which was announced as the Government decision on foot of An Chomhairle Ealaíon's recommendation.  I urge the Minister to call on An Chomhairle Ealaíon to justify why they bowdlerised the poems of a great Irish poetess, to withdraw this infamous publication and substitute for it a suitable collection of Emily Lawless's poems which will faithfully reproduce the verses she wrote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a number of questions to the Minister for Finance today in relation to the Gaiety Theatre. I am expressing myself very mildly when I say many people will be disappointed <Col N="2065" /> with the Minister's replies to those questions.  It is quite clear the Minister himself would like to provide an additional subsidy for the live theatre in Ireland's capital city but he feels he is limited by present financial conditions from giving that subsidy.</P>
      <P>The Gaiety Theatre has served the people of this nation in a commendable way in the arts for decades past.  It is a first-class theatre in perfect condition. It could not be built today for anything less than, I suppose, between £400,000 to £500,000.  Deputy Dillon has referred to the fact that An Chomhairle Ealaíon has recommended that £2 million be spent on the erection of another structure in another part of the city which will provide accommodation for a similar number of people as can already be accommodated in the Gaiety Theatre.  Reports, which we have seen last week, indicate that the price being offered by a foreign concern for the Gaiety Theatre is in the region of £200,000.  We have in the centre of Dublin a building, with a tradition of making a useful contribution to the fine arts, already available for one-tenth the cost of what it is proposed to spend on a building out in Ballsbridge.  I would earnestly recommend to the Minister that he use every persuasive power at his disposal to ensure that the Gaiety Theatre is not closed down and demolished.</P>
      <P>The Dublin theatre at the moment is in a precarious state.  The Olympia Theatre is under a cloud at the moment.  It has been rescued from the block by the enterprise of a number of theatre folk but we all live in dread of the final news that, notwithstanding our efforts, it is going to be knocked down.  The Queen's Theatre is almost certain to go as soon as the Abbey goes out.  In any event, it is not entirely a satisfactory building.  It is unlikely to be an economic proposition in any respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital for the natural cultural interest of this country that the Gaiety Theatre be maintained.  I feel the Minister, as an individual, would wish it to remain.  There are literally tens of thousands of people in this city and <Col N="2066" /> country who feel the same.  I believe it would be a national disgrace as much as any other kind of disgrace for Dublin if it should go.  I know the Minister may reiterate that it is up to Dublin Corporation to provide financial assistance for the Gaiety Theatre. Dublin Corporation are undoubtedly considering the matter but I feel, when their primary obligation at the present time is to try to devote any moneys they have towards solving the appalling housing crisis in the city, they may feel, in these circumstances, they are unable to come to the rescue of the Gaiety. This is a national question.</P>
    <P>Quite frequently, CIE put on a train service and a bus service to bring people from the length and breadth of this island to the Gaiety Theatre.  This will indicate the national interest which exists in many of the performances in the Gaiety.  That is why the Minister should have referred to the national service the Gaiety provides.</P>
    <P>The Abbey Theatre is likely to be limited to a particular type of drama by reason of the memorandum and articles of association of the National Theatre Society.  It is necessary to have a broader outlook in cultural matters than that which can be obtained through the Abbey.  The Gaiety has served the public well over the years and on that account I would hope the Minister would ensure the necessary arrangements are made to save it for the nation.</P>

The other said: &ldquo;I will go to the Gaiety.  There is a lassie there with a good high kick.&rdquo; The first man said: &ldquo;Oh, shame on you, John, talking that way.&rdquo; John went to the Gaiety and there sitting in the seat in front of him looking for the high kick was his friend.

      <P>Three points were raised, two by Deputy Dillon, and one by Deputy Ryan which was, to an extent, an extension of one of the points raised by Deputy Dillon.  So far as the publication of the Emily Lawless poems is concerned, An Chomhairle Ealaíon was invested with a certain degree of autonomy.  It was considered necessary that such a body should have a degree of autonomy, and I am sure there are literary experts on the Board. While I have sympathy with the point made by Deputy Dillon about the bowdlerisation of the Emily Lawless poems, there may be good reasons for what was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I said there may be good reasons, perhaps not aesthetic reasons, but other reasons.  I do not know.  I am convinced that when we <Col N="2068" /> set up a board of this nature&mdash;and particularly in the field of arts&mdash;we must repose our confidence in it and leave to it the degree of autonomy most people feel it should have.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent Deputy Dillon was speaking on behalf of his Party when he referred to the President Kennedy Memorial Hall.  I think the erection of this hall was agreed upon in the House. An all-Party committee is still sitting and by virtue of my office, I preside over it, and there has not been any proposal from any member of the committee along the lines of the proposal now made by Deputy Dillon.  It is a great lack in the life of any capital city not to have a concert hall of the type contemplated as the President Kennedy Memorial Hall.  I do not believe the alternative suggestion now made by Deputy Dillon would find common acceptance throughout the country and, indeed, I am sure not in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy Ryan that I should be very sorry to see the Gaiety disappear.  It would create a void in the entertainment life of Dublin&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; because in the Gaiety we got grand opera, ballet, straight theatre, and many other forms of entertainment.</P>

      <P>I do not know; I suppose it would depend on whether they were young or old.  In general, as I said in reply to Parliamentary Questions this morning, I have a lot of sympathy with those affected by the decline in support for the theatre throughout the country, but I believe that any assistance given by the Government should be in the nature of assistance to the theatre in general throughout the country, and I do not think it right that the Government should be expected to come to the assistance of a commercial venture like the Gaiety Theatre.  Any assistance we give to the Gaiety and other theatres should be to maintain their existence for the purpose of presenting drama, and I hope the assistance we can give will have that effect.</P>
      <P>I do not think any other points were raised.  I can assure Deputy Ryan that if any specific proposal comes from the citizens of Dublin, supported by the corporation, along the lines of the proposal made by the Cork citizens, and supported by Cork Corporation, I will be prepared as Minister for Finance to recommend to the Government that they should look favourably at it.</P>

It had been assumed up to now that we were statutorily entitled to borrow moneys outside the State in currencies that were not Irish.  The advice of the Attorney General in relation to the recent borrowings by Aer Lingus of dollar currency from the United States indicates that we are not so statutorily entitled and section 4 covers this particular deficiency.</P>

I had amendments down which have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  I, of course, accept his rulings.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House raised in the course of the discussions on the Budget and on this Bill the fact that the increases which were given in the Budget and which are now given under the Social Welfare Bill to recipients of old age pensions, and social welfare assistance of various kinds, will be taken away from them in many cases by different administrative decisions.  I refer in particular to the case of people who are, in addition, in receipt of home assistance which we are quite convinced will in many cases be reduced because the recipients of pensions or social assistance of one sort or another will get some increases under the legislation we are now about to enact.  Similarly, in cases I know of already, persons living in local authority houses subject to differential rent schemes will have their rents increased because of the increases in pensions and in social assistance which these people are to get.</P>

We shall very carefully consider the provisions of this Bill and, if necessary, we shall bring in a Private Member's Bill if, in fact, we find that persons who should get these increases are not getting the full benefit of them because of action being taken through home assistance being reduced or differential rents being increased.  This is a very real danger.  We very much regret the Minister has not put a section into the Bill to deal with hardship cases which may develop.</P>

      <P>I raised a matter on Second Reading to which the Minister did not reply.  What we are proposing to do in this piece of legislation is to change the method of assessing means of smallholders in respect of unemployment assistance and a new provision is put into section 8. There is, however, provision in section 9 by means of which the Minister may, in any individual case, decide that the old system of assessment is to apply. This seems to be an extraordinarily wide power. There seems to be no means of appealing against the Minister's decision.  It seems a completely arbitrary decision.  He may decide, in an individual case, that a person who has applied for unemployment assistance is to have his means assessed on the old system and not on the new one. This seems a power we should not grant unless there are good reasons for doing so and I should be glad to know why the Minister thinks it is necessary to have this power.</P>

      <P>To attempt to go over all the ground covered in this debate, which went on for a considerable time, would be impossible in the short time available to me.  However, I shall deal with some of the important points made.  Deputies Clinton, Tully, Treacy, Esmonde, Hogan and O'Leary all referred to low output or failure to deal with the housing problem.  They also said that the housing slow-down was the result of deliberate policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> They attempted to interpret what is in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> as indicating that it was the intention of the Government to cut down expenditure on housing.  If that is the interpretation these people have put on the Second Programme, it is rather strange to read that, when that Programme was published, housing output was something over 7,000 houses a year, whereas the Programme indicates a rise of 100 per cent to approximately 14,000 houses per year. If that can be interpreted as saying that the Second Programme shows we are cutting down on housing, either I should be locked up or those who put that interpretation on it should be locked up forthwith.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, the total number of houses built by private individuals with State aid exceeded last year the figures of houses built by any Government in any year.  The Deputies in the Opposition know that that is so.  In the last full year of operation, the total number of private houses built exceeds the number any Government built in any year since the foundation of this State.</P>

Over and above that, we have provided water and sewerage services for no less than 5,600 houses, over two and a half times more than was provided two <Col N="2081" /> years ago and 22 times more than was provided in the last year of the Coalition Government to which these Deputies belonged.</P>

Yet they are not building houses and they are trying to blame the Minister for Local Government. Look at the figures; look at the money provided; look at the facts for yourselves.  Then hang your heads in shame, as you are entitled to do.  Do not come back here and blame the Government for lack of activity for which you yourselves, as members of local authorities, have been responsible. Will one Deputy in the Opposition show me in any local authority of which he is a member that I have prevented them building houses?  Will they show me that they themselves are not responsible?

      <P>Deputy Treacy has made the allegation that there is nothing in the Bill to benefit anyone but farmers.  I want to list, for the information of the House, various classes who will benefit.  It will benefit (1) persons buying houses built on sites developed with the aid of the new site subsidy; (2) elderly persons for whom two-thirds subsidy can now be paid to local authorities; (3) persons with incomes up to £1,445 and dependants, to whom local authorities can now make supplementary grants; (4) persons seeking rented accommodation or accommodation near their work in central city areas, the provision of which the new grants for flats will encourage; (5) persons seeking rented accommodation the provision of which the new subsidy for approved bodies will encourage; (6) persons reconstructing their houses who can now get loans of up to £200 from the local authority, without formal security; (7) persons building houses to whom local authorities will be enabled to advance money <Col N="2086" /> on second mortgage; (8) persons building serviced houses of up to 1,500 square feet who will now qualify for grants they did not heretofore get; (9) local authority tenants who will benefit by improvement grants for their homes and by the cheaper and better houses which the new methods of investigating needs and organising demand will bring; (10) industrialists seeking houses for their workers to expand output or set up new factories who will benefit through the new arrangements for subsidising approved bodies, including the National Building Agency, Ltd.</P>
      <P>To summarise&mdash;almost anyone buying, building or reconstructing a house may well benefit in one way or another under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies are also asking why we did not increase the grants generally.  I would quote Deputy Larkin and hope that I will not be charged with misquoting. Deputy Larkin said, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 215, Column 166:</P>
      <P>I am afraid experience of those purchasing houses with the assistance of local authority supplemental grants has been that when those grants were increased there was an automatic overnight increase in the price of the house.</P>
      <P>This, however, is not my reason for not increasing the amount.  The operations under all the grants that I have mentioned tonight show that for new grant houses the number being produced is a record all high figure, that in the last year, up to the end of March, the overall operations in respect of reconstruction are running at about 10,000 a year; water and sewerage grants are running at 5,600 a year. Taking all in all, these are surely figures that indicate that the assistance being given by the Government is being availed of to a large extent by the public who appreciate that these things are being done for their benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also mentioned here that newly-weds are not being catered for. All I can say in this regard is that under the Bill, section 60 can take care of that in that the local authorities will determine the priorities in the <Col N="2087" /> letting of their houses.  If it is their wish to make provision for some newlyweds in their schemes, this will be a matter that they will have to consider against the demands of others who may have a higher priority rating.</P>
    <P>Then there was the suggestion that high building is something that should not be allowed.  All I can say is that in Dublin city and other cities the spread of building cannot just go on indiscriminately into the future.  The greater utilisation of the centre city areas can be a great advantage by providing high residential flats there for many workers who would wish to be near their work and to be in the centre of the city.  There will be a demand for a number of these.</P>
    <P>I should like also to say that the space conserved as a result of building up rather than out will have many demands upon it.  That is also the consideration of traffic and traffic regulations in future.  These few things are in themselves sufficient to justify extra encouragement being given where the circumstances warrant high building being carried out by way of residential flats.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that in regard to building and building costs, we have, I believe, got to the stage where, by the adoption of new methods and new techniques, both industrialised and on-site operations, the cost of housing can be and is, in fact, at the moment being, brought down and this can be followed to give us a better house at less money; in other words to get better value than we may have been getting in the past.</P>
    <P>If anybody is inclined to suggest that any particular group is responsible for the high pricing of housing, I would say that all those who have any hand, act or part in building, whether in government, local authorities, builders, <Col N="2088" /> individuals, purchasers or otherwise, have all added their own quota and that there has been too little capacity in the building trade devoted to housing. There has been an unprecedented upward swing in the demand for housing. There have been too many people for too long with too much money available bidding for the few houses available.  All of us have been adding coals to the fire by making it easier for that situation to exist.  If we are now getting to the stage where by these new techniques and developments, we can get better value and give our people a better house for the same money or less money, this is something which it has been well worth while to bring about and more can be done in that direction, I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>The final thing I want to say is in regard to rents.  Much representation has been made in regard to my statement as to the policy on rents in future. The total public contribution towards subsidisation of housing is now running at the rate of about £6 million per year, of which the local authorities pay half.  The contributions by Dublin Corporation from the rates towards the cost of providing houses have increased from £350,000 in 1952 to over £900,000 in the last year for which figures are available.  If we are to continue to build houses for our people through local authorities, then we must either add substantially to our rates and taxes or we must take the inside course, that is, to look after the poor and make those who are better off and who can afford it pay more.  That is the responsibility of the local authority, not mine.</P>
