    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement to the Dáil on his meeting with Captain O'Neill and on events subsequent to this meeting; and if he will deal in particular with the suggestion that his visit to Belfast involved recognition of the constitutional status of the Northern Ireland Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in his recent discussion with Mr. <Col N="2" /> O'Neill at Stormont he sought any assurance that equal voting rights and equal opportunities in employment, housing and education will be afforded the nationally-minded people in the Six Counties; and, if not, if he intends to raise these matters in future discussions to be held with Mr. O'Neill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, I have on many occasions urged the desirability, in the national interest, of achieving, between the two areas into which Ireland is now divided, the maximum possible measure of co-operation in practical matters of public concern and expressed the conviction that this was possible without sacrifice of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted Captain O'Neill's invitation with the intention of exploring this possibility.  I found that he also was of the opinion that action such as I had in mind would be practicable <Col N="3" /> and beneficial.  Our discussions were confined to this subject, and no political or constitutional topics were touched upon either at our meeting in Belfast, or at the meeting yesterday in Dublin.  We have agreed that the scope for practical co-operation is extensive and should be further examined.  As the House is aware, arrangements for this examination in respect of matters of trade and tourism were later considered between the Ministers concerned and further discussions at specialist and official levels are now being arranged.</P>
    <P>I have urged that these meetings should not be given a greater significance than they warrant.  Nevertheless I regard them as the beginning of a process which has considerable potentialities for good.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that my visit to Belfast involved recognition of the present constitutional status of the Northern Ireland Government, if by recognition is meant approval, I did not regard it as implying this, nor should it be so considered.  I have just mentioned my conviction that practical co-operation could take place without sacrifice of principle and it was in this spirit that my meetings with Captain O'Neill took place.  In this connection I should remind the House that, on a number of previous occasions, members of the Government have visited Belfast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For my own part, I would regard as an honourable solution of this national problem, an arrangement on the lines of the proposal put forward on behalf of Dáil Éireann prior to the Treaty negotiations of 1921 and repeated on many occasions since, involving, subject to safeguards, the confirmation of the position of the Northern Ireland legislature with its existing powers within <Col N="4" /> an all-Ireland constitution, for so long as the people of the north-eastern counties might desire it.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in restating our purpose in this regard honestly and frankly, nor do I consider that it can prejudice or restrict the scope for practical co-operation as now envisaged for the benefit of the people living in both areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this Party, I want to say that we welcome the meeting of the Taoiseach with Captain Terence O'Neill.  We welcome anything of that nature which will provide for greater co-operation for the greater benefit of the people on the two sides of the Border.  I want to make it clear also&mdash;I think the Taoiseach has made it clear&mdash;that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, the ultimate objective is the re-unification of the country as a 32-county Republic.  In saying this, I appreciate the efforts being made and I hope they will be for the greater benefit of the two peoples on both sides of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the negotiations that have taken place from time to time between the Government of Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland in relation to matters like the Foyle Fisheries, Córas Iompair Éireann, and relative matters in regard to which daily exchanges have taken place between the respective Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and so on.  Will the Taoiseach be in a position at an early stage to indicate to the House what other matters it is intended to discuss with the Government of Northern Ireland that have not been habitually under discussion during the past 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, the scope available for active co-operation is now being considered and at some stage, no doubt, the possibilities revealed in this regard will be announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall await with interest an announcement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an appreciation of the reason for the non-notification of the public that such a meeting was to take place, but surely there was no reason for not having a prior announcement in relation to Captain O'Neill's visit to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the possibility of beneficial results was increased by not having any prior announcement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government believed that the abolition of Partition was the responsibility of the British Government; whether this view still holds; and, if not, when the change took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for ending the Partition of Ireland rests on everybody who can make a contribution to it, including the British Government.</P>
      <P>I have on many occasions, however, expressed my own personal conviction that the primary aim must be to eliminate the barriers of suspicion and animosity which have divided the Irish people in the past so that unity can be founded on tolerance and goodwill. This is a task which has to be done in Ireland and by Irishmen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider placing the entire responsibility for handicapped children in one Department instead of the <Col N="6" /> present unsatisfactory position of having divided responsibility between the Departments of Health and Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the present position is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The care of mentally handicapped persons is a rapidly developing service and has both a health and an educational aspect.  The provision of care and treatment for all classes of mentally handicapped persons as in-patients of institutions has traditionally been developed under the Department of Health, which has also accepted certain responsibility for the provision of medical and nursing services for the severely handicapped and the moderately handicapped children who attend clinics or day centres.  The Department of Education has been responsible for the education in school subjects of the mildly handicapped and those among the moderately handicapped who can benefit from such education.  This responsibility has been discharged by the provision of school accommodation and trained teaching staffs in conjunction with both the in-patient and outpatient facilities.  The association of the two Departments of State with this problem has not, in practice, been found to inhibit the development of the services.  A similar association between the two Departments is of long standing, for example, in the institutional care of children with orthopaedic or other physical defects or ailments, and has been a profitable one.</P>
      <P>A Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap which was appointed by the Minister for Health is expected to report within the next two months or so. The question whether the existing arrangements as between the two Departments should be altered will be considered when this Report has been received and examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there seems to be no definite line between where the functions of the Department of Health cease and where the functions of the Department of Education begin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Much hardship and neglect arises from that.  I am referring principally to the difficulty of getting these children to these special schools. Both Departments say it is not their function.  In Clondalkin alone, we have at the moment eight such children who are suitable for admission but cannot be got to these special day schools.</P>

      <P>The information for the years 1954-61 available in respect of the Deputy's question was given to him in my reply of 31 October, 1962&mdash;Dáil Debates, Vol. 197, No. 2, cols. 276-80.  The particulars for 1962-63 and for January-November, 1964, the latest available data, are shown in the attached statement which, with your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  No distinction is made for statistical purposes between mature and immature whiskey and exports of immature whiskey are, therefore, included in the figures.  It is understood, however, that such exports are relatively small.  Exports of &ldquo;day old&rdquo; whiskey, which were also included up to 1960, are excluded from the later figures.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>DOMESTIC exports of whiskey by country of destination in each year 1962 and 1963 and in the period January&mdash;November, 1964.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons on the Live Register on 29th January, 1965, was 61,123.  The percentage unemployed is calculated by relating the number of currently insured persons on the Live Register, excluding those in agriculture, fishing and private domestic service, to the estimated corresponding currently insured population.  This percentage at 15th January, 1965, the latest date available, was 6.7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the fact that there is no prospect of an early report or recommendations from the Select Committee on Health Services, he will now take immediate steps to raise the £800 upper limit for the middle income group to at least £1,000 per annum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question appears to be based on the misconception that the health services provided for in the Health Act, 1953 for what is generally known as the &ldquo;middle income group&rdquo; are available only to persons whose incomes do not exceed £800 a year.</P>
      <P>These services are available to all persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and their dependants.  All persons engaged in manual work under a contract of service are compulsorily insured irrespective of income; and as regards those engaged in non-manual work, they can continue their insurance voluntarily, and consequently their eligibility under the Health Acts, when they pass the limit of £800 a year for compulsory insurance.</P>
      <P>The services are also available to farmers whose rateable valuations do not exceed £50, again irrespective of income.</P>
      <P>They are available to pupils of national schools in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations, again without regard to their parents' incomes.</P>
      <P>In addition, persons whose yearly means exceed £800 who could not, without hardship, obtain institutional services required for themselves and their dependants can also be assisted by their health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is, however, kept under continuous review.  A change, as suggested in the question, would require legislation; and the Deputy will understand that before any legislation were <Col N="11" /> introduced it would be necessary to consult all the interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of acute dissatisfaction with our present ambulance and hospital services for road accident victims.</P>
      <P>During the last few years, my Department have been giving the closest attention to those services and through the co-operation of the local authorities, substantial improvements have been made.  In the case of the ambulance service the provision of resuscitation equipment and the training of ambulance crews in its use have received special attention.  The services of specialist anaesthetists have been enlisted to undertake this training and I am satisfied that these arrangements will contribute greatly to the attainment of a high standard of care for accident victims.</P>
      <P>A new ambulance specification has been prepared by the Department of Local Government in association with my Department.  Ambulances based on this design should be available shortly. The new type ambulance will be much superior to these at present in use, particularly so in the matter of suspension. A number of health authorities also have under consideration the installation in their ambulances of twoway radio telephone communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the greater part of the country hospital treatment for road victims is provided in the nearest County Hospital. In the city areas and particularly in Dublin a number of surgical hospitals is available to which the injured may be admitted.  In Dublin as many as sixteen hospitals may be called on to deal with accident admissions although the great bulk of the serious accident work is dealt with by a small number of these hospitals.  The question of the <Col N="17" /> improvement of the hospital organisation in Dublin for dealing with serious accident cases is being studied in my Department.  It is also being reviewed by a committee established by the Irish Medical Association and their views should be of great value in determining what improvements can be put into effect.</P>

With regard to the latter part, since the introduction of the £5,000 exemption limit for death duties was in relief of small estates, it is not accepted that the charge of duty on the full value of estates exceeding £5,000 causes a hardship or constitutes an anomaly.

      <P>The examination of the feasibility of putting some of the capital of State-sponsored companies on the public market is still in progress.  I do not think it would be desirable to enumerate the companies which have been considered in this connection.  On this point, however, and on the question of Government policy, I would refer the Deputy to pages 238 and 239 &mdash;Chapter 11, paragraph 7&mdash;of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> Part II, laid before each House of the Oireachtas in July, 1964. It was reaffirmed in that paragraph that the Government accept in principle that the public should be afforded further opportunities of participating in the share capital of such companies whenever it is established that such participation would be feasible on terms, and to an extent, not disadvantageous to the Exchequer or contrary to the general interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1935 the Dublin Brigade Council of the old IRA suggested that, because of the associations of the site with National activities, the northern part <Col N="33" /> of the Rotunda Gardens in Parnell Square should be taken over by the Government and converted into a public park to be dedicated to the memory of all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom and to be known as the Garden of Remembrance.  The suggestion was adopted by the Government and the site was acquired from the Rotunda Hospital Authorities in 1939.</P>
    <P>A competition for the design of the Garden was held in 1946.  The winning design, which was approved by the Government in 1950, consists of a sunken garden in the shape of a cross with a sculptured central feature.  Seating accommodation will be available in the Garden for the public.</P>
    <P>In 1949 the Government decided to make the site available to the Rotunda Hospital authorities in connection with the Infant Welfare Scheme, and it was occupied for that purpose until 1959.</P>
    <P>The main construction work in the Garden commenced in 1961 and has been completed except for the improvement of the approach to the Garden along the eastern side of Parnell Square which, it is expected, will be finished during the Summer.  The estimated total cost of the scheme, exclusive of the memorial sculpture, is £166,000 of which about £145,000 has been expended to date.</P>
    <P>A design for the central sculptural feature depicting the metamorphosis of the Children of Lir into Swans, representing the change of men into history was prepared by Mr. Oisin Kelly in 1961.  The Government having considered the design felt that the theme was not an appropriate one, and it was decided that steps should be taken to procure a more suitable design.  Following consultation with An Chomhairle Ealaion discussions have taken place with Mr. Kelly and it has been agreed that he will consider, having regard to his other commitments, how soon he can undertake the preparation of an alternative design.  Mr. Kelly's proposals in this regard are awaited.</P>
    <P>Even if a suitable alternative design were available immediately it is obvious that quite a considerable time must elapse before the completed <Col N="34" /> feature could be ready for erection.  In the circumstances it is proposed that, as a temporary measure, a fountain in the form of a tall jet should be provided on the site of the sculptural feature.  Arrangements for the provision of this fountain are being made and the work will, it is hoped, be carried out within the next three to four months.</P>
    <P>A decision on the question of the opening of the Garden to the public will be taken on completion of the work of improvement to the entrance and the installation of the fountain.</P>

If the scheme is found to be feasible and economic, the requirements of the Arterial Drainage Act in regard to exhibition locally, consideration of observations of interested parties, consultations with other Government Departments and confirmation by the Minister for Finance will then have to be complied with and accordingly at this stage it is not possible to say when work is likely to commence.</P>

      <P>The engineering survey of the Suck has shown that it is not possible to carry out an arterial drainage scheme on it without seriously worsening conditions on the main River Shannon in the critical section between Athlone and Meelick. Moreover, the Suck as far as Ballinasloe is affected by floods in the Shannon and that portion could not be <Col N="38" /> improved without work on the Shannon.

      <P>An engineering inspection was made of the Termon river in 1960 to consider it for an Intermediate River Scheme.  This small river forms the border between Donegal and Fermanagh along six miles before its outfall into Lough Erne.  It has a mountainous catchment and the yield of damaged land is too small and too scattered to make it a feasible proposition for arterial drainage.  In view of the present commitments of the Commissioners of Public Works in regard to arterial drainage and the extent of the problem throughout the country, I am advised that there is no prospect of the Termon river being dealt with at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Recommendation 401 adopted by the Consultative Assembly in November, 1964, recommends first of all that the Committee of Ministers should adopt the proposals of the Council for Cultural Co-operation and the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee regarding the future cultural programme of the Council of Europe.  The Government approve the general directives on the CCC's programme prepared by the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee.</P>
      <P>The second proposal relating to the provision of sufficient resources to the Cultural Fund and the Directorate of Education and of Cultural and Scientific Affairs has been examined by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level.  Taking into account the cash resources of the Cultural Fund at the end of 1964, it was considered that a budgetary grant for 1965, limited to 1,500,000 F.Frs., would make it possible to carry out the programme of the CCC.  Provision has however been made for an additional guarantee against loss in the amount of 250,000 F.Frs. in order to ensure the implementation of the cultural programme.</P>

Schemes which Bord Fáilte and the Council for the Education, Recruitment and Training of Staff in the hotel industry are carrying through should increase overall efficiency and raise the standards of hotel management.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the serious problem facing tenants of council cottages and private houses as a result of the high estimate given by ESB officials for special service charges; and if, in view of this, he will consider making available a more attractive financial arrangement whereby people living in isolated areas could install electricity at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB require special service charges only in respect of the relatively small number of premises which are located in comparatively isolated situations where the normal fixed charge does not yield sufficient revenue to permit connection on an economic basis even after taking account of the substantial State subsidy. The Board are already incurring substantial losses on rural electrification despite the subsidy and to offer more attractive terms for the connection of those premises to which special service charges apply, would involve the Board in additional losses of an order which could not be justified by the benefits which would ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these people living in isolated areas not to be given the same opportunity as those people living along the main lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained in some detail to the House the position in regard to the people living in certain areas who up to 1962 had not been provided with power. There were 112,000 of them and of these 112,000, 77,000 can get power without paying any extra service charge and 23,000 can get power by paying only a very modest extra service charge of up to 50 per cent of the basic charge but in many cases below that.  Of the remaining 12,000, the charges would be additional service charges of 100 per cent and those are required because of the absolutely <Col N="47" /> prohibitive cost of installation.  By 1968 we anticipate that about 90 per cent of all the premises will be connected to the system and, as the Deputy will see, we shall have done, on the whole, a very good job.  As the Deputy knows, there is a bottled gas subsidy available for people in the isolated areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the recent subsidy introduced by his Department to meet isolated cases was introduced in theory to benefit those isolated cases, but in actual fact, by the operation of the scheme people in isolated areas are worse off now than prior to the introduction of the subsidy scheme?  In the light of this would the Minister be prepared to have an investigation in which case I should be prepared to put actual cases before him proving my arguments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always prepared to investigate any cases that come before the Deputy's mind.  It is true that changing the system of subsidy to 75 per cent of the capital cost, that is, a maximum of £75 per grid connected did alter the incidence of the charge in certain cases in the direction the Deputy indicates but it also brought a great many other people into the range of being able to get power without paying extra service charges or paying a service charge that is a very small percentage above the basic charge.</P>
      <P>We reckon there are some 377,000 rural premises and the ESB believe that by 1968 37,000 of them will not have taken power at the existing rates and that of these 37,000 probably another 20,000 will seek connection if the scheme continues beyond 1968.  Therefore, the position compared with that obtaining in other countries would be fairly satisfactory in regard to the number of people who have been able to secure power.  We are not behind other countries in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that a relatively small number are being affected and the reason they are affected is that they are living in <Col N="48" /> isolated areas.  Is he aware that as regards the majority of the people living in isolated areas it is not their fault that they do not come within the system, the area selected by the ESB, and that, furthermore, these people in isolated areas are very poor people? Why should they be the people to carry an extra service charge?  Would the Minister not reconsider that in the light of the small number of people who are left?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That would involve a technical discussion of the method by which the ESB levy these charges.  It is a very complex one but the Deputy might like to know that already the rural system loses nearly £1 million a year and it is subsidised by the profits made on the urban system for the supply of current.  If we were to abolish the special service charge the losses would run at an additional £650,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to get the point.  There is nobody criticising the technical aspect of this thing or what the ESB are doing.  Taking the human aspect into consideration, does the Minister not know himself for a fact that it is the very poor section of the community who are being burdened with this extra charge?  Surely the remainder of the community would be generous enough to say they would carry the extra load for the limited number.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had representations, as was to be expected, from the Irish Mining and Quarry Owners Association.  Some of these representations dealt with the instructions a manager might be given by the owner of a mine, instructions with which the manager might not agree.  The association suggest that in certain cases the manager should be entitled to require the owner to give written confirmation of any instructions <Col N="57" /> given to him.  They recommended strongly that an owner who was not qualified to be a manager should not be able to override the manager's decision on matters pertaining to safety merely by confirming his order in writing. This view has been accepted by me and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that in such cases the owner must have the qualifications of a manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to raise a matter on section 23 but this may be an appropriate moment now.  A question has been raised with me with regard to the position of quarry managers.  Apparently under existing legislation the person in charge is known as an agent.  In practice, he may be no more than a foreman.  It has been suggested to me that the use of the new title &ldquo;manager&rdquo; may involve a person having a status out of proportion to his qualifications.  Will the Minister indicate whether there will be for the future a distinction between managers and agents or whether a manager will in future perform functions similar to those performed by an agent under existing legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to anything in the Bill but there seem to me to be some omissions.  The title is &ldquo;Mines and Quarries Bill&rdquo;.  I should like to point out that things have changed a great deal in the past few years and quarries have now become stone-crushing mills.  There seems to me to be very grave laxity and that is due to negligence on the part of public authorities who are prepared to open up quarries and get the material out of them as quickly as possible, with, of course, no qualified person in charge.  Because of the lack of proper supervision, particularly where stone-crushing operations are concerned, a problem of dust arises. There is no one to take any action in regard to this problem.  If these men were working underground, the position would be entirely different.  They would be properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions which apply to mines should also apply to quarries.  It is unfair that the man who is better protected <Col N="58" /> working underground should be in a privileged position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his fellow worker overground.  Any type of machinery can apparently be used, without any proper supervision whatever. The workers have simply to take pot luck.  The Minister should take drastic action in connection with the operation of quarries.  It is grossly unfair that anybody should be able to cash in just by handing over a piece of ground to a public authority, a public authority who will send in all the machinery possible, to operate as rapidly as possible, under the worst possible conditions.  I object very strongly to that.</P>
    <P>We all know the adverse effects of dust on miners.  The effects are the same where those working overground are concerned.  In tightening up these regulations in regard to mines, the Minister should also tighten up in regard to quarries, particularly where the sole motive in operating the quarries is the profit motive.  Similar provisions should be introduced to protect quarry workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked whether, under this legislation, the situation whereby an agent would be responsible for the safe working of a mine would continue without ensuring that a competent person is responsible. The intention is that a competent person will be available as manager with qualifications to be prescribed by regulation, thereby ensuring that the person will be fixed with the statutory obligations of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To both mines and quarries, but, lest I may mislead Deputy Leneghan, with regard to the right of a manager to seek written confirmation of an order given to him by the mine owner, in that case the mine owner must have qualifications sufficient to enable him to satisfy the mine manager that he is competent to give an order with which the manager does not agree.  There is a distinction, as the Deputy will appreciate, between <Col N="59" /> a man working underground and a man working overground.  It is not intended that the owner of a quarry overground would be required to give the same kind of confirmation of an order as he would be required to give in the case of a mine.</P>

      <P>I would like to find out what the Minister has in mind under this section.  Heretofore a definite standard was required under the 1911 Act, and in Britain, under the 1954 Act, there is a definite standard required before a man can be appointed as a mine manager.  Under this section the matter is left wide open <Col N="60" /> and it is said that the qualifications will be prescribed by regulation.  There is some concern about the section and if some indication were given by the Minister as to the standards required it would put people's minds at ease.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory council and it is proposed, before the regulations prescribing the qualifications of a mine manager are drafted, to consult that council.  In that way we will be in a position to receive competent advice before the regulations are drafted and to ensure that they will provide for qualifications consistent with Irish mining activities as we know them.  People who are now actively engaged in mining operations will have an opportunity of advising us.</P>

      <P>Before section 31 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provisions as to Appointments by Mine and Quarry Owners</P>
      <P>(1) Where the manager of a mine or quarry dies, resigns or otherwise ceases to hold office, nothing in section 13 or 23 shall prevent the mine or quarry being worked at any time during a period not exceeding seventy-two days (or such longer period as an inspector may allow) until a successor is appointed, if at that time there is a person appointed by the owner to exercise and perform in the event of the manager's ceasing to hold office, his powers and duties until a successor is appointed.</P>
      <P>(2) The person appointed shall, while so acting, be treated for the purpose of this Act in all respects as if he were the manager.</P>
      <P>These amendments repair a defect in the Bill as it stands.  In reply to Deputy Pattison a few minutes ago, I mentioned a period of 75 days as the maximum period for which a person with lesser qualifications could act as manager.  The period is 72 days.  I was wrong in that.  Under the Bill as it stands no limit is placed on a period during which a person with lesser qualifications may act as manager.  The amendments provide for a limited period during which a person may act and provide for qualifications for such a person.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 21, line 17, to delete &ldquo;section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subsection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section provides for a minimum height of 5 foot 6 inches in the case of every travelling road in a mine.  It has been represented to my Department that to comply with this minimum requirement at this stage would have a serious effect on the economy and viability of some existing Irish mines. It has been suggested that in many cases it would not be necessary to have a minimum height of 5 foot 6 inches in the case of some of the travelling roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not completely convinced about this point but, nevertheless, I am prepared to go into it to see whether an exemption might be made in the case of this minimum requirement.  Therefore, I propose to provide that an exemption may be made pending a closer examination.  I do not wish create insurmountable difficulties <Col N="64" /> certain mine owners.

      <P>&ldquo;(3) An inspector may by notice served on the manager of a mine exempt any apparatus from subsection (2).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section, as it stands, provides that in a mechanically or gravity operated winding apparatus at a shaft a competent person who is at least 21 years of age must be employed.  It has been represented to me by the Irish Mining and Quarrying Association that certain operations, particularly the gravity operated winding apparatus which brings up minerals rather than human beings, would not require the attention of a person of 21 years of age.  It is also suggested this is a useful way of bringing young people to work at, if not in, mines so that they will become accustomed to the atmosphere of mines.  I agree to the case made in regard to this limited sphere of operations and that it is not necessary to have a person of 21 years of age in charge of gravity operated apparatus bringing minerals to the surface.  The proposed new subsection provides that an inspector be given power to exempt.</P>

In my constituency a young chap was killed a few years ago when he was caught in one of those machines which he was working.  I would stress the point about the granting of these exemptions.  I hope the insertion of this new subsection will not encourage getting jobs done cheaply by having young fellows on duty at these machines rather than adults.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so naive as to think that the representations made to me did not envisage getting a simple operation done cheaply but I was also impressed by the other part of the argument &mdash; that it was useful to accustom young people to activities at mines who would later be given jobs of greater responsibility.  I am not familiar with the case mentioned by the Deputy but I can assure him it will be the function of the inspector to ensure that as far as possible exemptions will not be given where there might be a particular danger to a person under the age of 18 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must agree the particular work might result in extreme danger to persons working underneath.  As it is now, the provision is wide open: anybody at all will be allowed to operate those machines. Is there not a danger that persons in the mines beneath, even though they are not travelling up or down, might be threatened by the possibility of the machine falling down on top of them thus causing fatalities or serious injury?  It is playing with fire to suggest there should not be any age limit in respect of persons operating those machines.  The ages of 18 and 21 years have been mentioned.  That makes it worse because nobody under 18 can operate such machines according to the Bill.  Now the Minister says there can be a dispensation for people under those ages.  We assume that will mean what Deputy Pattison referred to &mdash; that <Col N="66" /> there can be youngsters of 15 years of age or younger.  The Minister should have another look at this.  It is not something which can be accepted by the House too easily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>No mechanically or gravity operated rope haulage apparatus at a mine shall be operated on any such occasion except by, or under the constant supervision of, a competent male person who is at least eighteen years of age.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the Minister can say there is no question of danger.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that in such circumstances there could be grave danger, if somebody were unable to control it, whether it was being hauled by rope or gravity.  If it is not under control, it could run back. People have been killed in that way.</P>

The section will provide that no person can engage in this operation who may be under 18 years of age unless the inspector, in his wisdom and knowledge, recommends an exemption.  No <i>carte blanche</i> is being <Col N="67" /> given to people to employ anybody under 18 years unless exemption is granted by the inspector, who certifies that the operation is capable of being done by a person under the statutory age.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 33, line 33, to delete &ldquo;is minimised&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;is suppressed at source&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I feel that the section as it stands, which only requires that dust be minimised, is not sufficient.  By substituting &ldquo;suppressed at source&rdquo; it would be much stronger and would help to keep down the incidence of pneumoconiosis and other diseases caused by dust.  In the absence of a proper scheme of compensation, this is very serious for workers.  The injuries which dust causes to the health of workers cannot be overstressed.  Everything possible should be done to suppress at the source rather than allow it to be created and then try to remedy it.  It could be argued that a mine owner had minimised the dust as required by section 70 but the dust could still be at a level that would be dangerous to the health of the workers.  The words &ldquo;is suppressed at source&rdquo; would place a far greater obligation on mine owners to deal with this problem.  I do not think the words &ldquo;is minimised&rdquo; would serve the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;minimised&rdquo; recognises the practicality of the situation.  In mining operations underground dust can arise at a number of points.  An obligation to suppress this dust or gas at source would, of course, be the ideal situation but it is not realistic to suggest that that ideal situation can be achieved. Therefore, the word &ldquo;minimised&rdquo; is used rather than the words &ldquo;suppressed at source&rdquo;, suggested by the Deputy, because I am advised that this would be impractical in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the obligation imposed by the section as it stands to minimise any dust that is inflammable and dust of such character and in such quantity as to be likely to be injurious to the persons employed will have to be carried out in accordance with certain prescribed <Col N="69" /> regulations and, naturally, these regulations will go as far as is practicable to impose the obligation on the persons responsible for the working of the mine.  It would be impossible to fix them with the responsibility of suppressing all these things at source. It would not be practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we will have the advice of the inspector in this case and also of the men working in the mines.  If they regard the incidence of dust to be beyond what is tolerable I should expect that they would bring that first of all, to the attention of the mine manager or his immediate subordinates or to the mine owner but certainly to the mine inspector.  They would have means of conveying the presence of any undue amount of dust or other obnoxious substances.  The inspector, of course, will be available at all times to ensure that as far as possible these dangers will be eliminated and, certainly, minimised according to the regulations that will be prescribed and, I hope, enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what steps will be required in order to obtain the information that this section demands should be obtained. The section prescribes that it shall be the duty of mine owners and of managers to ascertain the thickness of strata between working and surface water.  Under the 1911 Act certain borings ahead were required to be made.  Such provision is not contained in this Bill.  We feel that there should be some definite method laid down by which this information should be ascertained.  It has been proved in the past that plans of mines have been not too accurate.  It could mean a great deal if certain plans were just a few yards out.  It is quite easy for plans to be even up to 20 yards out.</P>

      <P>Section 71 requires the owner or the manager of the mine to seek evidence of the proximity of disused workings, water bearing strata, and so on.  So that, there is in section 71 the obligation to ensure that the ground around is surveyed to ascertain whether there is water or some other dangerous substance that might affect the safe working of the mine.  Section 73, then, requires the manager to take precautions against inrushes of water where it is reasonably ascertained that these dangers are possible.  The Deputy did not move his amendment because as a result of his consultation with the officials dealing with this matter in my Department he was satisfied with the explanations they gave him.  I take it that he is still satisfied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 39, line 4, to delete &ldquo;may <Col N="71" /> require&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;will ensure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The section provides that regulations may require the provision and maintenance, for the use of persons employed at mines, of certain facilities for hygiene, health and the welfare of the workers.  We feel that the wording of the section is not sufficiently strong; that it should be provided that regulations &ldquo;will ensure&rdquo; the provision of these amenities.  These amenities are not provided in certain mines in this country at the moment and, consequently, men have to return to their homes covered with dust and coal and sometimes soaking wet.  We feel the time has come when owners should be compelled to provide these amenities. As the section stands it might be a considerable time before the amenities would be provided.  We feel that they should be provided without further delay.  They should have been in existence many years ago.  It is unfortunate that we have to legislate to compel people to provide these amenities.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret it is not possible for me to accept the amendment as proposed.  In the first place, the substitution of the words &ldquo;will ensure&rdquo; for &ldquo;may require&rdquo; would take out of the hands of the Minister any discretion he might have in this matter and would also amount to a statement as to what the future will be in the case of all these mines.  I realise, as I am sure all Members of the House realise, that there are certain minimum conditions, sanitary and toilet conditions, that we ought to require at mines, but the type of conditions would vary from mine to mine.  There are mines where people have to travel a long distance from the pithead before they get home over rough and possibly not very dry ground.  In such circumstances, it is desirable that there should be washing and drying facilities as near as possible to the minehead.  Then there are cases where a mining operation will be quite convenient to existing facilities, for example, in a village, <Col N="72" /> and it might not be necessary to have the same type of regulations in relation to that mine as to the one to which I have just referred.  Therefore, I think it would be more realistic to follow the usual pattern in these cases which is that the Minister may require the provision and maintenance of these facilities.</P>
      <P>Again, I shall have in this case the advice of the advisory council available to me.  As the Deputy is aware, this council will be representative of workers as well as employers.  Thus, we shall have the advice of those people who are immediately affected. It is better rather than to have a blanket provision to cover all cases that this usual form should be applied leaving certain discretion to the Minister as a result of the advice he gets. Again&mdash;and this is an important but not the most important point &mdash; the insistence on certain standards of requirements at one mine might be impossible to attain because of the marginal nature of the operations there&mdash;marginal economically&mdash;so that it is better that discretion be given to the Minister, especially when he will have not only the advice of the advisory council but also the initiative of that council to guide him, if necessary.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Surely an advisory council is not needed in order that basic needs are supplied.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good section, a section which ought to be implemented. I do not see what the Minister is worried about when he says he should have a certain amount of discretion.  I do not see what he is worried about when he says he will consult with an advisory committee.  The Minister will need discretion as far as subsection (c) is concerned because nobody wants him to insist that canteens or accommodation facilities for enabling such persons to partake of meals should be <Col N="73" /> provided.  That may not be necessary in certain mines but surely this House is entitled to give the Minister power to say that washing facilities, including soap and clean towels or other suitable means of cleaning and drying, would be provided.  I am convinced that the Minister will ensure these facilities will be provided.  Therefore, what he should do is to subdivide the whole section so that we at the Committee Stage can say: &ldquo;We have effected one thing as far as mines and quarries are concerned&rdquo; and that we&mdash;not the Minister at his discretion, not any advisory group &mdash; as public representatives have decided that under paragraph (a) there will be washing facilities, under paragraph (b) accommodation for changing clothing, etc., and under (d) there will be a supply of wholesome drinking water.</P>
      <P>There should be a special provision which will ensure that the ordinary basic facilities will be provided for miners.  I am sure it is not in the Minister's mind that, if I am a miner and I come up dirty and dust-ridden, because my house is half a mile away I should go there to clean myself.  The Minister is well aware that particularly in these villages the smaller proportion of houses have baths or showers.  There should be an assurance from the House that such facilities will be provided by regulation of the Minister.</P>

I misunderstood the Deputy's argument.

As the Minister knows, there is no proper compensation for miners suffering from pneumoconiosis.  They must be proved to be 100 per cent incapacitated before they can get compensation. If the percentage is anything lower than that, they get nothing. Under this provision, workers found to be suffering slightly from pneumoconiosis would not receive any compensation. Of course, other disabilities are also covered in this section, such as physical and mental disabilities.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on mine managers to submit themselves for examination. If such regulations are to apply to workers it is equally important that they should apply to managers, who may well suffer from mental or physical disabilities.  In the absence of any provision for compensation or for retraining, we cannot agree to the section.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  I would support the section because I think it is a good section if there were proper provision for compensation for those whose health might be in any way impaired.  As the section stands, if mine owners find some workers suffering from a slight touch of pneumoconiosis, they are free to dispense with their services and they are under no obligation to pay these workers compensation.</P>

      <P>This section cannot be taken alone in relation to the last portion of the Deputy's submission. The section provides regulations requiring men to undergo examination at particular times.  I can well understand the reluctance of persons who have been working at mining for a considerable period or even for a short period and who, for all they know, may have contracted pneumoconiosis, to undergo such examination.  If they are diagnosed as having this disease, they may be disemployed and our mining operations here are not on such <Col N="81" /> a scale as to ensure that they can be employed more safely in an aboveground capacity.  I believe they have such a scheme in Britain.</P>
      <P>I believe it is desirable that there should be this prior examination of people who seek employment in mines and it is equally desirable that persons who contract pneumoconiosis should be diagnosed at the very earliest stage in order to ensure that they would get such treatment as might cure them.  It is wrong to continue to allow a man to work underground if he has contracted pneumoconiosis and is possibly getting worse.  There is always the fear that the man may lose his job but under section 119, which gives me power to make regulations regarding this examination, I have to consult with the owner of the mine and with any associations appearing to me to be representative of the employees.  Naturally, I would want to create a situation in which the men would be allowed to keep on working and the consultations I would have with the mine owners and with the trade unions representing the men would have regard to the possibility of alternative employment being found for such men as might not be able to continue working underground. I cannot guarantee that such employment would be found but there is no question of the desirability of having the examination.  A man should not be permitted to work himself to death in a mine.  The regulation might well provide for doing something for such men other than cutting them off work completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know of cases of men who have been working with Bord na Móna or CIE and who have got hurt.  If any of these men has been foolish enough to try to obtain workmen's compensation the next thing we find is that the employers refuse to take him back.  It is well known that they do that.  There is also the case of the man who may have been working in a quarry and the same thing could happen.  A man working in a mine may get some form of lung disease.  It is discovered; he is treated for it and cured and when he tries to get back to work he will not be taken.  I wonder if the Minister would take some powers to himself to ensure that such people would be treated fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not know that this position obtains.  I know it and so do other Deputies.  It is grossly unfair but the fact remains that mine owners, quarry owners and company magnates do not want to give these people a second chance.  They are most reluctant to take them back and in most cases they do not do so.  Far from depriving the Minister of any of his powers, I would like him to take all the powers <Col N="83" /> he can to ensure that this type of gangster employer will be properly dealt with and that they will be compelled to deal reasonably with their employees when they return to look for work.  This state of affairs applies to local authorities and is common practice with Bord na Móna, the ESB and other State companies.  Once a man makes a claim against them they will not take him back and the Minister should ensure that that does not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very old problem and it is much greater than the context in which we are discussing it.  I know from my days at practice at the Bar that people who got compensation under the workmen's compensation code frequently found themselves, when a lump sum settlement was made, without any employment.  Lawyers making such settlements have often tried to build into them some provision whereby the employee could get back to work.  The fact is that nowadays more and more men are seeking compensation at common law rather than under the workmen's compensation code.  Common law provides that damages can be assessed not only on loss of earnings but because of hurt, disturbance and also because of loss of opportunity of employment.  Under the workmen's compensation code damages can only be assessed on lack of earning capacity and as soon as a judge decides that a man is fit to work and the man seeks to resume employment, the employer may not take him back, even though the judge decides he is fit for work.  I think that is a defect in the system which should be remedied.  I hope it will be possible to take it up in the revised workmen's compensation code now being discussed by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

There is a grave lack of supervision in regard to quarries, many of which are operated by public authorities&mdash;county councils, the Special Employment Schemes Office, the Land Commission and others.  It is past time they were brought within the ambit of the regulations attaching to mines.  It seems impossible to me that a man working in a quarry at the moment could escape getting lung disease from the dust that is allowed to fly, uncontrolled, all over the place.  Nobody has been made responsible.  Therefore, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his effort to cry halt to this lack of control in quarries.</P>

      <P>I have no proof that lung disease can occur as a result of the inhalation of dust in quarries, but, as Deputy Leneghan has said, the quarry industry is becoming so widespread, so much employment is being given, and so many minerals are being processed because, obviously, it is profitable, that I should like to ensure that if something does arise in the future, if some lung disease is diagnosed as a result of the inhalation of dust in quarries, I shall be able to take steps to remedy it.  As I said at the outset, I do not know that any form of lung disease arises from the inhalation of dust in quarries but if it can be proved that it does, I should like to be in a position to control it.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I can understand the Minister providing that people be medically examined before entering a mine or quarry and I can further understand the point of having periodic examinations of people working in mines, but, is the Minister <Col N="85" /> not anticipating too much when he acquires power to have persons employed in quarries&mdash;not those seeking employment &mdash; subjected to periodic medical examination before he is able to state categorically that lung diseases do arise from employment in quarries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I took counsel with the Minister for Health in this matter and the Minister's advisers suggested it is better that we should provide for this kind of examination because of the danger of pneumoconiosis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone shares Deputy Leneghan's anxiety about quarry workers because their problem has become a much wider one than heretofore.  I assume slightly different standards would apply to mines than to quarries. I do not think they would be comparable in regard to the degree of danger to health.  I do not know whether one can contract lung disease from the dust in quarries or in factories, but I suspect one can.  I have no positive evidence, but I believe that a person working in a flour mill must, by the inhalation of tiny dust particles day in, day out, be exposed to dangers to health.</P>
      <P>We can only depend on the doctors' opinion in this matter.  There may be a fear that on the slightest pretext a doctor will say to a quarry worker: &ldquo;You are not fit to work in a quarry.&rdquo; The danger can be more easily evident in a mine, but in a quarry it may be different.  There are two questions I should like to put to the Minister.  Has he ever contemplated making regulations for the introduction of safety devices?  The Deputy from South Tipperary might be able to advise us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that in employment where a lot of dust flies around, workers do not wear what I would call filter masks.  I am told some workers do not bother to use them.  I know the Minister and his officials must have taken pains in introducing this Bill but did they ever contemplate the introduction of regulations that employers would have to provide and employees would have to wear filter masks to ensure that dust is not inhaled? Secondly, in the matter of medical examination, who would pay the fee&mdash;<Col N="86" /> it might be only 15/ or £1?  Would it be the applicant, the employer or the employee?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure the Minister understands my attitude in this matter.  I wish to make it quite clear that I do not expect the same standards to be applied to mines and quarries.  On the other hand, up to now quarries have been lacking even the most elementary forms of control.  As the law stands, anybody can open any kind of quarry anywhere and operate it under whatsoever conditions the owner wishes.  That is intolerable.  I see that lack of control as I travel throughout my part of the country.  I do not see mines because there are none in my constituency.  I cannot allow ordinary county council workers to be smothered in dust because they are afraid to protest to the local authority for fear of losing their jobs.</P>
      <P>That is where I want the Minister to come in.  I do not want him to introduce the same stringent regulations as for mines.  I want him to ensure that in future the quarries will be operated under proper supervision, that the workers will be treated as human beings and not as bits of blotting paper expected to mop up the dust.  That is what has been happening.  I am glad the Minister has taken steps to cry halt and that he will bring these regulations into operation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I want to stress to the Minister that this section could be used by employers as an escape out of their obligation to pay compensation. Under existing legislation there is an obligation to pay compensation only when 100 per cent disability is proved.  Where there is anything short of 100 per cent, there is no obligation to pay compensation.  Under this section a mine owner will be free to dismiss those workers.  The Minister has made the point that this is far better than that they should kill themselves working.  What it amounts to is that they have a choice of either starving to death or working to death.  If they do not get compensation, they will starve to death.  If the Minister could use his influence with the Minister for Social Welfare to introduce some scheme of partial compensation, it would allay the fears expressed on this section.</P>

    <P>The section as drafted applies the existing limit of hours of work below ground in mines to all classes of mines. I am introducing an amendment to exclude all classes and to revert to the <i>status quo</i> that existed under the Coalmines (Regulation) Act, 1908, to limit the number of hours as worked to coal, etc. mines only and to give power under regulations to extend the type of mines to other types, for example, metalliferous mines.  The effect of the two amendments, Nos. 15 and 17, is to confine the provisions of section 112 to the mines which come within the scope of the 1908 Act and to take power to apply the section, modified as necessary, to any other classes of mines.  In other words, if persons can negotiate reductions in <Col N="90" /> work, it is a matter for application then by regulation to the type of mine in which these persons work.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been prompted by the fact that coal miners in my part of the country have been for the past 30 years working a 7½ hour day on five days of the week and five hours on Saturday.  We feel that it is a retrograde step to specify an eight hour day. Many people may not be conscious of the fact that miners are not entitled under existing legislation to a half-day.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Tobacco (Control of Sale and Advertisement) Bill, 1964: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been fairly well examined by the people who have contributed to the debate and there is little further to be said, but I should like it to be clear, in view of what has been said, what the Bill does. There are things that it has been alleged to do.  I should like to clear up that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that all I am concerned about is the continued use of cigarettes.  It is specifically stated in the first section that pipe tobacco, cigars, cheroots and snuff &mdash; all of which form part of tobacco &mdash; are excluded from any of the provisions that are contained in section 2.  It is very important to make that clear &mdash; I may not have done it up to now &mdash; because it <Col N="92" /> does mean that a very big part of tobacco consumption could still go on untouched and, in fact, increase, if necessary, because nobody wants to deprive people who have got this nicotine habit, or tobacco-smoking habit, of the pleasure where it is a simple pleasure and a harmless pleasure, as it is in the case of pipe tobacco, cigars and snuff.  Nobody wants to curtail the use of these in the slightest or the advertisement of any of these.  The section refers merely to the use by the public of the dangerous form of tobacco, that is, the cigarette. I want to make that completely clear. There is a very large part of the tobacco usage which should not be interfered with at all.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is permissive and simply asks the Minister to do something if in his opinion it is in the public interest to do so.  Clearly, therefore, nothing could take place at all until the Minister was concerned by a particular habit, that is, cigarette-smoking.  If the Minister was convinced that it was a bad thing for people to go on smoking cigarettes, in that way he would come to the conclusion that it was wise in some way or other to draw their attention to the fact that this was a dangerous habit which they should curtail or stop if possible &mdash; preferably stop.</P>
    <P>So, it is a Bill which leaves entirely to the Minister the final decision.  It is merely asking that the Minister should have power, if he feels it is in the public interest, to take any particular decision curtailing advertisement or insisting on the inclusion of &ldquo;dangerous product&rdquo; on the advertisement or carton, wherever it might be.  So, it is only an enabling Bill and it does not prevent anybody from doing anything at all.  It is merely to help the Minister if he considers that he need take this action.  I cannot see why, if the Minister believes that a certain practice is a dangerous practice from the health point of view, he, as Minister for Health, morally can refrain from carrying out his responsibilities in this way.  I am not asking him to do it unless he is so convinced.</P>
    <P>My case, of course, is based largely on the fact that there is a danger in cigarette-smoking.  It is now universally <Col N="93" /> agreed.  The danger is the danger of lung cancer which is practically universally a mortal disease and that fact is not being made clear to the public.  I think the Minister has failed in his responsibility to make it clear to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested in a recent announcement that he has circulated so many leaflets &mdash; I think 360,000&mdash;and that he has advertised in &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; and he made a few other suggestions of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is either a fool or a hypocrite.  He is a fool if he believes that the relatively minor educational proposals which he has used in this particular campaign against cigarette smoking will be effective in achieving his objective.  We must assume that if he has decided to curtail cigarette-smoking by any kind of campaign he has done it because he is convinced that cigarette-smoking is a bad thing and that some curtailment is needed; that he has been convinced by the arguments made.  So, I say that if he thinks he is going to counter the £½ million or £¾ million spent on cigarette-smoking advertisements by a few advertisements in &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; and the leaflets he has handed around to youngsters, then he is either a fool or a hypocrite.  If he is not a fool, then he is a hypocrite because he knows the facts and is quite consciously and deliberately doing nothing about it.  That is completely amoral behaviour on the part of an allegedly responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister discriminates between the need for the prevention of drug addiction, morphia, cocaine, marijuana, as against cigarette smoking.  The Minister suggests that there is some element of moral torpitude in drug addiction, and so on, and for that reason it must be prevented.  My attitude to drug addiction is that it is due to a personality defect and is a form of illness; consequently it is something which requires medical treatment and medical care.  I do not think I would go along with the Minister in his condemnation of people of that kind and say that this is some form of depravity.  The Minister's values are all astray.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> In regard to this question as to whether it is moral or immoral, I do not particularly want to pursue that argument but my feeling about drug addiction is that, No. 1, it is due to a personality defect and, No. 2, it destroys the body, the most wonder-fully creative thing, the human body which the use of drugs over a period of time will undermine and eventually make into a terrible thing.  But so does cigarette smoking.  Anybody who knows a person who has lung cancer sees exactly the same thing happening, the destruction of the body.  That is the only reason I feel concerned about this at all, seeing this kind of thing happen to unfortunate innocent people who do not really know what they are letting themselves in for.  Death from lung cancer consists mainly of two things: it takes a long time; it is terribly painful and one usually ends up by suffocating to death.</P>
    <P>The only reason we, in the medical profession, show a significant drop in the incidence of cigarette smoking is that we know the facts.  It is not because we are people with stronger fibred characters or better personalities or anything like that.  It is because we are more frightened by the facts because we know the facts.  It took me nearly two years to give up the habit. It is a very difficult thing to do, whether you are a doctor or a layman, but if you know the facts it is not so difficult.</P>
    <P>That is why I accuse the Minister of conspiring to conceal the facts from the general public.  The general public are not so irresponsible, so stupid, or self-indulgent.  The Minister says he is merely doing something which, generally speaking, he believes is reasonably safe, that we are scaremongers and which he is continually led to believe is safe by the advertising campaign of the cigarette manufacturing companies.  There is no doubt about that at all.  People watching the advertisements see the fine young broth of a boy sucking away at a cigarette.  Let them go around to St. Luke's or St. Kevin's and see a few of these poor things suffocating to death, people <Col N="95" /> who were in good health ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing is the impregnability of the Minister to the facts as they are.  The most dramatic illustration of the seriousness of the whole thing came to us last night in the decision of the British Government, who are as close to bankruptcy as, I suppose, a Government have ever been, to stop the advertising of cigarettes on television at the risk of the loss of the revenue income involved.  They have not taken that decision lightly.  It is as important to the Minister, Kenneth Robinson, Wilson and the rest of them, as it is to the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, and his colleagues in the Government.</P>
    <P>The question of revenue is at the back of this whole problem.  It is not a lack of conviction on the part of the Minister.  It is inability to decide where else the money will be found if it is not got from tax revenue on cigarettes. It is a simple, sordid problem of pounds, shillings and pence.  People will die of lung cancer because the Minister cannot think of another way of raising the money.  The old China wars were fought on the same issues. The British Government were in trouble and eventually they were shamed into changing conditions.  The existence of this problem has the same motivation: money, greed, selfishness and indifference to human suffering, in which the Minister has shown himself in recent years to be a particularly skilled practitioner.</P>
    <P>The Minister says a code is being introduced.  In the light of the Wilson decision, the introduction of the tobacco companies' code will be worth watching.  It is claimed that it will alter the cigarette consumption rate and so on.  Nobody believes for one moment this hypocritical, humbugging, supposedly self-denying ordinance on the part of the tobacco companies. Does the Minister seriously think these companies will curtail their dividends or profits?  Have they shown any likelihood that they will take such a principaled decision where money is involved? This type of capitalistic businessman <Col N="96" /> does not care who gets hurt as long as his profits are increasing. Imperial Tobacco profits went up by £2 million, from £16 million to £18 million.  No self-denying ordinance or code will be allowed to interfere with the amount of cigarette consumption that will go on.</P>
    <P>It could be said that this code would be a valid or useful one except for this fact.  I wrote to Mr. Kenneth Robinson about this whole matter and he told me that in fact this self-denying ordinance by the tobacco companies, much the same as the proposals put forward to the Minister by the tobacco companies, has been in operation under the Tory Government since 1962.  As usual, the Minister is even behind the British Tories, two years behind them.  At least they had sufficient interest in the whole question because it has been on the mat since 1958.  The tobacco companies were urged to do something and they brought in this absurd code in 1962.  It is exactly the same as we have here.  I have here a letter from the British Ministry of Health from which I quote:</P>
    <P>In 1962 the tobacco manufacturers agreed voluntarily to eliminate from their cigarette advertisements both on television and on other advertising media themes which are likely to have special appeal to the young. They also accepted that advertisements should not be shown on television until just before 9.00 p.m....</P>
    <P>It was speculation on my part that this was not worth the paper on which it was written but the proof is the fact that there has been an increase to 20,000 deaths from lung cancer, an increase of 5 per cent in 1963, in spite of this famous code.  The Minister must know that.  His advisers in the Department must have told him that the code was completely useless, futile and ineffective in Great Britain and he must also know that it will be completely useless, futile and ineffective in Ireland.  Yet, he continues to persist in it.  This is another example of his complete amorality and irresponsibility as a Minister.</P>
    <P>When he talks about interference with the rights of individuals &mdash; there is no <Col N="97" /> interference in this Bill &mdash; he might have a word with the Minister for Local Government or with the Minister for Justice in regard to the alcohol blood tests with which I completely agree. Deputy Corish, Deputy McQuillan, and the late Deputy Desmond and I were the only Deputies who voted for that some time ago and now it is being widely used.  It seems to me these tests represent much more serious interference with the rights of the individual but they are there to protect the public good.  Similarly, it seems to me the public good is involved on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The British decision has, of course, been welcomed by all the responsible groups, the Medical Association, the Medical Practitioners Union and all these authoritative bodies.  One can talk to them about these things; they know something about them and they have welcomed the decision as a step in the right direction, a very desirable step.</P>
    <P>Talking of interference with rights, here is a small illustration of the wonderful golden ring that there is around the vested interests of capitalist businessmen of one kind or another. Some time ago I tried on behalf of some agents for the product, to get access to one of the national newspapers for an advertisement for a substance which would help people to stop smoking cigarettes.  They were rejected by the newspaper proprietors and told they could not advertise this substance because it would knock their competitors. Did one ever hear such hypocrisy when every day one reads of products that are claimed to be superior to other products, something that washes whiter than anything else? That is all permissible and acceptable but where there is the slightest impinging on the tremendous vested interests in the tobacco business generally, there is a complete blockage of any such advertisements which might help unfortunate people who cannot of themselves for one reason or another stop smoking.  This substance might help them to stop but no, they must not be told about it because there might be a slight reduction in dividends and profits coming from men and women dying in pain.  Lest there <Col N="98" /> should be such a reduction, they may not have this advertisement and no advertising is allowed to counter the big tobacco manufacturers' half page advertisements in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>There is another link in the ring around these people.  Griffith spoke of a paper wall around Ireland but there is a wonderful paper ring around the tobacco manufacturers.  In this ring the Minister is the main link.  Another link is television.  Some people approached me after the introduction of the Bill and asked me would it be possible to advertise on television the dangers of lung cancer from cigarette smoking.  I wrote to Telefís Éireann and asked if it would be possible simply to advertise on television that cigarettes cause lung cancer and I received a reply from Mr. McCourt dated 15th January in which he said he could not judge the admissibility or otherwise of the advertisement from the amount of information given in my letter but it seemed to him that the advertisement I was suggesting would come within a range of general statements which would not be acceptable advertising within the context of their code of standards and current practice.  <i>Noli tangere:</i> do not go near them.  No matter how you try to get at these people, you find this frontline defence for the tobacco manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann and the newspapers make a lot of money out of tobacco advertising.  That is all permissible, part of the jungle life that goes on in a capitalist society, but the other strange thing is that the elected representative who has the responsibility of protecting the public when necessary from the sale and advertising of dangerous substances, is himself a member of that ring who, despite all the events in Europe, America and Britain &mdash; where in most cases some sort of preventive action is taken&mdash; still defends the tobacco manufacturers' interests and betrays his responsibilities to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I think I have said all I wanted to say but in passing I may add that I am astonished at the main Opposition Party.  There was one very civilised and helpful contribution from Deputy Anthony Barry in which he took the <Col N="99" /> reasonable line of saying that although he was a heavy smoker, if this would help to stop people becoming heavy smokers, he wished the Bill good luck.  I am grateful for that comment but it is astonishing that on this terribly important question all over the world &mdash; in a minor way: I am not trying to build it up into something of great national and fundamental importance, but it is in one way important &mdash; the main Opposition Party, who claim to represent nearly half the people of the country, have no view and have expressed no authoritative view on the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is all the more astonishing since we have pretty persistent repetition of Deputy O'Higgins's obvious concern for the health of the people.  I am delighted to see that; it is a very welcome development, but I think there is involved here an important question of health and I am very surprised the Deputy did not take the opportunity of putting forward some points of view on this measure.  I am also very surprised that a Party with two very distinguished members of the medical profession in their ranks found themselves unable to put forward a point of view.  I am more than surprised that neither of these two distinguished gentlemen put forward his point of view &mdash; for or against is immaterial. Surely some point of view should have been put forward on behalf <Col N="100" /> of a Party who claims to represent such a big sector of the public.  The Government Party at least said something and made some comments, but we heard nothing at all from the main Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>That is a bad thing from the point of view of democracy.  It is bad because it breeds on the division of people on something which is not a fundamental issue, something about which individual members in all Parties could have a point of view, not necessarily at variance with or unfaithful to the Party attitude on fundamental policy issues.  The main Opposition Party are as guilty as the Minister in not allowing a free vote.  I propose to put this matter to a vote.  I do not care how many support it.  It is a personal matter.  This is not a Party measure. It is mine and Deputy McQuillan's. But it is an important matter and one which will become even more important as the years go by, and it is, therefore, essential at this stage to know how many have a point of view on this issue at this juncture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that effective steps should be taken to indemnify those who have already suffered or are in danger of suffering, loss by reason of accident as a result of the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company Limited consequent on the failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to detect the insolvency of the Company in sufficient time to protect them.</P>
      <P>This motion was put down at a time when many people had found themselves in serious difficulty as a result of the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company, at a time when several Parliamentary Questions had failed to get from the Minister any admission that he had any other responsibility than to receive the accounts of the company certified by a firm of recognised accountants.  There seemed to be no evidence of any serious concern on the part of the Minister or the Government for the many people who had got caught by having their premiums placed with this company.  At that time one person came to me and said he could not believe it was possible that the law of the country would compel people to spend money on insurance which turned out not to be insurance and when that position arrived that they were thrown to the wolves.</P>
      <P>Since that time the Minister has introduced legislation which has passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas providing for the setting up of a fund to be subscribed jointly by the insurance companies and the Government to meet claims arising out of accidents where the premiums were held by the Equitable Insurance Company. That would seem to be a measure which would meet fairly the situation and it was welcomed by all sides of the House, and more especially by the victims of this collapse.  They felt that immediately it was passed, their worries were over but these unfortunate people are still on the cross and no effort has been made by the Minister or the Government to take them off it.  They are still suffering agonies because of the fact that some of them have already had to meet claims and many more claims are pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> I know of people who are practically on the roadside as a result of the fact that even though this legislation was passed eight months ago, no relief has yet come to them and no money has been paid out from this joint fund. When will these people get the relief they so badly need; when will payment be made to them?</P>
    <P>I know that a joint committee of the insurance companies will consider these cases.  They will then be passed on to the liquidator, who, in turn, will pass them on to the court.  We are waiting for all this to happen.  What I and many people cannot understand is why the Minister has not moved to relieve the plight of these people by using the contingency fund at his disposal. Surely this is the type of case the contingency fund was intended to meet?  Surely it is only fair that the agony of these people should be relieved, that they should get help to meet the serious plight they are now faced with?  It is a reasonable request. The people concerned expected the Minister to treat this as a matter of urgency.  Our compaint is that he has not done so.  There is grave worry in the minds of people as to whether or not this joint fund will meet claims under common law.  I should like the Minister to clear that matter up, as well, when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can say about it.  I know other Deputies are very interested.  I am aware that a number of Deputies have themselves been caught.  We think the Minister has not fulfilled his responsibility fully under existing law because he has not saved those people in time.  Apart from that, he has left grave doubts in the minds of many people.  The important thing is to ensure that these people are relieved immediately and I would implore the Minister to use the money at his disposal to end their agony.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Deputy Clinton has put the case very concisely.  We apprehend that the Minister, in reply, will tell us he has done all that can be done to meet the cases we are concerned about.  He <Col N="104" /> acted reasonably speedily last year when he put through the Insurance Bill, now the Insurance Act, under which an insurance compensation fund was set up, more or less under the control of the High Court.  A sum of £30,000 was advanced by the Minister to that fund, specifically carmarked to meet cases arising from the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company.</P>
      <P>I think the gravest case involves a constituent of mine, a small contractor, who at the time of the collapse had pending against him claims by two of his workers in respect of his liabilities under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, against which he was insured with Equitable.  The claims were settled on senior counsel's advice in the middle of last year.  My constituent, a very small contractor, was compelled to pay the sum of £4,500 compensation. He claimed on the liquidator for that sum and our complaint is that the case is not being considered with the despatch which we in the House were led to believe nine months ago such claims would be dealt with in cases of hardship.</P>
      <P>This man is on the verge of bankruptcy. The £4,500 was produced by him at the expense of his working capital.  It completely exhausted his resources. The Federation of Building Contractors took up the case with the liquidator who advised them a few weeks ago that procedural delays were inevitable.  The liquidator said he regretted that he could not at that time give any clear indication of when the member's claim would be paid.</P>
      <P>That situation is a complete breach of faith with this House and indeed with the Minister because I apprehend that until I wrote to him about this case on 26th January last, the Minister was probably unaware of the seriousness of these legalistic, bureaucratic delays which have hampered the decisions of the Legislature.  The Minister's responsibility in these matters is to deliver a hard rap on the knuckles where it is deserved, to insist that the bureaucrats responsible for these delays get on with the task assigned to them by Act of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough that such aid is not available until it is too late.  I <Col N="105" /> am not at all satisfied with the reply I received from the Minister's Secretary in a rather formal letter dated 5th February.  It told me that the delay had arisen because of the fact that the High Court had been experiencing some difficulty in the matter.  The letter assured me that considerable progress had been made and that the Minister had been assured that when the procedure is established there will not be any delay in dealing with individual payments.  It said it was hoped to bring the case I have mentioned before the relevant judge within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>They were glib phrases.  &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  That is no help at all to this man who, because he had to meet those claims, cannot now pay his creditors.  I feel confident it is only necessary to bring this matter to the Minister's notice to ensure that he will do as Deputy Clinton has suggested&mdash;make use of the contingency fund which exists for cases such as this.  We are not prepared to be stalled by red tape.</P>
    <P>It is grossly wrong that the intentions of the Oireachtas should be thwarted by rules of court or what have you. Possibly, it is understandable that difficulties should arise in the first case to which this new Act is being applied but it is not unreasonable to ask the court, the liquidator and the Minister to have regard to the human factors involved.  I am deliberately not mentioning the name of the case I have cited for obvious reasons.  I have made the fullest details available to the Minister in confidence and I now appeal to him to act speedily in this very urgent matter.  I may add that there are two other cases where similar problems arise.  They may not be quite as serious but they are something to be deplored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion refers to one of the most disgraceful situations that have ever arisen in this country where the public trust is concerned. We had an insurance company supposed to be a reputable company whose records were supposed to be checked by the Department but who went broke months after the Department <Col N="106" /> suspected that something was wrong.  The extraordinary thing is that right up to the day they went into liquidation, that company were collecting premiums from unfortunate people throughout the country.  I am particularly bitter about this affair for several reasons, the primary one being that I was badly stung myself.</P>
      <P>It is shocking that any company existing on public trust should be in a position to collect money from private individuals for any reason whatever for months after the company knew they could not meet their liabilities and when the Department responsible for checking must have had very strong suspicions that they would not be able to meet their liabilities.  As a result many people suffered severe loss, financial and otherwise.  I am aware that on 23rd May a premium of over £40 was collected from a private motorist.  At that time the company must have known, and the Minister should have known, that it could not carry on.  But no effort was made to stop them collecting premiums.  They continued to do so until the very last moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23rd May payment was made by a colleague of mine now dead.  The company went into liquidation and a receiver was appointed. That receiver proceeded to notify people that their policies were cancelled. I took the necessary precautions to get alternative cover for my car, my business and my home early in May. Towards the end of July, I got a note from the receiver to the effect that my policy with the Equitable was being cancelled with effect from 31st July.  I replied that as far as I was concerned it had been cancelled on the first or second week of May, that I had alternative cover and that I did not consider I was covered or had any liability for payment beyond that.  I got an impudent letter in reply to the effect that as far as the receiver was concerned, I <Col N="107" /> had no right to cancel my own policy and that he alone, as a servant of the High Court, was the only person who had the right to determine when my policy was cancelled.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that action of this kind made a bad situation worse.  I know a receiver has an awkward job to do and that he must get the best out of the situation.  But I would challenge the Minister that the receiver has got the best out of it.  Can the Minister say with certainly that all the moneys collected on behalf of the company by agents and brokers throughout the country did in fact pass to the receiver following the bankruptcy or closing down of the company? Were there considerable sums paid which some people felt they had no need to pay back after the action had been taken, despite the fact they went to the people for whom the cover was obtained and got a second cover for them?</P>
      <P>These are matters which should be straightened out.  It is long after the time when the Minister should make a statement clearing this up.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that there is no point in writing polite letters that we are doing the best we can.  It is nearly 12 months now since this happened.  As the Minister is aware, a colleague of mine was badly involved in this whole affair.  Nobody except he and his immediate associates know the annoyance and trouble brought on this man simply because an insurance company, to whom he paid a considerable amount of money, had been allowed to slide out of their responsibilities without very much attempt being made to check on them in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's replies in this House, this company had been in the habit of sending in their audited accounts much later than they were liable to do.  The Minister had to remind them on more than one occasion that their accounts were overdue and that they should do something about it. Yet right up to the last minute they were allowed to collect premiums for which they must have known they could not offer cover.  The people responsible to the Minister for seeing that <Col N="108" /> these things are done should have checked on them before this thing happened.</P>
    <P>This has struck a terrible blow at the confidence of the people in companies of this sort.  It has been said time and again since that there is no point in insuring anything with a company that has not as much money as some of the big foreign combines.  This was bound to happen when these people were allowed to carry on as long as they did.  I would be very anxious to know from the Minister whether there is any possibility that the whole case can be wound up and if he could say clearly how far it is hoped to indemnify those who have suffered loss as a result.  I appreciate it would be impossible to refund the thousands of premium payments made to that company.  I should like to know if all other payments can be covered and, in particular, whether the legal expenses of people who had to go to court to defend claims made against them because of the failure of the company will be fully covered.  That is an important point.</P>

      <P>I did not expect I would be called upon to reply so early this evening.  If this motion had been presented by the Fine Gael Deputies who spoke in the manner in which it appears on the Order Paper, I would have accused them of being vindictive and indulging in a witch-hunt.</P>

They have deplored the delay that has taken place in meeting the claims to compensation of those who have been affected by the failure of this company.  If that is so, it would have been sufficient for them to bring a motion in that form&mdash;that they deplored the delay and asked me to account for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was put down after the Bill was passed.  We discussed <Col N="109" /> at great length the merits of the action taken when the Insurance Bill, 1964, was passed.  I do not think anybody will deny that in that Bill the Government went as far as they might be reasonably expected to go in ensuring that those affected by the failure of the Equitable would be compensated. The Minister for Finance agreed to put up a certain figure and, in the face of much opposition, I ensured that the insurance companies now existing to transact business would also make a contribution, so that those affected will be fully and properly compensated.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the manner in which the motion was put rather than drafted, I do not think I need go into the background of the examination of the accounts of the Equitable, but I may say, very briefly, that the accounts of the Equitable for the last full year of their operation were due in the normal way six months after the end of the year, that was, for the year ended 30th June, 1962.  Therefore, these accounts would be normally due in my Department on or before 31st December.  But, there is a provision in the 1909 Insurance Act which empowered the Minister, on request by the insurance company involved, to extend that period by three months. That provision was frequently availed of in the case of many insurance companies other than the Equitable and it was not considered anything unusual for a company to make such a request. The Equitable made the request in this case and, while it is true there were rumours about the Equitable during the three months period of extension, there was no action that I could have taken more expediously than I did ultimately take to satisfy myself of the true position of the Equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, not only did the Equitable do business with their clients but the insurance companies did business with the Equitable and they were financially involved in a number of ways with the Equitable, for example, in the fire insurance pool and, therefore, the widespread knowledge that it was alleged was available about the financial position of the Equitable did <Col N="110" /> not appear to extend to the insurance world itself.</P>
    <P>However, the three months extension period to which I have referred lapsed on 31st March and immediately I asked the Equitable Insurance Company to submit their accounts, that they were now in default, and they submitted them on 3rd April, in an incomplete fashion.  They were not in the ordinary fashion the statute required them to be in but they were in such form that made it clear that they were not then solvent.  It was at that stage I made up my mind to move but I thought it was not unreasonable to give the company the opportunity, mainly in the interests of those insured with the company and, of course, its employees, to recover the ground and they made certain overtures in certain directions that I thought would be successful in providing sufficient new capital, sufficient backing, to get the company out of its troubles.</P>
    <P>That continued only over a matter of about a month and when it became clear that these efforts which I felt were reasonable to take in the circumstances were unlikely to be successful, I eventually decided to have the company wound up, and on 9th May the Chief State Solicitor was requested to present on my behalf a petition under section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1936, for the winding up of the company on the ground that the company was unable to pay its debts.  The petition was presented on 11th May and came for hearing before Mr. Justice Budd on 27th May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry&mdash;23rd April. I made a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will just delay the House that much longer because the purpose of retailing these dates was to indicate that it was unlikely that a premium would have been paid on 23rd May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When all that was done, it was obvious that I had to do something else because it soon became apparent that the assets of the Equitable, no matter where they could <Col N="111" /> be found, were far from sufficient to meet the claims.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point that delay would affect people, at any stage, as the House is aware, the failure of an insurance company would affect the same number of people and in roughly the same amounts because insurance liability is a continuing thing and if, for example, the company failed in April, 1962, all that volume of insurance premiums which represented the payment for cover that people sought would be affected.  So, it might have affected different people at different times, but, by and large, the different people would have been affected no matter what time the company went into liquidation.  So that the period, of itself, is not as material as was suggested on the last occasion that we debated this matter.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned about now is what I can do.  I did bring this Bill before the House and the House gave it a very generous reception, even though a critical review, as it went through.  Before the Bill was ever passed it was decided to appoint a receiver but he had to act under the orders of the court.  Therefore, he was an officer of the court, and I will admit that I am very disappointed too by the lack of expedition in the meeting of these claims.  I am reasonably certain that if I had taken unto myself the administration and the adjudication of these claims I would have been criticised by the Opposition.  I am certain I would; that then they would attribute to me some designs on certain powers that I ought not to have&mdash;and the Fine Gael Party, in particular, are great advocates of leaving matters to courts of competent jurisdiction to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had no choice in this case, in any event.  The court had to make the order and the court appointed the receiver. From there on he was an officer of the court.  I had no power over any one of the claims made or over the processing of any one of these claims.  Therefore, as far as the bureaucrats referred to by Deputy Byrne are concerned, the bureaucrats are not my <Col N="112" /> bureaucrats.  There are other bureaucrats involved, perhaps.  I am not saying that there are.  But, the delay is certainly not in my Department.  Again, I am not going to be a Pontius Pilate in this connection.  There is a delay that I am terribly worried about.  The delay is in the court, possibly in the court procedures, that people do not seem to be able to get over.  It is a winding up procedure and there is nothing I can do to take it from the court.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from this motion, realising the difficulty that people are continuing to face as a result of the failure of the Equitable, I am considering having a petition presented to the court expressing my concern about the delay and bringing to the attention of the court that there are people who are suffering great hardship as a result.  I do not know whether this petition will be successful in expediting matters but I feel that the relevant judge or judges must know that hardships are being incurred and I am sure there is no desire on the part of the judges to prolong these hardships. I have already told the liquidator that if he wants any help by way of regulation that I could make, I would be only too glad to do so.  I have been on to the liquidator &mdash; and wrongly, in my opinion &mdash; on a number of occasions with reference to a number of individual claims, asking if he could expedite the matters.  I say wrongly because I am not supposed to interfere with an officer of the court.  However, I can assure the House I am no less concerned in these matters than the Deputies who have spoken, and if there is a way of expediting the meeting of these claims, I shall certainly adopt it.  As a matter of fact, there are quite a number of claims before the court which are nearing the final stages.  I do not know really what delay is involved.  I have been trying to push them as fast as I can.</P>

While moving many of the amendments, I adverted to the fact that we were very concerned about the interference with the rights of the public and argued that they should have recourse in many cases to the protection of the courts.  It is also worth mentioning that one of the earliest Ministerial amendments was one seeking permission to bring the Act into operation at different times in different parts of the country.  The Minister, I think, felt it would be desirable, or even essential, that there should be available locally planners to ensure that the Act would be capable of implementation when brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe appealed to the Minister to ensure that if there was to be postponement so far as the country was concerned, the Act should be allowed to operate in Dublin at the earliest possible time.  When we came to the section dealing with regulations, we had other amendments down.  There were Ministerial and county manager regulations; I think amendment No. 46 dealt with Ministerial regulations.  Not everybody could agree with my point of view at the time that the Minister should bring in these regulations in draft form and secure approval from the House.  I was concerned to ensure that the rights of individuals would not be capriciously dealt with and at column 398, volume 203, of the Dáil Debates, I said:</P>
    <P>So far as amendment No. 46 is concerned, this is simply bringing into line the normal procedure the Minister proposes to adopt in regard to his regulations.  I believe this is something which would add to the respect everybody would have for this Bill.  If the planners of the future feel the orders they are going to make are reviewable by the Oireachtas, I believe their approach to planning will be sound and not in any way capricious.  This will entitle them <Col N="117" /> to the proper respect of everybody. The rights of even one individual may, therefore, be vindicated in this House by bringing the order under review here.</P>
    <P>When the Minister dealt with that amendment at column 403 of the same volume, he said:</P>
    <P>I submit it is sufficient and probably a much more practical approach, to allow the present subsection to stand so that the matters dealt with in any such regulations will stand as prescribed in such regulations unless they are annulled, rather than to have in the subsection a provision that Ministers should seek the actual approval in each case.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>If such were the position, in a matter of urgency particularly we would find the whole section completely valueless.  As I said earlier, the regulations will not change the law or expand it.  They will merely exercise a right enshrined in the law. If some Minister should step out of line, then the regulations he would have made would assuredly be annulled by this House and his work and the work of his advisers in that respect would go for nothing.  There is that assurance as a protection against the madness of the Minister. If it is wrong, the House will throw it out without doubt.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came to make the regulations following the passage of the Act, he brought the Act into operation over the whole country on the same day.  It turned out that he did not need the powers he had earlier sought from the House by amendment, in regard to introduction of the Act. He made other regulations under section 10 and section 89 but I am mainly concerned tonight with those made under section 89.  Some regulations deal with compensation, some with exemptions and some with the subject-matter of the order I am dealing with.  There was an explanatory memorandum issued with the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> One of the first items dealt with in the regulations now made by the Minister was in regard to the 1925 Local Government Act which had remained unamended since the time the first regulations were made.  Under the Act they have now been repealed and the new regulations take their place.  I want to point out that when the Minister made these regulations in S.I. No. 218, 1964, Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963 (Licensing) Regulations, 1964, he certainly availed of the full scope of section 89 and he extended the list to which licences would apply in future and it is now a long list.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill, we had said that one thing necessary would be that the public should regard as desirable control of undesirable development in either planning or development.  What has happened, I suggest, in these regulations is that the Minister has used them not to control &mdash;I should be very glad if he denies what I assert here &mdash; undesirable development, but to raise money.</P>
    <P>Originally the one thing which seemed to be licensed was a petrol pump.  A permit had to be obtained to place a petrol pump and the 1925 Act stipulated what the amount of the licence fee would be.  In a rural area it was one guinea; in urban districts of population not in excess of 3,000, it was two guineas; in urban districts with a population exceeding 3,000, it was three guineas; and in a county borough it was five guineas.  It would take a good deal of examination to find out what exactly was in the mind of the Minister when he framed these regulations governing the licence fee to be applied to petrol pumps in the future.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Schedule deals with petrol pumps and they are described as &ldquo;Appliances and structures for servicing vehicles&rdquo;.  There is (a), (b), (c) and (d): (a) covers a petrol pump oil pump, air pump or other appliance and the licence fee is £8: (b) movable pump or other appliance for dispensing any oil or oil derivative or other mixture thereof; (c) a delivery pipe or hose attached to a petrol pump, oil <Col N="119" /> pump, air pump, water tap or other similar appliance or structure which is erected in any permanent position and which is neither wholly nor partly on, under or over a public road; and (d) a petrol, oil or other storage tank (including any associated manhole, inlet, outlet or pipes for connection with a pump) and the licence fee is £4 for each 5,000 gallons capacity or part thereof.</P>
    <P>What exactly is expected of a person who has a petrol pump?  How much is he expected to pay?  We have parts of a pump.  A hose is part of a pump. It is no good having a pump standing on its own without a hose to carry the petrol to the car.  Is this doublebarrelled? There is not much good in having a petrol pump if one has not got a tank to supply the petrol to the pump.  If a man keeps, as he must keep nowadays, the two grades of petrol&mdash;premium and ordinary&mdash;what will he have to pay annually by way of licence fees for these pumps?  If I am not correct I shall be glad if the Minister will correct me, but if it is £8 for a pump, £8 for a hose and £4 for the tank&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why these little words were introduced.  In the original you had &ldquo;in, on, over or under&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Along&rdquo; has now been added. I should be interested to know what is meant by &ldquo;along a public road&rdquo;.  Why was that phrase put in?  I take it these words were put in for a specific reason and I suggest the specific reason was to catch people who had not been caught already and bring them in so that they would have to pay licence fees for things they enjoyed freely up to this.</P>
      <P>I shall be interested in hearing from the Minister what meaning is to be attached to the words &ldquo;or hose attached to a petrol pump&rdquo;.  If it means something other than what is commonly meant, I shall be interested to hear the Minister's explanation.</P>
      <P>Up to this motorists have enjoyed what has always been called &ldquo;free air&rdquo;.  The Minister now, apparently, intends that there will no longer be free air.  Someone will have to pay for it. Has the Minister considered what the effect may be?  If a garage proprietor decides he will not pay this £4 licence fee, will the motorist revert to the hand-pump or will he have to leave the road and drive inside the garage premises to have his tyres pumped? Why does a water tap fall to be licensed now?  Local authorities charge nobody for a water connection and I take it the garage man is, in the ordinary way, paying the local authority a fee already for the supply of water to his premises.  If he decides to supply water to the public to top up radiators, will he have to pay another fee for that?</P>
      <P>The only movable pump that I know is the appliance used to top up one's back axle or gear-box and the appliance used to supply a mixture of oil and petrol to motor cyclists and auto cyclists.  That is a movable pump.  Are these the kind of appliances which will carry a licence fee in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part II of the Schedule, the Minister brings in &ldquo;Other appliances and structures&rdquo;.  The first is &ldquo;a vending machine or other coin operated machine (not being a weighing machine).&rdquo;  I have seen children exerrit <Col N="121" /> cising the right of youngsters to deal in colour at the bubble gum machine on the side of the street, inserting their pennies and getting their bubble gum. It is not a weighing machine; it is a vending machine from which a sale may be made.  That is one example.</P>
    <P>We have another machine that is coming in in places, a machine from which at night a driver on the road may get coffee by inserting coins.  These machines are in evidence at docks and other places where sailors come off boats at night and may require a cup of coffee.  I might ask whether CIE will have to obtain licences for the chocolate-vending machines on their stations.</P>
    <P>Part II of the regulations deals with an appliance of any type not used for servicing vehicles.  One machine carries a licence of £8 and another lot carry a licence of £4 but along with them there are racks or shelves on which oils are displayed for sale.  Let me now go back to the garage owner who, having paid the fee for his petrol pump, now finds himself in the position that the case in which he displays oil is now also to be subject to a fee.  I want to know from the Minister if that is the case.  There are different types of oils on these racks and stands and I want to know if each one will have to be licensed and bear the appropriate fee.</P>
    <P>What will be the position in regard to the shop in any town or village, outside of which it is the custom in Ireland as on the continent, to put vegetables to show them off?  Will these have to be licensed and will they have to bear the appropriate fee mentioned here of £4?  The regulation is not content to stop at the words &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; or &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.  It goes on to deal with any advertisement on the business premises.  If any of these can be classed as an advertisement, it is caught.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the Schedule deals with advertisements containing an emblem, a symbol or a device on the public road.  What does that wide wording mean in this case?  It says &ldquo;symbol, emblem, model, or device which is on or partly on a public road&rdquo;.  If you take the definition of a public road as including the footway, it would seem to bring any type of <Col N="122" /> sign used at the present day, and they are many, particularly in towns, within the scope of the licensing regulations. There is the CIE sign indicating where a bus stops or signs which say that parcels may be sent from a particular place.  What about the Dartry Dye Works who have signs indicating receiving depots or the timber stands put on footways outside shops to say that you can get the morning paper of your choice, whether it be <i>Sceala Eireann, Irish Independent</i> or <i>Irish Times</i> at that particular shop?  Are these all to be licensed in the future?</P>
    <P>We have advertisement signs on our public roads.  Generally you find when approaching a garage, a sign which states that petrol of a particular kind is available 100 yards ahead.  Do these carry the licence fee of £4?  The regulations mention a hoarding, fence or scaffold.  Here I am at a loss to know what is meant by this wording. I can understand a hoarding, an advertising hoarding, but sometimes a hoarding is put up and left for some time around a dangerous building.  Are these to be subject to a licence fee?</P>
    <P>Then we have the question of a town or landscape map.  It has always been felt that one of the things which would be of interest to people visiting this country is a town or landscape map which would help them to know where they are.  I noticed that in Limerick recently they put up a town map and I have seen quite a few people looking at it.  It gives them the lay-out of the city and helps them to find the particular street they are looking for.  The Minister will tell me that this will not be subject to the licence fee.  I know that.  The local authorities may do as they like with regard to these matters. The corporate bodies may do what they like.  The Board of Works may do what they like and none of these will have to pay the licence fee but the man in the street will have to pay it.  If any private individual puts up a town or landscape map, he has had it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the weighing machine. These have become very popular in the country, perhaps because people have become more concerned with the problem of weight.  I wonder if everybody wishing to install one of these machines <Col N="123" /> will pause and conut his pennies to see if it is worth his while to pay the fee of £2 for it.  To start off, 480 people would have to put in their pennies before the man could hope to get anything from the machine.  I wonder if the Minister envisages that the weighing machines put up for public convenience, if not put up by the local authority, for weighing cattle or goods, will have to carry the licence fee while the one put up by the local authority will not have to carry it.</P>
    <P>Then we come to cables, pipes or wires.  I do not know why they fixed on a distance of half a mile, or any part thereof.  Part III of the regulations deals with &ldquo;other structures&rdquo;.  A person putting one up will have to pay £4 for the right to do so.  If we are to become nuclear-minded, will our shelters qualify for the £4 also?  A lamp post or any such fixed structure will be assessed at £2.  The erection of lamp posts to brighten the countryside is something that has been taking place in our rural areas.  Not only have they been of use to the people occupying the premises, but they have been of help to the general population of the area as well.  This, now, is to carry a fee of £2.</P>
    <P>In this very extended list, the Minister has introduced a thorough widening of the scope of the licensing regulations as they existed up to now.  Immediately, one is struck by the question of whether the Minister intends this as a control to planning.  I suggest that if the Minister were intent on controlling this type of development planning he might as easily have met the case with a 5s. fee as with an £8 fee.</P>
    <P>These are not the type of regulations anyone had expected.  I should like to hear from the Minister why licensing fees of this range and rate have now been brought into play.  Could it be that this is an attempt, even in a very small way, to meet the cost of planning?  During the progress of the Planning Act through the Oireachtas, the Minister was asked if he could give an estimate of the cost.  He said, and <Col N="124" /> we accepted it, that it would be a considerable task to make an estimate of the cost of planning or of how it would be met.  One of the questions I asked was whether he could give any help to the local authorities to implement the Act, or whether he could give them partial financial help.</P>
    <P>Is he giving them in this right to raise these sums, part of the cost?  I think the Minister having made these regulations, might have given an interpretation of them which would let the public know what they mean.  The Minister should at first have acquainted the public of his intent in these regulations. Such regulations should not be imposed without first giving the people of the country a full explanation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps all this is a bottle of smoke as far as the Minister is concerned. Perhaps my fears are groundless, but at least the tabling of the motion will get from the Minister an assurance that what I am alleging is not correct &mdash; that his intent was not to raise moneys by regulation but only to control undesirable development.  In this respect, it is noticeable in the explanatory memorandum issued with the regulations, that the Minister wrote in the phrase:</P>
    <P>No distinction is made between the rate of fee for the initial licence to erect (construct, place) and maintain an appliance or structure referred to in Parts I and II and the rate of fee for a licence to maintain an existing appliance or structure.</P>
    <P>There were structures that existed before the appointed date, structures that were there over a long number of years, which would seem to have been excluded when this set of regulations was being made &mdash; that the rate of licence to maintain them was to be no more or no less than in respect of new structures.</P>
    <P>That seems to give purpose to what I have to say &mdash; that this set of regulations is carefully framed, deliberately thought up; that there is nothing haphazard about it and that the Minister, when he made the regulations, knew full well what they were intended to do.  I suggest that what the Minister <Col N="125" /> has done is to use his power by regulation unduly to encroach on the rights of the people and on the privileges they have had up to this and, under the guise of operating the Town Planning Act, to do something which in the long run will do a lot to minimise the respect people have for the Act.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give the lie to what I say.  I assure him I shall not take offence if he gets up and tells me that my fears are groundless, that he does not intend to raise these sums of money, that the public can enjoy the same rights and privileges as heretofore.  If the Minister tries to justify the imposition of this little budget, to be collected by the local authorities by way of fees, part of which are to be paid into the Road Fund and part into the county fund, then I shall tell him that is not the way to win respect for the Town Planning Act.  I shall suggest to the Minister that he has gone really mad and that it is time the House had an opportunity of passing judgment on his madness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I do not wish to go over any of the arguments or points so ably and capably made by Deputy Jones but I should like to bring to the notice of the House the manner in which we are tying up progress in red tape.  I readily concede that planning is essential these days, that it is more than essential, but what I object to is the regulations being made under our Town Planning Acts.  If one wishes to erect a petrol pump and a petrol pump is essential to the public generally, one must first of all provide a site plan, a location plan and public notice must be inserted in the newspapers of intent so to erect a petrol pump.  The person concerned must forward that notice, together with two copies of the plan, to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority will, in due course, inspect the site and may or may not grant permission to build.  If they refuse, then the right of appeal to the Minister will lie against such refusal. That takes a considerable amount of <Col N="126" /> time.  Supposing one should get the ear of the Minister or his advisers and permission is given to erect such a pump, then the regulations set out by the Minister apply.  First, if the containing tank is along a roadway, a fee is payable.  This word &ldquo;along&rdquo; worries me a lot.  I particularly remember the Fisheries Act, where the legislators wrote in &ldquo;in or on the banks of a river&rdquo;.  Courts have construed that in many cases as being within half a mile of a bank of a river.  Now we have these words &ldquo;along the public road&rdquo;.  I wonder how will they be construed?  I do not know what it means or what interpretation will be given to it.  The Minister should clarify the position at this stage.</P>
    <P>Having got permission, if one sinks his tank along the public road a licence fee must be paid of £8, not an initial fee but an annual fee of £8.  The pump is then erected some distance away from the tank and a further fee must be paid for the pump.  But if one tried to dodge the issue and sank the tank in a place which could not be described as along the road, the Minister catches you again by imposing a licence duty on the hose pipe from the pump to the vehicle which is being loaded up.  That is my interpretation of it anyway.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (b) of section 3 says: &ldquo;a delivery pipe or hose attached to a petrol pump&rdquo; shall be licensed &ldquo;which is erected in a permanent position and which is neither wholly nor partly on, under or over a public road.&rdquo;  I wonder why the Minister has not written in here &ldquo;or along a public road&rdquo;?  It might have clarified the position.  I think they have deliberately framed it in that manner to catch the person who has a petrol pump not in, on, or along the public road but who may use a hose for the purpose of supplying his customers.</P>
    <P>Again, subparagraph (e) refers to a lamp-post or lamp in a fixed position. Does that apply to ESB poles?  If it does, it is a very serious matter because the ESB will be only too glad to practise their economy and erect as few as they possibly can.  Alternatively, does it apply to the local authority? <Col N="127" /> Will they have to pay a licence fee to the Road Fund?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I am corrected on that.  Very often a shopkeeper, to facilitate his customers, will erect a lamp outside his premises.  To comply with public liability insurance, it is very often essential for him to erect such a lamp; otherwise, he would not get cover.  If he erects such a lamp, he must pay a licence fee for it, and not only for one year but as an annual charge.  Really, that is a very bad regulation.  It cuts across public policy in that we are all anxious to see the public protected by insurance, and insurance companies will possibly refuse to accept a liability such as this unless there is a proper light outside the premises.</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (f) refers to:</P>
      <P>a bridge, arch, tunnel, passage or other similar structure which is used or intended for use other than by the public, and which is constructed on or after the appointed day.</P>
      <P>It is a common thing now to see bus stops with shelters erected over them. I wonder will a licence be necessary in respect of these bus stops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A local body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would scarcely be a local authority but if I am told that is so, I am glad to hear it.  It would be ridiculous if a licence were necessary for such shelters.  We are told that &ldquo;a cellar or other underground structure constructed on or after the appointed day&rdquo; will require a licence fee.  It is common for coal chutes to be erected on footpaths outside premises adjoining the public roadway.  They are most useful.  Coal may be shot from a public vehicle into the cellars of a dwellinghouse or into factories.  An annual licence would be payable in respect of such chutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Schedule, I notice that a licence is payable on a &ldquo;hoarding, fence or scaffold&rdquo;.  In other words, if one wishes to repair one's house <Col N="128" /> along a public road and it is essential that a scaffold be erected for the purpose of repairing the house or doing renovations thereto, a licence duty of £4 is payable.  Again, if I am wrong in that, I would be very glad.  That is my interpretation of it.  Deliberately it sets out &ldquo;hoarding, fence or scaffold&rdquo;. I wonder what will happen to the farmer who wishes to erect a fence along a public highway <i>in lieu</i> of an existing sod fence.  Say he wishes to erect an up-to-date fence, does he have to pay an annual fee of £4?  If he does, it is going to hit the rural community very hard indeed.  That is my interpretation of the regulations.  I sincerely hope I am wrong again.  If I am wrong, the Minister should clarify the position now.</P>
    <P>I know of many cases where district justices have recommended to farmers that they should erect proper fences. Actually, the Minister himself has in many cases recommended that hedges should be cut down and proper fences erected to enable the public passing along the highway to have a view of scenery.  If the recommendations of the Minister and of the district justices are accepted and proper fences erected, an annual licence duty is payable on them.  It does not state here the length of fence one may erect or how many fields the licence duty will cover.  If there is a gateway or laneway and a fence is erected on the other side, again we will find ourselves in the same position.  I am certain the Minister did not mean any such thing in his regulations but he will have to clarify them. Otherwise, the agricultural and rural community will be hit very severely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones was very mild when he said he thought this was a petty budget.  It is not.  It is a very serious budget, in my opinion.  A half million pounds from petrol pumps alone is a considerable amount and, as the Minister has stated on many occasions, the numbers of vehicles on our roads will increase and, as they increase, facilities for them by way of petrol pumps, garages and other amenities will become necessary and, as they are provided, additional tax is being put on motorists.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to realise <Col N="129" /> that the garageman, the shopkeeper or any other person who is giving a public service and who has to pay a licence duty for it will not bear the burden on his own back; he will pass it on to the consuming public and this is another blister on the back of the public.</P>
    <P>The local authority will become a tax collector in so far as this is concerned. At the moment their duties are onerous enough.  Only the other day we got an estimate in Donegal of the rates for the current year of £3 15s. 1d. in the £. Here we have this additional blister being imposed on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I did not think for one moment when the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, was going through this House that the regulations which would be made under that Act would be used for the purpose of imposing taxes such as these on the public.  I would appeal to the Minister to clarify the regulations before having them enforced.  Deputy Jones has brought to his notice sufficient points which need clarification and until that is done I would suggest to the Minister that the regulations should be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the 1963 Bill was being debated in this House, many of us had misgivings about how it would be applied when it became law.  Again and again, the Minister for Local Government assured us that it was simply a Bill to tidy up, to prevent certain abuses and to regularise the running of the various local authorities so that objectionable buildings, hoardings and so on, could not be erected. None of us imagined for a moment that it would turn out to be the terrible instrument of torture which, apparently, many local authorities think it is at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is contained in the Minister's Order here is, indeed, something which in my opinion should have been fully explained when the Bill was going through.  It should have been made quite clear to the House that it was the intention of the Government on the passing of the Bill to impose extra taxation in the guise of licence fees for all these things.  The more one looks at the Order the more one realises that there is an awful lot of matter here <Col N="130" /> which by no stretch of the imagination could anybody have thought would be there by Order when the Bill was going through the House.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience of local authority administration that already in the proposed planning which the local authorities are working on the most extraordinary interpretations that could be dreamt of are being put on various sections of the Act.  Suggestions are being made that this, that and the other thing must be done.  In fact, the liberty of the individual to do even simple acts is being made a subject for licensing.  Small wonder that that attitude is being adopted when one looks at the Statutory Instrument bearing the signature of the Minister for Local Government which has been produced and which Deputy Jones now suggests should be annulled.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough for the Minister to explain that certain sections of this instrument are being misinterpreted by Deputies but the fact that it is open to such misinterpretation should be a warning to him that he should not allow it to go out in this form.</P>
    <P>The most amazing interpretation that I have heard is that which Deputy O'Donnell has just given and which any of us could put on the Act.  Deputy O'Donnell asks is it true that a farmer can be asked to pay a licence if he is going to erect a fence.  If I had not the Statutory Instrument before me, I would believe that such a suggestion was a figment of the Deputy's imagination. The Schedule to the Statutory Instrument definitely includes a hoarding, fence or scaffold.  They will be licensed at a cost of £4 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that those things will not happen but I want to tell him that already they are happening. I know &mdash; and the Minister is probably as well aware of it as I am&mdash; that his Department are holding up schemes because of the fact that an interpretation is being given to the Act that this plan which must take place within three years of the passing of the Act must be presented and everything must fit into it.  When we find local authority officials interpreting the Act in that way and the Minister's own <Col N="131" /> officials agreeing with them that that is the correct interpretation, is it any wonder that Deputies should be alarmed when they find something like this being published with the object of adding to the confusion and adding to the cost which the ordinary man must bear?</P>
    <P>Take the small man who is erecting a petrol pump or who has had a petrol pump over a number of years. He does not own the pump.  In many cases he does not own the building outside which the pump is erected.  While he has been paying a small licence fee and has not been objecting to it, it is now proposed to charge him in respect of the petrol pump an annual fee of £8.  I am sure the Minister, before he became Minister, often ran short of petrol, as many of us do, in a country district, and was very glad to find a little petrol pump in an out of the way place, where they sold perhaps only nine or ten gallons a week but where there was a shop, perhaps, beside the pump.  All such small petrol pumps will disappear if the Minister insists on collecting £8 a year from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>He will collect more if the tank is included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He will collect more in respect of a tank.  He will collect £8 in respect of the pump and if the unfortunate man is foolish enough to have the tank far enough away that it has to be connected by hose to the petrol pump, he will pay £4 in respect of the hose and £4 in respect of the storage tank.  Perhaps I am blaming the Minister in the wrong but I am assuming that he read the Statutory Instrument before he signed it and knew everything that was in it.  It is quite clear that this particular document was intended to squeeze the last ounce that possibly can be got out of the small people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make quite clear that if I thought the big petrol companies or people who were well-to-do and able to afford it would be taxed and made pay extra for facilities I would not be objecting to it, but the unfortunate thing is that, again and again, we find <Col N="132" /> the Government introducing legislation which hits the small man.  This is another example of that type of legislation.</P>
    <P>It was not hurried legislation.  The Bill was long enough before the House.  I thought every possible angle had been brought out when the Bill was going through the House.  Despite that, we find that this whole new idea has been cooked up as soon as the Bill was law and we are now asked to let it go through without offering any resistance to it.</P>
    <P>Again, the idea seems to be that, not alone should the local authority be able to collect from the person who has any type of structure on the public road or street, but they are empowered to collect, as Deputy P. O'Donnell so rightly said, their licence for the &ldquo;erection, construction, placing and maintaining of, under, over, or along the public road&rdquo;.  If that is not out to catch every possible angle, I do not know what is intended.  In this city alone, there are a number of old Georgian houses about which we heard so much and in practically every one of them are cellars, coal cellars, to which there is an entrance for coal from the street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not come into it.  It is only those constructed after a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It says here &ldquo;maintained&rdquo;. I was under the impression that anything that was already there was exempt but this Statutory Instrument states that it applies to the erection or maintenance of those things and if it does, then it applies to cellars, etc., already in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was very little reason for the action which has been taken by the Minister in this case.  I honestly believe he could have introduced the Act as it was intended to be introduced when it came to this House, so that the operation of it could be made clear to everybody.  Already there has been a considerable amount of confusion over the operation of the Act.  Plans for housing schemes which were submitted to the Minister's Department were referred back to the local authority <Col N="133" /> to find out how they fitted into the new plan, which is not in existence and which the Minister's officials and he himself must know is not in existence. If they are prepared to do that, there can be an interpretation of everything, including the sections of this Statutory Instrument, which will turn out to be an additional impost on the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to tie up the ordinary person as attempts are being made to tie him up under this Act.  The Act as passed was rigid enough and it should be left at that.  To try to introduce refinements which mean that, as one of my colleagues recently said, very soon the ordinary man cannot turn in his bed without asking permission from the local authority, is going too far.  That seems to be the situation and the Minister should have another look at this before he tries to enforce it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity and indeed the urgent necessity for the discussion in which we are engaged here tonight underlines something to which I have frequently adverted in this House, that is, the danger in Acts of this sort of giving the Minister power to make regulations.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why, when this Act was passing through the House, everything that is in these regulations could not have been discussed and incorporated by way of section or subsection, possibly as a result of a media between the Minister and those members who opposed the provisions. That would have obviated our taking a second bite of the cherry as we have to take tonight.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that this cannot be amended.  If these regulations go through the House without being annulled, they are law and there is no use in any of us asking the Minister to clarify this or that and there is no good in any of us asking the Minister to give an assurance on this or on that.  Irrespective of what the Minister says here to-night, this will be the law, if it is not annulled, and any planning authority can impose its own interpretation of these regulations on any person within its jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> We have heard various interpretations of these regulations here tonight and I am quite certain various interpretations of these regulations will be attached to them by various planning authorities throughout the country. Indeed, if they have to go to court various district justices and judges will probably put various interpretations on them, too.  If the Minister finds it necessary to clarify one iota of what is contained in these regulations, he will find it necessary to agree to Deputy Jones's proposal, that these regulations be annulled, because if the Minister is in doubt about the meaning of the regulations, then, obviously, these are not regulations which should pass the House and be given the force of law.  This sort of thing has happened, despite the most intelligent and painstaking approach to this matter by Deputy Jones and other members of the Fine Gael Party, and this House now finds itself in the position that several interpretations of this document are being put before it and one interpretation involves more expense than another.  It means no doubt that if this document gets the force of law, concealed taxation, but nevertheless taxation, will be imposed on every garage owner and probably every farmer.  I agree with the interpretation which Deputy P. O'Donnell put on this in regard to fencing, wires and such other things.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cellars or underground structures refered to by Deputy Tully, I do not agree with his interpretation. However, surely the Minister is aware that if anybody constructs a cellar or underground structure, the Commissioner of Valuation will be after him and will put extra rates on it. Not content with that, the Minister for Local Government comes along and says to the local authority in relation to the levying of a rate for this underground structure or cellar: &ldquo;You will get more because this citizen will have to pay an extra £2.&rdquo; Then there will be no doubt about the interpretation of that section and no doubt about its inequity.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to agree to the proposal by Deputy Jones. The Minister must see the dangers inherent in allowing this document to be <Col N="135" /> interpreted by each solicitor or legal adviser to different councils.  There is bound to be immense confusion and a great deal of litigation, causing much expense.  The Minister will realise that it was never intended to give him the powers which he got by sections 10 and 89.  He must realise that it was never intended to give him the weapon by which he could make another cruel assault upon the pockets of an already overtaxed section of the community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in the mind of anybody sitting on this side of the House in regard to the effect of this provision, and the Deputies sitting behind the Minister will have to explain to their constituents the situation which will arise.  If this document is given the force of law, then not £500,000 but something closer to £1 million will be extracted from the pockets of the population by means of what can almost be described as a subterfuge.  There is no doubt that the House, even Deputies on the opposite side, never intended to give the Minister the power which he has taken&mdash; quite legally&mdash;to extract these huge amounts from the pockets of the community.</P>

      <P>Apart from petrol pumps, which are specifically mentioned in these regulations, it appears other items not related to petrol stations will also be subject to tax. Part I relates to appliances and structures for the servicing of vehicles.  It seems that as a garage proprietor, a man will be liable to pay £8 for each petrol pump, also £8 for each oil pump, also £8 for an air pump, and also £8 each for every other appliance.  Further, in regard to a movable pump, he will be liable for £4 and also for £4 each in respect of other appliances for dispensing services to vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will similarly be liable for £4 in respect of a pipe or hose connected with a petrol pump, a hose or pipe connected with an oil pump, a hose or pipe connected with an air pump, a hose or pipe connected with a water tap and to £4 each for other permanent appliances <Col N="136" /> or structures.  He will also apparently be liable to £4 in respect of a petrol tank, £4 in respect of a storage tank, £4 in respect of an oil tank and £4 for each 5,000 gallon capacity.  If I am correct in that interpretation, it means that a garage proprietor who has one of each of the items specified in Part I for the service of vehicles and if the amount specified is payable in respect of each item, will be required to pay £72.  If he has two pumps and two hoses, etc., apparently he will pay double that amount.</P>
    <P>Apparently, a great part of these regulations relates to items involved in servicing vehicles; it does not actually say motor vehicles.  It refers to other appliances and structures in Part II, other than those used for the servicing of vehicles.  In respect of a vending machine, the proprietor will be liable for £8; for a coin operated machine other than a weighing machine, he will also be liable for £8.  Under (b) in respect of appliances not used for the servicing of vehicles, he will be liable for £4 each.  He will further be liable under section (c) of Part II for £4 each if he has a case, a rack, a shelf or other appliance or structure for the purpose of displaying articles for the purpose of advertising goods in or in connection with any adjacent business premises. In addition, he will be liable for £4 each for symbols, with which we have become so familiar in relation to various brands of oil and petrol, emblems and models.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify whether in fact the swinging sign permanently attached to a private dwelling house, apart from business premises, will be liable for this licensing fee.</P>
    <P>We also have a suggestion here that £4 each should be paid for each hoarding, fence or scaffold, £2 each for a town or landscape map and £2 for a weighing machine and finally £2 per half-mile length, or part thereof, of a cable, wire or pipeline.  Obviously this is a very comprehensive arrangement to include every possible device used in connection with the provision of a service or the running of a business.</P>
    <P>As has been stated, it is a very serious matter that these liabilities should <Col N="137" /> be imposed by a Minister's Order instead of by legislation.  It would have been fairer if these matters had been discussed and amendments made before the 1963 Planning Act went through the House. It was never contemplated, although it was minutely studied at the time, that a Statutory Instrument in the form of a Ministerial Order would be brought in to make liable in a very comprehensive way the business people who in the normal way put up various signs and use various devices to provide a proper service.  The Minister should withdraw these regulations now that their implications have been made clear to him.</P>
    <P>Under Part III, those who erect other structures will be liable for £4 in each case if they erect what is described as a bridge, arch, tunnel, passage or other similar structure for use other than by the public.  Those who construct a cellar or underground structure will be liable for a fee of £4 and finally those who provide a lamp post or lamp in a fixed position will be subject to £2 each.  Such lamps are often used by business people to assist in advertising their commodities and to give a measure of safety to members of the public who avail of their services.</P>
    <P>The Minister should withdraw these regulations.  Even if he brought in amending legislation, there would be an opportunity of discussing suitable amendments.  Apart from those engaged in providing services for vehicles, it seems many other traders will be involved.  A very rough estimate seems to indicate that £2 million or £3 million could easily be collected if they were strictly applied.  No doubt if the power is there, it will be availed of by various local authorities.  They will be obliged to implement them.  Those who are liable to pay these licence fees will find they are involved to the tune of a couple of millions.  That will prove a heavy imposition on the public who will be obliged to pay in the long run in the price structure for the cost of these licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues in this matter, mainly on principle, the principle that this is taxation by regulation.  If members of <Col N="138" /> Dáil Éireann were fully alive to their parliamentary duties, we should have a full attendance to-night on a matter of such important principle.  The Minister is taking unto himself power to sign a document which will have the effect of raising a very substantial amount of money in taxation.  I am indebted to my colleague, Deputy Jones, for his untiring research and for his great memory.  I sat here during the discussion on the Planning Bill and I certainly do not remember the detail as Deputy Jones does.  I compliment both the Minister and Deputy Jones on the enormous amount of work and the great patience they exercised in regard to that Bill.  I draw the Minister's attention to the very good spirit that prevailed between him and Deputy Jones.  At that time the Minister said that &ldquo;if some Minister should step out of line, then the regulations he would have made would assuredly be annulled by this House.&rdquo;  I refer to column 403 of the Official Report of 29 May, 1963.  He added that that was a protection against the madness of a Minister: &ldquo;If it is wrong, the House will throw it out without a doubt&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect, the House is not judging whether it is wrong or right. This will be an imposition on the proprietors of service stations.  Surely they deserve more from the Parliament of the country than to have this imposition laid on them?  Recently they were made the scapegoats by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; he prevented them from raising the price of petrol.  Now they are to have this extra tax put on their petrol pumps and signs.  These men give 90 and 100 hours service in the week as against the 40-hour week elsewhere. They are at our beck and call the whole year round.  One can go into an isolated country district and if short of petrol, through one's own carelessness, one can knock up the unfortunate man in the petrol station at any hour of the night and he will oblige.  As often as not, he makes one feel slightly ashamed.  The Minister should remember the service these people give and he should withdraw this proposal. The majority of these stations have been put up by private individuals. <Col N="139" /> some with the help of loans from the oil companies.  This tax will fall on them now.  They have enough to do to pay back the large loans.  They have to work very hard and it is most unfair that this tax should be imposed on them.</P>
    <P>There is then the matter of inn signs. These are historical.  One can read in Sean O'Casey about the &ldquo;Cat and Cage&rdquo;.  I suppose that man will be stuck now because he has the &ldquo;Cat and Cage&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;Red Cow&rdquo; in Clondalkin will have to pay tax.  Many inns will be affected.</P>
    <P>Maps are not put up in areas only by local authorities.  Private individuals and societies put up maps in historical places.  I have in mind the map in New Ross which was put up by such a society, and which gives an excellent idea of that whole battle.  It is extraordinary that a Minister in an Irish Parliament should make a regulation taxing a map that commemorates a great historical event.  I believe that, now that these things have been brought to the Minister's attention, he will not go on with this proposal.</P>
    <P>Many farmers and farm labourers have houses adjacent to the public road, with an ordinary stone-faced fence, or a sod fence, which may not be very beautiful.  A great many people are improving their cottages and houses, taking down these fences and putting up railings, or stone or brick fences.  I am amazed to discover that a man who does that will have to pay a tax of £4 a year.  A case, or a rack, or a shelf, or an appliance, or a structure for displaying articles for the purpose of advertisement or sale in or in connection with an adjacent business premises will carry a tax of £4 per year.  The Minister should really take that out.  The greengrocers all over the country were ahead of the supermarkets in displaying vegetables in baskets.  They will now have to pay £4 a year tax.</P>
    <P>This is bureaucracy gone mad.  This did not emanate from this House and that makes it infinitely more dangerous. It is bad enough for the Minister for Finance to bring in new taxation <Col N="140" /> in his Budget, but that is right and proper according to the Constitution. He is entitled to introduce taxation. This is a matter of a Minister raising taxation by regulations.  I do not know what the figure will be.  It could be £1½ millions between all the signs, and posters, and fences, and petrol pumps, and advertisements, and weighing machines and vending machines.  God knows where it will end.</P>
    <P>I note that where a man has a bridge, arch, tunnel, passage or other similar structure for use other than by the public, he will pay a tax of £4 per year.  That is ridiculous.  If a person buys an adjoining premises across a narrow lane, especially in the milling industry, he will build a passageway for goods which will not interfere with anybody else.  Now we find that such a person has to pay a tax for that.  We also have &ldquo;a lamp post or a lamp in a fixed position&rdquo;.  We should encourage people to put lamps on our public streets.  There are a number of villages in Ireland that would not be well lighted except for the people who own service stations.  Now that we are to put a tax on these lights, many of them will cut down to one light.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell, who is a lawyer, and, I believe, a good one, was not able to understand this matter of &ldquo;along a road&rdquo;.  If these regulations go out as law from this House, people like Deputy P. O'Donnell are going to make a lot of money out of them because every garage man in the country will be running into court to find out if he is along the road or on the road.  The regulations say &ldquo;in, on, over, under or along.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;along&rdquo; was only put in this particular one so there must be an extra special trap in it.  I hope the Minister will take these regulations back to his office and reconsider them.  I am sure many people in his own Party will agree with me in this.</P>
    <P>Part II refers to &ldquo;Other appliances and structures,&rdquo; and relates to &ldquo;vending machine or other coin operated machine (not being a weighing machine),&rdquo; and the tax is £8.  There will be no more bubble gum in the <Col N="141" /> service stations when the man there has to pay £8 licence fee for the machine.  The simple people down the country like to try the bubble gum machine and there are quite a number of them about the country.  These people are now stuck for £8.  I thought the weighing machine was exempt but I find that the tax on these is £2 a year.  As Deputy Jones said, 480 people will have to weigh in before the man gets a penny from the machine.  I know that as we are all over 21 here, we should be weighing in fairly often but the Minister is making sure that we will not do so because all these machines will be taken away and hidden.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it would be Ministerial madness to bring in regulations like these.  He said that in 1962 and in doing so he anticipated his officials.  This action by the Minister is taxation by regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only describe this as a disgraceful form of taxation which is being inflicted on the people. It is a retrograde form of taxation.  It has been disgraceful to see the benches behind the Minister occupied by only four members of the Fianna Fáil Party, two of whom have been asleep almost all the time.  That shows the interest they have in the people of this country.  They are sent here to represent the people, but, from what the people are saying, they know they are being poorly represented.  It shows their callous indifference to this imposition on people already burdened by rates.</P>
      <P>It is a retrograde step that our streets, which have been brightened up by lights over shops and business premises, will have to go back to the wartime blackouts.  The Minister is imposing either a payout or a blackout on the people.  At that rate all we will be able to do is to dream of a white Christmas.  Under the regulations, water taps erected for the convenience of people are mixed up with petrol pumps and there is to be a tax on them. People are already overburdened by rates because of increased valuations and this is an additional disgraceful form of new taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> According to the regulations, people who provide an air hose will be taxed. It is a disgrace that they should be taxed and they will disappear because they are no addition to any garage owner as they are.  Any appliance or structure &ldquo;displaying articles for the purpose of advertisement or sale in or connected with any adjoining business premises&rdquo; comes under the regulations. Salthill in County Galway, which is now fairly well lighted up by these structures and appliances, is to be heavily hit by increased taxation. Salthill would be a dismal place if these lights were put out so that the Minister could not collect his pound of flesh.  These people are already paying increased taxation by way of increased valuation.</P>
    <P>The regulations speak of &ldquo;a lamp post or lamp in a fixed position&rdquo;.  In what other position could it be?  They refer to &ldquo;a bridge, arch, tunnel, passage or other similar structure for public use and which is constructed on or after the appointed day&rdquo;.  They include &ldquo;a cellar or other underground structure&rdquo; and say &ldquo;constructed on&rdquo;. Of course it is constructed on.  Any cellar we have is constructed on the premises.</P>
    <P>The regulations deal with coin operated machines.  Would they include the one-armed bandits in O'Connell Street?  Advertisements are dealt with.  I submit that a lot of these play their part in lighting up our towns, thus reducing the cost of public lighting.  The Minister should have second thoughts and realise that, after Mid-Cork at any rate, he will be up against it when he tries to impose these regulations.  Will he tell us what is meant by &ldquo;hoarding, fence or scaffold&rdquo;?  Will any temporary scaffold erected by a contractor be included? What about CIE who seem to have a monopoly of street advertising through their bus services?  Do the taxpayers not have to foot that bill?  I suggest there is something wrong in our State when such anomalies are allowed to exist.  I hope the Minister will make it clear what these regulations mean and that he will have second thoughts.</P>

      <P>There has been so much misunderstanding and misrepresentation of what is contained in these regulations that it is really impossible, short of devoting a day to it or writing a book, to correct all that has been said here tonight.  I shall start off by saying that if anything is repeated often enough, particularly by those who feel they have some reason to believe it, the point can be reached where they will believe anything.</P>
      <P>All this began on 21st November last when one of our daily national newspapers published their version of what they believed these regulations contain.  I have no record that this national newspaper or anybody associated with it went to any trouble, through my Department at any rate, to make any inquiries.  They proceeded, long after the issue of the regulations, to write about them in a manner completely and absolutely unrelated to the realities of what is contained in them.  They began by discussing the revenue, the money to be taken from the people in licensing fees.</P>
      <P>Here we found people talking in hundreds of thousands of pounds. Although he did not contribute to the debate, Deputy A.  Barry corrected that and said it would be half a million pounds, and the speaker then on his feet amended his £100,000 to half a million pounds.  Then we had another Opposition Deputy increasing the figure to £1 million.</P>

At any rate, we had this picture of £20,000 being written up to £1½ million.  Of that £20,000, £18,000 will go to the Road Fund and £2,000 to the various planning authorities which will about meet the administration costs of the licensing procedure.</P>
      <P>We come to the various items which tonight became so involved and so multiplied that they produced the exaggerated figures I have mentioned. I find there is, without doubt, a great deal of genuine misunderstanding as well as misleading information in the minds of people who wish to mislead. We have had the plaint that all these things should have been done in the Act so that there would be no need to introduce them later.  Quite an eminent member of the legal profession said that, but I shall not comment on the nonsense such an argument makes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If such had been the case any changes we might have to make now or in the future could be made only by amendment of the Act.  The facility to make regulations is well recognised as enabling us to make changes as circumstances demand or as circumstances change.  We had here tonight Opposition talk in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;along&rdquo;.  Great play was made by a few quite well-known solicitors <Col N="145" /> on the Opposition benches on this point.  They said this had been slipped into the regulations, that it was something that should have been discussed when the Bill was going through the Oireachtas.  All I have to say is that the word was already there, that it was part of the document discussed here as a Bill which ultimately became law.</P>
    <P>If the word &ldquo;along&rdquo; is now taken exception to, it does not prove that if we had discussed everything then, everything would now be all right because the word &ldquo;along&rdquo; was discussed in the Dáil.  They try to make us believe it has emerged only now and that they do not understand it.  If they do not understand it now, they did not understand it then, and if they did not understand it then, I am surprised it was allowed to go through.</P>
    <P>What we have to keep in mind is that these regulations and the fees prescribed under them are in respect of the use or obstruction of the public thoroughfare or footpath, which does not in fact belong to the person carrying on a commercial business on these public ways which should be reserved for the ordinary comings and goings of the public.  This is what we must bear in mind when this picture is presented of people being charged licence fees for doing something on their own property. That is why we have this realistic estimate of £20,000 of what the fees will be under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The figures of £½ million, £1 million and £1½ million are probably conjured up by Deputies who think that every pump and every appliance mentioned in these regulations, regardless of where they are situated, will be charged the full licensing fee.  Only a relatively small number will come under the licensing code at all.  They will be those appliances which are in fact usurping public space, access for pedestrians or vehicles on the footpath or roadway.  In order to control this matter of interference, there is no reason why these people should not pay something.</P>
    <P>This is public, not private, property. This is property for which the people in question have paid nothing.  It is the same as if I asked Deputy Jones if I could put a petrol pump in a field <Col N="146" /> he has along the public road.  He says: &ldquo;Certainly, but you have to pay me £8, £10 or £20 per year.&rdquo;  Would I not look a right ninny if I came in here and complained that Deputy Jones was doing me down because he asked for £20 a year to use his property to make money for me?  Yet when we talk about making a charge for the use of the public footpath or roadway, we are accused of driving people out of business.  Without these regulations, there would be no legal way for these people to operate on the footpath or roadway, to dig up the road and put down a tank or operate petrol pumps on the roadside.</P>
    <P>Not all of them are being charged for the first time.  Admittedly, the figures given here are higher than those for comparable facilities in the past.  But if we go back to the charges made when the 1925 Act was passed, under which the previous regulations were made, we find that even the smallest charges then imposed, in real values of to-day, based either on the Government's calculation or the Opposition's calculation of the depreciation of money, when compared with the figures now proposed show that the latter are not so far out of line as would seem to appear.  We must also consider that the number of cars and the through-put of petrol and so on is increasing enormously.  Therefore, the fees are not so unrealistic.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear as far as advertisements are concerned that, unless they are supported by some stanchion or other fixture that is itself on the footpath or roadway, even though it overhangs the footpath or roadway, that sign is not subject to the licence fee calculated here by some Deputies.  Then there is the question of the hose attached to a pump.  Where the pump itself is charged for, the hose normally used for filling a vehicle is not subject to any additional licence of £4 or anything else.  The hose mentioned here is anticipated to be the swinging-arm type of hose which comes from a pump situated on the private property of the owner.  There is no licence in respect of this pump but there is a charge of £4 in respect of the <Col N="147" /> swinging-arm and hose because, obviously, the servicing takes place on the public thoroughfare.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the tank.  If the tank encroaches on any part of the public footpath or roadway, or both, or if any part of it is underneath that roadway or footpath, the tank is subject to a licence fee.  If it is not under that roadway or footpath but wholly within the private property, no licence fee is chargeable.  It is only in the case of the tank under the roadway or footpath and the pump on the kerbside or the swinging-arm utilised for servicing vehicles on the roadway that more than one licence fee arises. If the tank is underneath the roadway and the pump on the kerbside, the fee would be £8 for the pump and £4 for the tank.  If the tank were under the road and the pump off it, but a swinging-arm was necessary to supply vehicles on the road, the tank would be subject to the fee but the pump would not be subject to the fee.  However, the swinging-arm would also be subject to the licence fee.</P>
    <P>Those are a few of the variations that seem to have caused some confusion. It is not right to lump them together and say that in every case, irrespective of where the appliance is situated, a fee will be charged.  The case was mentioned of the tank in private property and the pump on public property.  In case anybody adds this up as well, the feeder pipe from the tank on the private property to the pump on the public property is not chargeable.  In fact, it is excluded by certain words in these regulations. Likewise, there is the question of the cable brought underground from the adjoining premises to supply power to the pump at the edge of the footpath. Again, that cable to bring the power to the pump from the private establishment would not be subject to a licence fee, as is anticipated by some Deputies.  These are a couple of matters which could be construed, readily and genuinely, as possibly coming within the terms of the Statutory Instrument.</P>
    <P>There is also certain confusion in <Col N="148" /> regard to a cellar or other underground structure constructed on or after the appointed day.  This is on the very same principle as I have already indicated. If the cellar is constructed after the appointed day under a public roadway or footpath, this roadway is property that does not belong to the developer and I do not see why, not only should there be a charge for it but, to have it there to facilitate a business or otherwise, there should not be some licence in order that this type of structure can be controlled.  In the case of structures constructed on or after the appointed day, I do not think anybody can have or will have any particular gripe because a person who undertakes that type of structure will have some particularly good reason for it and the question of a fee or otherwise will not deter him.</P>
    <P>The question of vending machines has been raised and of weighing machines being left out of their particular place and being brought in at another point.  It is true that there is a continuous growth of these machines, not only in number but in variety of service to the public, and the matter could come to a point where people in small businesses of various kinds could have their business usurped as a result of the indiscriminate use of these machines adjacent to their premises and out of which they were getting nothing.  The person with facilities for the sale of various things in a small shop or little business has these facilities within his own property. It would be unfair that, without let or hindrance, all types of vending machines, big or small, might be installed on a public footpath or roadway towards the cost of which the owner of the vending machine had contributed no more than any of his neighbours.  There is that aspect of it. At the same time, it is possible that small vending machines which have been instanced here&mdash;especially the bubble gum machine and that type of small fixture which is usually not taking up any ground space at all but is very often a fixture on the wall of a building and does not protrude more than five or six inches, probably could be exempted.</P>

      <P>In so far as those which stand out are concerned, that is a matter that I am still rather perturbed about because, taking the weighing machines and the type of stand that is on the footpath, if the footpath is public property which was constructed and is maintained for the convenience of pedestrians, there is very great reason why the placing of such machines should not be encouraged and that they should be very much controlled.  That is a different matter from the display of vegetables or oils in racks and display cases and so on. These things, provided they are not taking up public space on public footpaths or roadways, are not subject to any of the fees that it is alleged attach to them in this document here tonight.  It is all related to that which is using public space, whether a footpath or roadway.  We have to keep this in mind all the time when talking. We have to remember that these are public places, that they cost money to put there and to preserve and in so far as access on roads and footways is concerned, with the growing traffic and the anticipated growth in traffic, we want every inch of every roadway and footway if we are to make them passable.</P>
      <P>In all of these matters, particularly as we get into towns and on to footpaths, these machines are quite a substantial imposition on the public generally who pay for the maintenance of the footways.  While certain people may pay for a licence and, by permission of the local authority, may be given a facility to use them for their individual purposes, if a licence fee is charged, as is proposed in some of these cases here, I do not think it is unjust or unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as petrol pumps are concerned, there is one thing I should like to say.  In so far as the sale of petrol or any commodity is concerned, I am not in sympathy with the idea that a licence fee is beyond the capacity of the persons concerned but I am sympathetic in the case where a service such as water and air is provided, and which is not charged for <Col N="150" /> but merely provided as a facility for the customer who buys petrol.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there were differential fees in the past ranging from one guinea to five guineas, despite the good case there is to be made on the numbers of vehicles now licensed, and despite the change in the value of money, in this regard there may be something in the argument that the increased charge from five guineas to £8 is far less than the person should be charged, but, side by side with that, the increase from £1 to £8 seems to be somewhat out of balance.</P>
    <P>I am meeting the Irish Motor Traders Association on Monday in regard to this and, probably, several other matters: petrol sales, the regulations relating to petrol stations and all these other things that we have been talking about.  I will be discussing with them in greater detail what evidence is there from their members throughout the country in regard to this matter.  I am taking that into account, plus my own sympathy&mdash;although I could make a very good argument against the last thing I said&mdash;together with the fact that Deputy Jones has made his case in his usual reasonable way and that this is a follow-on to the Planning Act which we got through here on a fairly amicable basis.  I am inclined to add that to the other two reasons I have given and I am inclined to say that in these discussions with the Motor Traders Association on the basis of what relates to petrol sales and all that goes with it, in respect of some of these things, I feel that we may bring things back a bit but I do want to reiterate that the total amount estimated for these fees is £20,000 and not £500,000, £1 million or £1,500,000, as was suggested here tonight.  Rather than adopt the suggestion of annulling the whole regulation, I would think it could be amended in particular respects.  The provisions are very carefully worded as some Deputies remarked.  They ensure that some people will not get away with something they are not entitled to get away with while others have to pay.  They are drafted in that meticulous way that I would be inclined to have sympathy for making changes where necessary, <Col N="151" /> instead of annulling the whole regulation. I think we can proceed on the basis that general agreement can be achieved in a matter of a very short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister started his reply by speaking of misunderstanding and misrepresentation and for that he took one of our members to task. The Minister will find if he consults the records of this House that I put this motion down away back when I became aware that such regulations had been made to the Minister.  I want to take the early opportunity of saying that whatever the newspapers had to say, they did not influence our thinking on this matter.  However, the newspapers were right in drawing the attention of the public to this matter as they did.  It has taken this motion and this debate here tonight to get from the Minister clarification of what was intended in these regulations.</P>
      <P>The motion was fully justified and the Minister's reply here indicates that there were grounds for the fear we had.  It amazes me that the Minister is able now to give us a firm estimate of charges and what they will bring in, a sum of £20,000.  I do not know how the Minister arrived at that figure.  I am sure that later on if we ask the various local authorities the number of pumps and so on that are located by the footpaths or roadways we shall know whether the sum of £18,000 which would go to the Road Fund under one part of the regulation, that is, the proceeds of petrol pumps, and the sum of £2,000 which he mentioned would come under another part of the regulation is as firm an estimate as the Minister would lead us to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that our fears in this respect were justified.  This is not <Col N="152" /> the type of regulation which we thought of.  We took the provision in good faith when it was brought before the House, that &ldquo;along a public road&rdquo; did not have a special significance but had the ordinary connotation which it had under the 1925 Act. It seems that if fees are now chargeable for the use of the public pathway or roadway the experts from the local authorities will have to descend on the roadways and byways to determine whether the tanks are under or over the footpaths, under or over the roadway, whether they are on private property, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is the small people who have been giving this service in the past by means of the kerbside pump who will be affected by this provision.  The Minister in his reply showed concern for the public.  He used the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; as against &ldquo;private&rdquo;.  We are inclined in this House to speak of public property as if somebody outside the country owned it.  We are inclined to think of the people of this country as having no rights whatsoever.  Is it not they who own the public property, the people in the villages and the townlands?  Are they not paying for it through their taxes and rates?  The small shopkeepers and small traders are the public and down through the years they have been making facilities available to the public.  We must rid ourselves of this idea of the public being some kind of body which is remote from the plain people, as if there was a distinction between them. The people of this country own the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the higher charges.  I suppose it is one way of dealing with the depreciation of money but the Minister is justifying the imposition of taxation not to control planning or undesirable developments but merely to raise money.  That is the important thing to remember.</P>
    <P>The question of advertisements, unless they are on a footpath or roadway on a staunch fixture, will be a matter requiring inspection.  One can imagine the county engineer, assistant county engineer or county surveyor cycling around to inspect these things to see if they are on staunch supports <Col N="153" /> or not and whether they should be subject to this type of regulation.  In regard to advertisements, people will have to decide themselves whether to apply for licences to the local authority or later they may be subject to the punitive portions of the regulations and may be fined for each day or portion of a day for which these unlicensed structures remain.</P>
    <P>The Minister went back to the swinging arm type of petrol delivery hose.  The discussion tonight showed how many different types of appliance connections it was necessary to mention. The Minister is very concerned about vending and weighing machines, of which there has been a growth, lest they might impinge on the small people.  Who are the small people but those who put up the original pumps? The big combines are well able to get off the roads, and have got off the roads, but those with kerbside pumps must either pay or get out.  They have no alternative.  Yet, by this regulation the impost on them is to be increased. I hope the Minister, if he continues these regulations, will decide on a figure more in accordance with the type of trade these people do.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister could not say tonight to the House what he is going to say to the motor traders on Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I shall give this assurance to the House, that any announcement I have to make will be made to the House.  I am much more prone to do that than most people are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have that assurance.  The Minister spoke of vending machines and weighing machines encroaching on the small trader but I am sure it is the small traders who have quite a number of these machines at present.  It is the <Col N="154" /> small trader who cannot afford the supermarket type of construction or that of the big combine who wants to display his wares and try to attract some of the available custom to his shop.  A number of shopkeepers throughout the country are doing that as anybody living in a market town knows.  The supermarkets can display their wares under neon lights and glass covers but the ordinary people must display vegetables and other wares on a stack of calf baskets or buckets or other hardware outside their doors.  It is they who will have to pay and those who can afford the greater amenities and enjoy a bigger inflow of capital will not be paying.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind the Minister's reply seems to be looking both ways. He has sympathy at one stage for certain people and at the other stage he believes they should pay.  Then there is the &ldquo;public&rdquo;.  I do not like that word any more than I like &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; or &ldquo;Exchequer&rdquo;.  I should like these high-sounding words brought down to the level of ordinary people.  The Minister says tonight that those who use the pathways and the roads and have used them for years must pay because they are using public property but if one takes any village with petrol pumps, is it not the ordinary people of the area for whom the amenity was created who are taxed and who through their use of cars provide the money for these roads and footpaths?  We speak loosely of the Road Fund, which is simply the contribution of the motorists.  The other portion of it is the rates which people ordinarily pay their local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has justified these regulations.  In fact he has given point to the argument made tonight that these regulations are the kind which we felt he should not make and I am sorry he has made them.  He is not doing justice even to himself, I believe, when he allows his name to go on these regulations.  He has replied mainly in regard to petrol pumps and has referred to vending machines, cellars and weighing machines but he has made no specific reply on quite a number of matters.  When these regulations go through the House, they have the force of law and every local <Col N="155" /> authority will face the business of collecting these fees not from the public, that fanciful term, but from owners of kerbside pumps in every village in the country, from the owners of racks or vending machines&mdash;I prefer the word &ldquo;rack&rdquo; or &ldquo;display case&rdquo; such as is used in the country.</P>
    <P>We are completely justified in having put down this motion and if the Minister now decides to, or is inclined to, give way slightly, that would be the greatest justification for the statement that I am sure he did not adequately consider these regulations before putting his name to them.</P>
    <P>This document goes down to the local authorities and some unfortunate individual there will have the duty of deciding on which of his neighbours throughout the county he will have to place this burden of taxation.  The Town Planning Act will be brought to the pass where regulations made under it will not inspire confidence in the Act itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we have talked at cross-purposes but I think it is apparent that the Minister has been going around in circles in trying to cover the truth in regard to these regulations, the truth being that he is on the defensive regarding the attitude he has adopted in respect of these regulations. It is clearly established that it is money which is being sought in this and that the Minister thinks it right to take this money from people who are providing this type of service to the public.</P>
    <P>We have been fully justified in putting down this motion because in these regulations there are many things in respect of which we do not know what the position will be.  The Minister did <Col N="156" /> not mention the question of a fence which I posed to him and there is also the type of thing that is growing up in some of our cities, the stands from which the barrow-boys sell their goods. We do not know whether these people will have to pay a tax on the carts and racks from which they try to make a living.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of only slight amendments to these regulations and I must say that is something which does not satisfy either this Party or myself. The position is that all we have had are vague generalities, Ministerial assurances that such and such is not meant and a vague estimate of what fees will be brought in.  The Minister has spoken of £18,000.  I wonder how he arrived at that figure and I would like a breakdown of it.  If he goes on the assumption that it will be made up of the £8 licence and the £4 licence, does it mean that for these 26 counties we will divide £18,000 by 12 and get 1,500 petrol pumps scattered throughout the country?  I am not going to accept these assurances.  I believe these regulations should be annulled and I invite the House to join with me in taking a stand against this type of imposition on the people who have been providing these amenities for the public in general.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted to control planning, he had his answer in a simple type of regulation which could be got in the ordinary way from any post office.  Instead of doing that, he decided to make these regulations which are capable of many interpretations and on which even the Custom House itself will have many queries from local authorities.  It will be interesting to see how they will work out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost completed <Col N="159" /> my remarks when progress was reported, but I should like to point out again that our main objection to subsection (2) is that it lays down provisions which were regarded as out of date in my part of the country over 30 years ago.  Coal miners in that area have enjoyed a 7½-hour day during the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister may point out that this section does not worsen the conditions of any of those workers but the fact remains that we are passing legislation in 1965 which in effect could mean a 48-hour week.  Still, I understand from subsection (10) that the Minister may by regulation shorten the number of hours.  In what circumstances may he make these regulations? Subsection (2) provides for a maximum of eight hours per day.  It has been proved by experience&mdash;for instance, in the case of the Agricultural Wages Board&mdash;that the minimum wage is often regarded as the standard wage. The same can apply here in regard to working hours&mdash;eight hours in a consecutive period of 24 hours may come to be regarded as the standard, set, may I emphasise, by legislation passed in this year of 1965.  Under the Conditions of Employment Act, coal miners are not entitled to a weekly half-day.  That point, also, should serve to sustain this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The eight hours provided for in subsection (2) is the maximum number of hours a miner may be underground for the purpose of his work and of going to and from his work.  It was prescribed, first of all, for health reasons that no man should be underground for more than eight out of a consecutive period of 24 hours. It is being regarded as a standard which does not by any means prescribe how long a working day should be.  The length of a working day is a matter for negotiation between the workers and the employers.  Therefore, the fact that eight hours is the maximum prescribed here does not preclude a lesser period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked if subsection (10) enabled me, through regulation, to <Col N="160" /> prescribe a period of less than eight hours.  The answer is yes, but the need for that, from the health point of view, is not apparent and need not be considered at this stage.  Therefore, I suggest the amendment is unnecessary. The eight-hour maximum is regarded as a safe period during which men may be underground in mines.  If it is possible for them to negotiate a shorter period than that, then this section does not inhibit their claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Pattison is mistaken if he thinks this is legislating for an eight-hour day.  We are legislating that a miner may not be underground for more than eight hours.  It is from the time he enters the mine. Getting ready, equipping himself for going down, is not included in the eight hours.  This includes only the period while he proceeds from the bottom of the shaft to the face of the coalmine.  It approaches much nearer eight and a half hours than eight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there is nothing in the subsection to stop negotiations aimed at having the number of hours reduced, but we should not forget that if, in 1965, this House lays down an eight-hour period underground, there is no point, in 1965, in going to the Labour Court asking them to reduce the number of hours, because they will be very quick to point out that legislation has laid down eight hours.</P>

      <P>On the Motion for the Adjournment, Deputy Harte has given notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of Question No. 23 on the Order Paper for 4th November, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4th November, 1964, following certain happenings concerning a compulsory purchase order made <Col N="163" /> by Donegal County Council in relation to a cottage, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Local Government:</P>
      <P>If he will explain why an inspector from his Department rejected a site offered to the Donegal County Council despite the fact that the engineering section of the county council had passed it as being a suitable building site and that the County Manager had initiated purchase proceedings by compulsory acquisition months ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>On 21st September last I confirmed a compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of six out of seven cottage sites scheduled in the order. The remaining plot of land was omitted from my confirming order because I was advised that it was unsuitable in all respects as a site for a house.</P>
      <P>Following lengthy supplementaries put by me to the Minister and his replies, I found I was as well informed in the end as when I asked the question.  I feel that the function of this Parliament is that the elected Members have a right to ask certain questions when it appears that officialdom rules local government.</P>
      <P>This case concerns a lady in Donegal who is living in very bad housing conditions.  These conditions were described by Proinnsias Mac Aonghusa in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of November 22nd, 1964, as follows:</P>
      <P>Mrs. Grace Carr is a widow living with her two often-unemployed sons and sick daughter at Carrickdawson, three miles from Raphoe, in Co. Donegal.  Her cottage is said to be about 200 years old.  She owns it and a small plot of land purchased by her husband many years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When approaching this cottage one could be forgiven for believing that no one could live there.  The walls, once held together by a form of lime cement, are crumbling.  The <Col N="164" /> doors and windows are rotten and ill-fitting.  The thatched roof appears ready to collapse.  Rain comes through constantly.</P>
    <P>The floor is earthen, and daylight can be seen through the gable and roof.  The interior walls consist of rough, uneven stone and crumbling lime cement.  In heavy rain water comes in under the door and the roof leaks so badly that it is impossible to find a dry spot for a bed.</P>
    <P>I endorse everything said there.  I inspected the house.  It is indeed a mystery how anybody should be expected to live there in a Christian country like this.</P>
    <P>Four years ago Mrs. Carr applied to the county council for a specific instance cottage.  The county council, recognising her needs, went through the usual lengthy investigations, which appears to me to be downright red tape. But, since the Minister for Local Government demands it, these things must be done.  I do not accuse him of being responsible for these regulations. They were there before he went in. However, they are still there and he maintains they must be carried out.  In Donegal it is impossible to get one of these houses built inside anything less than two and half years, and in many cases up to seven years.  Nevertheless, Mrs. Carr applied to the county council for her cottage.  In the circumstances the county council went out of their way to help her.  The engineer was asked to inspect the site.  He did so and passed it as being fit as a building site.</P>
    <P>It then transpired that many years previously her late husband purchased a small site at the front of the premises described as a house in which she is now living.  When she was asked to provide title for this site, she was unable to do so.  That is not unusual in Donegal, and I am sure the same applies to many parts of Ireland.  Everyone in the locality knew it belonged to the Carr family.  Mrs. Carr possibly could have sold it to a neighbouring farmer.  She could have built a house on it herself, had she the money.  But the county council, again on dictation from the Minister for Local Government, will not build a house on any land unless <Col N="165" /> that land is registered in the name of the county council.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Carr was asked to have the land transferred to the county council.  Not having title, she consulted her solicitor. The solicitor had to make up his mind about letting Mrs. Carr go to the expense of going through the courts or whether the local county councillors could influence the county manager to have it included in a compulsory purchase order.  The manager, again recognising the circumstances of this family, included this site in an order, along with six other similar sites in the county.  The manager will not make a compulsory purchase order in respect of any land without first being advised by the engineering section.  In this case the engineering section advised the manager that a house could be built on the site and the manager duly applied to the Minister to acquire this site by compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>I witnessed that compulsory purchase order in January of last year.  On numerous occasions while I was in Dublin I rang the Department inquiring when the compulsory purchase order would be sanctioned.  Eventually, I was told that six sites out of seven had been passed, but Mrs. Carr's had been rejected.  That prompted me to ask the question in this House.  The tone of the Minister's replies would indicate that he believed I would not have asked the question, were he not Minister for Local Government.  I take great exception to that.  The Minister for Local Government serves the people.  Further, I believe there is a responsibility on this particular Minister to serve the people of North-East Donegal.</P>
    <P>When the site was rejected by the Minister for Local Government and he refused to tell me in this House why he refused to sanction it, it would have appeared that I was beaten by officialdom.  I had the site inspected and was convinced that a house could be built on the site.  The only weapon left to me was the public Press.  I released the findings to Mr. Proinnsias MacAonghusa and they were duly published.</P>
    <P>On the Sunday following their publication, <Col N="166" /> the Department of Local Government had a reply in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> I could find in the Oireachtas Library today a copy of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of November 22nd containing the article by Proinnsias MacAonghusa but the edition for 29th December was the Dublin edition, which did not carry the Department's reply.  I am not surprised.  The reply by the Department was so weak that it was used only in the country edition.  The editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> must have considered it so weak as not to interest readers in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As a result, I am not in a position to quote exactly the Department's reply but, from memory, the points made were: (1) Bog formed part of the site.  In relation to that, may I say that bog forms part of it but only of part of it and a house can be built on the remainder of the site.  (2) The proposed site was approximately 1½ miles from the nearest school.  My comment on that is that there is no member of the family of school-going age.  They are all over the age of 20. (3) There is no water supply.  I dispute that.  There is a water supply.  It may not be a good water supply but at least it is as good as the supply they have now, living in a bad house.  (4) There was no sewerage system.  What sewerage system have they at the moment?  Surely bog is the best place to site a septic tank?  (5) There were no shops adjacent to the site.  (6) It was 2½ miles from a church.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Local Government how many houses have been built in Donegal of which all these things could be said?  The constituency of North-East Donegal is as well known to the Minister for Local Government as it is to me. The number of houses built by Donegal County Council is small but the article presented by the Department of Local Government in defence of a shocking scandal could be used in relation to a number of those houses.  The Department was not content with that. To try to vindicate the Minister for Local Government they quoted from the Dáil debate.  They quoted only part of the Dáil debate and, needless <Col N="167" /> to say, the parts quoted would be favourable to the Minister.  They quoted the Minister as having said:</P>
    <P>I am surprised the application, having started in 1961 should only be queried now by the Deputy after his saying three years have elapsed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really irrelevant to the point I wish to make.  I submit to your ruling.  The point I should like to bring out is that if they had started a bit earlier and quoted me as having said of the Minister that if it had been one of the Minister's henchmen looking for a job &mdash; and then I was interrupted by the Minister &mdash; he would have paid better attention to it.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the articles appeared in the press I have again paid a visit to the site, accompanied by a contractor.  The contractor was puzzled, on seeing the site, as to why the Minister for Local <Col N="168" /> Government should refuse to sanction it.  Being a friend of mine, I felt he might be influenced by the fact that I was trying to solve this problem and he was trying to help me.  He told me in confidence that he built houses on worse sites for Donegal County Council.  Having heard that, I invited two other contractors, unknown to each other, to inspect the site and they reported back to me that not alone had they built houses for Donegal County Council on worse sites but that, in fact, they were doing it at the moment.  Needless to say, these men did not want their names released but they would give me their word that if there is a public sworn inquiry they will come and testify that that is the position.  They are men who build houses day in and day out, who recognise whether a site is suitable or not and whether or not a house can be built on a particular site.  Officialdom seems to think that such men know nothing.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Donegal County Manager, the Secretary and the engineer in charge of housing visited the site.  Having heard that they were at the site.  I raised the matter at a Donegal County Council meeting and the manager declined to give me his findings.  Reading between the lines, I mentioned to the Manager that the answer was obvious, that they had discovered the same findings as I, the contractors and the engineer who first inspected the site had found, and therefore he was afraid to go against the Minister for Local Government; it was as much as his job would be worth.  That is my own personal opinion.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that persons such as the Carr family have to tolerate housing conditions such as they now have while an engineer from the Department rejects the findings of a Donegal County Council engineer and while the Minister accepts the reply of the engineer from the Department without inquiring as to why he found differently from an engineer from Donegal County Council.  If the opinions of these men were in conflict it should be the duty of the Minister <Col N="169" /> to ask both engineers to go back and to produce an agreed report or to submit a third opinion.</P>

      <P>The assertions made here by the Deputy may, in his lights, be considered proper but the report that I have relied upon is one of which I should like to give the House full and clear knowledge.</P>
      <P>The report that the site was suitable for housing, which was signed by the county council's technical advisers, gave the following information: the area of the site &mdash; 1 rood; water &mdash; not available; sewerage &mdash; not available; electricity &mdash; not available; distance to school &mdash; two miles; distance to Church &mdash; three miles; distance to shops &mdash; half a mile; distance to and nature of water supply, if piped supply not available &mdash; 440 yds.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of this CPO in 1964 relating to a case which commenced its progress through the Donegal County Council three years previously, in 1961, my inspector went down and found that the report as submitted by the council's technical advisers was correct.  But he himself went further in his description and added that the site was a very small piece of cutaway bog surrounded on all sides by boggy moorland, that the site was low, damp and waterlogged and that the land was generally of poor quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy had 20 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position I reluctantly had to meet.  In this business of sites coming up for acquisition for the housing of families, my earnest wish is to clear them as quickly as possible.  However, against that background and with the technical advice and the report of the technical officers of the council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the County Council engineer's report?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will not restrain himself I shall have to ask him to leave the House.  The Minister is entitled to 10 minutes.  The Deputy had 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should at least admit the engineering staff passed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow the technical advisers of the council are the same people referred to by the Deputy as the engineers.  It is the engineer's report on the site I read out, that the area was 1 rood, water not available, electricity not available, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>He still passed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, despite the information submitted, and in the light of that information one would immediately wonder how it came to be passed. My inspector having gone down to have a look at the site and reported to me, I just could not pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accompany me to the site and inspect it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector reported <Col N="171" /> that there was no scarcity of sites suitable for building&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering why one of the suitable sites on the main road to Raphoe was not sought in order to build a house expeditiously for the family.  I am also pinpointing <Col N="172" /> the fact that we got the CPO in 1964 in relation to a site that was offered in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With that, I leave it to the Deputy to go down and explain himself to the people who had the misfortune to send him here to try to represent them.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11th February, 1965.</P>
