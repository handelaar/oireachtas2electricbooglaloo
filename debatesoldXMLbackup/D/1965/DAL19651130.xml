      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the report of a statement by General de Gaulle indicating that he felt that the obstacles which were keeping Britain out of EEC were weakening; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have been following very closely recent developments in this matter, particularly the statement on the 24th November by the French Minister of Information. While we have no more information than was conveyed by that statement we naturally welcome any indication of a development in the situation as it may affect our application for membership for the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of that statement, does the Taoiseach think that any direct approach should be made to the Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, no <Col N="496" /> doubt, aware that a situation exists in the EEC which rather discourages any initiative at this time.  But this situation will, no doubt, be resolved some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As our application for membership of the EEC is not actually withdrawn&mdash;it is deferred for some time&mdash;would it not be desirable that we should have some official contact with the EEC at this critical period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an Ambassador accredited to them.  There is in the EEC a situation which has to be resolved before any decisions of this kind are likely to be possible.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>All areas of the country have already had an opportunity of accepting electricity supply under the rural electrification scheme.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that work under the post-development scheme has not yet commenced in the following rural areas of Counties Longford and Westmeath:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>County Longford:</i> Ballinamuck, Abbeylara, Leggagh, Kilcommock, Moydow, Aughnacliffe, Dring and Legan.</P>
      <P>

      <P>Seven of these areas, namely, Ballinamuck, Abbeylara, County Longford and Moydrum, Mullingar, Multyfarnham, Turin and Killucan, County Westmeath, have been recanvassed.</P>
      <P>The board cannot say in which order the remaining areas will be recanvassed but they expect that work under the post-development scheme will be completed in all these areas within two or three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power what steps will be taken to carry out an investigation into public transport, both omnibus and railway traffic, in Dublin with a view to supplementing the recently completed private traffic investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy refers to the report recently submitted to Dublin Corporation by the traffic consultant engaged by them to carry out a road traffic survey of the city and make recommendations with regard to the future road traffic network therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> Until such time as decisions on the main street network recommended in the report have been taken it would be premature to undertake the supplementary investigation into public transport traffic suggested by the consultant.</P>

      <P>The purchase of material is a matter of day to day administration in which I do not intervene but in the context of the Buy Irish campaign I have made inquiries in this case.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the company concerned that an order for Irish-made hardboard was recently placed with a reputable Dublin supplier but, through an error, some of the sheets supplied were of foreign manufacture, which was not noticed when delivery was effected; in fact, only 3 out of 50 sheets were marked &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;.  The supplier has expressed regret that the mistake occurred and has undertaken to replace the foreign hardboard with Irish products.</P>

      <P>There is a service contract with one advertising agent for plain advertisements for all Departments. Individual Departments make their own arrangements in relation to all other types of advertising.  For example, as far as my Department is concerned, the contractor for plain advertisements handles advertising for National Loans.  In the case of Prize Bonds, however, agents are invited to tender for advertising campaigns to publicise the Bonds in newspapers, posters, television, etc.</P>

    <P>(b)  The amounts of sick pay specified are subject to deduction of any Social Welfare benefits payable to officers other than those at (x) in respect of absence due to illness.</P>
    <P>(c)  The special sick pay arrangements for officers suffering from tuberculosis are allowed once only to any officer.</P>
    <P>(d)  The sick leave conditions of officers recruited locally by officers of the Department of External Affairs abroad vary considerably from country to country.  As the numbers covered by them are small it is not considered necessary to indicate these conditions.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister must accept from members of his own Party who have made representation to him, or if not to him to his predecessor, about matters such as this, that when it comes to the tourist trade, it is wrong that a person who comes into this country and who has the misfortune to wait until after 12 o'clock at night should be charged a fee of 2/-to leave the country again?  Surely this cuts across the &ldquo;Sell Ireland&rdquo; programme of Bord Fáilte, inviting people to this country and then charging them 2/- to leave it?</P>

      <P>There are certain times of duty for the officers at the frontier posts.  If a person attends during those hours of duty and presents his passbook while entering or leaving the country, there is no charge. However, if he attends one of the posts outside of these hours, it entails extra cost to the State to have an officer present.  A charge of 2/- is not too onerous in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>The point I want to dispute is that a person from Great Britain coming to this country must pay 2/- to get back into Northern Ireland after 12 o'clock; he does not have to pay it to his own customs authorities but has to pay it to this Government.  Surely it will be accepted that 99 per cent of the people who cross the Border are legitimate traffic, crossing the Border for pleasure, while the one per cent do not have to pay the 2/- but can use non-approved roads and other means of crossing the Border?  The whole customs regulations are geared in the wrong direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 13th May last to his previous question in this matter. As I explained then, I am satisfied that the wide powers of local authorities to acquire land for the purposes of their functions, including the power of acquisition for future use, are adequate for all purposes.  These powers were sufficient to have enabled the County Council to proceed for the acquisition, by compulsion if necessary, of any part of the estate in question prior to its acquisition by the Land Commission some months ago.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of part of the estate being made available at this stage to the county council for housing or other development, this must be settled between the Land Commission and the council.  My information is that the county council has already agreed to take over 31½ acres which is located within about half a mile of the village of Rush and that the possibility of acquiring a further 64 acres is at present being investigated.</P>

      <P>Consultation with assemblers and other interests was conducted in depth before the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, were made, and likewise public comment was invited. In the process the question of making compulsory the fitting of seat belts was considered, but it was decided not to do so for the reasons set out in a public statement issued at the time. These reasons which are still valid, were outlined in reply to a question by Deputy Coughlan on 20th October last.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1965, made on 20th April, 1965 prescribe that all cars and station wagons first registered on or after 1st July, 1965, be equipped with seat belt anchorages, complying with a prescribed standard, for seat belts for use by persons in the front seats of the vehicle.  Prior to the making of these regulations car assemblers were consulted and public comment invited in the usual way.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the taking of safety precautions is being hampered by some managements in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in the Factories Act, 1955 to enable workers in any factory to establish a safety committee and the factory occupier and my Department's factory inspectors are statutorily required to consider any representations made by such committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the law for an individual to make complaints nor is there any provision for me to protect an individual from any consequences of making complaints but there is provision for the establishment of committees with statutory rights to approach either employers or managements and make complaints or suggestions and I think this provision could be availed of to a greater extent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will <Col N="524" /> appreciate that building sites are not fixtures and, consequently, figures of the frequency of visits would not be altogether meaningful.</P>
      <P>In the year ended 30th September, 1964 the factory inspectors of my Department inspected 1,339 building sites. In the 12 months ended September, 1965, the number had increased to 1,842.</P>
      <P>Managements are not given advance notice of inspections carried out for the purpose of checking on compliance with the provisions of the Factories Act and the relevant Regulations.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that compliance with the safety requirements of the Building Regulations of 1959 is yet fully satisfactory.  In the year ended 30th September, 1964 prosecutions were taken on 108 counts.  However, my inspectors report a continuing improvement in the standard of compliance.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Under the sale of food and drugs legislation, it is an offence to sell as whole milk, milk which contains less than three per cent of milk fat.  The testing of milk for this purpose has no connection with the milk testing requirements under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, which relate to the method by which payment for milk supplied to creameries is calculated.  In the circumstances, I do not see the need for requiring public analysts who test milk under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts to adopt the method of testing in operation at creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The Deputy may be under a misapprehension as to the exact position in regard to these different tests.  The creamery test is based on samples taken every day, whereas the farmer can take an isolated sample, send it off to the public analyst and get a <Col N="526" /> completely different result.  These are two different systems of testing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the Garda Band were described in glowing terms by both the President and Taoiseach on the programme for the 1964 American and Canadian tour of the Band; and why in view of this it has now been decided to discontinue the activities of the Band.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions 53 to 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strength of the Garda Band has varied from time to time: before 1938 there were four Garda bands with a <Col N="530" /> total strength of 85.  In that year they were reduced to two bands with a strength of 51.  In 1954 the bands were reduced to one with a strength of 37.</P>
    <P>The cost to the State in salaries and pension liability for the year 1965 is of the order of £38,000 and in respect of hours of duty on musical activities alone the cost to the State is of the order of £25,000.  Apart from this cost to the State sums are given to the Band as fees for private engagements and further sums are given as voluntary contributions from within the Force. These fees and contributions are not handed over to the State as an offset to the State's costs; they are kept in a fund administered by a Band Committee who are members of the Force and cover such items as contributions to the bandmaster and the band sergeants, subsistence allowances for members attending engagements, repairs to instruments, fees to the Performing Rights Society, printing and stationery costs, grants to the Garda Benevolent Fund and to the Garda Medical Aid Society and so on.</P>
    <P>Members of the Force in the Garda Band are ordinarily required to do three hours regular police duty on each of four days in the week but on any day on which the band have an engagement the members are not required to do any regular police duty.  On a conservative estimate, which has taken into account the special tour of duty on traffic enforcement in the weeks approaching Christmas and other minor occasional assignments of that kind, the bandsmen give less than one-third of the normal Garda working hours to police duties proper.</P>
    <P>The position this year is that the band has made ten visits to the training depot and, in all, has played on 40 days in connection with the drilling and passing-out parades of recruits.  The use of recorded music and loud speakers has been found, however, to be adequate throughout the general period of recruit training.  In effect, then, it cost the State £25,000 to have the band available for 10 official musical performances of a couple of hours on each of 40 days of this year.</P>
    <P>Apart from official performances, the band gave two free recitals in <Col N="531" /> public and performed at 55 private engagements &mdash; at races, football matches and the like&mdash;at fees varying from £10 10s. to £30.  The gross total of these fees amounted to £700 and, with the deduction of subsistence allowances which account for more than half, the net benefit to the band fund was no more than a couple of hundred pounds.  A number of requests for the use of the band were withdrawn when the question of fees was mentioned even though the highest fee quoted was less than one-third of the salaries payable to the band for that particular day.</P>
    <P>To conclude: my decision to disband the Garda Band was based on the following considerations: (1) the retirement of the bandmaster early this year occasioned a reappraisal of the band's functions; (2) the cost of maintaining the band is excessive, wasteful and out of all proportion to any purpose served; (3) it has been established that the band has outlived its usefulness for official purposes as its functions in the training of recruits can be carried on adequately by the use of recorded music; (4) it was found that there had been a steady decrease in public interest over the past 12 years which was reflected in the number of private engagements and the receipts from fees had dropped to less than half, that is, from £1,980 in 1954 to £870 in 1963 and £700 for the first ten months of 1965; (5) while maintaining the Force at its present strength of 6,540, the intake of recruits will drop by about 50 per cent in a couple of years time, there will be a corresponding reduction in drilling exercises and passing out parades, and the maintenance of a band would become still more wasteful and excessive; (6) continuance of the band for prestige purposes alone could not be justified; (7) police requirements in the prevention and detection of crime, enforcement of the traffic laws and the maintenance of law and order generally which now cost almost nine million pounds annually necessitate that the most efficient and economical use be made of all police manpower.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="532" /> not agree that the statement he has made is one which no Minister for Justice should make about a body such as the Garda Band?  Does he not agree that he has, for some reason best known to himself, adopted a vindictive attitude towards a band which is well known not alone here but throughout the whole world?  Does he deny that last year this band was lauded by people in this country and in America as being a credit to any nation and that the Taoiseach is on record as confirming that in writing?  Will he say, in view of all those things, why he decided to save a miserly amount compared with the money being spent otherwise? Is it not a fact that this band which, for its cultural value alone is worth very many times the amount we spend on it, is worth every penny that is spent on it?  Why should it be disbanded now at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied the decision taken was the correct one.  The extra police manpower made available will go very far towards greater enforcement of the Road Traffic Act.  Already members of the band are engaged on that particular work in the city and they have released other members of the Garda for crime prevention and detection.  I am perfectly satisfied that that is the work the manpower of the Force should be engaged on and the amount involved, £40,000 per year for a band with ten official functions in the year, was entirely incommensurate with the main purpose of the Force, which is the enforcement of law and order and the implementation of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider the decision to disband the band a reflection on the whole idea of a Garda force?  The common practice in all police forces is to have at least one band and, in many cases, more than one.  Has the Minister not considered the possibility of retaining the band as a band, even on a part-time basis, and using the members for other duties rather than disband the band entirely?  Surely that type of band should be possible.  Surely it should be possible to retain the band on that basis, allowing the band to be available for ceremonial Garda duties?</P>

      <P>Some members of the Garda Band were recruited in the ordinary way but the great majority were given exemption from the educational tests, etc. because of their competency in playing musical instruments.</P>
      <P>Members of the Force who have been recruited because of specialised qualifications have at all times been liable to assignment to ordinary police duties.</P>
      <P>So far as the band is concerned, 13 members were compulsorily transferred to ordinary police duties in 1954 following a reorganisation of the band in that year.  Also, seven members of the band were compulsorily transferred to ordinary police duties in 1964.  Over the years, there have, also, been instances where band members were transferred to other duties at their own request.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the only requirement of recruits for this type of duty was that they be capable of reading music and competent to play a brass or reed instrument?  Surely that is not what is required of an ordinary guard and not the type of test or examination which a normal Garda recruit is required to do?  Does the Minister not agree that this was a case of men being specially recruited because they were able to do a certain thing, that they were a credit to the Force and because of the fact that money is short Fianna Fáil have now picked on what they thought was the softest one they could get?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the matter I wish to raise should be more appropriately raised on section 11 or on section 12.  Section 11 deals with the First Schedule, which sets out the diseases and animals which come within the ambit of the regulations which may be made for the control and eradication of disease.  The net point I want to raise is this: we are at present engaged in a campaign for the eradication of warble fly in cattle. Cattle appear in the First Schedule.  I want to know from the Minister does the Department intend to supplement the usual procedure for eradication of a pest of this character with a biological attack upon the source of <Col N="543" /> the trouble, with specific reference to warble fly?</P>
      <P>We are at present having recourse to a system of dressing cattle with a systemic dressing designed to destroy the warble embryo in the circulation of the cattle, not the blood circulation but the lymphatic circulation of the individual beast.  This procedure could be very advantageous if supplemented by a biological attack on the warble fly itself analogous to that which was conducted by the Government of Australia when they were dealing with the greenbottle fly in connection with the elimination of maggots in sheep in Australia.  At first glance, it appears that a biological attack on the warble fly over the whole country would appear to be out of the question, but, when the Government of Australia successfully undertook such a campaign for the elimination of the green-bottle fly over the whole sheep-raising area of Australia, I have always felt we should address ourselves to the problem.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture, I contemplated an experimental attack of this kind on a restricted area. At that time, prior to 1957, we had not at our disposal the drugs now available for dealing with this problem.  We had to grapple with it by the methods then available.  It was finally considered that, in view of the very restricted effectiveness of the remedy at our disposal at that time, it was, perhaps, premature to adopt the biological attack.  Now that we have a very much more efficient systemic dressing for this complaint, I should be glad to know from the Minister if any corresponding attack is to be made on the problem by a systemic biological attack on the warble fly itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be quite crude and plain about it, the procedure for the biological attack on a pest of this kind, which was so successfully inaugurated and operated by the Australian Government, was that they captured a number of male flies which they irradiated, thereby rendering them infertile.  These were released and&mdash;in the nature of things&mdash; this kind of parasites only mate once, then lay infertile eggs and the fly <Col N="544" /> population begins to dwindle.  The consequence has been for that variety of fly to disappear altogether.  This is, in a highly simplified form, the nature of the biological assault on parasites of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon has mentioned, this new process of the systemic dressing represents a breakthrough in this particular field.  We are advised that systemic dressing on a national scale, such as we are undertaking, would be about 95 per cent effective.  As I understand the position, that should suffice to ensure the effective eradication of the warble fly. We have not got all the figures in as yet but we think that by now we should have dressed somewhere in the region of four million cattle.  This, I think, represents success.  It may be that when we come to evaluating the situation, as a result of the national eradication campaign this year, some form of biological attack, such as Deputy Dillon has mentioned, may be necessary.  At the moment we do not think it will be but, if it is, it will be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reassurance.  In the meantime perhaps the Minister would consider examining the practicability of the biological procedure in connection with this particular type of pest in case, in the future, it should become desirable to embark upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister several questions in relation to the warble fly eradication scheme at present in action.  First of all, does he not consider that up to the 1st December&mdash;that is tomorrow&mdash; is a very short period in which to allow farmers to operate the scheme?  Would he enlighten the House as to whether it is mandatory on farmers to have all beasts treated by this, or whether they are allowed to have treated only such animals as they wish to present for marketing?  If all beasts have to be treated does he not consider it imposes a good deal of hardship on farmers, in present circumstances, in the light of the fact that it is an extra charge, even though it is a charge of only 3/- per beast?  It so happens <Col N="545" /> that, perhaps, the marketing conditions for livestock at the moment are worse than they have been in the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the charge of 3/-, in the event of all beasts in a herd having to be treated, is too great, when it is considered that a farmer has to pay 3/- for a suck calf to be treated for this and 3/- for a bullock as well? Have the operators carrying out this particular treatment any specialised training whatsoever, or are they simply told to buy the stuff, appoint it for the area, charge 3/- per beast and stamp the cards?  I understand that a special card is being issued for this particular treatment.  Does the Minister not consider that this is extremely unreasonable in the light of the fact that the ordinary small farmer has not got book-keeping facilities or files available to him, which means he will have an extra card?  He already has the difficulty of the blue card.  He very often has to read three or four numbers on the ear before he gets the right one.  As well as that, he is likely to have a third card for brucellosis.  Would the Minister, therefore, not reconsider the whole question of the registration of this treatment so that it could be stamped on the already existing bovine tuberculosis card and thus save a lot of trouble?  I asked the Minister enough questions but I have something further to say later on on this particular treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I do not think that 1st December is too early a date at all.  We must finish in or around 1st December because veterinary advice is to the effect that every day one goes beyond the 1st December increases the risk.  We inaugurated the campaign at the end of the summer and there was ample time for everybody to have their herds dressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally received the form in relation to it only approximately one month ago.</P>

    <Col N="546" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In a national scheme of this sort, there will be individual discrepancies here and there.  The campaign was launched on a national basis at the beginning of September and even if any particular herd owner received notification only a month ago, he still had a month to get in touch with the local operative to have his cattle dressed.  I do not think a charge of 3/- per animal is excessive.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon's interjection in relation to the cost charge, I would say that, apart altogether from any benefit accruing to the hide trade, there is no doubt that the elimination of warble fly brings enormous benefit to the herd owners.  Apart from the damage by warble fly to the hide itself, infestation with warbles has a very serious effect on the way in which cattle thrive, if they are store beasts, and it also affects the milk yields, if they are dairy herds.  The warble fly does all those things, apart from the damage it does to the herd itself. There is no particular skill necessary to dress animals.  I think the best way I can illustrate this point is by telling the Deputy that I have dressed cattle myself.</P>

      <P>We gave a lot of thought to the system of records necessary and it seemed to us the simplest way of doing it was to issue a very simple certificate related to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme. Indeed, the simplest thing for the herd owner to do is to attach the warble certificate to his blue card.  No bookkeeping of any sort is necessary.  It simply means that the blue card and the warble fly certificate now accompany the animal everywhere it goes.</P>

      <P>The position apparently is that the herd owner is at a loss of approximately 1/6d.  The return of this drug would be accepted from him or the operator will use the drug but a charge of 1/6d. can be made.  This means a loss to the herd owner of 1/6d.  I should like to know from the Minister if he can do anything about this?  I have had complaints in my constituency about this matter.</P>

Is the Deputy referring to herd owners who, in past years, for the purpose of good stockmanship, had stocks of this drug on hands but of which they do not get the benefit this year?

      <P>The circular issued to farmers and herd owners states that the drug is eliminated from the system in six hours.  I think I am correct in that interpretation.  There has been a good deal of misunderstanding about this.  As far as I can make out, having read the official record, if an animal which has been treated for this warble fly treatment dies, provided the veterinary surgeon is called within 24 hours to see the carcase of the animal, compensation can be paid.  I was not here when the Parliamentary Secretary replied to the debate but that is what I understand he said.  I want clarification on this point.  It should be made absolutely clear here where the herd owner stands. If the Minister and his advisers maintain that treatment is excreted out of the system in six hours, what is to prevent them saying, if my animal or anybody else's animal dies, within a <Col N="548" /> day or so: &ldquo;That drug is excreted from the system in six hours and we are not liable?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reassure the Deputy and others on this matter.  This insurance scheme was introduced with a view to making sure that nobody was at a loss under this campaign.  We endeavoured to build certain conditions into the scheme to make sure that we would not be called on to pay compensation for deaths which resulted from some entirely different cause.  If we are to administer the scheme in a reasonable fashion&mdash; fortunately the number of deaths has been very small in proportion to the number of cattle treated&mdash;some conditions must be attached to it.  If any Deputy knows of any hardship cases or cases in which some herd owner has been harshly dealt with, he should bring them to our notice and we will try to have the matter rectified.</P>
      <P>As I say, this is a national scheme and we are endeavouring to deal with somewhere in the neighbourhood of 4,000,000 head of cattle.  We had to introduce some conditions.  It is not our intention that any single herd owner should be at a loss because of his participation in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the liberal attitude of the Minister but it does not quite answer my question.  Supposing a herd owner loses an animal.  Supposing the animal dies a week after it has been treated and the veterinary surgeon is sent for and comes along and says: &ldquo;This animal did not die because of the dressing; it had no effect on it at all.&rdquo; What redress has the herd owner then got?  The Minister can stand on this legally if we accept the six hours. Remember that we are legislating for the future and I cannot see anything in this Bill to safeguard the herd owner if his animal dies later than six hours after treatment.  There is nothing to stop anybody coming along and saying that the Minister is not responsible. The herd owner will not get any compensation then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard of two cases in my county.  I have not seen the animals, <Col N="549" /> but shortly after being treated, the calf was lost and some time afterwards, the cow died.  I do not know if compensation was paid in this case.  It was applied for.  It seems to me there is no real legal coverage in this case, and I am not alone in this view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister saying that the Department will adopt a reasonable attitude in cases of this kind.  I know of a woman living in an isolated area whose cattle were treated.  The animals were put out on grass some distance from the house. One died after dressing.  The beast was found dead some time later on.  It was more than 24 hours before notification was given to a veterinary surgeon.  I am glad to hear the Minister will take a very liberal view of cases of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>I think the Deputies who have spoken have highlighted the difficulty.  The Minister said that the Department are quite reasonable and that in any case of hardship the matter could be brought to his notice.  Unfortunately, the scheme does not indicate that there is any question of leniency with regard to notification within 24 hours.  It is true that losses are not very great, but it is also true that there are small herd owners who go to work in the mornings and if an animal dies before they return in the evening, it may not be possible in isolated areas to get to a veterinary surgeon within 24 hours.  That has happened in two cases I know of and the people concerned feel they are going to lose the cost of the beast which they cannot afford.  Why was 24 hours selected?  Surely it should have been possible to have made it a little longer than 24 hours, in view of the fact that leniency can be shown, as the Minister said?  That has reassured these people who feel there is a danger of losing some of their stock if they get them dressed because they might not be able to meet this deadline. Perhaps the Minister will consider this.</P>

Now if we did not have them dressed, we are locked up and cannot sell our cattle.  It is hard enough to sell cattle at the moment and prices are bad, but on top of that, if they are not dressed, we have to keep them next summer as well.

We have succeeded in dressing 4,000,000 cattle this year.  In fact, we have achieved success.

They may <Col N="555" /> have got a reminder three weeks ago: we shall ascertain that before the debate proceeds much further.  Three weeks is quite adequate.  Our officers, particularly in County Wexford, have been combing the area, going around to herd owners, pestering them to have it done whereas, in an area such as that Deputy Dillon talked about, where the matter got under way quickly, efficiently and well, the AI station dealt with it in their own way, area after area, as suited them.  It may have been six weeks or even two months from the original notification before they came round to the herd owner. However, County Wexford was a slow area from the point of view of the scheme as a whole and we were combing the area and sending the officer time and time again to try to persuade people to have their cattle dressed so there was no question of the herd owners in that particular area having their backs to the wall.

I think that if people have failed to get the treatment done before 1st December the Minister might consider, in this first year of the scheme, such persons applying to the Department to have it done on the next practicable occasion, giving them interim cards to permit traffic in the area.  No great harm can be done as it will arise only in a very limited area. Would the Minister consider giving such a licence to sell during the next 12 months if they get their cattle dressed on the first available date in the new year?

We should not, if possible, allow that situation to arise.  I would agree with the Minister if he said that the exclusion of one individual from this scheme would jeopardise the success of the whole scheme over the country. I would be inclined to say that this is very unfortunate, that we cannot wreck the whole elimination scheme in order to meet the problem of one individual farmer and that we must look at it from the angle of compensation, and so on, but that we have to stand firm. Here is a case in which I do not think it is necessary to stand firm and rigid.</P>
      <P>My experience of the Department of Agriculture has been that the more you can meet the farmer and communicate with him, the more you understand his difficulties.  Even if they were not as fast off the mark as one might expect them to be, various problems arise which make that impossible. Therefore, I would ask the Minister not to commit himself to be unable to do anything to meet this special problem mentioned by Deputy Esmonde which may turn up in other areas. There is a way out of it without doing irrevocable harm.  If these farmers were given some form of permission to sell their cattle, if they wish to sell them, during the ensuing 12 months, they could reasonably be called upon to make a corresponding undertaking that they would have their cattle dressed for the purpose of the elimination of warble fly on the first available occasion.</P>

      <P>Let us take it that ten per cent of the cattle will be breeding illegitimate warble flies within the next 12 months.  To that extent, the system as devised by the Minister and his Department for the total eradication of the warble fly has been a failure. Taking it from there, if you are going to go on in the coming year with the same type of system, without compulsion, will you then arrive at the stage where you will have no warble flies in the country?  I am saying this because, as a member of a county committee of agriculture, I was always in favour of compulsion for the reason that I felt there was no other means of totally eradicating the warble fly and I am still of that opinion now.</P>

      <P>The number of farmer Deputies who want to compel farmers and to introduce compulsion amazes me.  Deputy Dillon says quite rightly that the way to get farmers to do anything is to get their co-operation, to explain what you are trying to do, to show the benefits that will accrue.  You will then get their whole-hearted and enthusiastic co-operation and you will achieve far more, I think, than you will ever achieve by compulsion.</P>
      <P>The warble fly eradication scheme began last year on a voluntary basis. About 2,000,000 cattle were treated on an entirely voluntary basis by voluntary organisations.  That was a tremendous indication of what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

We have gone a step further and we <Col N="558" /> will have treated somewhere in the region of 4,000,000 out of 5,000,000 head of cattle, and this represents almost total success.  According to the veterinary surgeons, it indicates that this warble fly is well on its way towards eradication.  When we get our records and our figures we shall evaluate this year's campaign and decide what we shall do next year.</P>

We must remember, however, that whether they are sold or not sold at the present time, the legitimate warble fly will arrive.  From 1st December the owners must wait until the next season starts.  Deputy Dillon's suggestion that it may be done at the first reasonable date is the solution to it.  Not alone are there the people to whom Deputy Esmonde referred who did not receive notice until it was too late but there are the people who did receive notice but who for one reason or another did not dress the cattle.  I am sure every Deputy is aware of people who no matter what advice they got, did not dress the cattle, and it would be unfair to say now: &ldquo;If you try to sell them in the open fair or market, you will be <Col N="559" /> prosecuted.&rdquo;  The Minister will not be losing anything if he says: &ldquo;For this year there may be some arrangement made, but this is the last year it may be done.&rdquo; Then nobody can ever claim he did not get adequate notice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons made a point about compulsion.  While the Minister may say he does not like compelling the farmers, I have come to the conclusion that there is a certain hard core in this country who no matter what warnings they get, will not ultimately do it until they are compelled.  Possibly Deputy Lyons is nearer the mark than the Minister might think.</P>

If farmers are interested in their stock, they will have this job done without any necessity for the Minister to fix a date or to have it made compulsory.  If a man is unable to sell his cattle, surely it is in his interest to have them dressed in time?  The whole thing about this scheme is that it cannot be a success unless everybody concerned participates in it.  It is a waste of time for me to have my cattle treated if my neighbour does not do likewise.  Therefore it was necessary for the Minister to fix a date in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Meaney took it that Deputy Esmonde's suggestion was that if a man said: &ldquo;I give an undertaking that I will have them dressed,&rdquo; the man would be allowed to sell them.  If that had been Deputy Esmonde's suggestion, there would have been no sense in it because it is the buyer who would have to give effect to the undertaking given by the vendor.  In a scheme of this sort, all we can do is go as far as we can.  There will always be exceptions and special cases in respect of which we must provide and we intend to provide for them in this instance as well.  Our problem was to ensure that no herd owner would be encouraged to adopt the attitude that this is just another scheme and &ldquo;It does not matter whether I have my cattle dressed; it is just a pious wish of the Minister and his Department.&rdquo; We want everybody to understand that we are in earnest about this and that if anybody wilfully neglects to have his cattle done by 1st December, he will leave himself open to a criminal prosecution if he offers them for sale publicly.</P>

What I asked was if a person has dressed with the derris treatment and has done so consistently over the years, will the Minister license him to sell.

My position is that if somebody has had the opportunity of having his animals dressed before 30th November and has neglected to do so, I do not see why the scheme should not be applied fully in his case.  If there are exceptional cases here and there throughout the country where persons are entirely blameless, it is not our intention that they should be penalised.

If you let one warble fly loose in the country, he can affect several cows but we are not here dealing with a very urgent situation.  However, it is a situation with which we must deal effectively.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is to ensure that if for any reason, whether it be malice or indolence or ignorance, a farmer has not got his cattle dressed in the systemic scheme this year, we should exact from him an undertaking that he will get them dressed next year.  Deputy Meaney foresees the possibility that the undertaking to dress would be given by the purchaser instead of by the vendor and in that I think he underestimates the position. If a couple of cattle have the warble fly in their systems which will eventually come out on their backs, it does not matter a damn.  The thing to ensure is that the fellow who is cantakerous will do it and that the simple person or the indolent fellow who has not done it because he did not bother to do it will give an effective undertaking that he will do it next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to get leave to sell any of his cattle in the open market, such a person must apply to the Minister for a special ticket, instead of a certificate that he has dressed his cattle, but the formal application must contain either a request to have his cattle dressed or <Col N="564" /> an undertaking to dress them at the first acceptable date in the new dressing year.  If we put it that way, we shall catch every beast and leave nobody out, not even the crooked chap who says he will not dress them.  If that obtains, I agree with Deputy Fanning that if we get somebody who sat tight and said: &ldquo;I will not do it,&rdquo; we may have to go a step further and introduce compulsory powers.  I think the Minister is right, despite the cynical people who go around advocating compulsion&mdash;of course I do not include Deputy Donegan in that.  The Minister should establish every possible means of getting voluntary effort and co-operation before undertaking the final step.  In the heel of the hunt, he will get substantial compliance.  I know Deputy Esmonde will be cross with me, but I do not think we should encourage retention of the derris dressing. I do not believe it was ever worth a damn.  You had to get it and you had to rub it into the warble and it made the warble a damn sight worse than it otherwise would be.  I think a great many warble flies survive the experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Minister that a situation will develop whereby 20 per cent of our cattle, minus the number under three months, will be in the position of not being permitted to be sold in the open market.  In such a case the Minister, I think, must back down.  That may be the wrong word: &ldquo;liberalise&rdquo; is probably a nicer word and I agree with Deputy Esmonde on that.  This must happen and I am sure the Minister will take a decision in his own good time and he will have to liberalise. <Col N="565" /> It would not be possible to contemplate a situation in which 25 per cent of our cattle could not be sold.</P>
      <P>The other point is that as far as I am concerned, and I think this side of the House, we want to see warble flies completely and finally exterminated. We think the Minister was right to introduce a degree of suggestive compulsion, shall we say, in the first year but the Minister could, perhaps, by being a little extra lenient succeed better in getting the cattle dressed than if he pressed this too far.  I am reminded of a line in a play of Shaw's which said that the undeserving poor are just as badly off as the deserving poor and if a fellow by his own indolence, perhaps, fails to have the cattle dressed, with a little bit of luck, he could get away with it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister mind answering the question: if, for one reason or another, whether because of misfortune, misunderstanding or something else, a person has not dressed his cattle by the systemic method, which the Minister wants, and the date having gone by and it now being impossible for him to do so, his cattle will be locked up until 1st September next, would the Minister agree if this person does employ some other methods and proves this to the local agricultural adviser, whoever the Minister likes to nominate, will the Minister permit them to be sold again?  That seems a fair question and I think the Minister should answer it.</P>

I say it is untrue <Col N="568" /> there was sufficient notice in my area and I believe it is extremely likely it was insufficient in other areas.  Will the Minister meet the farmers generally?

      <P>There is a matter the Minister might consider on this section.  Some time ago there was an outbreak of fowl pest and a number of people were required to kill fowl and burn them.  The question of clothing arose.  It turned out that a number of the people concerned&mdash;ordinary workmen working for a day's wages&mdash; were at a considerable loss because they could not pin on anybody the responsibility for replacing clothing which had to be destroyed.</P>

In the country <Col N="572" /> to say to the sister-in-law or brother-in-law of a small farmer that he or she is to be prevented by the Gardaí going to visit a place which they habitually frequent can be a matter of considerable circumstance.

      <P>There is new machinery.  In this legislation the Minister's powers are limited.  Up to now there was no provision for arbitration in these cases.  We are introducing it here for the first time.  A person may be entitled to compensation; the Minister may decide that person contributed to the outbreak himself and his compensation should, therefore, be reduced.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point we want clearly established and perhaps the Minister could clarify the position for us.  There is a certain apprehension abroad&mdash;wholly unfounded, in my judgement&mdash;that if you have a pedigree herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle and the Minister directs the destruction of that herd in order to avoid the spread of a disease with which that herd has become infected, the Minister will take the ten pedigree cattle in that herd and say they are to be valued as butchers' beasts, whereas the herd owner says they are pedigree cows for which he paid anything from £200 to £500 per beast.  My recollection <Col N="574" /> is that where we had to destroy a pedigree herd to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, we paid the owner the true market value of each pedigree beast.  I thought that, if we could not reach agreement on valuation, there was some machinery by which arbitration could be set up to determine the value.  However, I may be wrong in that, but certain it is that the Minister for Agriculture considered himself bound to pay the herd owner the true value of the pedigree cattle and not to compensate him on the presumption that the pedigree cattle were no more than butchers' beasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a long and complicated history.  The 1894 Act set out rates of compensation for different diseases.  The modern Acts in both Britain and Northern Ireland followed more or less the same procedure and set down the rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In each such order the compensation provisions will be stated and the House will have an opportunity of seeing the order and deciding whether the compensation is or is not relevant.  It would certainly be our intention that the full market value would be paid for any animal slaughtered and we would, therefore, necessarily have to have regard as to whether or not the animal was a pedigree animal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>If the owner of an animal or bird slaughtered under this Act at the direction of the Minister or a local authority, has an insurance on the animal or bird, the amount of compensation awarded to him under this Act or any order made thereunder may be deducted by the insurers from the amount of the money payable under the insurance before they make any payment in respect thereof.</P>
      <P>I wonder how that comes in.  Surely if an animal is insured, that insurance should be paid rather than have the State subsidising insurance companies. That is what this amounts to.  It seems to me a most unreasonable provision.</P>

      <P>It is section 18 we are dealing with now.  What is suggested here is that the State should pay and the insurance company should not have to pay the difference.  To me that means a subsidy being paid by the State to an insurance company.  If insurance is payable, I see no reason why the State should pay money which should really be paid by an insurance company.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;where the money is rightfully due&rdquo;.  I was under the impression that the State would also be paid.  Perhaps the Minister has a little machine which helps him to make money, but I was under the impression that it was our own money.  This is money for beasts which are insured and on which insurance is due.  Others do not come into it.  It is only those beasts on which insurance companies would normally pay the amount due.  For some extraordinary reason the Minister suggests that if £100 is due on a beast and if the State <Col N="577" /> pays £80, all that the insurance company has to pay is £20, although it has been collecting premiums on the basis that it would pay £100.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether to take that as praise or otherwise but we will not go into that matter.  Let us take an analogy.  I have been looking up a few costs of insurance such as the cost of insuring under workmen's compensation, plus common law.  A worker on a building site would cost an employer in workmen's compensation plus common law, £8 2s 6d., whereas a worker in a footwear factory will cost the employer £1 15s. 9d.  That is the great difference.  If you increase the risk for an insurance company, the premium will go up.  I could not agree more with the Minister.  I think he is right.  At first, he did not know what the section meant.  Whoever put it in was right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

What is suggested now is that the State should carry, not alone its normal responsibility, but the responsibility for the insured animal also and Deputy Donegan and the Minister are saying that unless this is done, premiums will go up.  If that is correct, it follows that if it is not included and if we include subsection (3) as put down, premiums should be reduced.  We all know that is poppycock.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this which may have escaped Deputy Tully's mind but which certainly escaped my own.  I cannot square subsection (3) with what I understood the Minister to say, that was, that the Department accepted the liability to pay the value of pedigree cattle, because subsection (3) of this section seems to suggest to me that the Department expects hereafter that owners of pedigree herds will insure the difference between the real value of the pedigree beast, which may be 200 guineas, and the value set out in the Minister's order, which may be a flat rate for commercial cattle of £80 a beast actually slaughtered and if the pedigree owner comes to the Minister and says: &ldquo;In respect of my ten cattle, I paid over 200 guineas a beast&rdquo; and the Minister will say: &ldquo;That is your funeral.  All you get under my order is £80 compensation for each beast slaughtered.  It was your responsibility to insure them with an insurance company against foot and mouth disease or any other bovine disease in respect of which a slaughter order might be made for any sum you liked and if you wanted to cover them for 200 guineas, you should have covered them for 200 guineas, less whatever the Minister will in his order pay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> Surely Deputy Tully will face this fact, that if you have to insure your beast for 200 guineas, your premium will be higher than if you only insure for 120 guineas.  The purpose of the Minister's order, as I understand it, will be to see that ordinary commercial farmers will be fully compensated by the Minister if he slaughters their cattle but farmers or breeders of pedigree cattle carry a liability hereafter to insure the difference between commercial value and pedigree value.  That is the meaning of subsection (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the simple principle is defensible.  If the State in the interests of the community orders slaughter, then it should take on as the agent of the community the responsibility for that.  Whether we like insurance companies or not, premiums, by and large, reflect the calls made upon them within some guide lines.  If we are to load on to insurance companies the compensation in cases like this, all we are doing is putting this type of insurance out of the reach of the ordinary farmer because it will become too expensive.  My Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out to me that very often in this type of case we would slaughter animals which would not be affected at all, which might be on neighbouring farms or which would not have incurred any disease or risk of disease.</P>

I think you cannot do anything else in this country when you take a man's property from him in any shape or form except give him full market value compensation. I do not think we can attempt to do it.  It could be that a man, a very prudent type of man, would have a special type of insurance.  As <Col N="581" /> Deputies know, in business there is a type of insurance whereby you can not alone insure your property for its full value but for loss of profits arising out of that property.  There might be something equivalent that a farmer could do in his business and whereas we would pay him full market value for his animal there might be some additional benefit for which he could insure himself and which the insurance company would pay even though we were still paying full market value.  I will look into it.</P>

The farmers are finding it a great hardship to tide themselves over that period with fodder and, possibly, grass.  In many cases small farmers are working on a hand to mouth basis. Where this hardship exists, I wonder could the Minister suggest any form of compensation to carry the farmer over that period where it can be proven that it is a hardship on him.

      <Col N="584" /> I should like to say something on which I know Deputy Dillon will not agree with me.  When the Minister says he represents the veterinary section of his Department, he represents a most conservative body of men, men who have to be undoubtedly but who, as well, depend entirely for their success on so being.  I do not want to make any attack upon them, but I do say the Minister, in his administration of this section in relation to such things as the innocent importation of pheasant eggs which was prohibited, would want to have a second thought. When the Minister goes to seek their wisdom, which they will give him with all good heart, he has got to think first of their conservatism.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that every fair breeze blowing from Scotland can be rotten with fowl pest.  They would need to test all the snipe that arrive and they will discover that half of them are ridden with fowl pest.  It is all right making orders but there is nothing like a politician in between who can see things clearly.  I do not want this to be regarded by me as an expression of hard criticism of any section of the Department.  From the time I arrived in this House, there was nothing irritated me so much as this ridiculous degree of veto on the importation of birds and the birds kept in quarantine afterwards.  I leave it entirely to Deputy McMenamin's memory and his work.  The Minister will see how hard that man worked if he looks up the records.  It was rectified only after he had departed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue this topic raised by Deputy Donegan. It seems to be bringing in white turkeys to a quarantine station since 1955 when we could not bring pheasants in but indeed we were never asked to do so.  Deputy Donegan, whose voice must be heard with respect and will be listened to with respect, fairly charges the veterinary section of the Department with being conservative.  I know Deputy Donegan will agree with me that anybody who is responsible for the entire livestock population needs to be conservative.  There are a great many adventurers as well in this country but when the devil gets out <Col N="585" /> of the bag, you cannot catch him.  They vanish in a cloud.  Unfortunately, the veterinary surgeon of the Department of Agriculture carries the bag and closes the front door which they so triumphantly opened and then abandoned. Sometimes I think the Minister is perhaps a little too liberal in some of his quarantine procedures.  I think, when his predecessor, Deputy Smith, established the quarantine station at Spike Island, it was not a prudent thing to do.  I have never been satisfied that it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I bet the Minister did. On the whole, it is necessary for the veterinary advisers of any Minister for Agriculture to err on the side of conservatism because all the pressures that operate on the Minister for Agriculture will be on the side of liberality and unless he has some anchorage to swing on he will be forced into a course which will seriously jeopardise the whole livestock industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to subsection (1), paragraph (b) of the section which refers to the disinfection of persons entering the State, their clothing and baggage and the giving of such information concerning their occupation and previous movements as the Minister may reasonably require.  I fully recognise the difficulty that exists if men dealing in cattle come in wearing rubber boots off a boat or an aeroplane. Their boots are covered with mud which may have been picked up on an infected farm in an infected area in Great Britain.  I am also acutely conscious of the impact on tourists of large notices threatening them to wash their boots and clothes at every airport they come into.  When we come into our own airport and read menacing notices warning us to wash ourselves from head to foot if we have been in contact with livestock abroad we know damn well we will do no such thing at all.  Despite this there are notices at Dublin Airport calling on us to report to the agricultural office at Dublin Airport, which is all <Col N="586" /> cod because nobody reports there.  Nobody's boots are washed.</P>
    <P>The regulations, I suppose, were made during some foot and mouth disease outbreak in Great Britain. The regulations are still in operation and the notices are still hanging there at Dublin Airport.  I suppose there are similar notices at Limerick and at Cork. We have got to consider very carefully whether it is sensible to go on with regulations of that kind.  Motor cars may pass through infected areas when they come into this country.  They arrive here without having their undercarriages washed at all.  I doubt very much if anybody will bring in on their boots any serious contamination that would spread disease.</P>
    <P>I am certain that this kind of precautions should not be a perennial feature of our system having regard to the importance of the tourist industry. It may be that if there is any dangerous, virulent outbreak of some disease in a confined area of Great Britain it would be reasonable to take such precautions for a strictly limited time.  The Minister, in administering regulations to be made under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 30, ought to take a fresh look at their impact on tourist points of entry into this country. If I were visiting France, Belgium or Spain, and were suddenly challenged in a language I did not understand to prove to a representative, not of the customs or of the passport officials but of the local Ministry of Agriculture, that I should have my boots washed, it would cause me an amount of dismay which would certainly be inconsistent with the promotion of the tourist interests of that particular country.  I would suggest that the Minister for Agriculture should have a further look at this procedure as I think it is simply being allowed to tick over unnecessarily because nobody is particularly concerned with its control.</P>

      <P>I understand this is one of the orders.  A man has to double dip his sheep before he can expose them for sale at a public mart.  In widespread areas in County Galway it is a grave hardship on small farmers who have to travel long distances to comply with this order.  It is a very grave hardship that sheep should be dipped at this period of the year.  I understand that there is a dip on the market which only requires one application and this is effective for the whole year.  It is ridiculous that the sheep should have to be dipped twice. Apart from the hardship, you could have the SPCA on your back in enforcing this.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to have a look at this regulation.  It is a grave hardship over a wide area in my county.  The facilities are not so readily available for sheep dipping especially where there are small sheep owners. They have to travel long distances to comply with this order and this imposes a grave hardship on them.  The Minister should look into this matter. There should be one dipping with the proper type of dip.  That view is held by the County Galway Committee in relation to sheep dipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely not.  Again, let us not get involved in one another's wool. In the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, it is necessary to see to it that people do not go on to an infected farm or, if they do, that they do not come off it.  Suppose some fellow gets cantankerous and says he blooming well is coming off it.  Do you envisage a Department inspector, who may weigh 15 stone and have a waistline of 44, laying violent hands on the man in question and rolling in the dirt, or do you envisage him saying: &ldquo;You cannot come across that fence.  If you <Col N="592" /> do, I will have to call the Garda.  I am accompanied by the Garda.&rdquo;  If he proceeds across the fence, I envisage the Department inspector going to the sergeant and saying: &ldquo;That fellow must be stopped or he may spread this disease,&rdquo; whereupon the sergeant, never running, and never appearing to hurry, proceeds in the general direction of the potential offender and remonstrates with him prudently, ultimately saying: &ldquo;If you will not do what has to be done, you impose upon me the necessity to bring you to the barracks. Surely a man like you does not want to be brought to the barracks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Supposing the Department inspector seizes him, what does he do with him? Does he bring him to the Department of Agriculture and incarcerate him there?  Surely the Minister must see that the situation is grotesque?  If this kind of situation arises, an inspector of the Department ought to be accompanied by a Garda, or preferably a sergeant or an inspector who can call the Garda to enforce reasonable regulations made by the Minister.  I urge the Minister to look at this again and to ask himself this question : &ldquo;What will my inspector do if the unlikely situation arises in which it will become his duty to arrest and apprehend a man?&rdquo; What would the Minister look like if the inspector arrived with a prisoner in the back of the van and deposited him in the Department of Agriculture?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section of very considerable importance.  We are going to authorise the Minister to make it a statutory offence under this section to sell, offer or expose for sale or export any horned cattle.  That is going a long way.  Personally, I dishorned all my cattle many years ago.  I accepted this particular philosophy as wise.  I wanted to avoid cattle hurting one another in sheds.  But it is, nonetheless, true that, in the west of Ireland, if you want to sell a two-year old or a 20 months old heifer for the bull, the shorthorn heifer with horns is worth £7 to £8 more than the same heifer without horns.  The people may grow out of that over the years but that is certainly true today.  Personally, although that is true, I have habitually dishorned all my cattle in the calf stage.  However, I think it is going a long way to forbid people to expose for sale cattle with horns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not underestimate the Minister's dilemma.  I think he is probably trying to take a Draconian decision, to force it through and to get the trouble over.  I think it is one of these things he will not be able to achieve in the near future: I think he is going too far.  I would be prepared to go so far with him as to say that you could not sell for export cattle with horns but I see the Minister's difficulty. <Col N="596" /> He may ask, in reply: How am I to get them dishorned?  It is a veterinary operation after six months of age, and a relatively expensive operation, whereas, if all cattle are dishorned in the calf stage, it could be done by the farmer himself at practically no cost.  I think all that is true but I would remind the House that we are dealing with the livestock industry.</P>
    <P>I want to hear from the Minister his justification for a sudden decision to direct that all cattle in this country must be dishorned.  Is there any precedent for it?  Is there any other country in the world that has done it? Manifestly, the Minister will exclude from this provision pedigree cattle of the shorthorn breed and of other breeds that have horns characteristic of the beast.  However, I certainly would want to hear from the Minister his justification for so sweeping a proposal as is enshrined in section 54.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, I think, to some extent has answered his own question in so far as he tells us he has always had this done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall add to Deputy Dillon's weight in this matter the fact that the NFA and the ICMSA both unanimously agreed that this is desirable. I think that the benefits that will flow from it will be very considerable. These horns serve no useful purpose whatsoever.  They can be responsible for a great deal of damage not alone, as Deputy Dillon mentions, in sheds but also in transport.  It is much more expensive to transport horned cattle. They take up much more room and do more damage.  All in all, I think it would be a very sensible and progressive step to take.  We do not intend to do this overnight.  We would propose to give very adequate notice &mdash;two or three years.  As the Deputy also knows, there is now a very cheap and effective preparation available to enable the growth of horns to be inhibited.  All in all, this is something that is fairly easily done and <Col N="597" /> well worth doing.  We do intend to co-ordinate our activities in this regard with the authorities in the North of Ireland.  Naturally we would have to because of the nature of the trade between the two areas, and we would hope that both jurisdictions would agree on a date when this would be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that is so essential at all.  It would appear to me to be better if we were to have dishorned our cattle here by a certain date and let the other fellows do what they like.  However, the Minister will discuss it with the livestock exporters, the pedigree breeders, and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will do this.  Like Deputy Dillon, I know there are certain people who still wish to see the horn on the shorthorn heifer and there are others who wish to see the horn on the whiteheaded bullock.  However, we can see the Minister's argument.  What I would wish to see is that the Minister and his Department would engage in a campaign, through the local committees of agriculture, to educate people into a realisation of the advantage of dishorning their cattle at the calf stage.  If they are let go to the stage where it is necessary to give an anaesthetic and have the dishorning done by a veterinary surgeon, then it is more expensive and we should probably fail to get it done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in my twenties I undertook the dishorning of cattle and I would do anything from 100 to 150 a day without any anaesthetic.  I did that with the neighbours' cattle for as many as eight years, taking plenty of skull, so that the skull would be shaped right away.  While you would not have as nice a head, you could do it as Deputy Dillon said, by using the appliance when they are small calves.  However, I would suggest to the Minister that in providing an appointed day, he should, first of all, have a period of, say, two years for a campaign, as Deputy Dillon had in regard to tuberculosis, and as the Minister has had in regard to the warble fly.  In having this campaign he should enlist the aid of <Col N="598" /> the societies he suggested and try to get the thinking right before he hurts anyone.  If you go down to the fair in Ballinamore or Ballaghaderreen, there will still be those who prefer the shorthorn heifer with the horns on.</P>

      <P>I would prefer if he were appointed by a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court.  I do not know what Deputy Tully's experience has been but my experience as a member of a local authority has been that while valuers act probably according to their consciences, there is a fear among valuers who are selected by county managers that, if they do not give an award that is agreeable to the mind of the county manager, there is an extreme likelihood that they will never get another job.  From that point of view, I would prefer if, instead of the Minister appointing the valuer, it were left to somebody remote from the affair, a judge in the courts.</P>

I am quite sure that, according to his lights, he will be fair, but it means dissatisfied customers.  If a person who applies for a valuer is not satisfied by the first valuer suggested by the Minister, the Minister can say: &ldquo;I will appoint one myself&rdquo;, and there is no right of appeal.  I would agree with Deputy Donegan it would be better for the person who requires the valuer to know what the alternative was.</P>

Apart from the aspect that this section in itself is not doing anything, I want to point out that it enables the Minister to do this: first of all, compensation can be arrived at by agreement.  If the amount of compensation cannot be arrived at by agreement, a valuer shall be appointed by agreement.  If there is no agreement on the amount of compensation set by the valuer, only then does the Minister say: &ldquo;I will appoint a valuer.&rdquo;  Even still at this point if the valuer appointed by the Minister does not give satisfaction to the customer, then the person concerned can go to arbitration under the Arbitration Act of 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the registration of caravan sites and camping sites, the continuation of the scheme of ministerial guarantees in respect of loans raised for the construction or improvement of holiday accommodation and the provision of resort amenities and continued arrangements for the financing of the various activities of Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939, 1952 and 1957 provide for the registration by Bord Fáilte of certain categories of holiday accommodation, namely, hotels, guest houses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps and motor hotels or motels.  The effect of the registration system is that no person may describe or hold out any premises as an hotel, guest house, etc., unless the premises are registered in the appropriate category with Bord Fáilte.  To secure registration, premises must comply with standards prescribed by Bord Fáilte with my consent and proprietors must file with the Board a statement of maximum prices.  Registered premises benefit from inclusion in the Official Guide published annually by Bord Fáilte and also from various <Col N="604" /> schemes of financial assistance for works of improvement and extension.</P>
    <P>Caravans are playing an increasingly important part in holiday-making and Bord Fáilte say that the present patronage for caravans is predominantly for static caravans for hire on site.  The patrons are mainly family groups and include many families who for financial or other reasons could not take a holiday in hotels.  Caravan sites are not intrinsically attractive, and close control over this form of development is essential to ensure the safeguarding of scenic and other natural amenities.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, provides for the control of certain aspects of caravan site development and general standards for such development have been laid down by the Minister for Local Government.  These powers are operative only in areas to which they have been applied by Order of the Minister for Local Government.  In addition, the use of land for the purpose of caravanning is subject to the approval of the local planning authority under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. Local Government legislation in the matter of caravan sites, however, relates mainly to standards for physical planning rather than operational standards so that in general it may be said that local authorities are concerned with the planning, public health and public amenity standards of caravan development.  Bord Fáilte, however, are anxious to encourage higher operational standards also.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, little progress has been made in the provision of caravan sites to a standard comparable to the best sites in Britain and on the Continent.  An essential step towards the raising of standards of facilities and operations is the introduction of a system of inspection and grading. Bord Fáilte intend also to attract camping visitors from European countries where camping holidays are very popular and it is intended, therefore, that the registration system should extend also to camping sites. Provision has accordingly been included <Col N="605" /> in the Bill for the registration of caravan sites and camping sites by Bord Fáilte in accordance with regulations made with the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power after consultation with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for certain minor amendments of the scheme of guaranteed loans for the provision of holiday accommodation and tourist amendities, which is operated by my Department under section 17 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  Under this scheme the private developer raises a loan from a bank or other lending institution and the repayment of capital and the payment of interest is guaranteed by the Minister.  All loans guaranteed to date have been in sterling and there is some doubt whether the existing legislation would enable a guarantee to be given in other currencies.  This doubt is being removed under the Bill by making it clear that guarantees can be given in currencies other than the currency of the State.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Act restricted guarantee for loans raised for the provision of amenities and services to works related to particular tourist resorts.  With the creation of the regional tourism organisations, and the growing popularity of motoring tourism, initiative in tourism is now growing in places other than those which are traditionally regarded as resorts and it is considered desirable that guaranteed loans should be available for worthwhile tourist enterprises even though they may not be in a recognised tourist resort or associated with a particular hotel.  This is being effected by a modification of the scope of the scheme as set out in the 1952 Act.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Act limited the operation of the scheme of guaranteed loans to a period of five years from the date of passing of that Act.  This period was extended by two further periods of five years by the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1957 and 1961, so that the present scheme is due to expire in 1967.  The Bill provides for a further extension of five years which would have the effect of authorising the continuation of the scheme until 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The Bill also contains provisions for the future financing of the various statutory functions of Bord Fáilte. These functions are paid for out of funds voted annually by the Oireachtas in the form of grants-in-aid to the Board.  There are statutory limits on the aggregate amounts that may be issued to the Board for specified purposes and accordingly it is necessary from time to time according as these statutory limits are reached, to ask the Oireachtas to enact enabling legislation to permit the voting of further funds so as to provide for the continuation of the Board's activities.  It so happens that we are at present nearing the statutory limits applicable to the three main divisions of the Board's activities, namely, the major resort development scheme, the scheme of cash grants for the development of holiday accommodation and the general function of increasing tourism in Ireland.  Accordingly, the Bill contains enabling financial provisions relating to all three functions.</P>
    <P>The resort development scheme was inaugurated under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, which provided for the payment to Bord Fáilte within a ten year period of sums not exceeding in the aggregate £1 million for the giving of grants for major tourist resorts.  From this fund a grant scheme has been operated by the Board to enable such essential schemes as basic site development, provision of promenades, parks and other recreational activities to be undertaken.  The major resorts and resort areas selected by Bord Fáilte for development were:</P>
    <P>Galway/Salthill, Killarney, Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Tramore, Skerries, Kilkee, Youghal, Ballybunion, Lahinch, Arklow, Greystones, West Cork, County Donegal, Achill Island, Dingle Peninsula, River Shannon and Lakes.</P>
    <P>The scheme is carried out by Bord Fáilte in consultation with the local authorities and other local interests. One of the main conditions of the scheme is that there should be a minimum local contribution of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The progress of the scheme in the first four years was slow in terms of <Col N="607" /> physical work but a great deal of work was undertaken in the form of discussions with local interests, formulation of proposals and drafting of plans, the acquisition of land and so on.  With the acceleration of actual development work in the past couple of years, grant payments have increased and we are now reaching the £1 million limit.  The scheme was the first comprehensive programme of its kind and the initial plans and estimates were necessarily of a tentative nature and were subject to modification as the scheme progressed and experience was gained.</P>
    <P>The work programme for some resorts had to be varied because of local conditions, resulting in the abandonment of some items and the substitution of others.  Overall, Bord Fáilte have found it necessary to adopt a more extensive programme to ensure that a significant impact was made and that moneys would not be wasted through inadequate scale or incomplete planning.  Costs have risen considerably since the first estimates were prepared so that, even to finance the original proposals, additional moneys would have been needed.</P>
    <P>A further factor is that the Shannon waterway was not originally included among the areas to be developed and the subsequent addition of the Shannon has absorbed some of the initial fund.  It will be clear from all this that the original £1 million provision is now inadequate.  It is estimated that by the time the complete programme of works at the seventeen resorts and resort areas has been carried through the total cost will amount to £2.5 million.  The rate at which the work can proceed will, of course, depend on the availability of capital.  The provision of funds for this purpose will be covered in the usual way in the annual Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to look ahead and to consider what form resort and amenity development should take to meet the requirements and the tastes of the tourists of the future. All the areas selected for development under the original scheme, with the <Col N="608" /> exception of Killarney and the Shannon waterway, are coastal and the basic attraction in each case is proximity to the sea.  With the development of additional early-season and late-season traffic it is clearly necessary to consider other types of amenities also, as coastal resorts have diminished attraction outside the main summer season. Visitors outside the peak season are increasingly of the &ldquo;special interest&rdquo; type, seeking active sporting holidays such as game-shooting, pony trekking, hunting, angling and golf, as well as national monuments and places of historic interest, and they can thus be attracted to inland as well as coastal tourist centres.  A major increase is expected in motoring tourists from Britain during the next few years as a result of the improvements in the cross-channel services.  The motoring tourist will circulate extensively and will expect to find inland places to visit for interest sake.  I am, therefore, asking Bord Fáilte to undertake the planning of a new resort programme with these criteria in mind.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new scheme involving new centres would obviously involve the provision of additional funds.  It is not possible to make any precise estimate at this stage of what funds would ultimately be required but I am proposing to make provision for a sum of £750,000. Expenditure from this fund will be authorised annually in the light of the availability of capital moneys.  Should the financial position permit relatively early exhaustion of this fund, the Dáil will be asked to increase it in due course.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the raising of the existing limit on the resort development fund from £1 million to £3.25 million&mdash;an increase of £2.25 million, of which £1.5 million is in respect of the completion of the present programme and £0.75 million to provide for a second resort programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the raising of the limit of the amount which may be provided in the form of grants for the development of holiday accommodation. Provision was made in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, for the payment to Bord Fáilte of amounts not <Col N="609" /> exceeding in the aggregate £500,000 for this purpose and this limit was increased to £1.5m. by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1963.  From these funds grants have been provided by Bord Fáilte for the construction of additional holiday accommodation, the improvement of existing accommodation, the provision of indoor and outdoor entertainment facilities for visitors and the provision of staff accommodation.</P>
    <P>The grants, which amount generally to 20 per cent of the cost of the works subject to certain maxima, have stimulated a considerable amount of hotel development involving a total investment of approximately £10 million, including the grants, over the past five years.  The scheme of grants was revised in February, 1964, to provide for increased assistance for new accommodation in resort areas and the grants were extended to include guesthouses providing at least ten guest bedrooms.  Provision was also made for assistance for youth hostels and other categories of visitor accommodation such as colleges or other institutions catering for groups of visitors during the holiday period.</P>
    <P>The amount issued to Bord Fáilte at 31st March, 1965, out of the existing £1½ million fund for holiday accommodation was £1.166 million and the sum voted for the current year is £255,000. The position at the end of the current year will, therefore, be that £1.42 million will have been expended, leaving a balance of only £79,000.  It is, accordingly, necessary to raise the limit of the existing grant fund in order to provide for the continued financing of accommodation development.</P>
    <P>Despite the expansion of accommodation that has taken place, it is clear that further expansion is necessary to accommodate the increasing number of visitors that are being attracted to Ireland each year in accordance with the Second Programme target of doubling 1960 tourist income at constant values by 1970.  In recent years we have been recording an annual increase of 500 to 600 registered rooms, not counting rooms in supplementary accommodation such as boarding houses, private houses, etc., <Col N="610" /> but a recent assessment of the position carried out by Bord Fáilte following detailed investigation, revealed that a far greater rate of increase will be necessary if the 1970 target is to be achieved.  We must therefore continue the scheme of grants for a further period.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to make firm estimates of what grant commitments will amount to as this will depend on the rate of investment by the hotel industry itself.  The proposal in the Bill is to raise the limit on the amount which may be provided for holiday accommodation grants from £1.5 million to £3 million.  This provision, like the provision about resort development grants, is of an enabling nature.  The amounts to be provided in any year will fall to be voted by the Dáil in the normal way under the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the special funds for accommodation grants and for the development of major tourist resorts the cost of administration and general activities of Bord Fáilte are met from an annual grant-in-aid.  From this grant-in-aid the Board are required to meet the cost of overseas publicity and advertising and a wide range of activities, including improvement works at minor resorts, access works and other improvements at places of historic or other special interest, assistance towards developing angling tourism and other sporting attractions, assistance to hotel staff training schemes, grants to meet interest on loans for accommodation and resort development and promotional work in connection with festivals and international conferences.</P>
    <P>Up to 1961, this grant-in-aid was subject to a limit of £500,000 in any year but this limit was removed by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961 and replaced by the provision of a global sum of £5 million, the intention being that for a limited period the level of State expenditure on the development and promotion of tourism would be substantially increased.  It was indicated at the time that, on the basis of annual provisions related to the then current requirements, the sum of <Col N="611" /> £5 million be expected to meet requirements for a period of seven years.</P>
    <P>Circumstances have since made it necessary to modify the objective of allocating the £5 million over a seven-year period.  Increased interest grant commitments, resulting from the increased rate of investment by the hotel industry in the development of holiday accommodation, made it necessary initially to reduce the period to six years and the annual grants-in-aid to Bord Fáilte up to and including the financial year 1963-64 were allocated on the basis of a six-year period. The grant-in-aid for 1964-65 was, however, increased very substantially to allow Bord Fáilte to initiate a programme of increased activity, particularly in overseas publicity and in marketing.  This was necessary because of the growing competition in international tourism, because of the great importance of tourist income in the national economy and particularly because of the formidable target set for tourism in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>At the beginning of the current financial year, the amounts issued to Bord Fáilte were just in excess of £3.5m. and the sum of £1,847,000 voted for this year will bring expenditure above the £5m. limit.  This renders it necessary to enact new legislative provisions to cover the Board's future activities.  The fact that the statutory limit is expected to be reached very shortly makes the enactment of the present Bill a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to work out in advance a rigid programme of expenditure on tourism.  The amount to be provided in any year will depend on the progress made towards the achievement of the 1970 target and also, of course, on the availability of resources.  I am proposing, therefore, to depart from the concept of any fixed limit.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for the deletion of the existing limit of £5m. contained in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, and does not substitute any new limit.  The position then will be that in accordance with section 2 of the <Col N="612" /> 1961 Act the amount to be provided to Bord Fáilte in any year will be determined by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance and will be included in the annual estimates.  There will be no diminution of the degree of control by the Dáil as the money will form part of the Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the usual way.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> aims at doubling income from tourism between 1960 and 1970, in terms of constant 1960 prices.  This is a formidable target and represents an average annual increase of 7.2 per cent compound over the ten year period.  When the Second Programme was adopted in 1963, this rate of increase had not been achieved and consequently the actual rate required from 1963 onwards to double the 1960 income was in fact 7.8 per cent.  It was recognised that competition from other countries was increasing, that the target could not be regarded as an automatic projection of a previous trend and that active promotion and the provision of adequate Exchequer assistance would be necessary during the period of the Second Programme if the target was to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The actual income from tourism, including income earned by Irish carriers, in 1960 was £44.2 million.  Deputies will have seen from the Bord Fáilte annual report for the year ended 31st March, 1965, that the income for the year 1964 amounted to £68 million which in terms of 1960 values represented £57.4 million.  These figures indicate that the increased promotional activities of recent years are showing results and that if the present rate of increase can be maintained, the 1970 target of £88.4 million in 1960 values will be achieved.  There are no grounds for complacency, however, and continued efforts will be necessary in the shape of promotional activities, resort development and provision of accommodation to maintain and provide for the required increase in tourist traffic. With the increase in the number of visitors to the country the services provided at local level and the interest <Col N="613" /> and enthusiasm of local enterprise take on great importance.  The new regional companies have provided a new impetus for local and regional activities and I would like to take this opportunity of saying how valuable is the contribution of the regional companies&mdash;the officers and members and all who co-operate with them&mdash;and I have no doubt that we can look forward to the continued growth of this excellent work.</P>
    <P>Deputies are, I am quite sure, aware of the important contribution which the tourist industry makes to the country's economy.  Income from tourism for the year 1964 represented more than one-sixth of the country's total overseas income on current account for that year.  It is the largest of our invisible exports accounting for nearly 50 per cent of such exports.  In comparison with visible exports, tourist income was second in importance only to food, drink and tobacco in 1964 and exceeded the income from exports of live animals for that year by more than £1 million.  An important feature of the tourist industry is that it is primarily based on domestic resources, involving little dependence on imported goods.  Because of the decentralised character of the industry its benefits extend to all parts of the country and it is an important factor in assisting the less developed areas of the West and South.</P>
    <P>I am confident that as a result of the increased promotional activities of recent years and the improvement in travel facilities, the upward trend in tourist traffic to this country can be maintained, provided the necessary resources and facilities are made available. The principal purpose of this Bill is to enable these resources to be provided and I accordingly confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important measure and I would say it comes before the House at an opportune time inasmuch as it precedes the annual Estimate.  In the course of his speech we were warned by the Minister that certain moneys will in future appear in <Col N="614" /> the Estimates rather than as hitherto arranged.</P>
      <P>Tourism cannot be regarded as anything but important in our economy.  It comes second&mdash;indeed, there have been times when, as the Minister said, it exceeded the export of live animals&mdash;in order of importance in the economy of this country, agriculture coming first.  It is important, therefore, that money be made available but, side by side with the availability of that money, there must be careful planning to ensure that the money will be spent not alone in those areas geographically likely to produce the best results but wisely at all times. That is a precept readily accepted, I think, by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill contains a few widely different sorts of provisions.  The first relates to caravans and caravan sites. I appreciate the effort at tidying up through the medium of planning and sanitary services by the Department of Local Government.  There should, I think, be a very close liaison between the Ministry of Transport and Power, and particularly Bord Fáilte, with the Department of Local Government, but I am not so sure that this onslaught, as I call it, on caravan sites legislatively, apart altogether from the planning and the sanitary side of it, is desirable at the present time.  I think it would be better if Bord Fáilte worked by themselves, without the aid of a provision such as this, with the Department of Local Government in relation to planning and the sanitary side of the matter.  I take it, however, that Bord Fáilte have gone into this matter with great care and are now seeking to have camping sites registered under a wide variety of names.  I do not know that the names I have read will include everything or whether there will be a way out, but I should like to know whether this register will carry with it the obligation on the part of the owner of the ground upon which caravans are either permanently parked or may be parked to pay a fee to Bord Fáilte in the same way as hotels do.  I should like to be clear on that at the outset. The inclusion of the names of the people who have these sites in Bord <Col N="615" /> Fáilte brochures will, of course, be valuable to the owners of the sites, but I should like to know whether they will as a matter of course have to pay for that inclusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right when he talks about standards and the necessity for them.  Standards are necessary not alone in the tourist industry but in all industry.  However, I would be very careful in this regard because the Minister then goes on to talk about the necessity for inspection and for grading. A considerable amount of irritation is caused in the hotel industry by inspection and by subsequent grading.  The resentment does not spring from the actual result but rather from the method of obtaining that result.  Some Bord Fáilte inspectors make themselves, according to the information at my disposal, particularly objectionable. That applies to some of them, not to all.  I suppose it would be hard to find perfection all round but, nevertheless, everything that gives rise to irritation in an industry such as this should be wiped out forthwith and the people responsible, the executive heads of Bord Fáilte, should be on the look out for anything that is objectionable and accept the principle that their officials must not necessarily be always right.</P>
    <P>With regard to guaranteeing loans and so on, this arose last week or the week before on other Bills with reference to other currency.  I take it the same principle is being applied here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's enthusiasm for regional tourism organisations is an enthusiasm I do not share.  Neither do I deprecate anything that is being done but there are organisations which not alone I but other people are watching with some apprehension and not a little caution.  We are living in an age of management and management consultancy in which great stress is placed not alone on the necessity for planning but also on the ability to plan. While I do not propose to go into the matter at great length here, I am having some inquiries made&mdash;some are completed&mdash;into the manner in which regional tourism directors or managers have been chosen, particularly <Col N="616" /> from the point of view of lack of previous experience, certainly in tourism and, generally speaking, lack of experience in administration of any kind.  If what I am told is correct&mdash; that they did a rapid course in either Bray or Greystones shortly after appointment&mdash;that does not seem to me to satisfy the general trend towards management.  I shall leave it at that for the moment.  I shall be able to deal with all of them when we come to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the spending of money on tourism and the development of tourism to the point at which we will reach the target set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, then we must at every level of this industry not alone seek for but get competence, and particularly at the executive and administrative levels.  That competence can only come from training and experience.  I know of at least three cases where neither the training nor the experience was available from the persons chosen.</P>
    <P>That is the critical side of the picture.  I want to say, on the other side, that Bord Fáilte have done great work in the development of major resorts.  I speak for a few of them, particularly of what they did at Keem Bay, Achill, in my constituency.  I have seen their efforts in the various places mentioned by the Minister.  They certainly did not spare any effort in preserving the scenic beauty of Keem Bay and in making it more readily accessible.  It is a tremendous job. It is a sightseeing amenity in itself, apart altogether from the fact that the work they have carried out makes the splendour and grandeur of Keem Bay more readily accessible.  I do hope that the planning and sanitary authorities in local government will not allow the very fine vista that has been created by Bord Fáilte to be upset or its value decreased as a tourist resort and amenity.</P>
    <P>Waterways have been mentioned and, in particular, the Shannon.  I wonder if Bord Fáilte would concentrate on the establishment of safety points and radio telephonic communication in relation to the Shannon, <Col N="617" /> particularly at the points where there are lakes.  The whole country was shocked this year by the awful tragedy in which a father and two sons lost their lives.  Admittedly, the weather was bad and navigational difficulties at their very worst.  It has occurred to me and to others that some kind of radio telephonic communication with points on the mainland might have been of some assistance.  That is certainly something that should be considered with a view to trying to avoid tragedies of that kind.  I do not think that we can go too far in trying to secure safety measures for persons using waterways.  I throw out that suggestion. I do not know how practicable it is but it should be examined.</P>
    <P>In view of the shortness of the tourist season, the provision of indoor recreation facilities is another matter that should get prior attention.  At seaside resorts younger people find a rainy day a bit much and we do have the odd rainy day.  People who are building hotels should provide playrooms.  I do not mean nurseries; I mean rooms where billiards, snooker and other indoor games can be played.  That suggestion should be made to hoteliers. It might not be too difficult to assist them.  If people are driven indoors by wet weather, there should be some indoor activity in which they can engage.</P>
    <P>While I notice that the Minister is anxious to delimit the amounts provided in some way and to increase them in annual Estimates and that the Dáil will have control over them, that is a target that should be set but it must be made clear that while increases are being provided for, £1 million to £2½ million and so on, that money is not available at the moment to people who would start in now to look for it. It is probably a part of long-term planning.  People should not be given to understand that there is money readily available for them as from the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The use of colleges for groups is a feature that should be pursued. There are many excellent places that could be used during the summer. Bord Fáilte should make inquiries <Col N="618" /> from the principals or boards of management of these schools as to their availability.  They may be doing that.  It should be made more generally known to overseas groups that these places are available.  I have taken part in a number of conferences abroad organised by philanthropic bodies who had taken over boarding schools for the purposes of the conferences.  I have known this to be the case in Switzerland and in France.  That could be done here.  These boarding schools have the equipment, the accommodation and the amenities required by large groups of people attending conferences.</P>
    <P>On the question of the expenditure of money abroad on marketing and advertising in competition with other countries, I would suggest that our greatest tourist reservoir is Great Britain.  There is a large population there.  The holidaymakers have money to spend and they are good spenders. We can succeed in getting only a certain number of American tourists. We have not got what would be called the top-class accommodation that most Americans seem to require.  We have got in the main middle-class accommodation, the modest, moderate accommodation, modest in what it represents and moderate in its charges. That is the area where our greatest hope lies for increasing tourism.  I do not think that travel agents meeting in Hong Kong or anywhere else are greatly beneficial to this country's tourist industry.  I am not complaining about the fact that representatives of Bord Fáilte and kindred organisations attend conferences abroad.  I am just wondering what the value of it is. There should be greater concentration on Britain, which has the population and the money.</P>
    <P>I have said in this House many times that in the training of hotel personnel sponsored by Bord Fáilte emphasis should be placed on local dishes, not alone meat dishes, but fish dishes.  It is largely a matter of presentation.  An area, whether a big resort like Galway or Dún Laoghaire, or a small resort like Enniscrone, or some of the smaller villages in Achill. can become famous because of some <Col N="619" /> special dish or some characteristic peculiar to it.</P>
    <P>Speaking for my Party, on the whole, I welcome this Bill.  There are many aspects of it that require minute examination, and that, of course, we will come to on Committee Stage. But, just now, having regard to the Minister's speech and his very full explanation of all the provisions in this Bill, I see no difficulty in giving him the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken this opportunity to give a pretty comprehensive but not too long review of the tourist industry, the experiences of the past and his optimistic hopes for the future which we all share. Everything that has been claimed for the tourist industry has, by and large, been correct.  It is true that the industry is a big moneyspinner in this country but the main feature of it is its seasonal character.  I suppose there is nothing at all we can do about that.  However, it is unfortunate that those people who get their initial employment in the tourist industry&mdash;those in hotel work&mdash;have not an opportunity to work here after the season is over.  They have to go away and away in this case is usually Great Britain or some places farther afield.  Of course, many of them are not encouraged to stay for the next season because, unfortunately, the pay, in very many cases, is extremely small. The correcting of that situation, of course, is in the main the business and responsibility of the trade union movement but I am afraid there are some unscrupulous employers in the tourist industry at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort was made some time ago by Bord Fáilte, with much encouragement from the Minister, to extend the season, an extension always meaning that it should be extended into the month of September and some part of the month of October.  That has not met with great success.  It is generally accepted that June is by far the best month of the year as far as the weather is concerned.  But, for the family who want to take a holiday away from their own home, it is out, because no family man or parents <Col N="620" /> could ever contemplate taking children on holiday in the month of June, which is the examination month in the schools.  It is a pity that such a good month is wasted because it is a month during which there is a fair amount of accommodation in the hotels.  We have been talking about this for very many years.  I think the Minister, as Minister in charge of tourism, should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Education, in order to see how best the school year could be revised so that families could go on holiday during the month of June.</P>
    <P>I was one of the critics of the regional tourist bodies or companies to which the Minister referred in his speech and to which Deputy Lindsay has referred also.  The Minister will recall that I was pretty keen on the formation of these regional companies but merely questioned the method by which certain of the members were appointed or selected.  However, that objection which I and many more of my colleagues from different sides of the House had at that particular time has dissolved somewhat.  I can speak only about my own part of the country and the regional company in the south-east seem to be going quite well and I should say, they are pretty energetic as well.</P>
    <P>We have not done enough to promote the tourist industry from one point of view in this country.  I do not speak about outside tourists; I speak about our own holidaymakers here.  I remember a slogan in connection with holidays &mdash; I forget the title of the monthly or bi-monthly booklet produced which had a caption which read &mdash;&ldquo;See Ireland first&rdquo;.  The tendency in recent times, for those who can afford it, is to go abroad.  Bord Fáilte have some function here in advertising Ireland to the Irish people.  There are many people who have been in Spain, Germany, other parts of Europe and all over Great Britain who have never seen places 50 miles from their own home town.  In view of our present difficulties in regard to the balance of payments, we should make a contribution in that respect next year, maybe, the year after, and indeed any time we have this particular difficulty in <Col N="621" /> whatever degree we may have it.  We should concentrate on trying to keep as many people as possible at home here.  A friend of mine who was accustomed to going abroad and who spent his holiday here this year told me he was thrilled at what he saw in Ireland. He was also ashamed to admit that a lovely holiday such as this was on his doorstep and that he had not availed of it until then.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, whilst concentrating on trying to get tourists from abroad, should also endeavour to see that money does not go out of the country unnecessarily.  They should try to persuade people from Wexford that Clonmel would be a good holiday centre and people from Deputy James Tully's constituency to go over to the West.  There are, as I say, people who have been in Spain, Germany, France and all over Great Britain who still do not know the beauty of Killarney, Mayo, different parts of the North, central Ireland and also the south. Therefore, Bord Fáilte could do a very good job, particularly in our present circumstances, in including people to see Ireland first before they venture abroad.  Every town in Ireland has its attractions, not alone for the foreign visitor but for the Irish as well who have never seen these places.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has realised the necessity for more money for advertising Ireland abroad.  I cannot say I have travelled extensively abroad, but, when we see our publicity in Switzerland and other countries in Western Europe, we realise how very poor our publicity and advertising are when set beside the publicity for these countries in railway stations, on public hoardings and in newspapers.  If we want to attract tourists, we will have to try to compete with these other countries on the same level of publicity and advertisement as these countries.</P>
    <P>Here I am in perfect agreement with Deputy Lindsay.  It has always been my view that the greatest potential for tourism in this country is Great Britain.  The attractions are so obvious that there is no necessity for me to mention them here.  Suffice it to say that the journey is short and the fact that the majority of our people speak <Col N="622" /> the same language should be an attraction to the British tourist.  We should concentrate on him to a very great extent.</P>
    <P>The travel companies are doing an excellent job in this field of advertising.  We know these travel companies, particularly in Dublin as well as in Cork and other parts of the country, are advertising to a pretty good extent in the British newspapers, particularly the British Sunday newspapers.  Of course, they are doing a good job of work for themselves but, incidentally, they are doing it for tourism in this country.  I know that many of their representatives have travelled, not alone in Great Britain but all over the world to get business for themselves but in so doing they are also helping the tourist industry here.</P>
    <P>Apropos these regional companies, the south-east regional company is engaged in an excellent venture, the contacting of Welsh people to swop tourists.  This is an excellent idea.  I think we have got the better part of the bargain over the past couple of years.  However, the Welsh are businesslike enough to catch up on that.  By and large this business of encouraging people from Wales and from the other parts of Great Britain to this country is very good indeed. We had a very successful Welsh Week in Wexford town during which many features attractive to the Welsh people were staged.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to impress upon Irish hotels their special obligation to buy Irish at all times because the hotels are the main advertising centres for Irish products.  It is embarrassing when in the company of visitors having a meal in an hotel one of them picks up a cup or a saucer to discover that it is made in Hong Kong, Great Britain, or some such place.  The majority of visitors tend to turn up ashtrays only to find that they are not made in Ireland. This makes a mockery of the whole business of Irish tourism because when visitors come to Ireland, they want to see Irish made articles.  If we want to advertise ourselves in the industrial field, we will have to show those tourists that our Irish hotels, which, as <Col N="623" /> I say, are the focal point for tourists, buy Irish.  Their tableware, furniture and ashtrays should be made in Ireland.  As Deputy Treacy reminds me, our souvenirs should be made in Ireland.  Souvenirs in Ireland have become a bit of a joke because so many of them are made in Japan or Hong Kong.  Souvenirs have become a joke not alone in this country but throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Hotels should also be induced to encourage the sale of Irish drinks, whether stout, ale or whiskey.  There should be an obligation on Irish hotels, not alone from the point of view of tourism but from an industrial point of view to introduce, more or less in the role of salesmen, Irish products to visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his remarks with regard to the registration of hotels, mentioned that hotel prices had to be more or less approved by him.  I was glad to hear that, because I remember some time ago, about six months ago or it could be 12 months ago, he had occasion to take some Irish hotels to task because of the high prices they charged.  He had occasion to say&mdash;I do not propose to give his exact words&mdash; that many of the Irish hotels were pricing themselves out of the market.</P>
    <P>I think that is so in respect of a small number of big hotels.  On the other hand, it ought to be said that in the majority of Irish hotels, that is, the ordinary hotels&mdash;I do not know what the grade is&mdash;the prices charged are very low indeed.  They are much cheaper than one would get in many parts of the world.  It is only in a minority of hotels that the prices are very dear.  If the Minister says he has a responsibility to approve maximum prices, why did he make the speech with regard to the prices that certain hotels were charging?  He could have done something about it if, in his opinion, the prices were too high.</P>
    <P>I should also like to bring to the notice of the Minister the fact that many places are not registered hotels. I do not know what one would call them&mdash;you could call them guesthouses or anything you like.  Many of them <Col N="624" /> are undesirable establishments which advertise abroad.  The solution is not very simple but there are some places in the country which do considerable damage by advertising certain facilities and prices, particularly in the British newspapers and entice people to this country.  They offer them wretched service and charge them very high prices.  They fleece them to some extent, and destroy the good name of the tourist industry in this country. If they want to be registered, they apply to Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte set certain standards and it is on those standards that it is decided whether or not the particular establishments will be registered.  If they do not want to apply for registration, they can still carry on as hotels.  They advertise abroad as &ldquo;The Red Rose&rdquo; or some such place and it is assumed by people who read those advertisements abroad that they are reputable establishments. When those people come over here, they find the services in those places are bad, the conditions awful and the prices not at all what they should be.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of seeing only some resort schemes but as far as expenditure and the results are concerned, generally speaking, they were satisfactory.  I can only talk about one or two places the Minister mentioned and I would say that the efforts of the local authorities, the Department of Local Government and Bord Fáilte were very well worthwhile.  I have an interest in a scheme in my home town, the Ferrybank scheme, which does not seem to be making much progress.  I do not say it is the Minister's fault.  It may be the fault of Bord Fáilte or the local engineer but as one who has the main responsibility, the Minister might take some interest in it.  This scheme was mooted about two years ago but so far not a spade has been put into the ground.  I know there are planning difficulties but the money end seems to be all right.  Two years seem to have been wasted in that no construction or building has been done.  I know plans had to be prepared but two years, in my opinion, is far too long.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the Minister.  I do not know whether he deserves it or not or <Col N="625" /> whether CIE should get it.  I know the Minister has an interest in this matter. I refer to the improvement at Rosslare Harbour.  An excellent job of work was executed there.  I visited the place recently and I saw the cars being rolled on and off.  The work was done very quickly.  I also availed of the opportunity to talk to some of the people who brought their cars here and some who went out with their cars and they were extremely pleased. There are other improvements contemplated there, and if they are effective, I am sure they will do the tourist industry a tremendous amount of good and will do good to the image of Irish efficiency in respect of traffic.</P>
    <P>The Bill is supposed to deal primarily with the registration of caravan sites and camping sites.  I will not say a lot on this except that the Minister did not give very much information.  Caravan sites and camping sites are now to be registered under section 2, subsection (c).  The Minister will be entitled to make regulations regarding the general service in those sites, and so on, but he has not given us any idea what, roughly speaking, these regulations will include or whether or not they will be in operation by next year. The fact that we have not had caravan or camping sites in this country in recent years has been a loss to our tourist industry.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  The local authorities, through the various county medical officers of health, have clamped down on those undesirable sites, and I suppose rightly so.  Some of those sites are undesirable from the point of view of lack of necessary services.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will consult with the Minister for Local Government before he makes the regulations. I wonder why he did not mention the Minister for Health because, after all, general sanitation is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I think the Minister for Health should make those regulations.  We do not want too much consultation on this but the Minister for Health is certainly the person who should be consulted.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I did not quite get the <Col N="626" /> message about section 3.  The Minister has a similar obligation here wherein he proposes in respect of transport generally and borrowing, that borrowing from outside, no matter in what currency, will be guaranteed by the State.  I cannot understand how it applies in section 3.  He will have to be concerned with dollars and francs. If it were a Bord Fáilte borrowing, I could understand it, but I cannot understand why we should be concerned about the issue of loans in any other currency to those who would look for them for hotels and things like that.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have no objection to the proposals in this Bill, but I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the remarks I made which are designed to ensure that the tourist industry will achieve the target which the Minister hopes to achieve so far as income is concerned by 1970.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention the provisions in section 2 which control caravan sites.  I think we can look forward to a tremendous increase in that traffic next year.  Our improved car ferry service will mean that many thousands more British tourists will be coming here with caravans.  While we all welcome this trend, we must be very careful to see that we will not have shanty towns around our seaside resorts.  Down south last summer, I noticed a tremendous number of caravans. In some places they were not spaced very nicely and they could be the start of shanty towns which would be hideous and spoil the whole area. While this may be largely a matter for the local authorities, I think Bord Fáilte should co-operate to the utmost with these authorities to ensure that caravan sites and parks are properly laid out, with all the necessary amenities, so that when a British tourist comes here, he can park his caravan in a nice place, with all services laid on.  I think this is the new pattern of tourism and I think it will develop very much indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also noticed down south that some towns have no town parks.  It has been stated by other speakers that we should concentrate more on Britain for our tourists than anywhere else.  I am inclined <Col N="627" /> to agree that that is at least partly true.  Something which is very dear to the heart of the average Englishman is a properly laid out town park.  In Tralee there is a very nice park which has been praised by many English tourists, but in some of the bigger towns nearby, there are no parks.  The English tourist likes to take scenic trips but he likes to come back and relax in a park, if it is properly laid out.  It is deplorable that in some towns no attempt has been made to provide any kind of park.  Perhaps in some towns there is an open space which is called the town park, but it is a barren space with no flowers or anything else.  I urge the Minister to use his influence with Bord Fáilte to try to get some united action with the local authorities to provide town parks in places such as Killarney.</P>
    <P>They should also provide bowling rings.  Bowling is a very popular game in Britain today and we should spend money making such facilities available rather than spend it on grandiose schemes.  We want to provide the simple pleasures for the people who come here.  The average English person who comes here is a simple person. He does not want plush hotels.  He wants to stay in a clean place where the food is good, and he wants the more simple pleasures of life.  If we examined these facets of the tourist trade in an effort to attract the average Englishman and his wife, and if we gave them the simple things which they seek, we could improve that traffic very much indeed with very little outlay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I realise, as everyone else in this country does, the importance of tourism.  The more we can do to encourage tourists to come to this country and to spend more money in whatever currency may be available the better for all.  I could not agree more with what Deputy Corish said about the Minister and Bord Fáilte encouraging tourism by our own people in our own country.  The Minister is in charge of CIE and he, more than anyone else, could encourage <Col N="628" /> this, because if CIE co-operate and organise cheap tours to places of interest in various parts of our own country, we will be going a long way towards giving our own people a better holiday with better facilities and, at the same time, they will be spending their money in our own country.</P>
      <P>Everyone who knows the country knows you can have a better time at home than anywhere else if you know where to go, and if there is proper transport organisation to bring family parties to the beauty spots. The Minister should give earnest consideration to that, because so far no one has been able to get families from various parts of our own country to go to our own resorts, whether inland or by the sea.  The sooner that is done the better.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister how is the amount of money that tourism is worth to this country determined and in what manner?  Can the Minister tell me does someone suddenly say that tourism is worth £70 million?  I find it very difficult to imagine how this can be found out.  I know questionnaires are handed to people who come in at Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare and elsewhere.  They are asked the amount of money they have to spend. Many of them look on this as a joke and the answers they put down are certainly jocose too.  I should like to know has the Minister any particular slide rule which will give the actual figure for tourism.  I do not say that in any cavilling manner but it would be nice to know that tourism was actually worth £60 million, or £70 million, or whatever the figure may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could also do much to encourage local authorities down the country to provide amenities such as those mentioned by Deputy Moore.  If there is one thing more than anything else people who are travelling complain about, it is the lack of public conveniences in towns throughout the country.  I know there are difficulties in providing these conveniences.  There are difficulties for the local authorities because the people in the various towns do not want public conveniences sited in the places where they might be <Col N="629" /> of most use.  The Minister and Bord Fáilte should encourage local authorities to persuade people in small towns to take a less restrictive attitude on this and we might be able to get around that aspect which would be good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I also think there is something in what was said earlier about charges in hotels being too high in some cases.  In the main I think everyone agrees that most of our hotel charges are fair and the facilities provided reasonably good. If we have the &ldquo;odd man out&rdquo;, as we say in my part of the country, then eventually that person is found out and the customer goes elsewhere.  For the good of the country as a whole, and its reputation, if the Minister finds there are certain hotels which have overcharged, it would be well to whisper in their ears that they should mend their ways.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope everything will be done to encourage the tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  There is not very much in it. When the Minister talks about caravan sites, he talks more or less of the static caravan, the caravan which is permanently sited and people take it for the holiday period.  This is going into big business in this country at the present time.  I am afraid we may tend to overlook the other aspect of it, that is, the person who hitches a caravan to the back of the car and takes the family around the country for the purpose of having a cheap holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want anybody to get the impression that I am decrying the efforts of those who try to provide the proper types of amenities for the customers of the static or parked caravan but I should like to point out that it is no longer a cheap holiday for the person who takes a caravan parked at a site where there are certain amenities, perhaps a very good caravan and reasonable accommodation. At the same time, costs are going up.  In the summer, particularly in July <Col N="630" /> and August, costs are pretty high for the ordinary person.  Therefore, the person who can get for hire or borrow a caravan which he can take along himself is in fact able to have a much cheaper holiday.  What I want to convey is that I should not like to see the caravan site for the mobile caravan completely passed over.</P>
    <P>In the area where I live, there are a couple of caravan sites.  There is one very fine caravan site, with all sorts of amenities, for static or permanently-sited caravans.  I know that, in the summer, this has resulted in a very big inflow of cash to the area.  The people who come there are, I suppose, 90 to 95 per cent Irish.  I think most caravanners find the same thing when they rent a caravan site.  The people who come are, in the main, Irish people who move around to places like this on a holiday.  The other caravan sites that are there are for the caravan which is halted on the site.  I should not like the Minister to set down too hard and fast a rule about this because there is a danger that we will put the mobile caravan on to the side of the road again.  If we insist on too drastic regulations, there is always the danger that people will not be able to meet the standards.  As a result, we may close down the caravan site completely. Caravans will then park along the road again and, apart from being a traffic hazard, will be an annoyance to people in the houses near where they park.  The Minister should watch that end of it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows of the situation whereby long-standing hotels in this country were written off because they did not meet certain requirements. I have in mind one small hotel in this city with nine bedrooms.  For years, the proprietors had advertised it as a hotel.  Then they spent over £2,000 on remodelling it.  They made it into an excellent hotel, still with nine bedrooms. Bord Fáilte examined the hotel and decided it could not be classified as a hotel and, as far as they were concerned, it became merely a guest-house. They refunded the contribution which was paid.  We had the ridiculous position that this building which had been used as and called a hotel for <Col N="631" /> years became overnight a guesthouse because Bord Fáilte had too rigid an interpretation of the rules.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, a man told me that he and his wife ran a guesthouse in the city last year.  Not alone did they receive letters of commendation from satisfied customers from other parts of the country and from across the water but even Bord Fáilte themselves sent copies of some letters they received and indicated how glad they were that the people had received favourable treatment and were satisfied with their bargain.  This year, they applied for registration as a guesthouse and were refused on the ground that they had not five bedrooms, but, in fact, only four.  This sort of thing is very frustrating.  While I suppose there has to be some type of regulation, at the same time, too rigid an interpretation of a certain set of rules, if applied to caravan sites, may do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who have never accepted the figures given for tourist spending in this country.  The Minister and I have had this matter out across the floor of the House.  I do not propose to go into it now except to say that the figure taken from a sample of people coming into the country can be only marginally correct.  I am told by some people that it is very accurate.  I am not prepared to accept that at all. In this case, we are dealing with people most of whom already live in this country.  I could not agree more with Deputy Corish and with Deputy Lyons that these people can be encouraged to continue taking their holidays in this country, which means a moneyspinner; it means an awful lot of money being spent here which otherwise might go abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not agree entirely with Deputy Corish about the travel agents.  Some of them have been circularising people, who they think might be interested, with brochures about other countries and have not bothered to slip in a brochure about the Irish resorts.</P>
    <P>One of the things which will eventually do irreparable harm to holidaying <Col N="632" /> in this country is this question of prices.  Have no doubt about it that some of the hotels and restaurants in Ireland have gone completely screwy where prices are concerned.  There are still in the city and throughout the country decent hotels and restaurants where you can get a good meal at a reasonable price but there are others where you cannot and where you pay a fantastic price, particularly if you speak with an out-of-town accent.  If they know you are not a local, they appear to think that the sky is the limit.  The prices some people are asked to pay in some of those places for very bad meals&mdash;they can hardly be called meals at all&mdash;are doing an awful lot of harm to the tourist industry and to the attraction of the types of tourists who would be prepared to have their holidays in this country.  I know that if you go to the Continent, you may be charged fantastic prices for very bad food and that that can be quoted back to us when we make complaints such as this, but I do not think it is any answer to it.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have assisted Meath County Council in planning a park in Laytown.  I was interested in Deputy Moore's reference to parks.  Unfortunately, they have not given them very much except the plan.  I think that if they gave a few £s more towards the setting-up of the park, it would be appreciated a lot more.  The plan is excellent: there is no doubt about it. It looks very well, such as it is, but they could spend more.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say if there is any type of grant which can be given through Bord Fáilte to try to preserve an amenity?  I have in mind portion of Bettystown where the sand has become cropped&mdash;what they call a burrow.  Whenever the east wind blows, the whole area is covered with fine sand.  There have been numerous complaints.  It is bad enough when it happens in winter, when there are no visitors, but the fact that that can happen and does happen in the summertime is doing irreparable harm in an otherwise lovely area.  Perhaps the Minister would say if there is any type of grant or assistance which could <Col N="633" /> be given to try to prevent this sort of thing happening.</P>
    <P>One final thing we had today during Question Time, and will have, le cúnamh Dé, later on tonight, was a discussion on the Garda Band.  That band appeared in America last year and Bord Fáilte is on record as saying they gave Ireland £1 million worth of publicity.  If it is decided finally to disband the band, would it be too much to ask the Minister if Bord Fáilte would be in a position to give some assistance to have it retained because the publicity given by the tour of the band last year did a great deal of good for Ireland.  People who never heard of this country became interested because they saw this Irish band playing in America and in Canada subsequently. Perhaps the Minister might make a comment on that when he is replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not know whether to welcome this Bill or not.  I would welcome it in the ordinary course but when I find Bord Fáilte taking more control I abhor it.  Any major project Bord Fáilte or their predecessors before them, the Irish Tourist Board, have ever tried, has been a failure.  They started off by buying luxury hotels throughout the country, hotels for which we had no customers whatsoever and hotels which they were very glad to get rid of later on.  The next gimmick they tried was An Tostal.  We remember the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on An Tostal.  Where is it today?  What good did it do this country apart from spending the ratepayers' money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing we heard of Bord Fáilte was in regard to their tourist promotion in the United States of America.  To cater for the prospective tourists they provided hundreds of thousands of pounds for luxury hotels and neglected the small hotels, neglected the real tourist area from which we get our main tourists, namely, the Six Counties and Britain. Practically every paper you take up in the off season has some reference to a Bord Fáilte promotion in some part of the United States seeking tourists for this country.  I wonder what is the actual economic advantage <Col N="634" /> to this country of American visitors here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the tourists from Britain and the Six Counties?  They will bear a very unfavourable comparison with our tourist influx from Britain which we have neglected down through the years.</P>
    <P>Many of the tourists visiting our country come by air, and the first thing they visit is our airport at Dublin. If they visit the bar there they find they have to pay 3/4 for a small whiskey.  We are trying to control the price of whiskey throughout the country but there is no mention of trying to fix the price of whiskey at the airport or the price of a meal either.  If the airport is the front window of the country we should give it an image of the country and ensure that these exorbitant prices are not charged at the airport or at CIE tourist establishments.  Again, in our principal tourist resorts where there is a CIE hotel, unfortunately it does not cater for the ordinary Irishman.  It caters only for the plutocrats who come to stay there overnight usually as the guest of some Irish company seeking promotions abroad.  These tourist hotels which, are financed by the rate-payers' money should be more amenable to the ordinary citizen and the charges should be much more reasonable than they are.  I am certain that practically five per cent of the visitors who stay at CIE hotels are not Irish and very many of our CIE hotels are certainly not as full as they should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to give my opinion.  The Minister came to my county in Bundoran to a dinner given by the Fianna Fáil Party.  He said £100,000 would be spent by Bord Fáilte in a very short time.  Not one penny has been spent on Bundoran other than a plot of land bought by a Fianna Fáil henchman at Bundoran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the fault of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that one man in Bundoran wanted to spend £30,000 developing a caravan site and other amenities for tourists at Bundoran and he was turned down by the local authority, and the local authority were able to tell him there was a technical reason why they were turning it down.  The real reason is that Bord Fáilte want to develop the property.  This man said: &ldquo;Let them develop it if they need it&rdquo; but they have not told him yet whether they want it or not, and this very night they are meeting again in Bundoran with the local authority. This is another red herring to prevent the money being spent in Bundoran.</P>
      <P>I do not mind the local authority controlling the caravan sites there but I object to Bord Fáilte controlling them.  That is my principal objection to this Bill.  The local authority have done a very reasonable job.  We must get permission from the local authority under town planning before we can develop a site as a caravan site.  We must comply with the sanitary authority; we must comply with the health authority and with the local authority. Having done all that, we must now come to Bord Fáilte and seek their permission for registration of that site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is all this red tape going to lead us?  Why can there not be one control, either the local authority or Bord Fáilte?  I know the money people have spent in my own county, and not one penny of assistance has been given by Bord Fáilte in developing caravan <Col N="636" /> sites.  Bord Fáilte now comes along with this red herring in regard to registration of these sites, saying: &ldquo;We will not allow you to register that site.  Therefore, you may no longer use it other than for the statutory period&rdquo; of 26 days or whatever it is under the Act.  There should be just one authority governing the registration of caravan sites.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish said earlier on, I cannot understand section 3 of the Bill in which reference is made to the guarantee of currency other than the currency of the State.  Are we going to lend money to foreigners to develop our caravan sites?  Is that the principle at the back of section 3?</P>

Why should we have to give guarantees in respect of foreign currency to people who wish to develop sites here?  Is that in relation to some of the Germans wishing to develop sites in the west of Ireland? Are we guaranteeing their loans from the banks?  I cannot read any other interpretation into section 3, and I have heard none.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  It has been mentioned by Deputy Tully, that is the Garda Band.  In my county, which is one of the premier tourist counties in Ireland, we have seen no Garda band or military band for years.</P>

      <P>It certainly does arise.  I am referring to tourist attractions and amenities, and I am suggesting to the Minister methods whereby he could make certain tourist areas more attractive and more enticing to the public.  If one goes to Dun <Col N="637" /> Laoghaire of an evening and there is a military band there, it is an amenity and an attraction.  Why can we not have these bands throughout the country?</P>

      <P>They have, too, but they would like to hear bands from outside.  We have our own Lambegs too, if the Minister knows what they are.  The only method of transport into my county at the moment is CIE, and I have had complaints about the type of bus in which they are transporting people.  I had a question down in this House which the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order because, he said, the Minister had no responsibility for the type of bus that was being used.  This express bus service to Donegal was inaugurated by the Minister with the officials of Bord Fáilte and of CIE.  A magnificent tourist bus was put on but it was only put on once.  Since then we are back to the old bus with the hard-back seats with our knees hitting our chins, and it takes 4½ hours to get from Dublin to Donegal.  During the winter, the tourist bus is being reconditioned and remodelled for our plutocrats in the summer but our unfortunate Irish citizens will not get sitting in it.  If the Minister wants to bring tourists to Donegal, he should ensure that CIE put on a better type of bus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of Deputy O'Donnell, the Bill was received with very constructive criticism, and there was the clear implication that there was general approval of Bord Fáilte's activities in regard to the promotion of tourism.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay asked for information in relation to the nature of the planning for caravan sites.  Quite obviously, the sanitary services come under the general regime of the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities.  This also applies to health regulations.  The location of caravan sites comes, in the first instance, under the local authorities in relation to the 1963 Planning Act, but Bord Fáilte will control the registration of a caravan site in regard to its operational character, and if there is some lack of complete control in regard to sanitary services because of the remoteness of the site or if the local authority are not following the regulations too closely, Bord Fáilte would have an interest in the character of the sanitary services on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of caravan sites will relate to the space between caravans within the site, the actual condition of the tracks within the site, the question of whether there is public lighting at certain hours within the park and the nature of the services provided by the owners or the companies operating the sites.  That would relate to the removal of waste, the provision of water, the removal of litter and whether a central service block exists which may include sanitary accommodation with water laid on&mdash;anything from a launderette service to a playroom for children in wet weather.  A variety of central services can be provided which are not <Col N="639" /> essential to all caravan sites but naturally the grading of sites will relate to the provision of these services.  The fees charged by the owners of caravan sites will have to be approved by me. They have not yet been settled and it can be taken for granted that they will be reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke about the necessity for the application of good standards.  I entirely agree with him. It is absolutely essential, if we are to preserve the scenic beauty of our land, to have certain controls in relation to caravans and their siting.  I am sure all Members of the House can recall long stretches of mountain scenery or beach where the siting of a caravan park can make all the difference, so that careful siting is of importance. Very often the planting of trees around a caravan park can make all the difference between the preservation and the despoliation of the surrounding countryside and Deputy Moore can be satisfied that Bord Fáilte are keenly aware of this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay suggested that sometimes registration inspectors of Bord Fáilte irritate.  They are absolutely bound to irritate if they are to do their work well.  The standards of hotel accommodation, particularly the sanitary services, are improving.  I go around the country and I can see the improvement, but there is still further room for improvement.  Therefore, Bord Fáilte inspectors are bound to irritate but they must not be permitted to do so wrongly, and in that I agree with Deputy Lindsay.  Knowing a good deal of what goes on in relation to hotel inspection&mdash;through hearing representations from people who object to Bord Fáilte decisions and hearing reports from reliable people&mdash;I would say that Bord Fáilte on the whole are as lenient as they possibly can be.</P>
    <P>I encourage Bord Fáilte to be even stiffer in regard to the fundamental rules associated with the grading of hotels.  I have to agree with Bord Fáilte that a hotel should be given a period in which to show improvement before it is downgraded, but I feel they are reasonably lenient in their attitude and occasionally I have to ask them to <Col N="640" /> be as tough as they can in order that standards will be preserved and improved.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputies praise the work of the regional companies. They have been in operation for only 18 months and splendid work has been done in terms of information offices opened, inquiries answered, a system for booking hotel accommodation organised for people who seek accommodation and have not booked in advance, the provision of regional guides in some areas.  Above all, co-ordination between regional companies and the local associations is of very great importance.  I know of a great number of local associations that received help from regional companies and directors. Their job of assessing the local tourist potential is of very great significance.</P>
    <P>They also have the job of looking for fresh accommodation which is largely of the moderate price variety, encouraging people to keep visitors, to make available two or three beds, to take a catering course in the vocational school, pointing out to householders the tourist potential of particular areas for angling of one kind or another and encouraging them to register with Bord Fáilte for accommodation in the unregistered list, if not suitable for registration in the registered guesthouse list.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear Deputy Lindsay's praise for the Bord Fáilte work in Keem Bay and I quite agree that every effort must be made to preserve the beauty of such places as Keem Bay, which I know very well. For that, the help of Deputies and of all people with a sense of the needs of tourism will be required in future because many people will want to build houses and shacks and bungalows dotted irregularly along every beach and around every cove in Ireland.  We shall destroy the country unless very great care is taken in planning. When I hear criticism of certain local authorities who at present appear to be unduly conservative in their attitude, pending the making of a final plan, I hope those who criticise realise the necessity for conservatism in regard to these matters.  If there is a stretch <Col N="641" /> of beach a half mile to three miles long obviously there may have to be a building site at some point along the beach.  Equally, some part of the splendid isolation of the beach must be preserved.  Most Deputies will appreciate the necessity to support those who are attempting to plan the scenic amenities of the country in an intelligent way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay referred to the Shannon disaster when some people unfortunately lost their lives while pleasure boating.  The Shannon guide clearly shows markers on the Shannon to enable navigation to be carried out safely.  I think Bord Fáilte will be considering whatever safety measures are necessary which they are capable of fulfilling.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;of the need for indoor recreation in many areas.  Grants for such amenities are available from Bord Fáilte for hotels and, in connection with the resort scheme, grants are available for specific centres in resort areas.  If a 20 per cent contribution is made by a local development association, by a local company or a local authority, Bord Fáilte are prepared to give a very adequate grant towards civic centres of that kind where among others there could be facilities for the recreation of children during bad weather.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay also spoke of the need for inexpensive accommodation. The House will be glad to know that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 unregistered rooms recorded in Bord Fáilte lists, advertised abroad and known in particular to the information offices of all the regional companies and these were availed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one information office outside Drogheda, at Newgrange, and there is no telephone. It is not a very sensible place to put the information office for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  Some of the information offices I think must be reviewed in any case by all the regional companies.  The House will be glad to know there are 95 farmhouses <Col N="642" /> on the Bord Fáilte list as suitable for tourists.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay spoke of the very great need to encourage British tourists to come here.  If he reads the annual report of Bord Fáilte, he will see that a very considerable advertising and promotional campaign is carried out in Britain.  Travel agents are brought over here.  Last year there were 1,600 calls on British travel agents made from various Bord Fáilte offices in Britain and 355,000 English people saw films of Ireland and there was a very large number of lectures to anglers' associations. There were also two tours of Britain in which 17 Irish travel agents accompanied Bord Fáilte officials to visit British travel agents.  Deputy Lindsay will also see in the annual report that the advertising appropriation for Britain was very considerable.</P>
      <P>We are getting more American visitors.  The number went up by 43 per cent from 1963 to 1964, whereas the number of American visitors to Europe went up by 13 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What would that represent in figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amount spent was between 17,000,000 and 20,000,000 dollars.  American visitors spend more than English people, particularly if they take the Aerlínte service to Ireland, and the grade of accommodation at the hotels where they stay tends to be higher.  They also spend more in the shops.  On the other hand, English visitors spend very freely in relation to their incomes and are very welcome among us.  On the whole, I think Bord Fáilte have a balanced attitude, making quite sure that there is adequate promotion in England and at the same time encouraging visitors in proportion from other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish spoke of the need to extend the tourist season.  Every effort is being made to do that and special publicity is used in the case of certain regions to encourage people to come to see the beautiful autumn scenery. There is the June holiday plan carried out by Bord Fáilte to encourage holidays is June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Could the Minister persuade the Minister for Education to close the schools in June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to secure some kind of co-operative consideration of that matter but I understand there is considerable opposition by school authorities still towards changing the ending of the school period.  I shall approach the Minister for Education again in regard to this.  In view of the very great changes taking place in educational policy, I hope we shall have a changing attitude in regard to that matter also.</P>
      <P>Specialist interests that have been encouraged by Bord Fáilte and the regional companies such as golf, racing, angling and ancient monuments all tend to spread the season.  There are many places in Ireland where hotels were almost completely full even towards the end of September and the season has actually spread.  I cannot remember exact figures but the number of cars that came over in June this year was something equivalent to the total number of cars that came in all the summer months five or six years back.  The season must tend to spread; otherwise, I agree it will be difficult to ensure it will spread sufficiently to enable the maximum number of people to be employed for a long period each year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish spoke of the south-east regional company arranging the Welsh Week.  That is a typical example of something far better done by the regional companies with the help of local funds and Bord Fáilte than by Bord Fáilte alone.  In Europe, the national tourist offices would never be asked to organise an event of that kind. That would be done by the Lucerne Development Association or the Perugia Provincial Tourist Association. I am very glad to see that the regional companies are showing such great initiative in only the second full year of their existence in regard to the organisation of such matters as the Welsh Week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish also spoke, quite <Col N="644" /> rightly, about the use of Irish materials in hotel construction.  I know Bord Fáilte do encourage the use of Irish motifs in decoration, the use of Irish fabrics and Irish tableware in their promotion of good standard of decor, ambiance and of construction in hotels.  I go to a great many hotels myself and I think that, on the whole, a good proportion of Irish materials are used.  Since, as the House knows, the standard of design of Irish tableware has been very much improved in the past two or three years, I do not think hotels have any excuse for not using Irish tableware and Irish fabrics, carpets and so forth.  There is no reason why they should go abroad for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also spoke about the Japanese souvenirs.  Bord Fáilte have done their utmost&mdash;I know the detailed work they do in their souvenir section&mdash;to encourage the sale of Irish souvenirs made in good taste.  I think that with the co-operation of hotels and with the interest taken by certain shopkeepers, the standard is not too awful.  There may be a lot of very shoddy stuff sold but, at the same time, there are some very good souvenirs being sold.  If one goes to the country which I shall not name, supposed to be the home of good taste, and which has given us most of the good taste we have, and looks at the souvenirs in their shops, I do not think we have done too badly in encouraging souvenirs of good taste here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Lindsay spoke about hotel prices.  I have not the power to control prices.  The only power I have is to agree to the Bord Fáilte principle of registration whereby the grading of a hotel must relate to a degree to the prices charged.  A B class hotel must provide the requirements of comfort, food and service that would correspond with the prices they are going to charge.  The prices must be clearly marked and, if there are any changes during certain parts of the year such as the high season, those prices must be the maximum that can be charged.  That is all the power I have to authorise Bord Fáilte to carry out these registration rules.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> If hotels charge too much, they will price themselves out of the market. A few hotels have obviously been overcharging.  But I think there have been more complaints about the prices of odd meals and snacks than actual hotel prices.  The hotel&mdash;which, incidentally, is a very good hotel but which shall be nameless&mdash;which wishes to keep passer-by motorists from coming in to have a cup of tea and does so by charging 5/- for a cup of tea and one biscuit is doing it the wrong way. It really would be better if they put up outside the door they were not able to serve tea to people.  There are other examples but they are not too numerous.</P>
    <P>We now have had two reports by the <i>Financial Times</i>, which I suppose can be regarded as a reliable organ of opinion.  In those two reports, they made a study of the prices of A class hotels and B class hotels in Europe and the cost of meals in restaurants. In both reports we came out astonishingly well.  It is true to say there are possibly only two or three countries in Europe where prices for hotel accommodation in the various grades are noticeably cheaper than here. Those are countries which have had, up to now, a lower standard of living and, certainly, a lower standard of wages.  There are exceptions to that. Quite obviously, Bord Fáilte have got to keep their eye on complaints made of excessive charging.  But when I, for example, look through the half dozen hotel guide books in Europe, I really cannot see there is gross overcharging here if the hotels keep to the rules and charge what is stated in the Bord Fáilte Guide Book.  Certainly, the prices for guest-house accommodation in general, I feel Deputies will agree, are pretty reasonable.  A charge of seven guineas, eight guineas or nine guineas a week for full board and room is not excessive by European standards.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned in reply to Deputy Corish that the Minister for Local Government is solely responsible for the rules in regard to sanitatation. That does not come under the Minister for Health in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore mentioned the question <Col N="646" /> of town parks.  Town parks can be pretty expensive and it may not always be possible for Bord Fáilte to engage in projects to provide them. Looking at the future over the next few years, there are amenity grants under the Minister for Local Government, there are the Bord Fáilte grants for resorts and then funds can be provided by local authorities.  The three&mdash; the Minister for Local Government, the local authorities and Bord Fáilte &mdash;can engage in a tri-partite arrangement for the provision of amenities such as town parks.  Quite naturally, however, the pressure on Bord Fáilte is very great.  I think they will have to engage primarily in future on improvements that very directly relate to the servicing of tourists, the provision of entertainment centres for tourists, access roads and so on.  If they have enough money occasionally to provide for town parks, no doubt they will consider it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons spoke of the need for encouraging tourism within our own country.  Other Deputies spoke about that also.  The regional companies should specialise in regard to that. They will have regional guides and they should do more than Bord Fáilte in encouraging Irish people to take their holidays within Ireland.  I would point out to Deputy Lyons that CIE last year, as in previous years, arranged a tremendous number of tours by bus all over the country starting from a number of different centres.  They organised scenic tours, the radio trains and other train services for tourists. They are doing their best to encourage people to stay in Ireland for their holidays.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the annual doubt about the statistics from which we derive the income from tourism.  The figures relating to the number of visitors and their expenditure are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and published annually in the June issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i> The December 1959 Bulletin gave a detailed description of the method employed.  Now they get very definite information with regard to passenger movements from the shipping companies and the air companies. <Col N="647" /> They engage in a sample passenger card inquiry which is undertaken at eight day intervals in respect of persons entering and leaving the State.  The inquiry is anonymous.  They very carefully scrutinise the cards in order to eliminate the ones that are written in fun.  I can assure the House that I know enough about market research and marketing inquiries carried out by commercial companies in Britain and here to know that not only the English but we, Irish, with our different temperaments, are getting quite used to filling up cards about every conceivable matter.  The Irish people are becoming accustomed to it.  The British have become very accustomed to it. There is quite a compulsion among the majority of people to sit down and fill up cards carefully and accurately. They enjoy doing it.  They do it about everything, from why they take Beechams pills to how much they spend in Ireland.  It is becoming a universal habit.</P>
    <P>I think we can say that the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office are reasonably accurate.  If there is any basic inaccuracy I do not think it is a very large.  Being very careful statisticians they would certainly check the increase each year in tourist income.  I am quite certain that, if there are any errors of a small kind, they would be repetitive from year to year.  That is well known to statisticians.  There may be some element of inaccuracy, but they certainly get some idea of the increase and that, of course, is the important thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked about sites for mobile caravans.  I am quite sure Bord Fáilte will carry out the registration on the basis that, if there is need for sites for mobile caravans, they will be provided.  One could hardly publish a list of sites such as we already have, but without registration, in which the accommodation available would be given without indicating quite clearly that there are sites for mobile caravans. Quite obviously all this would have to be done in a balanced way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstood me.  What I said was I <Col N="648" /> hoped standards would not be set so high as to result in the closing down of existing mobile caravan sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was suggesting that Bord Fáilte might register caravan sites in which there would be no space for visiting caravans. I think the attitude will be that Bord Fáilte will obviously have to give time to people to improve their standards. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is possible to have what might be described as a lower grade type of caravan site, with all the basic essentials but none of the luxuries.  I am sure Bord Fáilte will give time to existing caravan site owners to improve their sites and provide the basic facilities. I have never known them to be unreasonable about that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also asked about some help from Bord Fáilte to prevent sand-blowing in Bettystown.  I sympathise with the Deputy.  I passed by there once when the sand was blowing and it was very unpleasant.  Whether that would come within the limited scope of Bord Fáilte grants I very much doubt.  That would be a matter, I think, for the local authority and the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 118 proposes that the section be not accepted as it stands and that there should be substituted &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;.  I have known cases of vested cottages being taken over.  They looked to be in good structural repair but, when the tenants went in, they were unfit for human habitation because the roofs were bad, the windows were bad and the sanitary arrangements were very imperfect.  I believe the important thing is to <Col N="650" /> ensure that, when a tenant takes over a cottage, that cottage is fit for human habitation.  If this section were to be passed without sufficient safeguards for the tenant, this House would not be doing its duty.  The Minister should accept the amendment in order to ensure that the cottages will be in good sanitary condition.  Under other sections the Minister will force local authorities to make vesting orders within a very short time and if as a result of a vesting order the local authority hands over the cottage in an unfit condition it is the tenants who will suffer.</P>
      <P>The Minister may make the case that local authorities are too slow in carrying out repairs and the local authorities may make the excuse that the cost is too great.  If the Minister imposes a vesting order and forces a local authority to hand over unfit houses, both the local authority and the Minister will be doing an injustice to the people concerned.  I realise that local authorities will find it difficult to get money for repairs because the impact of the cost of repairs on rates is very important in more places than Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that certain sections could not have been left out of the Bill.  The section with which we are now dealing uses the words &ldquo;Whenever a housing authority propose to make a vesting order under section 17 of the Act of 1936 or to sell or lease a dwelling under section 89 to the tenant thereof&rdquo; but section 89 covers &ldquo;any person&rdquo; as well as the tenant who may be there at the time.  That is not stated in section 102 but it is stated in section 89.  In my view a person who goes into a cottage that has been occupied may find it in bad condition.  There have been many cases in the area from which I come where tenants had very little respect for the cottage while they were in occupation and an incoming tenant found fittings broken and in some cases the staircases burned.  If the incoming tenants finds that under section 89 the local authority have to prepare a vesting order and he will be forced to take <Col N="651" /> the cottage without having a guarantee that it is in good sanitary condition as well as in good structural condition, he will not be getting justice.</P>
    <P>Under the section there is a right of appeal to the Minister within a certain time.  In the event of appeal on the grounds that the cottage is not in proper sanitary condition, what officer will the Minister send down to investigate the matter, or will the Minister have to depend on the local authority officers to give him the information, the local authority officers being the persons charged with the responsibility of putting the houses in proper condition? If the Minister sends down an official to investigate and that person finds that the appellant has a case, how will the Minister force the local authority to put the cottage in good condition? The machinery for doing that does not appear to be stated.  I would have my doubts that the person making the complaint would in any conceivable time have justice done to him by the cottage being put in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>The appellant would have to pay a fee to the Minister before the matter would be investigated.  I cannot see a poor cottage tenant deciding to pay a fee to the Minister to get an investigation into the condition of a cottage and waiting while the Minister sent down somebody to verify matters.</P>

      <P>The fact that this matter has been discussed at length on more than one day in the House tends towards repetition and in order to <Col N="652" /> avoid that I want to say that we are prepared to accept the Minister's assurance given on the last occasion that he is prepared to re-phrase subsection (4) and we hope that when the Minister is doing that he will have a look at the other portion where we have suggested &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have given all the reasons as to why he wants to make the proposed change and why he is not prepared to accept the Labour Party amendment.  The Labour Party amendment seeks a reversion to the position that existed prior to this legislation.</P>
      <P>I wonder if &ldquo;sound structural condition&rdquo; would take in, for instance, dampness.  Quite recently I have come across a case where a house was so damp that the ESB refused to wire it but the house was structurally sound. Would that case be covered if the Labour Party amendment is not accepted?  I think it would not be. There should be an obligation on a local authority to put a house into good sanitary condition also, mainly because of dampness.  There are many houses which have no damp course. A house that shows dampness to a large extent is not fit for human habitation.  Dampness should come within sanitary condition.  It should be an obligation on the local authority to eliminate dampness.  There are many ways and means of doing so but they are not inexpensive and it is not fair that a tenant purchaser should be saddled with the expense of making his house fit for human habitation by eliminating dampness when it is such a big job as to be beyond his means. It should be regarded as the obligation of the local authority.</P>
      <P>However, if the members of the Labour Party are prepared to accept the Minister's assurance, I shall not disagree with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be some clear explanation made as to what the Minister has in mind by &ldquo;sound structural condition&rdquo; and what exactly is covered by it.  Such explanation is not given in the explanatory memorandum. The words &ldquo;sound structural condition&rdquo; are open to such a variety of interpretations that it depends entirely on the engineer, architect or technical officer of a local authority who may examine a house.  There should be a directive to local authorities as to what is expected under this phrase and that should be made clear to the tenant purchaser in advance.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made the case that nobody would buy a house that was not in sound structural condition.  I do not know the position in other local authority areas but I do know that once a tenant applies to Dublin County Council for repairs to be carried out for the purpose of vesting, he must decide that he will purchase.  He cannot back out.  The only recourse he has if he is not satisfied with the standard of repairs is to the Minister. It is quite wrong to say that nobody will buy a house that is not in sound structural condition.  Tenants are compelled to buy, once they apply to have repairs carried out for vesting purposes. From that day they are compelled to purchase.  There is no way out.  If they cannot decide at some stage&mdash;when they see the repairs needing to be done&mdash;that they will not purchase and that the dwelling is not in sound structural condition, if that decision is not open to them at that stage, then I think they are beaten. There should be some way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be the last person to advocate leaving this thing open so that every crank in the country could bring back a local authority on several occasions and point to this or that slight fault.  They should be sufficiently able themselves to move in <Col N="654" /> and do something about it.  There are people who would not replace a broken pane of glass if they could get away with it and others who would not even clean their own gutters.  I have come across this very often.  But, at the same time, I think they should be safeguarded against repairs of a major character.  It would be wrong to leave it open to local authorities to recover possession in certain circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I wanted to say.  I should say to the Minister, in regard to section 89, that there are cottages down in Mayo&mdash;we have only 21 of the type mentioned in section 93&mdash;which could be usefully sold under section 89.  They could be put in good structural condition and repair, and that would save the local authority from having to prepare this vesting order which is very expensive, between publication, notification and so on.  If the Minister would look into the cases such as those I have mentioned in Mayo where a small number of cottages of the type mentioned could be dealt with under section 89, instead of having to prepare this expensive vesting order and if the local authority could be told to go ahead and dispose of the cottages under section 89, it would save everybody a lot of trouble. The Minister himself said that it might be more expensive to prepare a vesting order and that it might cost the local authority more than they would get from the rent out of the cottages eventually.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and see if he could deal with this type of case under section 89.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better restate what I said earlier on this matter, lest it may not have been understood or, indeed, heard by some of the Deputies here, that is, that in so far as subsection (4) of the section is concerned, my intention, expressed to the House earlier, is that this subsection will be amended so as to bring about the situation wherein repairs which will be required to be done before vesting, and which cannot reasonably be expected to be done by the tenant, will be included.  I think this is the matter to which <Col N="655" /> Deputies Clinton and Lyons have adverted and which was raised many times by speakers in both the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  It is the intention to amend subsection (4) so as to get over the objection to the section as a whole, in that it is felt by those who have spoken against the section that the provision is not sufficiently satisfactory from the point of view of the tenant.  This proposed change in subsection (4), in whatever form of words may be thought necessary by the draftsmen, will bring about the situation that repairs, other than those which can reasonably be expected to be done by the tenant, will in fact be carried out by the local authority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the vesting procedure operating heretofore, which Deputy Lyons is complaining about, this will not operate in regard to houses provided after 1st January, 1966.  It will apply only to those already existing up to that date.  While there may still be a number of them around, at least once this operation is carried through, it will not occur again under the present procedure, which I agree is pretty lengthy and which we are eliminating.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If during the payment period&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the owner of a house sold or leased under section 11 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, cannot be found or ascertained,</P>
      <P>(b) a special condition applying as respects a dwelling is not complied with, or</P>

      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The purpose of these amendments is to substitute the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;the person to whom a house was sold or leased&rdquo;, or his successor in title, wherever they occur in section 103.  It is a change of description and substitutes &ldquo;owner&rdquo; for the person named earlier.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 123 (a) is really consequential if these are accepted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 124, I should mention, restricts the powers of a housing authority to recover possession of a house sold or leased by them to the period during which any purchase money, rent or other payment in respect of the house is outstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain one matter here.  I mentioned last week the question of a house which was occupied by an old man who subsequently took in a young couple to live with him and they looked after him until he died.  He made no will and they remained in possession of the vested cottage.  They are still living in the cottage and there is rumour that there is a thirty-first cousin hanging around who may claim ownership.  Is there any way in which these matters can be tightened up because, as I see it, the occupier is only a payee and has no legal title to the house?  This other person can come along at a later stage, after the final payment has been made, and obtain possession of the house by claiming relationship to the deceased owner. Perhaps the Minister would say whether or not this type of case can be covered in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly a difficulty will arise in so far as the vested cottage is already in existence and has been sold.  Only recently we have had one such case brought up by a local authority.  We are pursuing that at the moment to see whether we can get around or avoid the difficulty which exists.  In so far as the vesting of houses and buildings is concerned, under this legislation, that particular difficulty will not arise.  It is only with regard to existing vested cottages sold that the difficulty can possibly arise.</P>

      <P>the person to whom a house was sold or leased under section 11 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, or such person's successor in title, cannot be found or ascertained.</P>
      <P>In the case to which I am referring, the alleged owner can be found.  There is somebody who will claim ownership but just because there may be grave doubt about that ownership, will it be covered at all?</P>

      <P>The particular point the Deputy has just raised will be covered and will be covered in the way that the person who will be owning the cottage, as it were, must use it as his normal place of residence.  So, from that point of view, he is all right.  Then, so far as the possible difficulties that may exist as of this moment are concerned, we will go back to the Labourers Act, 1936, subsection (d), which says:</P>
      <P>where it is not possible by reasonable enquiry to ascertain who is such owner or where such owner ordinarily resides, by delivering it to some person over sixteen years of age resident or employed in the cottage or by affixing it in some conspicuous position on the cottage.</P>

It is really, in the main, substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and thereafter deleting certain other words.  This is intended to bring about the situation wherein capital money may be applied for a purpose approved by the Minister and for which capital money may be separately applied.  As it stood, this was not terribly clear and I am asking that we should here change the particular wording.</P>

      <P>In page 69, line 25, to delete &ldquo;(other than a function under Part IV)&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 105 empowers local authorities and housing authorities to perform any of their functions outside their functional area other than functions under Part IV dealing with unfit houses.  The original intention, in <Col N="660" /> excluding Part IV, was to ensure that two local authorities did not serve overcrowding notices, repair notices or demolition orders in respect of the same premises.  The likelihood of this is extremely remote and on consideration of it it is not regarded as necessary to provide specifically against it.  On the other hand, it is necessary to ensure that county councils may continue to act under Part IV in areas under town commissioners.  Town commissioners have not got the necessary engineering or technical staff to ensure the operation of Part IV.  The only way in which Part IV can be operated in a town area is by having a county council operate it and under this amendment such arrangements can be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to get away from the assumption that a committee can perform any of the functions of housing authorities under the Bill.  This assumption, I should add, was never intended under the original wording.  A committee could not perform executive functions which would be the manager's business.  The wording <Col N="661" /> of the amendment is based on section 11 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if the Minister was going to allow the section to go through as it was.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this?  The Minister says a housing authority may, if they think fit:</P>
      <P>establish a committee consisting of such number of their members as they may think fit to perform any of their functions under this Act which in the opinion of the authority would be better performed by means of a committee.</P>
      <P>Does that, in fact, mean what it is supposed to mean?  Does it mean that a member of a local authority could establish a housing committee who will have full authority to proceed with a housing programme in their area?</P>

The compulsory land acquisition provisions can be dealt with later as part of a general Land Acquisition Bill.

    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> Section 82 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, provides that it shall not be lawful to let or occupy as a dwelling any cellar built or rebuilt after the passing of the Act.  Sections 83 to 86 contain further provisions relating to the use of cellars as dwellings.  The sections are unnecessary in view of the wide powers given in Part IV of the Bill, enabling housing authorities to require the demolition or closure of property unfit for human habitation. The amendment will, accordingly, provide for the repeal of sections 82 to 86 of the 1876 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 100 and 101 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, deal with the powers of sanitary authorities to make bye-laws as to houses let in lodgings. These bye-laws provide for fixing the numbers of persons who may occupy a room, for the registration and inspection of lodging houses and for enforcing drainage, sanitation and cleanliness.  In so far as the number of persons who may occupy a room is concerned, sections 64 and 65 of the Bill give housing authorities adequate power.  In so far as the other matters for which the bye-laws may provide are concerned, the remaining sections in Part IV contain adequate powers. The amendment, therefore, proposes the repeal of sections 100 and 101 of the 1878 Public Health (Ireland) Act.</P>
    <P>I should say that under this amendment it is proposed to include for repeal the Working Classes Dwellings Act, 1890.  The repeal is of minor significance.  The Act of 1890 provides that section 16 of the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844&mdash;which provided that no pious or charitable donation, devise or bequest should be valid unless executed at least three months before death&mdash;should not apply to land for working class dwellings.  The 1844 Act is repealed by the Charities Act of 1961.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the further part of the amendment is to include among the repeals the Housing Act, 1930. The Act, which amended the Housing Act, 1929, is spent and the repeal is merely of a tidying nature.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the further part of <Col N="668" /> the amendment is to repeal the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1936, which provided for exemption from rates for houses for which reconstruction grants were made under section 5 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Act, 1932.  The Act of 1936 is spent and the proposed repeal is of a tidying nature.</P>

      <P>The Minister has referred to matters to which a housing authority are to have regard for consideration whether a house is unfit for human habitation.

      <P>I was very glad to be reminded that this was, in fact, in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  This is certainly the sort of yardstick I hope the Minister had in mind when he talked about sound structural condition. Must this complete list, in fact, be considered?  Must the local authority have regard to this list when they are deciding whether a house is in sound structural condition?  It certainly fulfils what I was looking for.  It covers dampness and all the other elements to which we have been objecting and which we feel would be the cause of pretty heavy expenditure which a tenant-purchaser could not normally be expected to meet.  Is this the type of list the Minister has in mind when he sets out to revise section 102 which we have already discussed?</P>

      <P>Articles 2 (a) and (b) provide that a local authority may pay up to £500 to a person who has been in occupation of land for six years or to a person having a mortgage on the land. Under article 2 (c), a receipt for this money is to be &ldquo;effectual to vest the land in the authority&rdquo;.  It would obviously be incorrect to enable a receipt, given by a person who has a mortgage only on a leasehold interest, to be sufficient to vest the fee simple of the land in the local authority.  The amendment will, accordingly, provide that only a receipt given by a person who may be dealt with as absolute owner or by a person entitled to a mortgage or charge on the interest of such person will be effectual to vest the land in the authority.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to apologise to you, Sir, to the officials of the House and, indeed, to the gentlemen of the Press for having to detain them in this cold atmosphere. I would not have done it were it not for the seriousness of the situation, a fact which does not appear to have dawned on the Minister for Justice.  My question today, one of a series, was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to reports about the disbanding of the Garda Band; if the reports are correct; and, if so, what is the reason for this.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he had decided to disband the band and that the reason for it was financial.  He threw in, for good measure, the suggestion that the general body of the Garda were behind his action.</P>
      <P>Let me say straight off the reel that the Minister was not stating facts when he said the general body of the Garda Síochána were supporting this action. As a matter of fact, the direct opposite is the case and the Minister should be well aware of it.  In fact he has received representations from various organisations within the Force.  One of the points he made in answer to a further question was that these men were first of all Garda officers who were recruited to do normal duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before me the advertisement published for recruitment to the Garda Band.  It is headed &ldquo;Garda Síochána &mdash;Vacancies for Bandsmen&rdquo; and it says that the Garda Commissioner invited applications for appointments in the Garda Band.  In order to be eligible for appointment, the applicants must (1) be of good character; (2) be not less than five foot nine inches with a mean chest measurement of 34 inches; (3) be in good health; (4) have the primary school leaving certificate or better; (5) be between the ages of 18 and 30 on 1st July; and (6) be capable of reading <Col N="674" /> music and competent to play a brass or reed instrument or drums.  It goes on to give details of pay.</P>
    <P>These are not the qualifications required of a normal recruit to the Garda Síochána.  Not alone that; the Garda authorities do not recruit married men but the Garda Band do. Furthermore, they are selected for one reason only&mdash;because they are musicians. When they are taken into the Force naturally, in order to be able to parade, they are taught a certain amount of drill.  Many of them do not need this training.  During the Christmas period, they have to postpone other work and for three weeks do ordinary Garda duties.  In normal periods they do a certain number of hours of ordinary routine duties not requiring the same skill as the ordinary Garda recruit whom they are helping out.  They continue to be bandsmen for the remainder of the period.</P>
    <P>Last year the band went to America and I have here the souvenir which was sold to thousands all over the United States and portions of Canada. It contained a photograph of the Taoiseach with this message, signed &ldquo;Seán F. Lemass, Department of the Taoiseach&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>I am very happy indeed to learn that the Show &ldquo;Ireland on Parade&rdquo; will shortly leave on a tour of some thirty major cities in the United States and Canada.  This will be a truly Irish Show.  It will constitute the largest group of Irish artistes ever to leave Ireland on such a tour. With a total personnel of some 100 members it includes several Bands and some of our most talented groups of dancers and singers.  They all represent the best in Irish entertainment.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the tremendous effort and detailed planning over a long period which has gone into the organisation of this Show.  Its organisers and sponsors deserve our congratulations and our thanks.  I am confident that all their efforts will be fully rewarded by the success which this Show will achieve and by the warm acclaim with which I know <Col N="675" /> it will be greeted in the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>For those of our race in both countries the Show will, I am sure, be a very special treat.  The homeland will, as it were, be paying a most welcome visit to its own sons and daughters.  To all the friends of Ireland in the United States and Canada there could scarcely be a more appropriate way of extending warmest greetings and good wishes from us all here at home.</P>
    <P>I wish all members of the Show God Speed.  May the tour for all of them be most successful and enjoyable.</P>
    <P>The whole thing featured the Irish police band&mdash;the Band of the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Céilí Band.  The whole article was built around the Garda Band.  When they went to America, they visited 30 different cities and paid return visits to three of them.  The biggest crowd ever to attend at Madison Square Garden went there to hear the show, the centrepiece of which was the Garda Band.  More money was taken in than at any other show and, despite suggestions to the contrary, there was no reduction in prices.</P>
    <P>Before they went, the band were short of men and took a considerable number of members out of the No. 1 Army Band to fill up the ranks.  There was a bit of a row about that because the No. 1 Army Band at that time had a function to fulfil and did not want to lose their bandsmen.  As a matter of fact, 24 members of the present Garda Band are ex-Army men.  They were trained by the Army and transferred to the Garda Band.  Twelve of them bought their way out of the Army and were transferred to the Garda Band.  Eleven of them paid £200 each and one paid £90.  This was so because they were trained musicians.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to decry the role these people have played.  He said they were not doing very much and he highlighted the trips to Templemore and said they went only ten times.  I should like to remind the Minister that in 1965 they did 40 paid engagements and seven Céilí engagements.  It is of <Col N="676" /> interest to note that the Céilí Band is made up of Garda bandsmen and that this band is the only State-sponsored céilí band in the country.  They appeared on four occasions free of charge in St. Stephen's Green and once at the Garda Club in Harrington Street.  They made 52 appearances during the year, not including passing-out parades or the Scott Medal presentation. There was an average of two public engagements a week.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a fee fund not controlled by the Department of Justice.  It is not.  There is a substantial fund of about £7,000 and I should like to know what will happen to it now.  The money has been used in the main for the replacement and repair of instruments.  We should like to know also what happened to the substantial sum paid before the band went to America.  Deputy Ryan suggested, but it is not verified, that it was about £80,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told Deputy Ryan it was untrue.  Perhaps it was under some other heading but the people in America for whom this show was put on, Columbia Festivals Incorporated, did in fact pay a substantial sum of money before the band travelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Incidentally, I notice that the honorary patron was Mr. Charles J. Haughey, Minister for Justice of Ireland.  He was Minister for Justice at that time.  However, there is a figure of £7,000 with the control of which the Minister said he had nothing to do.  That is quite true but it is controlled by the band committee which consists of 12 members.  The chairman, treasurer and secretary are appointed by the Garda Commissioner and there are nine others from the Representative Body making up a total of 12.  There need be no doubt in the Minister's mind about the administration of that £7,000.  The people in charge of it are responsible people within his own organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> The extraordinary thing about all this is that we have here one of the finest bands&mdash;if not the finest&mdash;in the country, which for cultural reasons alone should be retained, but because the Minister says we are short of money, he has decided to cut down on this item.  It makes me sick when I think of the attitude of people in the present Government who are prepared to talk about culture, about the Irish language and Irish music all over the country at every dinner and dogfight and see afterwards what they do.  The Cork Opera House was lauded as an example of the Government's dedication and devotion to culture but here is the original police band formed when the State was formed and linked with the State ever since, now being wiped out because there is a slight shortage of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know, if he does not already know, that almost all&mdash;I think 34&mdash;of the people who make up the band were recruited to the band since 1957.  They are all recent additions to the band, not people who have been there for a long number of years.  The Minister said that some people left the band, that they were transferred to other duties.  I should like to point out that the people transferred to other duties were transferred for one of three reasons: first, people got too old to be active musicians and were transferred to cushy jobs&mdash;that was right because the alternative was retiral; secondly, people were recruited to the band who were not good musicians and it is only right that they should not be retained in a top class band such as the Garda band is; and thirdly, people were transferred who&mdash;mark you, there were only two or three of these&mdash;decided they would like to be real policemen, not musicians.</P>
    <P>The majority of these are dedicated musicians and whether the Minister likes it or not, he must face the fact that if he does not retain the band, those people will not remain in the Force.  The majority will get out and if the reason he is now talking of disbanding them is to make good his promise at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis to put extra policemen on motorcycles, <Col N="678" /> to put these people on police work so that he can release some of the others, he is making a bad mistake.  I want to give him an opportunity of stating that he is prepared to reconsider the position. The very least he could do if his mind is fully made up to do away with the band, is to give those men an opportunity of continuing their career as musicians and allow them to return to the No. 1 Army Band.  If he is not prepared to do that, he is simply making available to police forces in other places&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stole 12 of them last year and he did not tell them when taking them away &mdash;if some other people want to talk while I am speaking, I prefer to sit down until they have finished but if the Minister wants to hear the case I am putting up, I should like him to listen.  Last year 12 of these people who were taken from the Army Band were not told that the band would be disbanded within 12 months, that this trip to America would be the last one and that they were finished when it was finished and that they could go where they liked.</P>
      <P>Either the Minister has been misinformed or has jumped to a conclusion to which he should not have jumped.  The people to whom I refer are all decent men who have dedicated their lives so far to music.  It is their ambition to continue as musicians and if the Minister does not want to allow that, I have suggested what he should do.  I have promised to give five minutes to Deputy Michael O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I conclude by saying that these people, when recruited, were only asked to be of a certain physique and able to play an instrument.  No question of police duty entered into it then.  As far I can see this idea has been thought up suddenly by somebody who for some reason did not like the band.  Finally <Col N="679" /> every year this band has played, and has become internationally known by playing, at international rugby matches at Lansdowne Road.  This year when the rugby authorities asked for the band they were told the fee had gone up.  When they reluctantly agreed to pay the higher fee, they were then informed, quite recently, that the band was not available.  Was the Minister looking for the excuse of saying that the people in Lansdowne Road would not accept the band, that they were not worth the money they were asking?  Even at this late stage, the Minister should reconsider this decision.  I think it is a disgraceful decision by an Irish Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take all of the limited time available because Deputy Clinton also has an interest in this and I shall leave a minute for him.  Deputy Tully has quite rightly made a strong plea to the Minister to reconsider his decision in this matter.  He made out a very strong case from the point of view of the personnel in the Garda Band.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision from a different point of view, that of the public. For a great number of years, before either the Minister or I were heard of in public life, the Garda Band has been a feature of the cultural life of the country.  As Deputy Tully said, in a number of ways it has achieved international fame and recognition.  It will certainly be missed by the ordinary people if the Minister persists in closing it down as, apparently, he is determined to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to say that when the first inkling of the moves which were afoot to disband the Garda Band came to light, it was greeted with a sense of shock and dismay by the ordinary people.  I should like to urge the Minister to reconsider his decision on that score.  I know the Minister, in reply to myself and other Deputies today, made the case it was not worthwhile for prestige purposes.  Generally speaking I do not advocate spending money purely for prestige purposes; but, if it were necessary in this case, I <Col N="680" /> would say to the Minister it is worthwhile to keep the Garda Band, if only for prestige purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a very good case has been made by Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Higgins for the retention of the band.  Deputy Cosgrave asked the Minister if he was not satisfied they were working hard enough, did not give sufficient recitals and so on, could he not find sufficient occupation for them. Two main cases were made by the Minister today.  First, they were giving bad value because the number of recitals was insufficient; and, second, that the bandmaster had retired and it was an opportune time to disband the whole band.</P>
      <P>Since the date for the retiral of the bandmaster, the Minister decided to have an audition for somebody to replace him.  That was held on 30th April.  In fact they got nobody.  Nobody in the Garda Band was considered good enough to be bandmaster.  Some of the members of the Army No. 1 Band have been notified of this vacancy and asked to apply.  I understand the position is that a number of them have in fact applied.  Therefore, the Minister's reason that this vacancy was there and could not be filled does not seem to be a good one because he seems to be still attempting to fill it.</P>
      <P>I will not be allowed to pursue this any further.  All I want to say is that these men have suffered considerable loss by leaving the Army Band.  They were not told the Garda Band was going to be disbanded and the carrot of the American tour was held out to them.  Twelve of them lost £200 and one £90 when entering the band.</P>

      <P>First, I want to emphasise to the House that this is a practical development which has taken place as a result of several decisions taken by previous Ministers both in the inter-Party Government and the Fianna Fáil Government.  In 1938 there were four Garda bands with a total strength of 85.  In that year they were reduced to two with a total of 51.  In 1954 the inter-Party Government reduced those two bands to one with a strength of 37.  The fact is that people <Col N="681" /> no longer have the same regard for or interest in bands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the development of radio and television the plain fact is there has been a progressive decline in public interest in the Garda Band.  Last year, compared with previous years, the number of appearances was down by more than half.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision taken by me, for which I take full responsibility and of which I am proud, is in direct line with previous decisions consistently taken and takes into account the realities of life since 1938.  The plain fact is there is reduced public interest in bands and this has meant reduced interest in the Garda Band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>Apart from the fact that last year civilian demand was down by more than half, the number of official occasions on which the band was required was ten in 12 months. For ten official occasions in 12 months, we had to maintain a body of men which cost the State £38,000.  As the Minister in charge of the police machine in this country, a Minister who has been consistently urged since coming into office that greater attention be devoted to crime prevention and detection and the enforcement of the road traffic code, I feel the money which has been spent in this direction&mdash;on a decreasing asset, if you like&mdash;is money that could be much better spent in the fields I have just mentioned and I intend to spend that money in that direction.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but I should <Col N="682" /> like to ask him a question.  He mentioned a figure of £38,000.  Could he give a breakdown of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the £38,000, £25,000 is ascribed absolutely to ceremonial band duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply today the Minister says it was taking pensions and so on into account.  Has the Minister conveniently the breakdown of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It cost practically £40,000 to have the band last year. Of that, £25,000 was allocated directly to the prestige purpose of having the band.  Some Garda duties were executed by them for which I am allocating the other £14,000.  I have no further breakdown. Last year, a certain organisation, Columbia Enterprises Incorporated, an entirely private enterprise organisation which, I want to emphasise, gave us no money in respect of the band&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Did anybody in the State receive a substantial sum of money as a result of their going abroad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a private enterprise organisation.  They organised in the United States a massive promotional campaign, to which was largely due the success of the band.  I am not trying to decry the success of the band.  A substantial profit was made by the sponsors from the band, which, until then, had not been doing much in recent years.  For the use of the Garda Band the State received no profit.  All they did was to second the band for this period.</P>

      <P>We were covered in that respect.  I want to emphasise that any rational examination of the facts&mdash;in fact, my only surprise is that the decision was not reached long ago &mdash;must lead one to the conclusion that this was the right thing to do if this money could be allocated to making the police machine more efficient.  It was no hasty decision.  I went into the <Col N="683" /> full implications of it in recent months. I am satisfied I should use the funds at my disposal to provide a better public service, such as the doubling of the motor cycle patrols for the prevention of road traffic offences and the enlarging of the Garda Force for crime prevention and detection, the provision of the Gardaí with better radio equipment and more mobility in the form of better cars.  This is the direction in which I propose to move to increase the efficiency of the police machine.  If people wish to see cultural and prestige matters developed, that is a very good thing.  But my responsibility, so long as I am Minister for Justice, is the efficiency of the police machine.  It is on this I intend to concentrate.</P>
      <P>I should like to say in all fairness to the men concerned who have been put on police duty&mdash;I think Deputy Tully did them a disservice&mdash;that they have operated excellently since going on this duty and I have received an excellent report from their superior officers as to their efficiency on this work.  I have every confidence they will remain with the Gardaí for very practical reasons concerned with their monetary situation and conditions of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, much of the opposition to this decision has been of a hysterical nature that does not take into account the facts of life.  You cannot have your cake and eat it.  If the public want an efficient police machine and if they are to be satisfied with its operation in the primary fields <Col N="684" /> of crime prevention and detection and the enforcement of the road traffic code, they will get it from me to the best of my ability so long as I have this responsibility to the House and to the public.  If I decide to hive off purely prestige activity on the part of any section of the Force, I will hive it off in the interests of the Force as a whole having regard to my responsibilities as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say I am a person who likes to communicate with people and hear every point of view. I have discussed this matter with officers of the Force at every level. Everywhere I have got complete, unanimous accord for this decision.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Tully goes beyond the newspaper headlines and beyond the emotional and hysterical approach to this, he will appreciate that as far as members of the Garda Síochána are concerned, men trained in traffic enforcement, men trained in crime prevention, interested in their jobs, agree fully with this decision because they realise that it is in the greater interests of the efficiency of the police machine of which they are proud and which they want to see operating in a more efficient way so as to redound to the credit of the Force and the benefit of the public.</P>
