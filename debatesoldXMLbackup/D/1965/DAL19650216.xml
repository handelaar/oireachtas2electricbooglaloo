    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the fact that there is no likelihood of an early report from the Select Committee on Health Services, he will take steps, in view of the forthcoming steep rise in rates, to increase the State share of expenditure on the health services from fifty to eighty per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Health) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy no doubt appreciates that while the amount in respect of health services which has to be borne on the rates is increasing, so also is the <Col N="359" /> amount which has to be met from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that as much as four-fifths of the health expenditure should be met from the Exchequer, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a statement as follows which I made to this House on 29th June, 1960 (Dáil Debates, Vol. 183, Col. 664) when speaking on my Department's Estimate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If the State were to take over the whole, or a substantially greater part, of the burden of the cost, we should have to look anew at the administration of the services and possibly consider whether or not the authority which is the main source of the piper's pay should have more say in the tune being played.  To put it more plainly, if the Exchequer's proportionate share of the cost of the health services were to be increased by more than a casual or insignificant amount, then the Minister for Health, because of his responsibility to the general taxpayer, would be bound to take a more active part in the administration of the health services, even perhaps to the extent of taking them over, or entrusting their operation to bodies nominated by him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of civil servants who retired after 5th May 1960 and who came within the terms of section 8 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963 (a) the number of cases in which he has exercised his discretion under section 8 (1) of the said Act, and (b) the number of cases which would qualify for increased pensions at his discretion, if exercised by him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases in which I have issued directions under section 8 (1) of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, is 12, according to the available records.</P>

    <P>As regards (b) of the Deputy's question, <Col N="360" /> nine cases are at present under examination to determine whether a direction should be issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why disability pensions granted to members of the Garda Síochána discharged from the Force because of injuries received in the execution of duty are liable for income tax whereas an exactly similar discharge from the Defence Forces carries a disability pension which is not liable to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability pensions granted to members of the Garda Síochána in the circumstances stated are subject to income tax in the ordinary way since the pensions constitute income.  Wound and disability pensions granted under the Army Pensions Acts to members of the Defence Forces are specially exempted from income tax by virtue of section 16, Finance Act, 1919, as applied by section 3, Finance Act, 1925.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether there was a functioning lightning conductor on the Round Tower at Cashel, County Tipperary, on 17th January last; if not, why, and if so, why the conductor failed to prevent damage to the tower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley) Donogh O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no conductor on the Round Tower at Cashel.  For a lightning conductor to be efficient it is essential to provide a low resistance connection to earth. This presents difficulties on the rocky site at Cashel.  An inefficient conductor would increase rather than decrease the hazard.</P>
      <P>The question of installing a conductor at Cashel is being investigated in connection with the repair works at present in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary have similar inquiries made in relation to other round towers, lest there be a repetition of the unfortunate accident at Cashel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Steady progress has been maintained in the design and preparation of a scheme for the Boyne.  The formulation of an efficient arterial drainage scheme for this river presents many problems because of the water-power, fishery and navigation interests which are involved, including the effects on the port at Drogheda.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that it is hoped to reach the works stage in 1967.  We are striving to achieve that but, having regard to the many snags which can crop up in a project of this magnitude, I cannot commit myself to any definite promise.</P>

      <P>My Department did not refuse to make a helicopter available on the occasion in question.  The facts are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  A request for the services of a helicopter to convey a sick child from Inishboffin to Galway Regional Hospital was made to my Department by the Secretary of the Galway County Council at 3.30 p.m. on 15th December, 1964.</P>
      <P>(2)  The request was based on a report from the District Medical Officer in Clifden that the child was seriously ill with an abdominal complaint (acute appendicitis suspected) and that the seas were too high to permit of the child's being taken off the island by boat.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Department was willing to make a helicopter available but it would have been impossible for the helicopter to reach the island and be back to Galway city before darkness set in.  Helicopters are not capable of carrying out operations of the kind in question during darkness.</P>
      <P>(4)  Arrangements were made to send the helicopter on the mission at daybreak on the following day, 16th December, and the County Secretary was informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>(5)  The County Secretary stated that he would discuss the matter further with the District Medical Officer and report back to the Department.  He did so and stated that the District Medical Officer was anxious to get the child to hospital that night, the 15th; that the possibility of using the Aran Lifeboat for the purpose had been examined and rejected for the same reason as the use of a helicopter was not practicable, viz. the time factor; and that a local boat would be used.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House has been informed on previous occasions each Minister and Parliamentary Secretary is given the unrestricted use of a State car.</P>
      <P>It is not a function of the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, to give directives governing the use or supply of such cars and, in fact, no such directive was ever given by him.</P>
      <P>There is a long standing instruction to the Garda from the Minister for Justice that, except as a substitute for a car that has broken down, not more than one car at any one time is to be supplied to any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary without the advance sanction of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>On 12th November I was informed by a Minister that earlier on that date he had been given a second car, on requisition made by him direct to the Transport Section in the Garda Depot, as he required it urgently as the car ordinarily allocated to him was otherwise in use and not readily available.  I approved of the requisition and at the same time I caused a reminder to be given by my Department to the Garda Transport Section of the standing instruction that a second car was not to be supplied to any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary without advance sanction from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this question, put down by Deputy O'Higgins, arises from an article featured in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 7th February which was full of misstatements and malicious innuendo to the effect that the recent retirement of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána was associated with a directive given by him tightening up on the use of State cars.  As I have mentioned already, it is not a function of the Commissioner to issue such a directive. In fact he never did issue such a directive and on the relevant date on which a Departmental reminder was <Col N="373" /> given to Garda Headquarters in the matter, and for some time afterwards, he was absent on sick leave.  An innuendo in the same newspaper article that extra Government cars were used in the Roscommon and Galway byelection campaigns has no foundation whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The question of providing Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries with means of transport was dealt with in the Reports of the Shanley Committee of Inquiry into Ministerial Salaries etc. presented to the Minister for Finance in 1937 (ref. P. No. 2948), paragraph 63 which reads:</P>
    <P>We consider that the existing arrangement whereby cars and drivers are supplied from a common pool is probably the most satisfactory method of providing official transport for Ministers and is clearly to be preferred to the payment of an independent transport allowance to each Minister.</P>
    <P>The practice in this regard has gone on without interruption during a period of over 30 years and has been given the approval of the Dáil on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to answer the question as put.  To enable me to do so would require examination of Departmental files in conjunction with police records covering a period of over 40 years.  Up to 1963, police records in relation to the use of State cars were not retained after the cars in question had ceased to be serviced by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past ten months of the present financial year, there were 15 <Col N="374" /> occasions in all on which a second car was, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, supplied on special occasions to Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, of whom there are 17.</P>

      <P>The occasions as set out on my file vary.  There is the occasion of statesmen visiting this country who are given the use of a State car during their stay here.  Indeed, if the Deputy wants to pursue this matter further, it was dealt with very fully by Deputy MacEoin who, as Minister for Justice, in 1950, had occasion to check on the activities of other Government Ministers at that time in regard to the use of State cars. The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, at that time had, over a period of 12 months, utilised the facilities of a second State car 14 times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner applied for my consent to retire on pension, in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1925.  That Order provides that the consent of the Minister is required for the retirement on pension, under the age of 60 years, of a Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner or Surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order makes no reference to the furnishing by an applicant under <Col N="376" /> section 4 (2) of reasons in support of his application for the Minister's consent. In deciding to give my consent to the former Commissioner's application, I was influenced by the fact that under the relevant statutory provisions he was entitled to the maximum superannuation award, and also by my view that all posts in the Force should be held by professional policemen.  The greater portion of the former Commissioner's career to date in the public service has been spent not in the Garda Síochána, but in the Civil Service.</P>

The Comhairle agreed not to make awards to the Institution's personnel on the understanding that the Institution would not make awards to persons in this country other than its own personnel save where the Comhairle had already considered the case and decided not to make an award.  In the circumstances, the Commissioner, with my concurrence, decided that it would not be appropriate for the sergeant to go to London to accept the award.</P>

      <P>The House will have learned with deep regret of the unexpected death of Deputy Michael Joseph Kennedy&mdash;Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.  Only a few days ago he was in our midst here, apparently in good health and fully recovered from his recent illness&mdash;taking part in our affairs with the same drive, energy and devotion to duty as when he first entered Dáil Éireann almost 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>Joe Kennedy was totally dedicated to the national interest as he saw it, and to which he gave a life-time of devoted service.  He was active in the national movement since his boyhood days, first as a member of Fianna Éireann and later as a member of the Volunteers. He played a prominent part all through the War of Independence, suffering terms of imprisonment and undergoing the hardships of hunger strike.</P>
      <P>He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1927 and had unbroken membership of the Dáil since then.  He also gave many years of valuable service as a member of Westmeath County Council of which body he was Chairman for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His outstanding characteristics were his deep sincerity and unshakeable integrity.  His uncompromising assertion of his views, and his strong advocacy of the causes which were dearest to him won him the admiration of his friends and the respect of even <Col N="379" /> his strongest opponents.  He had an intimate knowledge of local government affairs and, particularly during his term of office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, he made a most valuable contribution to the development of social policy, in which he was deeply interested.</P>
    <P>A fluent speaker of Irish, he was most active in the language revival movement, a cause in which he passionately believed.</P>
    <P>Through his death, Ireland has lost a steadfast, patriotic son.  This House will miss one of its most zealous and most dedicated members.  The loss of such an outstanding and devoted Dáil representative will be especially mourned by the people of Longford-Westmeath on whose behalf he was so active up to the date of his death.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the family of the late Deputy the very sincere sympathy of the members of Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <P>Following the procedure introduced last year, the Vote on Account for 1965/66 is being moved in advance of the publication of the Estimates volume.  The volume itself will be circulated before the middle of March.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account is designed to provide funds for the Supply Services during the first four months of the coming financial year pending consideration by the Dáil of the individual Estimates and the enactment of the Appropriation Act.  The amount of the Vote now required is £74.39 million which is approximately one-third of the total Estimates figure.</P>
    <P>Deputies have before them in the White Paper the totals for each Estimate for 1965/66 together with the corresponding figures, adjusted for Supplementary Estimates, for the year now ending.  More detailed information will, of course, be made available in the Estimates Volume and will be at the disposal of Deputies when the individual Estimates are before the House.</P>
    <P>The total Supply Services expenditure of £220.8 million proposed next year is £20.9 million greater than the figure of £199.9 million provided for in last year's Budget.  On the basis of existing classifications, £16.8 million of the increase relates to current services and the balance of £4.1 million to the voted capital services.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on agricultural services, the social services, including health and education, public works, post office services and pay account for £18 million of the increase of £20.9 million. The increased expenditure on agriculture and the social services reflects the improvements granted in last year's Budget in accordance with the Government's stated policy for those services.  Part of the extra cost of public works relates to national schools in furtherance of the Government's aims in the sphere of education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> The large increase in the cost of public services remuneration is due largely to the 9th round and the unexpectedly costly terms of 8th-round adjustments mainly arising from arbitration.</P>
    <P>One of the factors contributing to the high cost of the Supply Services generally is the rise in prices which has taken place during the past year.  This was part of the inevitable effect of the ninth round in which pay rose faster than productivity.  In the present year every effort must be made to avoid further price increases.  A further rise in prices at this juncture would seriously jeopardise the prospects of continued expansion by impairing the competitiveness of our exports on which we are so heavily dependent for growth.  It will be more difficult to maintain in 1965 the rate of expansion of exports achieved in 1964 because of the operation of the British surcharge on exports of manufactured goods and a possible slackening in the growth of demand in other export markets.  It is imperative, therefore, to avoid any further increase in the general level of internal costs and prices.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the White Paper the largest single object of expenditure in the Estimates is agriculture. The various services designed to increase agricultural efficiency, to reduce farmers' costs and to promote production and exports account for £45 million, or over 20 per cent of the total expenditure on the Supply Services. This figure is £6½ million more than last year's budget provision.  I may mention that farming incomes went up by some 16 per cent last year and that there are good prospects of a further substantial improvement in 1965.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of state expenditure in 1965/66 will be on social services.  This general term includes health and education and, on that basis, accounts for £49 million of expenditure, exclusive of pay.  Pay is, however, a large element in the cost of our educational services and a straightforward addition of the provisions for social welfare, health and education in the White Paper would, in fact, show a total of £82 million.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare recipients benefited from the 1964 Budget to the extent of <Col N="383" /> £¾ million in this financial year.  The full-year cost of that benefit is included in the figure of £35½ million for the Social Welfare Estimate&mdash;the largest single estimate in the Supply Services.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs, at £18.7 million, is another outstanding item in the White Paper. Large as it is, this figure does not represent the full extent of expenditure on the postal, telephone and telegraph services since the cost of telephone development is met from non-voted moneys.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to draw attention to the provisions for Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power. Only a token provision has, as yet, been made in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce in respect of the temporary assistance to industry arising from the effects of the imports surcharge imposed by the British authorities last autumn.  A firm estimate of cost cannot be made at this stage, but I hope to be able to make the necessary adjustment when framing the Budget.</P>
    <P>The provision for Transport and Power for next year includes the annual grant of £2 million for CIE under the 1964 Act for which provision is not included in this year's total as it has still to be made by way of Supplementary Estimate.  The net increase of some £700,000 on the current year's provision for Transport and Power is due mainly to increased expenditure on tourist development.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> aims at doubling income from tourism between 1960 and 1970.  It is hoped that the increased provision in the Estimate will make a major contribution towards that end.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account before the Dáil is based on Estimates which have been carefully examined at departmental level and submitted to further rigorous pruning by the Government. The size of the total estimated requirement which has survived this process indicates that the task of framing the Budget will not be an easy one.  It is not appropriate, however, on the Vote on Account to discuss the budgetary outlook because all the necessary data <Col N="384" /> are not available.  I can only say that, so far as expenditure is concerned, the Government have made, and will continue to make, every effort to ensure that the expenditure side of the Budget is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to agree to the Vote on Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account for which the Minister asks on this occasion is, and it is banal really to say so, the largest Vote that has ever been asked for in this House. It is obvious in the present pattern of Government expenditure that the Vote on Account will increase as Government expenditure increases each year. The point is not, however, by how much the Vote has increased but whether we are, in fact, getting value for the increases over recent years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the new system adopted under the Standing Orders last year for the Vote on Account means that we have this discussion before the Book of Estimates is available to us.  That means that we are not, therefore, in a position to discuss detailed aspects of the Estimates, detailed aspects that make up the total, even in a general way but we are able to see from the totals summarised in the White Paper before us the general pattern the Government propose in relation to the expenditure side of their Budget this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, as the Minister says, the budgetary outlook is not yet by any means final, at the same time we must consider more than the mere expenditure of this money for which he is now asking because the expenditure must be regarded against the background of where the money will be obtained.  It is a sobering thought, I think, that in the ten months to the end of January 1965, the Minister received in revenue £25 million more than he received in revenue in the same period last year. Yet, he and his Leader, the Taoiseach, and his colleagues in the Government are going around bewailing the fact that revenue will not be sufficient.  This year in the ten months to the end of January, 1965, revenue came in at £172,615,763 compared with <Col N="385" /> £147,388,952 last year.  That is taken from the statutory return published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on the 2nd of this month &mdash;£25 million extra drawn in by the Minister for Finance from the people and he is already shouting that he will not have enough, even with £25 million extra in ten months.</P>
    <P>It is impossible from this side of the House, even with the information that is published, to judge how the out-turn is likely to arise for the current year's Budget, but one thing is certain: revenue will be booming and the Minister, by the end of this year, will have taken out of the pockets of the people more money than he budgeted for last April and, God knows, that was enough.  It is inevitable, of course, that he will have to budget to extract more money from the people while estimates are continuing to rise in the manner in which they have been rising in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is, I suggest, another sobering thought for the people to realise that the figure for which the Minister is now asking for the Supply Services, a figure of £220,854,000 for the year 1965/66, is exactly double the Estimates for the Supply Services for the year 1958/59. In that year the total Estimates were £110,002,000.  This year he is asking the House to give him exactly double what he requested in 1958/59.  When a Minister for Finance asks for double that amount and suggests budgeting is going to be difficult, notwithstanding the increase in that short period, I suggest the onus is on him far more clearly and in a far more detailed way to justify that increase than he has so far done.</P>
    <P>For reasons which I shall endeavour to show later, we have had that increase without any commensurate improvement in the value for the additional money spent.  As I said, it is not the amount of the increase that is to be considered but what value we are getting for that increase or whether indeed we are getting value at all.  The Minister in the tail of his statement suggested he was going to ensure at Budget time that there would not be any further increase in the Estimates, barring the increase in the Industry and Commerce Vote.  We are entitled to judge the value of the Minister's <Col N="386" /> promise by the record of his performance so far.  In 1964 in his Budget statement, he added £5,370,000 to his Supply Services Estimate; in 1963, he added £3,780,000 and in 1962, he added £4,485,000.  Bearing in mind the increase in the amount this year it is certain we are going to have to pay for a substantial increase at Budget time.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his speech, of the increase now granted, about £4 million is on capital services and about £60,800,000 on current services.  The increase of £4 million on capital services seems to me to be virtually the same increase as there was in the first nine months of this year, when, up to 31st December last, capital services had risen from £17,729,000 to £21,741,000. Therefore we can perhaps take the information from the nine-monthly statement that capital services, as included in the Vote now before us, are expected to run at the same total figure as they were running in the current year.  Bearing in mind the increase in the cost of everything everyone has to buy and the decreased value of money, which is another way of saying the same thing, it means we are going to get next year a smaller volume of work done for the capital services than is being done this year.  The increase in costs will be operating and, as far as one can see from the note in the statement issued by the Department of Finance on 31st December, it was running then at the same rate.</P>
    <P>As far as one can see in the same statement, there appears to be more or less an equivalent intake on tobacco duty.  In that connection, although we are not going to discuss revenue in detail, it is interesting to note that the deferment of tobacco duty under section 11 of the Finance Act, 1959, was this year only £30,000 more, at £2,430,000, than the figure for last year. I have said on previous occasions, and I repeat it now, that the manner in which our Revenue depends to such a very large extent and to such a high percentage on the proceeds of the duty from tobacco alone is something extremely unhealthy and something which, at the same time, does not mean that other bad forms of taxation should be substituted for it.  But it does mean <Col N="387" /> that the expenditure is something we must watch with the greatest possible care.  The fact that the figure for expenditure on the Supply Services Estimate has doubled since 1959 shows that the Minister has not bothered at all to examine that expenditure as a Minister for Finance should.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of small things in relation to expenditure that occurred to me while the Minister was speaking. One of them concerns his own Department. His Parliamentary Secretary has been issuing a very nicely turned out magazine or pamphlet entitled <i>Oibre.</i> It does not follow, however, that the taxpayers are getting good value for it.  I want to state that quite an unnecessary number of copies of that pamphlet were put into circulation purely for the glorification of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is common knowledge all over the city that more copies went into the wastepaper baskets in 51 St. Stephen's Green than went to people who took any proper care in reading the material.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that every single person in the Department was to be given a free copy of such a pamphlet is indicative of the waste of money and of the attitude engendering waste of money, just like the waste of money over the message by the Minister for Agriculture to which reference was made last week.  It is not a very large amount, but if one has that type of mentality at the head of a Department, it is utterly hopeless to expect people down the line in the Department to take any proper steps themselves to save money.</P>
    <P>The main reason why these Estimates have risen and why the Vote on Account for which the Minister has asked has risen to such an extent is the increase in the cost of living.  That increase in the cost of living commenced, as the Minister was then warned it would, by the initiation of the spiral caused by the turnover tax.  The Minister was then solemnly warned from this side of the House that if he went on with that project, he would start a spiral of inflated costs which would <Col N="388" /> mean that in the long run the amount of duty he would collect would be swallowed up in increased costs of administration.  It started the spiral and then, as we all know now, there came the by-elections in Cork and in Kildare when the Taoiseach, as the Leader of the Government, decided that he would throw aside the appropriate national requirements and deliberately, for political purposes, proceeded to mortgage the future with the settlement which had not then been justified in any shape by our productivity and has not since, indeed, been justified by productivity.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the manner in which, from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance down, that settlement at that time was claimed, not as an economic settlement of labour rates, but as a political settlement and, as such political settlement, it has brought in its train since a serious economic disadvantage&mdash;a serious economic disadvantage for the Minister for Finance at the present time because it is by reason of that settlement jumping productivity that he has to meet a substantial part of the cost in this total of the Estimates put before us.</P>
    <P>Costs of administration have gone up.  Naturally enough, if we are to be in a position to keep the able people necessary in the Civil Service properly to administer the Government machine, they must be paid the rates appropriate to their work as would be paid if they were in outside employment.  It would be quite wrong to suggest that because they happen to be in the employment of the Government, they are not to be treated in the same way as people in outside employment doing the same kind of work are treated.</P>
    <P>The national requirements were deliberately thrown overboard by the Taoiseach for the purpose of endeavouring to get a temporary political benefit and the Minister for Finance today when he brings in this motion is carrying some of the burden which was introduced by the Taoiseach, for political purposes, into our economic life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> Between August, 1963 and November, 1964 the cost of living index figure went up by 15 points&mdash;from 160 to 175.  I suggest to the Minister that that rise in that period of 15 months is a rise that is quite unprecedented in a period of international peace.  It was a rise that was started by the Minister himself when he initiated the spiral.  It is a rise that has created considerable difficulty and will have further effect, not merely on our home front, as we are discussing in relation to these Estimates, but also on the export front where we are in the gravest danger of being priced out of our export markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister, perhaps understandably, has been unable to give us any indication of the amount that will be necessary in relation to the alleviation measures for the 15 per cent British import surcharge.  Nor has he given us any indication at all of the effect that surcharge has had on our exports since it was imposed.  It would be only an estimate but it would be desirable to have an estimate, brought down to terms of pounds, shillings and pence, of the manner in which that gross breach of contractual treaty obligations by the British Government has affected us here.</P>
    <P>We see, too, these Estimates introduced by the Minister in a pattern in which our import prices are also steadily rising.  Luckily, we have had some improvement in export prices in such a way that the heavy increase in import prices has not influenced the terms of trade as it would otherwise have done.  There is undoubtedly abroad in this city a substantial volume of opinion that the increased export unit value figures that we are lucky to have at the present time are not likely permanently to continue in future.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter of regret that the <i>Economic Series</i> issued on 9th of this month&mdash;the last statement of the <i>Economic Series</i> so issued&mdash;does not include any figure after October and, therefore, after the introduction of the British levy.  It is a matter for sobering thought that we are increasing and have so increased our costs that <Col N="390" /> we may find it extremely difficult to complete abroad and it is accepted on all sides that if we fail so to compete, then we cannot possibly hope to have any adequate economic growth.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing yet from the Minister or his colleagues as to the prognostication for a growth in this year.  The only forecast that I have seen of the outlook is the Swedish one. The Swedes feel that there will be a reduction in their growth this year of something over 20 per cent on their figures for last year.  If that is indicative of a general trade recession all over, we may very easily find ourselves caught up in the same pattern.</P>
    <P>Wherever one looks down the list of figures in this demand the Minister has made on us today, one cannot help being struck by the fact that there has been such a heavy increase and so little real worth in it.  As I said, revenue in the first ten months of this year has increased by £25 million.  In fact, going back to the same period in 1958-59, it would appear that, this year, revenue will run at about double the figure of revenue of that year.</P>
    <P>What have we got for it?  Is it not true to say that the greater part of the vast increase in revenue has been frittered away by the Government without providing for the increase which are so urgently and absolutely necessary? We all accept, for example, that there must be a substantial increase in the cost of development of our educational services.  Our educational services must be improved if we are to take part in the improving world conditions.  What is included in this list we have been given by the Minister for increased facilities for education?  There is included, and properly included, the increase in pay needed, for example, for primary teachers to enable them to compete with those who have been given increases in outside employment. But there is no real provision here for anything more than increased administrative costs in the amount that is included for primary education or indeed for secondary education, or for vocational education&mdash;there is perhaps a slight query there until one sees the details.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> There must be a substantial extension of our educational facilities and the tragedy of it all is that this additional money being collected by the Minister for Finance has been so frittered away that it is not there to meet that increase that should be available. Indeed it is a sorry commentary on the 49 Votes put before us that there is only one Vote in the whole of the 49 that shows a decrease, that is, Vote 33, the Vote for the universities.  One would have thought that in relation to university education, there was a tremendous case for making an increased amount available for further and better facilities. Vote No. 33 is the only Vote that shows decrease, of approximately £100,000 a sum of £2,981,000 dropped down to £2,889,000.</P>
    <P>We all also agree that we must make more funds available for those in the community amongst us who are not so well off.  It is another tragedy that the amount of extra taxation collected has been frittered away rather than made available for a solid increase in social welfare benefits on all sides.  It is true to say that virtually the whole of the increase for which the Minister is asking arises from administrative costs rather than improvements in the benefits given by the several Votes.</P>
    <P>In the tables issued last year at the time of the Budget, we were told that current Government expenditure was running at the rate of about 22.7 per cent of gross national income.  It would seem pretty certain, as a result of the figures the Minister has brought in now, that that percentage will be quite substantially increased.  However, that is not the whole story.  It is perfectly clear from another figure given in this list in relation to Vote 15 that the Minister is budgeting for a heavy increase in rates for local authorities.  The provision for agricultural grants for last year was £9,422,000.  According to the figure for this year, it has gone up by £3 million, approximately 30 per cent.  I presume the 1964-65 figure includes the budgetary provision which usually includes any adjustments that have been made up to the time of publication.  If that is so, it means that the Minister for Finance is now telling <Col N="392" /> us that we may expect rates throughout the country to rise by an average of 30 per cent.  Because of the spiral created by the Minister, it was felt that rates would be likely to rise from about 7/-to 10/- according to the local authorities, concerned, but on these figures, if they do include that Budget increase of £1,400,000, then we must look forward not to an increase of about 10/- in the £ in our rates but an increase running at the rate of 12/6 or 15/-, hardly a record on which a Minister for Finance can compliment himself.</P>
    <P>There is bound to be an increase of about £4 million in the Central Fund Services, bringing up the additional taxation which the Minister is going to extract from the pockets of the people to about £21 million more again next year, even though this year it is going to be about £29 million more than last year in a full 12 months, an increase in two years of about £50 million in taxation.  This is hardly a record in regard to which the Minister should introduce his Vote on Account in a few terse pages.  This Vote on Account shows that he has failed to take any proper steps to curb Government expenditure in undesirable ways and has frittered away all the additional taxation he got on tobacco, beer, petrol, with its increased costs of distribution, and also the additional £14.1 million he got from the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>This additional revenue is not available for any of the Votes for which it is needed.  It is not available for the increase in educational opportunities for our people, for the advances that must be made by science and in research if we are to keep our place in the modern world.  It has been just frittered away by an incompetent administration.  The administration must all the same be paid for.  For that reason, therefore, we have no option but to provide the necessary funds to meet the incubus Dr. Ryan created as Minister for Finance, notwithstanding the fact that his first speech as Minister for Finance showed, or pretended, that during his term of office he intended to reduce substantially <Col N="393" /> the cost of Government administration.</P>

      <P>Prior to last year, the Vote on Account could be treated in a much more detailed fashion than it now can and even with that it was regarded more or less as a preliminary discussion on what I would consider the main financial discussion of the year, that is, the discussion on the Minister's budgetary proposals.  This is even less than a preliminary discussion because while all Parties agree that this should be the method for the introduction of the Vote on Account, I think some of us feel at a disadvantage in not having had the details that are made available in the Book of Estimates.  It was only when the Minister rose this afternoon that we had some idea as to how the increasing expenditure could be broken down as between capital services and recurring expenses.</P>
      <P>However, I should like to avail of this occasion to give some of my views not on expenditure but on the state of the economy generally.  It is, I think, important to say in the first instance that many of the Government speakers who are now protesting that it will be necessary to increase taxation in order to provide for greater development of the country are entirely wrong and entirely misleading.  They have made statements to that effect in the past.  It is dishonest for them to pretend that taxation, such as the turnover tax, tax on cigarettes, tobacco and the like, is intended to provide for the greater development of the country.  It is true of course that such taxation is drawn upon in order to service the money that is usually raised by way of loan. In any case, the first account we have from the Minister for Finance that the nation has to pay means an increase of something like £21 million.  I suppose it is inevitable in view of recent occurrences and present circumstances that there should be an increase in expenditure and the Minister in his brief speech indicated in the beginning why in his opinion it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagined on reading the White Paper on expenditure the main increase <Col N="394" /> would be in respect of salaries and wages.  That was being substantiated to some extent by the Minister for Finance.  However, the percentage increases on the various Votes seem to me to be somewhat up and down.  They vary from 50 per cent in respect of vocational education, and I might say we in the Labour Party welcome, as I am sure every member of the House welcomes, increased expenditure on education generally and in particular, on vocational education.  I do not know whether it is a proper interpretation on the part of Deputy Sweetman to say that the provision of an extra one-third for agricultural grants necessarily means a similar increase in the county and borough rates.  That figure needs explanation in greater detail by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I notice also an increase in respect of last year.  What proposals the Minister will have in his next Budget we do not know.  Social welfare seems to be the Cinderella in having accorded to it over the past year an increase of five per cent.  I suppose there are many Votes that could be increased, particularly those in respect of investment for the greater expansion of the country for future years.  This is an estimate and we must await the Minister's proposals in the Budget to see whether or not any of these will be cut down and, particularly, to see whether or not any of them will be increased.  Needless to remark, we are particularly anxious to see the Vote for Social Welfare increased as well as that for Health.  Provision is made for an increase for education this year, but these are the things with which we are primarily concerned.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's speech and he said these Estimates would be carefully pruned.  The Minister for Finance has been Minister for a long time&mdash;27 or 28 years&mdash;and has given long and good service to this country as a member of the Government.  I wonder did he ever consider what pruning by the Civil Service means? It is well open to question whether we are getting full value for the money we are expending, particularly in respect of investments and in respect of aids, <Col N="395" /> whether to industry, agriculture, fisheries, lands or forestry, and so on.  I am not suggesting, and I do not think I need say this, that as far as salaries and wages are concerned, there should be any reduction or that there is any overpayment in either wages or salaries.</P>
    <P>It is true to say we have the Committee of Public Accounts to examine expenditure in respect of the various Departments to some extent, and I say deliberately &ldquo;to some extent.&rdquo;  It is not possible for a Committee such as the Committee of Public Accounts to examine these accounts in such detail to assure themselves and their Parties that we are getting the best value for expenditure in this country.  I think, therefore, and this is not the first time I said it, a committee of this House, plus, if you like, civil servants, ought to be established to examine all these schemes of investment and aid to see whether or not these aids and grants are applied in the right direction.  I have no hesitation in saying, and I say it again, that there must be some schemes in industry and, I would say, particularly agriculture, where grants and aids are given that could bring better results.  Various aid schemes have been operated in the past five, ten, 15 or 20 years and I am doubtful whether the money thus expended gave a proper return.</P>
    <P>As far as investments in the agricultural industry and capital expenditure are concerned, I suppose we have not a great problem.  That has been demonstrated over the years in respect of practically every single loan.  Any time the Government have gone to the nation asking for £X or £Y invariably these loans have been over-subscribed. Again, I suppose it is inevitable that they should be over-subscribed because down through the years generous terms have been offered to people with money to invest in national loans.  It is a good bet for them because they get generous rates and when the loan comes to be redeemed, they get a generous return.</P>
    <P>The ordinary current services are another problem.  I suppose one could say this is an investment in that the taxpayer who pays for the services gets <Col N="396" /> something back.  We are concerned about the payments for these current services which run into millions of pounds.  Again, let me refer to the oft-stated policy of the Government through their various spokesmen, particularly in recent weeks when we had a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that the emphasis would in the future be more and more on indirect rather than on direct taxation.  I do not think that is a good policy.  The Labour Party believe that the emphasis should be on direct rather than on indirect taxation.  We believe that those in this country who have money also have a responsibility to contribute according to their means and I refuse to believe that the burden of taxation is fairly placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.  We should get, at some stage, a detailed statement from the Government with regard to their policy on taxation.  The Taoiseach and some spokesmen of the Government told us on some occasions that their aim was to reduce direct taxation and increase indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>We believe the emphasis in relation to taxation should be on luxuries and there should not be a tax, such as the turnover tax, on the cost of living.  We believe higher incomes could bear a further burden of taxation.  It is ludicrous that luxury goods, no matter what one's definition of &ldquo;luxury goods&rdquo; is, should be taxed at the very same rate as the essentials of life.  We refuse to believe it is fair and just to tax luxury goods at the very same rate as tea, bread, sugar and all the necessaries of life are taxed.</P>
    <P>If the nation is to meet the increased expenditure this year, the Government should consider what return might be secured from a capital gains tax.  Many of us know that considerable sums of money are being made over the years by people buying property and selling it at a big profit.  That is not subject, as far as I know, to any sort of taxation. The workman, who has to work through the whole year, has to pay income tax on every single penny he earns, after the usual allowances, but the man who can make many thousands of pounds on a quick deal has <Col N="397" /> not to pay any tax at all.  I do not know how much money could be realised from a capital gains tax on such a transaction.  A man who knows assures me that you could make £1 million on this.  I may be wrong in asserting that in the Dáil, but even if the tax yield were only £250,000 or £500,000 and if it did not cost too much to collect, I suggest it should be got.</P>
    <P>A short time ago £750,000 gave 2/6d. a week to the old age pensioners. A capital gains tax or a similar tax would surely be desirable.  I am sure everybody in the House wants to give the people in receipt of social welfare benefits a little more comfort.  Our efforts should be directed towards increasing production and so increase the wealth of the nation.  Of course, merely to increase production or even to increase the wealth of the nation is not as important as the distribution of this wealth.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired reading speeches by certain Ministers or listening to some of the Ministers talking in statistical terms about the progress made in this country.  Granted, progress is being made, but it is equally important to see how the various sections of the community are participating in this progress or in the new wealth that may be created.  I consider, in any case, that much more could be done to ensure greater production.  Every section of the community should be imbued with that sort of spirit.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, one of the Government agents, the National Productivity Council, so far as my experience goes, seem to be tackling the problem in a sensible way because they emphasise the need for certain things to be done both by the worker and the employer. They have demonstrated in their booklets and from platforms how there can be greater co-operation between the worker and management to ensure greater production.  They also emphasise something which the Labour Party and trade unions have emphasised, that is, frequent consultations.</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomes the more <Col N="398" /> friendly atmosphere between workers and employers in recent times but there is still a long way to go.  Formerly, the only time these two sides met was on the question of wages or on the question of employment.  Therefore, we welcome these consultations on a wider level in some industries.  It is a change for the better.  It is only by mutual trust and greater consultation that we can get the increased production which this country so dearly needs and which is not likely to materialise for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>The worker wants to be assured about certain things.  There have been instances in the past of workers deciding to produce more by making a greater physical effort.  Thank God, because of recent innovations, it is possible to produce more without killing oneself or sweating to death.  There have been instances in the past of workers gearing themselves to produce more and then finding themselves out of jobs because their employers could not get a market for the goods they produced.</P>
    <P>The worker needs greater safeguards. He needs to be protected against redundancy.  Redundancy was a term which was used in practically every speech in Dáil Éireann when we were talking about what seemed to be then a certainty&mdash;our becoming a member of the European Economic Community. There was talk about industry having to change its methods, having to readapt itself and all that sort of thing. I think I would be at one with the Taoiseach when he reprimanded somebody, either an employer or an industrialist, recently about the apparent complacency in this country.  The majority of the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil Party believe that we should become a full member of the European Economic Community by 1970.  It is only five years until that time and we have quite a long way to go before we are fit to enter the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>We questioned the Minister for Industry and Commerce about motor car assembly in November or December last.  He was somewhat indignant about the questions put to him about <Col N="399" /> the slowness of the motor car industry to go after its own business and to ensure that the workers would be engaged in some sort of industry by 1970.  As far as I can gather from the newspapers, they seem to be doing nothing in respect of that particular industry.  I am afraid that is also the case in respect of other industries. Employers, during the next five years, no matter what industry is concerned, must do everything to ensure that Irish industry will be maintained and, particularly, that employment in Irish industry will be maintained and will expand.</P>
    <P>The Government have a part to play in this problem as well.  It appears from the CIO committees that there will be redundancy.  Ministers have spoken about plans that were being made to provide for redundancy and to provide for compensation, resettlement allowances and maintenance allowances in respect of workers who find themselves unemployed.  They would be retrained over a period and would be resettled in jobs all over the country.  I wonder whether there has been any progress in that matter or whether the Government have any plans in respect of redundancy, retraining and resettlement of workers who may be redundant within the next few years.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the views of the National Productivity Council are necessarily the views of the Government, because in one of their publications, they have suggested what is tantamount to a manpower policy, something to which the Taoiseach referred very briefly in his speech on the Adjournment Debate on 13th December last.  I want to assure the Taoiseach, if he needs assurance, that this is an immediate problem that has to be tackled because workers are going to be sceptical of any scheme to provide for greater production unless they are to be secure.  I do not think anybody could regard that as being a selfish attitude.</P>
    <P>I have listened to speeches by a few Ministers recently inside and outside the Dáil and I recognise an air of complacency in some of these speeches. <Col N="400" /> I do not mind any Minister boasting about the achievements of Fianna Fáil or what he considers to be the achievements of Fianna Fáil.  They are entitled to boast of anything they have done, but on the other hand, they have a duty to talk about the country's problems.  They have a duty to talk about the distasteful problems, the problems that need urgent attention, the problems that need to be tackled vigorously.  Everybody would concede that there have been improvements for certain people in that there have been improvements in the standard of living. Mark you, in regard to any taxation policy, there should be a word of warning as well, that if the standards have been increased, and they have been increased mainly through the efforts of the trade unions to which the workers belong, any attempt to depress the standard of living will be resisted very strongly.</P>
    <P>There is an attitude among certain Ministers that things are rolling along well now.  Of course it is inevitable that we should make progress, or that we should make the minimum progress, because we are in an era of relative world peace.  I do not think any country in the world could report a lack of progress or certainly any going back. In the situation in which the world finds itself at present, I suppose an average effort would ensure improvements.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the rate of progress is fast enough.  In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> adopted by the Government, an increase of four per cent per year in gross national product was forecast.  When the First Programme was being discussed here, the view of the Labour Party was that the targets were not set high enough.  I had occasion to express the same view, about this time last year, that the targets were not aimed high enough and in reply, the Taoiseach said that if the targets were raised too high, people would regard them as fantastic and would not make any effort to attain what seemed to be the unattainable.  His own record over the past two or three years shows that we have set them too low.  In the year <Col N="401" /> 1964, the gross national product increased, not by 4.3 per cent but by 4.5 per cent.  That may appear to be good; it certainly is good, I suppose, in comparison with the past decade or the past two or three decades, but in present circumstances it is not good enough. Certainly it is not good enough when one compares it with the progress in other countries.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are furnished with the OECD Journal which gives information with regard to gross national product in respect of its member countries.  Mark you, we do not fare particularly well in that.  To Irish eyes, 4.5 per cent may be good but if we are thinking in terms of association with other countries and in terms of competing with other countries in the sale of our products, we will also have to think in terms of the competition that is coming from them.  As I said, in 1964 there was an estimated increase in gross national product of 4.5 per cent.  I think I heard the Minister for Justice saying that it may be 4.3 per cent.  In Austria, it was 6 per cent; in Belgium, 5 per cent; in Germany, 6.2; in Japan, 9.9 per cent; in Norway, 6 per cent; in Switzerland, 5.9 per cent; in the USA, 4.8 per cent; in Canada, 6 per cent; in France, 5.1 per cent; in Italy 2.7 per cent; in Holland, 5.5 per cent; in Sweden, 6.2 per cent; and in the United Kingdom, 4.3 per cent.</P>

      <P>We are higher than Britain but we are the third lowest. I am not trying to make an odious comparison; I am trying to impress on the Minister for Justice the necessity for greater effort and in all that the Government must lead.  An increase in the region of 4.3 per cent or 4.5 per cent last year would mean that the Government's target as outlined in their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> would be achieved by 1970 but that may be a statistical target that <Col N="402" /> will be achieved as far as general economic growth is concerned.  It will be achieved by 1970 if we continue as we have been over the past few years. I am afraid the targets we have set ourselves for people&mdash;and they matter very much&mdash;will not be achieved if we are to continue again as we are going at present.</P>
      <P>There was a certain amount of complacency again within the Government about the provision of jobs and about unemployment.  Last year was supposed to have been a particularly good year and there seems to have been evidence that it was a good year.  Again, a fair trial would be the matter of unemployment.  What is the Government's record as far as unemployment is concerned?  The last figures we got, on last Friday or Saturday, showed that on 5th February 1965, we had 61,015 persons registered as unemployed, but on the very same date, 5th February in 1964, we had 61,067 so therefore the unemployment problem improved to the extent of 52 persons fewer unemployed in a full 12 months.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is a good record. I do not think that is something one could place against what are described as the achievements of the Government in other respects, in respect of gross national productivity, for example. I do not think we can be particularly proud of ourselves in the fact that in 12 months we reduced the numbers of unemployed by 52; that represents 6½ per cent of the unemployment rate.  Again, it is, I suppose, an odious comparison, but in Great Britain last year, and Great Britain did not have the same success as far as increase in gross national product is concerned, the unemployment rate was 1½ per cent.  As far as our unemployment rate is concerned, I do not say it is, but I have been told it is the highest in Europe.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisages that by the year 1970 emigration will have <Col N="403" /> fallen to 10,000.  The evidence for the past two years does not suggest that, unless there is some dramatic change. I do not think we will achieve a target of 10,000 emigrants in the year 1970.  From the usual sources quoted by the Taoiseach and his Parliamentary Secretary, there is evidence that, for the 12 months ended November, 1964 we had 26,800 people leaving the country.  That was a sharp increase on 1963 in which we find, from the same source, that emigration was slightly under 22,000.  It seems, therefore, that emigration has increased by something like 5,000 in 1964 as compared with 1963.  I do not know whether there is some reason for that but, if there is a reason, I should like to hear it.  In any case I believe that the target of a reduction to 10,000 emigrants by the year 1970 is overambitious, having regard to the fact that the national increase per year in population is something like 25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder will we reach the target that has been set by the year 1970 in the matter of employment.  According to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> and the Taoiseach spoke about this here a few months ago, unemployment at that stage should be a mere 1½ per cent.  It is true that more jobs are being created in industry each year.  Nobody can deny that because the evidence is there, not alone in statistics but all around us.  However, this again is not sufficient.  Between June 1963 and June 1964, there was an out-flow, or a flight, from the land to the tone of 10,600.  That does not take into account women who may have been working on the land.  Rural Ireland in those 12 months June 1963 to June 1964 lost 10,600 men.  As far as industrial employment is concerned &mdash; that is, transportable goods &mdash; the figures went up from June 1963 to June 1964 by 7,700.  That still leaves a balance of jobs to be provided.  From September 1963 to September 1964 only 5,600 new jobs had been provided.  It seems to me that the provision of jobs in industry did not go as well in 1964 as it did in 1963.  I suppose one could assume that there was some increase&mdash; I have not the figures to substantiate <Col N="404" /> this&mdash;in the numbers employed in the building industry, but it is unlikely there was an increase in employment in other sectors of the economy as far as insured workers are concerned.  Instead, therefore, of increasing overall employment we have been losing up to 3,000 each year over the last few years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to something the Minister mentioned in his opening speech.  Apart from the things I have mentioned, there are very many problems to be dealt with in this debate, many urgent and pressing problems which will be discussed here, particularly over the next two or three weeks.  There is the problem of housing, social welfare, health. These are all colossal problems.  I want to say a few words finally about prices. The Minister said some time recently that prices were the latest hobbyhorse the Labour Party were riding.  We are still riding it because the people are gravely concerned about prices.  The Minister in his speech today also appears to be concerned about prices. He said:</P>
    <P>One of the factors contributing to the high cost of the Supply Services generally is the rise in prices which has taken place during the past year.  This was part of the inevitable effect of the 9th round in which pay rose faster than productivity.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is correct.  I think the increase in productivity in the first half of last year &mdash; I have not any recent figures&mdash;is pretty substantial.  I gave figures here some time ago to show that.  The Taoiseach on that occasion acknowledged that, despite the ninth round of wage increases, they had not been matched exactly by the increase in productivity in the first half of 1964 but it seemed that productivity would match the increase in wages in the second part of 1964.  The Minister knows that this wage agreement is to obtain for 2½ years from the beginning of last year.  There can be no increase and, therefore, by the time that agreement is replaced by another, the workers will have shown that they have more than matched productivity against the increase in wages that they got.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> The Minister went on to say, very simply: &ldquo;In the present year every effort must be made to avoid further price increases.&rdquo;  That is surely a pious resolution.  Who is to make the effort? It seems to us that since the introduction of the turnover tax, little effort has been made by the Government to ensure there will be no further price increases.  The Minister has no guarantee that there will not be an increase in prices and he admits that the increases that have taken place were directly precipitated by the introduction by him of the turnover tax.  In fairness to him, it is also true to say that, had there not been a turnover tax in operation from 1st November, 1963, the trade unions would have sought an increase of some dimensions to compensate them, first, for an increase in production since the eighth round of wage increases and, secondly, for the increase in prices that has taken place since the same date.  It is a bit naïve for the Minister for Finance simply to say, in his speech introducing the Vote on Account: &ldquo;In the present year every effort must be made to avoid further price increases.&rdquo; Prices have risen spectacularly over the 12 months from November, 1963 to 1964.  They are up by a record 6.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Taoiseach seem to be particularly shy about treating of this great problem of prices. Think what you like about them&mdash;in any case I hope that they have a measure of success&mdash;the British Government are facing up to this problem.  I think the Taoiseach made some remark about them, to the effect that we will see how they get on, meaning, I assume, that they are not going to be as successful as they hope, but they are at least showing their concern about prices to the public.  This weak statement by the Minister for Finance surely is no indication, if words can indicate anything, that the Government are concerned about higher prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce assures us that he is keeping his eye on the situation, that he has initiated dozens of investigations into the prices <Col N="406" /> of certain commodities.  I do not doubt that he has initiated or instigated these investigations, but there is no evidence of it; there is no evidence as to whether or not the price increases are justified.  That evidence ought to be forthcoming, particularly as I have said before, in respect of essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body established by the late Deputy Norton was successful.  It had its failings.  It was established for a short time, but I think the Government will have to get back again to the idea of having these investigations carried out and the evidence published, because the main thing in this or any other country is to let the public know that somebody is concerned, and to let the public know, if they have to pay higher prices, the reasons why there are higher prices.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said&mdash;I do not quote him&mdash;in a speech recently something to the effect that there was no room for profiteering in the building industry. Everybody will agree with him on that. I believe that the inference was that there might be profiteering somewhere in the building industry.  If there is profiteering in that industry, surely there must be profiteering in other branches of industry and excess profits which the public are paying.</P>
    <P>We were told when the turnover tax was introduced that it would not necessarily mean high prices.  I do not know who said it, but several Ministers stated that there would be such fierce competition between manufacturers and suppliers that the possibility was not that prices would remain stable but that there would be reductions.  I would like the Minister for Justice, who I know is going to speak this evening in this debate, to give some instances of prices that were reduced since the introduction of the turnover tax.  The people are concerned about prices.  The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach know that from their own constituents, and I am sure if the truth were told, they know it from members of their own families who are frank about the increases that have occurred in recent times.</P>
    <P>I had occasion the last time I was <Col N="407" /> speaking here on an Adjournment Debate to refer to the attitude of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this question of prices.  I think I would be right in speaking for the trade union movement when I say that if there is an attempt to increase the turnover tax, as has been vaguely forecast by some Ministers, there will be a reaction from the trade union movement.  There is no doubt about it.  I would not initiate it. It will be a voluntary, spontaneous reaction by the trade union movement against any other increase in prices.</P>
    <P>The President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions spoke at the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology on 27th November last &mdash; I do not think anybody could regard him as a very rash man &mdash; and said this:</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is concerned at the danger of further price increases reducing the purchasing power of wages.  We have repeatedly asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to institute effective investigations into price rises so that at least a psychological atmosphere will be created that will influence business against taking the easy course of pushing up prices.  The Minister has been successful in having increases in the price of sugar and the price of petrol set aside. Doing this he has in fact established the case that Congress has consistently sought to make.  Investigations of other commodities would, we are satisfied, also indicate scope for reduction in prices.  I might point out that the national recommendation on wages and salaries makes provision for a review in the event of very exceptional circumstances. Should there be a tendency for prices to continue to creep upwards Congress will have to consider seeking such a review.  It is up to industry and the authorities to see that such a situation does not arise.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody could consider that as a threat by the President of the Congress of Trade Unions to the Government.  It is purely a statement of fact in which he says <Col N="408" /> if I may paraphrase it, that the members of the unions affiliated to it would not be able to bear further increases in the prices of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and tell him that the trade unions are playing their part.  They have a treaty on wages for another 18 months.  They negotiated this freely with the employers. They are doing their part to improve the economy of the country and to improve living standards.  As far as prices are concerned, we should not have any more of these pious statements by the Minister for Finance, but should get action from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard two contributions from Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Corish on the Vote on Account and I would like to deal first with some of the remarks by Deputy Corish towards the end of his speech in regard to price control.  The coming 12 months will, in effect, be the test on this matter because, as he has mentioned, there is a national wage and salary agreement providing for industrial peace for the coming 18 months as there has been for the past 12 months.  The impact from the point of view of the cost of living came shortly after the 12 per cent increase was negotiated.  This together with other factors such as increased import costs and an increase in the price of meat, which of course redounded to the benefit of the Irish farmer, accounted for the increases in the cost of living over the past 12 months.  If the National Wage Agreement is honoured and if productivity continues to rise at the rate it has been rising, we should maintain a stable price level in the coming 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in the country, I believe, welcomed the National Agreement. Any disadvantageous factors were bound to be reflected in the cost of living index in the initial months after the agreement was negotiated.  From now on, we should see benefits from that agreement which was honourably concluded between the employers and <Col N="409" /> the trade unions.  In the coming 12 months, with stability on the wage and salary front and with industrial peace guaranteed, we should see also a stable price level and a stable cost of living index figure.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Corish would agree that the criterion of Government success on the economic front must be an increase in the employment rate, that the objective in a democratic society today must be spelled out as being full employment for all our people.  Our objective on the economic front must be a situation where every Irish boy and girl educated here to the fullest degree possible can look forward to a job within our community. This objective is the basis for the reasoning behind the two <i>Programmes for Economic Expansion</i>, the first one which concluded successfully in 1963 and the second which has now been initiated and has established targets for 1970.</P>
    <P>This programming or planning&mdash;I shall not go into what I regard as a fallacious distinction between the two, but I prefer planning&mdash;has resulted in a rising graph of non-agricultural employment.  For instance, the situation in the last three years of the last Coalition Government was a falling graph in regard to industrial employment. I shall just mention the figures. In 1955, non-agricultural employment fell by 7,000; in 1956 it fell by 9,000; and in 1957, it fell by 25,000.  The total for the three years was a drop in non-agricultural employment of 41,000.</P>
    <P>We have not got the full figures for 1964.  Deputy Corish made some comparison between months in 1964 and months in 1963.  The last three years for which we have full figures are 1961, 1962 and 1963.  In these years, as against that falling graph of industrial employment or non-agricultural employment in the three years I mentioned, we have a rising graph in regard to non-agricultural employment. The figures are: 1961, employment in non-agricultural activity up by 9,000; up by 9,000 again in 1962 and by 9,000 again in 1963.</P>
    <P>The total rise in non-agricultural employment for the last three years for <Col N="410" /> which we have figures is, therefore, 27,000.  That increase of 27,000, which is a plus graph and a rising graph, can be compared with the minus graph or the falling curve for the last three years of the Coalition Government when 41,000 people lost their jobs or went out of employment in non-agricultural activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>Has the Minister the figures for transportable goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not breaking down the total figure.  There is substantial employment in services not included in the category of transportable goods.  One obvious one is the hotel and tourist services in which substantial employment is given but not included under transportable goods.  It is only by examining the total graph over a period of years that one can get a true picture.  It is wrong when arguing statistically to isolate statistics, to compare one month in one year with a month in another year.  The correct thing to do is to take the trend in order to get the true picture.  The trend over the past three years has been a rise in employment over all categories, including the transportable goods category, which comes to 27,000.  The total drop for the last three years of Coalition Government was 41,000.</P>
      <P>The net effect is that for the first time in 1963 a new pattern emerged, where employment outside agriculture was in excess of the decrease of employment in agriculture.  There was a plus increase in 1963 in employment in non-agricultural activity that for the first time more than absorbed the decrease in agricultural employment.  For the first time since the Famine, our population is rising.  That trend appeared first in 1963 and has continued at a greater rate in 1964.  Every other year for which we have statistics shows a continuous drop in population.  Again, this is an overall figure which gives the truth. The population is now rising for the first time and the trend will be up further in 1964, when we get the full population figures for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose behind Government planning is to provide for increased <Col N="411" /> employment.  We have said fairly and squarely that we will be judged on this test and on this test alone.  We have spelled out in the Second Programme that we hope to achieve a net increase of jobs in industry of 86,000 between 1960 and 1970.  That, of course, being a net increase will involve the creation of many more jobs, probably the creation of jobs in the region of 150,000, if one has to take into account inevitable redundancy and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Corish says in regard to growth figures, the only way you can judge our likelihood of achieving the 1970 employment target is the rate of economic growth and the rate of increase in national income.  As I stated, the planned rate of increase in national income under the First Programme was doubled.  The planned rate was two per cent and we achieved a rate of four per cent.  I might say that the rate of increase in national income in 1958, and for some years prior to that when it was not a minus category, was never more than one per cent. Under the Second Programme, we are planning for an increase of 4.3 per cent for each year from now until 1970.  We have not got the exact final figure for 1964, but it appears to be in the region of 4.5 per cent&mdash;a little in excess of the actual target of 4.3 per cent.  We are now in excess of the target set for 1964 and if we maintain that rate until 1970 we say we will achieve the situation where there will be an increase of 86,000 in the number of people working in industrial employment, and we will have in agriculture also increased output, increased production and a better living for the people who remain on the land.</P>

      <P>Emigration must be linked to employment in any assessment of the future from the economic point of view.  Here again we have laid our figures before the public, set our targets and set out exactly what we hope to achieve through this planned rate of economic growth that I have mentioned.  In 1960, the number of people leaving this country was assessed at 43,000.  Last year, that figure was down to 25,000.  The planned figure for 1970 is 10,000.  We are nearly half way towards our target already.  The figures for emigration have been cut from 43,000 in 1960 to 25,000 last year.  It is hoped by a falling graph in regard to emigration to reach a figure of 10,000.</P>

However, if the standard adopted is consistent, then you can argue validly from the statistical point of view.  You may have an argument about the validity of the standard, but the trend remains the same.  You may disagree as to the method, but so long as the method is the same each year, you can argue validly on it.  Adopting this method, which Deputy McQuillan may disagree with, and using it consistently <Col N="413" /> for the years mentioned, the figure for 1960 was in the region of about 66,000; for last year, 25,000 and in 1970 the figure we plan to achieve is an emigration rate of 10,000.</P>

      <P>I should mention that in 1957 there was a further figure, not relevant to the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> but only relevant to the Coalition record.  In 1957, when the Coalition Government finally scuttled out of office, the emigration figure was 60,000 against a figure of 10,000 which we will achieve in 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main basis for this has been, of course, the increase in public capital expenditure.  This is a matter to which the Labour Party have always subscribed &mdash; the importance of the State taking a greater part, both by way of direct investment and by indirect investment in the way of capital grants and loans towards private industry and agriculture.  In regard to public capital expenditure, the figure was £38 million in the first year of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> 1958/59.  The figure in the current year is £96 million.  So that we have well over a 100 per cent increase since the start of the First Programme in public capital expenditure by the State, direct and indirect investment by the State in social and economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is of course a price to be paid for that, in that debt incurred under this expenditure has to be serviced out of the annual Budget.  I would defend a rise in national debt as long as that rising graph of public capital expenditure enables us to reach the employment targets I have mentioned, and the main purpose of capital expenditure <Col N="414" /> of that nature, of course, again, is to ensure that more of our people are gainfully employed here at home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish &mdash; and I am very thankful to him for this&mdash;quoted the figures in regard to growth rates for other European and American countries. Certainly, our growth rate which is planned, of 4.3 per cent, and the one achieved, of 4.5 per cent, come out very well by comparison with our two large industrial neighbours.  The rate of growth increase last year in the United States of America was 4.8 per cent.  The rate of growth increase in Great Britain was 4.3 per cent.  Our increase was 4.5 per cent, which was an increase on the figure for Great Britain and slightly below the figure for the United States of America but which certainly is on all fours with the expansion which is taking place in those two countries.</P>
    <P>We in this island as a developing economy have achieved the same rate of economic growth as these two highly developed industrial countries.  This, I feel, is a matter which at least gives sound basis to the economic reasoning that went into the preparation of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>Coming down to the actual increases which are set out in the Minister's statement on the Vote on Account and in greater detail in the figures which have been published, I should like to disagree with Deputy Sweetman who sought to show that the increase in the Estimates for Education, in fact, did not signify anything in the way of expansion of educational facilities.  In particular.  I welcome the figure for vocational education expenditure which has risen from £2.3 million to £3.4 million.  Agreed, that expenditure will relate largely to, as it were, the running expenses of vocational education. Deputy Sweetman sought to say it related only to an increase in salaries. It will also relate to increased personnel to staff the further facilities which are planned by way of capital expenditure on technical and technological facilities.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what I mean: we have not got the final capital figures for the coming year but in the current year <Col N="415" /> the increase in capital expenditure on education rose from £1.9 million to £2.4 million&mdash;an increase of £½ million in capital expenditure on education in the coming year.  That means a growing extension of our technical facilities which will have to be serviced by more and better trained personnel to provide the necessary education.  This extension in vocational education, of course, is the most important need in the education sphere today.  There is no question that in order to bring a greater volume of our people into the industries of the future skill will be the great criterion and it is the skilled occupations that will pay best, give a better standard of living and provide the outlets for our boys and girls in the future.</P>
    <P>That is why the Government, from the capital point of view, have spelled out a scheme for establishing regional technological colleges throughout the country that will enable advanced technological courses to be made available in key centres throughout the country where boys and girls can go to the highest technological level and where these facilities will be immediately available to most of them from the location point of view.  This will mean, of course, expansion in industrial growth in areas adjacent to these technological centres and this, of course, is a development which shows the forward planning which is uppermost in Government thinking at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the increase in vocational education from £2.3 million to £3.4 million.  This is an increase, of course, that will not be challenged by anybody in this House openly but it will be challenged by people who will challenge the need for taxation, who will challenge the need for taxation at all, when, in fact, taxation is needed, of course, to provide the funds for increased expenditure of this particular kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily indirect taxation.</P>

      <P>Are we to have more taxation?  Is that what you are saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. On the general principle of whether to provide services or whether to cut down taxation, I and the Fianna Fáil Party will always stand behind progressive expenditure where necessary and we will not tolerate any cut-back in Government expenditure in directions such as I have mentioned and we certainly would not propose any cut-back in expenditure on vocational education.  We will budget for an increase in that direction and I am certain that nobody in the Fine Gael Party will come out openly and say: &ldquo;No; you should not spend an extra £1.1 million on vocational education,&rdquo; but they will run away from the problem and will refuse to face up to the fact that progress, expansion, further employment, all of these matters for which we are geared in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> have a price, and taxation is the price.</P>
      <P>Nobody can deny that this is the central issue in Irish politics today: whether our people are prepared to face up to that problem, that economic expansion has a price and the price is taxation in order to expand the economy, to provide more employment and to work towards the goal of full employment in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other matters reflecting increases of expenditure and which, when examined home, will not be controverted by Fine Gael speakers but, again, they will run away from the implications of their policy.  I believe that in their heart of hearts the Fine Gael Party are a Party of reactionaries, fundamentally anti-progress, and, if they really spelled out their feelings, they would be against any expenditure on education, against any expenditure on social welfare services, against any expenditure in the social and economic fields because, fundamentally, they believe in reduced taxes and reduced rates and a cut-back in Government <Col N="417" /> expenditure in these essential fields.  In their heart of hearts, that is their mentality and that has been their traditional attitude, but, from the political point of view, they will not say that because they know that in the democracy in which we live, our people will not tolerate any cut-back in expansion, our people will not tolerate any cut-back in Government expenditure, if it is to mean less educational facilities or less social welfare services or less investment in the social and economic expansion which they desire.</P>
    <P>I can go through the rest of the details of increases.  There is the amount, £35.5 million, in respect of social welfare, which is completely defensible, of course, and which nobody will stand up and oppose in this House.  There is an increase of £800,000 in Local Government Estimates, primarily designed to ensure that the personnel are available to prepare for the expansion in housing which has already been planned and announced by the Government &mdash; the expansion of housing both in Dublin and in the rural areas where there are increased local government grants for the construction of houses for our small farmers.  In regard to the Department of Lands, the increase is £500,000.  The expenditure there is primarily to ensure that, when we pass the Land Bill into legislation, that Bill, which was supported here by the Labour Party and opposed by the reactionary elements of Fine Gael, will enable the congestion problem to be tackled in a serious way for the first time in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>For example, within that £500,000 we will ensure that where there is an elderly couple, a man and a wife, an incapacitated brother or brothers and sisters, people of that kind who are no longer interested in working the land the Land Commission may by agreement make a deal with them to give up their land, stay on in their homes and have made available to them what amounts to a retirement pension of £4 a week each which will not count against them for old age pension purposes. Under that section which was avoided by Fine Gael during the debate on the Land Bill in the Dáil, we <Col N="418" /> expect a substantial addition to the pool of land needed by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion. For the West of Ireland largely we have provided an increased sum of £.5 million for expenditure under the Department of Lands Estimate in the coming year.  I do not expect any West of Ireland Fine Gael Deputy to oppose land division in this House.  Any West of Ireland Deputy who openly opposed land division and opposed activity by the Land Commission would not last one week in this House.  There would be a complete revulsion of feeling against him in Counties Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo and Galway.  Through the Land Bill we are giving the Land Commission the necessary powers to tackle the problem of congestion.</P>
    <P>Another major increase in the Vote on Account is one of £700,000 for tourism.  Here again is an aspect of economic development that has contributed greatly to our progress in recent years.  We have such confidence in the further expansion of tourism that we have allocated £700,000 to Bord Fáilte for its promotion and development purposes.  Our targets in this field are probably the most ambitious outlined in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> By 1970 we expect that the income from tourism will be doubled, that is, that it will be close on £100 million.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of advanced thinking that is necessary.  We can make progress only by planning ahead and facing up to the fact that increased expenditure under these desirable social and economic heads is needed to provide more employment.  The funds can only come out of revenue derived from taxation.  In order to enable the Government to plan accordingly this Vote on Account is introduced in respect of these highly defensible social and economic projects.</P>
    <P>There is only one item for which there is only a token vote and to which the Minister for Finance referred&mdash; this is the question of what sum will be necessary to compensate our exporters arising out of the British 15 per cent surcharge.  Again this is an example of prompt action taken by the <Col N="419" /> Government to ensure that export markets which had been hard won by our exporters would be maintained, that there would be no cut-back in the supply of Irish manufactured products that have made a mark on the British market.  Due to prompt Government action towards the end of last year, our exporters have received guarantees enabling them to proceed with their programming in regard to market development and sales on the British market.</P>
    <P>This again costs money and the Fine Gael Party may say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that if they wish but I know they will not.  As in the case of the other headings, they will not say our exporters should not be assisted but they will oppose any taxation designed to ensure that our exporters are assisted in this way.  That is another example of running away from the situation.  The key issue in Irish politics today is that of facing up to these matters squarely as we have been doing.</P>
    <P>There is only one way in which progress can be made.  The Government can lay down the framework, as it has done in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The Government can provide the panoply of grants, loans and incentives over the whole field ranging from housing, to industry and agriculture.  However, what really counts is confidence on the part of small people, medium people and big people, people at all levels, from the factory floor and the farm, right up to the people who invest in business.  They must have confidence that there is a future in the country, a confidence that is reflected in the fact that they are prepared to invest money in practical projects which will benefit themselves and the community.  That is what is happening here.  Certain targets have been set and our industrialists realise they can go ahead and establish more factories.  The farmers have confidence that they can use more fertilisers and buy more stock.</P>
    <P>The result of all this revival of confidence is that we had before Christmas a successful national loan floated in rather difficult circumstances, at a time when there was a great lack of confidence <Col N="420" /> in financial circles in Britain where there was a run on the £ which the British Government managed to shore up.  In those circumstances we floated a loan which was over subscribed. That is in sharp distinction to the situation which obtained in the latter years of the Coalition Government when, under Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance, two National Loans were under-subscribed.  One loan for £20 million was under-subscribed to the extent that only £8 million was secured.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into any more detail but the fact of the matter is that there was no confidence in the administration of that time.  Lack of confidence is reflected by money.  When money does not come forward it means that people have no confidence in the Government.  The people are not happy with the administration and refuse to advance money.  Two loans floated by the then Minister for Finance failed miserably and they eventually led to the economic bankruptcy of late 1956 and early 1957.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the section of the population which is basic to our economy, the farming section. Without agriculture in a healthy state we just would not survive.  From the point of view of our balance of trade and balance of payments we must have expansion in agriculture.  We must, in particular, put more money into our farmers' pockets.  Last year there was an increase in farm income of 16 per cent, the highest increase in farm income for a number of years.  That again has prompted the Government to display its belief in the future of Irish farming and under the heading of Agriculture in the Vote on Account we are going to spend an extra £6,500,000 making a total of £45 million, which represents 20 per cent of total expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is the highest single increase in the Vote on Account going to a section of our community who are now coming into their own and who are now showing that, with the assistance of the various Government schemes, they have it in them to make an economic living on their farms.  The expansion in <Col N="421" /> agriculture last year was reflected by more money in our farmers' pockets which was a great economic achievement in the past 12 months.  We are going forward on the industrial front also and there is a reduction in unemployment, an increase in employment and a reduction in emigration.  This has been made possible, I emphasise again, by an expansion of Government expenditure which has been sustained by the confidence of our people who have paid their taxes and their rates in the past number of years in a buoyant economy; the confidence of our people who have fully subscribed to national loans, and this confidence has sustained an increasing level of Government expenditure and has made possible the expansion of our economy in recent years, which will lead to the planned increase in employment, which I have mentioned, by 1970.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice with some amazement and not a little admiration because of the brash method by which he throws statistics &mdash; the ones he happens to like &mdash; across the floor of the House.  When he began, he said he was going to discuss some of the statements by Deputy Corish and Deputy Sweetman.  He did not get round to Deputy Sweetman because he was not in the House when Deputy Sweetman spoke.  He told us the line we were going to take in relation to this Vote on Account.  Having done this, which amused me, he came back to the old Deputy P.J. Burke speech to which I have listened since 1954 when I came here, except for a short time in the Seanad, when I read the Dáil debates. This speech simply said that if you vote against the Budget, you are voting against 2/6d. for the old-age pensioner. The sum total of his speech is that the Government will do wonderful things, everything in the Vote on Account is something we look forward to as a success.  If you vote against it, you are voting against more houses, against more money for farmers, against more money for the Department of Lands and all sorts of other things.  The truth is, as we say in the country, there are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> We on this side of the House are quite entitled to believe and insist that we would act differently, if we were in Government, from the present administration.  We are quite entitled to say we do not agree with the Land Bill.  As an example, the Minister for Justice went into great detail in relation to the good in the Land Bill, whereby old people can hand over their farms and receive a pension. That is an excellent provision.  He did not mention that when the Land Bill gets under way, the Minister for Lands can enter on and inspect a man's holding and then have it frozen for three months.  He will then tell the Secretary of his Department, who will be a Lay Commissioner, to start proceedings. This means, of course, that a man's holding can be frozen and taken from him just like that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into details, although the Minister for Justice did, but I want to say that we on this side of the House cannot be labelled by any member of the Cabinet as against them, and particularly the Minister for Justice, who would sell refrigerators to Eskimos.  We will not be labelled by them as people who object to progressive expenditure.  We would indicate the ways we would spend money, the aims we would have and the results we would hope would come from the activities we would engage in.  These need not be the activities which the Minister for Justice feels are the right ones for the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister was extremely detailed in relation to some of his statistical figures.  I do not want to bore people with a lot of statistics.  The figure asked for in the Budget last year was almost £200 million.  We have not reached, in relation to the financial year, the heel of the hunt yet and the Vote on Account before us does not include any Supplementary Estimates that may be passed after 31st January, so that we do not know what increase there may be, even from the figures in the last column referring to the total Estimate for 1964.  We know that the actual amount up to date is £200 million and we know the figure asked now is £220 million.  We have to think of the effect this will have on the cost <Col N="423" /> of living.  What effect will it have on the poor person and what effect will it have on the Minister for Finance himself when he comes to add to these figures the increases in social welfare benefits which he must add?  The 5/-or 2/6d. which has been the regulation increase over the past few years just will not do in 1965.  These people are at the edge of starvation and we have to think of the effect of this increase on them.</P>
    <P>As well as that, what results have come from the Government's policies over the past seven years?  Have we got value for our money?  That was the kernel of the speech of Deputy Sweetman. We on this side of the House reserve the right to criticise the results that have not been forthcoming from Government policy and from turnover tax.  The first thing to be done is to examine the cost of living index figure. The position is that the cost of living increased in this country between mid-November, 1963 and mid-November, 1964 by 5.5 per cent.  The comparative figure for the previous year is only half that amount.</P>
    <P>This means that the ninth round, the 12 per cent which should perhaps have been negotiated over another one, two or three months, with retrospective payments, was rushed through by the Taoiseach in time for two by-elections in Kildare and Cork.  He succeeded, but it is his last success.  As a result of rushing this through, we have a figure and a period of time which, in my view, are wrong, even though these figures were agreed by the employers, the employees and the trade union representatives.  In obedience to the Government, to the State, the power of the State and the elected representatives, they did this and settled for two and a half years and 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want now to say to the Taoiseach that the chickens are coming home to roost and to say to the Minister for Finance that the working people have now to face a situation that for the 1½ years they will have to look to a very much greater increase in the cost of living, no matter what the Minister for Justice says about stability.  They already had an increase of 5.5 per cent <Col N="424" /> and something of the order of 2 per cent in February, 1964.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggested that the Minister for Finance might have to increase the turnover tax this year.  He quoted the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who stated in very measured terms in a recent debate that if that were so, the trade unions would have to look at the situation. We have now arrived at the manoeuvre, which was only a manoeuvre, before the Kildare and Cork by-elections.  The Government have now to face an impossible situation. They have to face rising costs, an increased Budget and a situation in which employment will be very seriously affected.</P>
    <P>What is the other factor which still awaits culmination?  All over the country we are at the present moment striking the rate.  As everybody knows, the arbitration system of fixing payment for local authority employees works quite well except that it works slowly.  When we fixed the rates last year in March and April, all over the country the effect of the ninth round had not come into effect.  Some made some provision for it in their estimates but nobody foresaw the colossal increase which would in fact accrue.  I should like to say that my judgment is when we meet in Louth next Monday morning to strike our rates they will probably go up by 7/-.  What will be the effect of this?  There will be further increases in the cost of living.  The stability which the Minister for Justice talks about just could not be for the next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Vote on Account shows an increase of £21 million.  That does not take into account the Supplementary Estimates that may be passed in this financial year after 1st February.  After that he has got to find something for the unfortunate recipients of social benefits. Just as in progressive legislation, if it is capital, he has to refund that capital sum as well.  As far as I can see, the situation is that before we start examining the figures at all, we should examine the period from 1957 to 1965 during which the Fianna Fáil Government have been in office.  In 1958 they produced this thing which <Col N="425" /> they called a programme and which is in fact a set of targets.  They have spent a lot of money since and have not got results.  The people are paying for something which they have not received.  The Minister on page 2 of his speech said:</P>
    <P>A further rise in prices at this juncture would seriously jeopardise the prospects of continued expansion by impairing the competitiveness of our exports on which we are so heavily dependent for growth.</P>
    <P>Some pay awards in the Civil Service have yet to be implemented.  Has the Minister taken account of those?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of local authority rates and some pay awards which have yet to be implemented. I have mentioned County Louth where the rates will have to be increased by between 6/6d. and 7/-.  I believe that will be paralleled in many other counties throughout the country. In Deputy McQuillan's constituency and in others in the west of Ireland, this figure will be greatly exceeded. In that sort of economy, the rates bear far more heavily on the people as a whole.  Fine Gael object to these increases.  It is quite clear that as we become further involved in the lives of the people the Government must have increased expenditure.  It might be a far better thing if we could get that by increasing private expenditure and so keep out of the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>Let us now examine what the Government have brought about since 1958 so far as the people are concerned. Let us look at the figures for employment and the figures for unemployment. When we look at the figures for employment we must also take into consideration the figures for emigration. I agree with some of the figures given by the Minister for Justice.  When I quote the figures for employment, I do not take the line which suits me and the particular section which suits me. I produce figures from <i>Economic Statistics</i> published at Budget time, 1964. The information given at Table 15 shows that there are 16,000 fewer people at work than there were when the Government instituted their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in <Col N="426" /> 1958.  If you take the period in which they were in office, that is, from 1957 to the present day &mdash; you will agree with me at this stage I have not picked the figures that suit me but the figures when they started the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>&mdash; you will find also on Table 16 that there were 32,000 fewer people employed than we had in 1957.</P>
    <P>There is another figure which can be got also from the same volume, the total work force.  If we look at Table 15 of that volume, we find that the total work force dropped as between 1957 and 1963, that is, including unemployed, by 49,000.  There are 49,000 fewer people seeking work or at work than there were when we left office.  What is the unemployment figure?  We have heard what the British and continental figures are and what they define as unemployment. What is our unemployment figure as a percentage of the total work force? It is six per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 6.6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the correction. That means 6.6 out of every 100 men are seeking employment in this country.  What is the emigration figure?  I find it extremely difficult to get this figure.  Deputy Corish gave a figure of 25,000.  The Minister for Justice said there were 65,000 in one year.  I find it difficult to get an authentic figure.  Let us take Deputy Corish's figure of 25,000 a year.  We find 175,000 people left this country during a period.  Add to that the 49,000 and you find the figure given from these benches over the past 12 months is correct, on the basis of even the lower figure given by Deputy Corish.  In fact 200,000 people, during the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, left this country because they could not get work.  At the same time, there is a drop of 49,000 in the number of people in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was the Leader of the main Opposition who, on one of the economic debates last year, referred to the rumour circulating in this city to the effect that when the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> first appeared, its title was &ldquo;The Framework of a <Col N="427" /> Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo;. That is all it is; it is a set of targets. Individual decisions have been taken and they could have been taken by the Government as easily without any splash or programme or without any suggestion that to go against the Government &mdash; this is the whole political line-up &mdash; is to vote against expansion or an increase in employment, or the fight against emigration, and all the other things we all believe in.  The Government's idea in relation to economic expansion is that if you vote against them you are voting against the country. From the figures I have given &mdash; authenticated figures from the Goverment's <i>Economic Statistics</i> published with the Budget of 1964 &mdash; it has been proved that the results of this programme have been very bad for the people.  Two hundred thousand of them emigrated and there are now 49,000 fewer seeking work or at work, and 33,000 fewer have found work. Those are the figures and they are quite incontrovertible.</P>
    <P>The Minister on page 2 of his introductory speech made a statement which I question and I would be very grateful if he would elaborate on it when he is replying to the debate. I will quote from the last sentence on the page:</P>
    <P>I may mention that farming incomes went up by some 16 per cent last year and that there are good prospects of a further substantial improvement in 1965.</P>
    <P>I do not know what methods the Minister used or what criterion &mdash; to use the word of the Minister for Justice &mdash; he employed to find the figure of 16 per cent.  If he is using Table 6 in his book, <i>Economic Statistics</i>, page 30, for the value and volume of agricultural output, I would not agree that the improvement was 16 per cent.  This Table sets out gross output less input of feeding stuffs, fertilisers and seeds. There is something one must remember.  Rates also come into the picture, as do tractors, oil, other costs and labour.  The position at the moment is that the farm worker is reaching <Col N="428" /> the stage where he will not work for the minimum wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>More luck to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>More luck to him, as Deputy Tully says.  If you were to look at it from his personal point of view he is quite right.  The farmers must pay more.  This figure is not a real figure; it is merely the figure for gross output. If the Minister has been using any other criterion that is quite all right. I hope he will go to the trouble of giving us some explanation as to how he arrived at the quite extraordinary conclusion that farming incomes improved by 16 per cent.</P>
      <P>Let us examine what happened in relation to agriculture from 1958 to 1965.  The Minister for Justice went into some detail to explain what the Government had been doing about it. Prior to the 1957 election I remember sitting over there in the back benches listening to the present Minister for Transport and Power.  He used come in here sometimes with three brief cases, asking all sorts of questions, making statements and appeals.  The subject was agricultural marketing.  He sold the idea to the farmers' organisations &mdash; or he got on the bandwagon with the idea &mdash; that agricultural marketing was to be the saviour of the farmers and that what they had to do was market their produce and that we in Government were not doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The younger members of the Cabinet would freely sell refrigerators to Eskimos but the Minister for Transport and Power exceeded even their efforts in that regard.  The Government changed and the present Minister for Finance included in the Book of Estimates one change, that is, the figure of £250,000 for agricultural marketing.  Deputy T. Lynch, then in Opposition, put down a question every month to find out how much of it they had spent.  After six years the Minister transferred the balance to An Bord Bainne when it was established.  The balance was over £200,000; nothing had been spent except in relation to the expenses of some committees.  A good way to get rid of a pressing question is to give it to a committee.  The <Col N="429" /> committee has to investigate everything and you shelve the problem for about 12 months.  At this stage the Government shelved the problem of agriculture for about six years.  It was only when there were warning signs from the west of Ireland, and other areas, that their political supporters were leaving them that the Government started to do anything about it.  Six or seven years too late they started An Bord Bainne.  It is doing good work but it did start with six or seven years leeway to make up.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission was also six or seven years too late.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have the situation in agriculture where, even though the great framework of the ground limestone scheme, the Land Project and the agricultural advisory services is still there, the covering for the framework &mdash; if you like, the flesh on the skeleton &mdash; has not been put on.  Fianna Fáil for seven years have been talking about agriculture and they are now waking up because of their losses in Roscommon and East Galway and because the people from the west of Ireland are defending their own area.  The Government now see that they have got to do something about agriculture and they are making tentative approaches to the problem.  One of the tentative approaches was to appoint the present Minister for Agriculture who is one of their best sellers.  In fact, talking about selling refrigerators to Eskimos, he would sell two refrigerators to each Eskimo.  There are things that could be done and there are things we would do.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up the Minister for Justice on this.  He went into great detail on agriculture and, indeed, with respect, perhaps he may have been almost out of order because he went into such detail and referred to all the things the Government were doing and what they would do.  I shall tell him what we would do, but merely <i>en passant</i>, as I would be out of order if I went into detail.  We will derate all farmers with valuations of under £25.  We have done our homework. We know what it will cost and we will do it when we become the <Col N="430" /> Government.  Mark you, I should like to justify this in relation to Budgetary provisions.  Does anyone believe that a farmer with a valuation of under £25 and no other income should have to pay income tax.  Does anyone believe that if one were to assess him on the basis of income he would have to pay it?  He pays rates on his house and on his outbuildings.  Then he starts to pay rates on land and that is his stock-in-trade.  He might as well pay rates on his cattle.  At the moment he pays not alone on his farm buildings and on his house but also on his land. The justification for the measure we will introduce when we gain office is that one cannot ask a man with a valuation of £20, and who is not qualified to pay direct taxes, to pay rates on the land itself.  These are things which could be done now.  These are things which should have been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice went into great detail and I must now do the same to some extent.  It has been stated that 66,000 people will leave the land by 1970.  So the Government say.  If it were true that we have reached optimum production, if every field were giving its maximum production towards the nation's gross output, if every farmyard were geared to produce the maximum amount possible in pig meat and everything else, then I would agree that there should be some reduction in the numbers on the land. If all these things were so, then, as more machinery was purchased and more economic and efficient methods used, one man would do more work and fewer men would be needed.</P>
    <P>When one looks at all the fields in, perhaps, 25 per cent production and all the farmyards in which there is not a decent shed, and all the other spheres in which improvement is needed, one realises that not only will there be a decrease in employment on the land because of increased efficiency, a more viable economy, and greater mechanisation, but, at the same time, there will be an increase in employment because of new productions and the expansion of old productions.</P>
    <P>This is where we absolutely part company with the Government and <Col N="431" /> with Fianna Fáil.  We do not say that 66,000 people must leave the land by 1970.  We refuse to accept that.  We say instead that there are measures we can take.  These measures are simple enough.  Step up the farm buildings schemes, give grants and loans for them, make sure the buildings are recommended by the Agricultural Institute, see that the farmer has agreed with his agricultural adviser, and justified the advice, and that he will not only be able to make the repayment but will have a greater income for himself when the repayment is made.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, he gave the IAOS a grant of £12,000; he increased the grant from £8,000 to £12,000.  The great and glorious Fianna Fáil Government who say they are interested in the small farmer, who must look to co-operation for his increase in income, have left the figure at £12,000 since 1957 to the present day.  The income of the IAOS comes largely from the co-operative societies.  We will increase that grant to £50,000 and match £ for £ the contribution of the co-operative societies to the IAOS so that machinery and processing plants can be put at the disposal of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>The rural businessman has, we believe, been excluded from the agricultural effort.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the 66,000 people are supposed to leave the land by 1970. If rural businessmen can produce plans to process and market the produce of neighbouring farms, we will give them grant and loan facilities in the same way as we gave grant and loan facilities to foreign industrialists.  We will give these facilities to the men who will process and market the produce of neighbouring farms.</P>
    <P>We will restore section B of the Land Project.  People do not realise that Fianna Fáil removed the credit provision whereby poor farmers could get their land drained and the cost added on to the annuities over a period of 30 years.  The rich man can get his land drained but the poor man cannot. Could there be any greater anomaly?</P>
    <P>We will see that specialist advisory <Col N="432" /> services are available.  We will ensure that the results of the investigations and experiments of the Agricultural Institute are brought straight on to the farms, particularly in relation to farm buildings and the other skills they have succeeded in proving to be correct. We will ensure that specialist advisory officers are available to tell farmers how exactly to get more profit from all these operations.</P>
    <P>There is something in relation to industry which must be obvious to everybody.  It is true that a greater number are employed in manufacturing industry but it is also true that this increase, small though it be, has taken place almost entirely as a result of the introduction of foreign industrialists. I welcome foreign industrialists.  I approve of them getting grants and loans and employing our people.  If, in a given situation, there were two industrialists, prepared to employ the same number with the aid of the same grant and loan, one an Irish national already providing employment here and the other a foreign industrialist, I would prefer the Irish industrialist to get the grant and loan.  I am sure everybody in this House would agree with me on that.  Whatever is wrong &mdash; the Government vehemently protest that the Irish industrialist gets his grant and loan in the same way as the foreign industrialist &mdash; the Irish industrialist seems to be at a disadvantage because that is not what happens.</P>
    <P>The pattern has been the setting up of branch industries with foreign executives and foreign monetary control. There are instances of refusals of grants and loans to Irish industrialists. That seems to me to be quite wrong.  It seems wrong to me that a bakery in my constituency employing 200 people should be told it cannot have a grant and loan because it is too near the Border and, if the Common Market situation came along, it could not compete.  Where are we? Are these grant and loan facilities to be used as a defence of the jobs that may be lost here in conditions of freer trade or is it to be exclusively grant and loan facilities for foreign industrialists because the Minister or the politician can then go and open the <Col N="433" /> factory, and say: &ldquo;There are 20 new jobs&rdquo;?  That may be nice politically but there are 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 jobs in jeopardy at the moment which could be defended, jobs in industries in which employment could be expanded if there were a different approach to grant and loan facilities. It is also true to say that there have been conspicuous failures by the Government in relation to very large grants and loans.  I shall not mention any specific instances.  It would be wrong to do so.</P>

      <P>There was an increase in social welfare payments from last August as a result of decisions in last year's Budget.  The figure for social welfare payments in this Vote on Account indicates no provision for an increase this year.  The Minister must face up to the fact that the consumer price index is up as from November 1963-64 by 5.5 per cent and there are other things beside the items on the consumer price index which leave these poor people in most dreadful conditions. The customary halfcrown or five shillings just will not do.  A comprehensive re-evaluation of all this social welfare problem has been necessary for the past number of years.  The only thing that has happened here in the past 24 months in relation to this is that Deputy Colley, now Parliamentary Secretary, asked a question in Irish of <Col N="435" /> the Minister for Social Welfare to which he replied in Irish in relation to workmen's compensation and many months later we woke up to the fact that this was a change, but nothing has happened since.  A lot more has to be done than a simple change in workmen's compensation, taking over the workmen's compensation payments. There is no doubt that things are extremely bad for these people and we have a social duty in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Vote on Account indicates that the Minister for Health, who succeeded after the last election in having a Select Committee on Health Services set up, has succeeded in getting any decision of that Committee past another Budget. A memorandum from the shadow Minister for Health, Deputy T. O'Higgins, has sat on his desk for the past nine months.  Everybody knows that those people who have to depend on State medicine, whether in the lower income group or in the middle income group, are very dissatisfied with the present situation.  They are not dissatisfied with the doctors or various other things but they are dissatisfied with the whole framework of the legislation and with the hoops they have to jump through. This is going to be a major factor in our political life in years to come.</P>
      <P>I want publicly to accuse the Minister for Health &mdash; I am a member of that Select Committee on Health Services &mdash; of deliberately delaying the business of the Committee and seeing to it that no decision is arrived at. Rarely has such frustration been provided in Irish politics as what has happened in relation to that Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we can hope is that some of the less conservative and less stubborn members of the Government will come to their senses and that perhaps between now and the final figures that will be provided for the Budget, there will be some indication of a change, because this is so serious that it should not have to wait for a change of Government. Of course if that change of Government comes, then without a doubt there will be a change, and an immediate change, to a contributory <Col N="436" /> system of payments for health with a choice of doctor and many other innovations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the fact that one reduction in the Vote on Account figures is in the figure for university education.  The Government have pinned their faith entirely as far as education is concerned particularly on the establishment of regional technological colleges.  I think it is a good step forward on their part to establish these colleges and one that is long overdue, but I do not think it is the whole answer.  We on this side of the House have indicated that our policy is that if a child has reached a standard of education that indicates he could benefit from training for a profession by going through the university, then lack of money will not deprive him of that opportunity.  There is no doubt that the Government targets in relation to this indicate that the Government reject that view.  That is a major difference between us and them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you have a bad mind, that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that is a Parliamentary description. I am not saying that the Minister has a bad mind and I would never describe it in that way.  I think he has a lovely humorous disposition and should use it a little more.  I have no bad mind at all.</P>
      <P>I would finally like to say that the figures he gave on workers' total employment indicate only that if the Government have not failed in that sphere, their efforts which are in part succeeding were not paralleled in the other spheres.  They have left agriculture behind them though they have now wakened up, though I think that they are too late.  The country people have left them and the forthcoming election will prove that.  Whatever result they got from employment in manufacturing industry could have also been extended if Irish industrialists were, by a different framework of legislation, allowed to participate as fully as people from abroad.</P>
      <P>Their health policy not only is disastrous, but is being pursued in an undemocratic way.  Their education policy is restricted largely to an increase in technological education on the higher side.  In agriculture, they have not even brushed the surface.  As far as the announcement by the Minister for Justice on the Land Bill is concerned, in effect, all he could give us was the one good provision that the old age pensioner could retire and leave his farm to somebody else.  He left out the most ridiculous proposals in other sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In social welfare, the policy of the Government which has been started by this price spiral has created a situation which it will be extremely difficult to correct in the Budget, because any payment provided to these people would have to be far greater than the previous payments if they were to measure up to even bringing them back to where they were a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are our criticisms and these are the things that we will set right when we get an opportunity.  I should like to say that we will have a further <Col N="438" /> opportunity on the Budget, but this statement by the Minister for Justice, who has just left again, that if we vote against the Vote on Account, we vote against the Budget and against Ireland obliges me to say that we have heard it all before.  We are nearly voting against the flag.  We have heard it since around 1922, which was a year before I was born.  I have heard it since I came into public life, but it does not cut any ice any more.  They have not the prerogative of patriotism in the inception of industry and the expansion of agriculture or working for the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Government spokesmen, particularly the Minister for Justice, have all stated that the Government are to be judged on their record in regard to emigration and unemployment.  I want to be fair to It must be realised that they have now been eight years in office.  It is not unfair, after an eight year unbroken period of responsibility, that we should examine their record, first, in relation to unemployment and, secondly, in relation to emigration.</P>
      <P>After eight years of Government by Fianna Fáil, the position in February, 1965, in regard to unemployment, is that on 5th February, 1965, the number of registered unemployed was 61,015 and 5th February, 1964, the figure was 61,067.  Therefore, in the 12 months that have elapsed between February, 1964, and February, 1965, there has been a drop in the number of unemployed of 52.  Those figures will not be denied by the Minister.  Surely that record is something Fianna Fáil cannot be proud of?  In the past 12 months, there has been a drop of only 52 after all this ballyhoo by the Government about their plans for the solution of the various problems in the future.</P>
      <P>There are about 70 Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Is the best they can do to reduce the number of unemployed by 52?  It could be done without any grants or attractions for industrialists.  The record is there.  I think it is a clearer way of presenting the picture than the way it was presented by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now give the figures for the <Col N="439" /> nearest available date in regard to emigration.  Here, again, the Government must be judged on their record in this field, and I do not think it is unfair to judge them over this period of 8 years.  They cannot say that an imprudent type of Government intervened during this period.  They have had uninterrupted Government authority for eight years.  The position as far as emigration is concerned is that for the calendar year 1963, assessing it on the basis outlined by the Minister for Justice, 21,840 people left as emigrants.  Up to November, 1964, a total of 26,800 people emigrated.  There was, therefore, an increase of 5,000 in the number of people emigrating between 1963 and 1964, according to the latest available figures.  The Government may say some of those people were building workers who went on a temporary basis.  Perhaps, but the figure of an increase of 5,000 over the previous year cannot be explained away as building workers.</P>
    <P>This Government have told us that they are on target at the moment in regard to their planning and programming for the golden era of 1970. I do not think that is correct if the figures are as bad as I have outlined. However, I will not pursue that matter further, because other Labour Party speakers will give further details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the figures not better than the 60,000 in 1957?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has gone back to 1957.  He was not here when I said that from 1957 to 1965 no other Party had responsibility for Government in this country.  Yet we still have 61,015 unemployed on 5th February, 1965, a reduction of only 52 on the previous year.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to discuss that with me, he is welcome to do so outside the House. At the moment he will have to accept the figures which are available to him and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I should like to deal with on this Vote on Account are the omissions by way of funds towards the <Col N="440" /> rehabilitation or saving of the west of Ireland.  There is no evidence in the various figures given on this Vote on Account that the Government are any more serious today than they were 10 years ago about facing the problems which must be tackled if the west is to be made a place where the population will stay and will be given a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>I had a feeling in the last few weeks that the Government were beginning to examine their conscience in regard to their neglect of the west.  In fact, judging by the Ministerial activity, one would have thought that a genuine problem.  For the last few months we had traffic jams in Athlone with Ministerial cars going over the Shannon in turn or together to various chambers of commerce dinners and other meeting places telling the gullible people of the west &mdash; and that is what they have been &mdash; what wonderful fellows they were.  We had the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, to crown them all, we had the Taoiseach.  That is a nice selection to cross the Shannon in the past few months.  I apologise; I forgot the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I am very sorry for leaving him out of that select company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the purpose of these visits?  I presume it was to calm the people in the west, to tell them that Fianna Fáil were the friends of the people of the west, just as the Minister for Agriculture on the wireless the other night said Fianna Fáil were the farmers' friend.  I want to be quite straight.  I do not know whether the people of the west are still as gullible as they were.  They have shown their gullibility on many occasions.  I have yet to find some way to counteract the situation when high ranking members of a Government Party or an Opposition Party come down to a rural area and make all sorts of promises.  There are still areas <Col N="441" /> in the west of Ireland where the people are foolish enough to swallow the tommyrot that goes on and what passes as alleged policy from these people.</P>
      <P>Recently replies were given in this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for instance, with regard to industrial development in my constituency of Roscommon and in Leitrim.  I make no apology to the House for making special reference to Roscommon.  That county has the second highest rate of emigration.  The figures given to me of industrial employment in that country were that as a result of industrial grants given to the area in the last five years it was estimated that 290 jobs would be created in due course These are the Minister's words.  The emigration rate from Roscommon alone is 1,000 persons per year.  The Minister tells me in the House that over a period of five years we might, in due course, get 290 jobs.  These jobs are not available yet but they will be available, in due course, if the so-called industries expand.</P>
      <P>I refer to Roscommon because I am familiar with it but the same pattern obtains in places like Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford. Yet, the Minister for Transport and Power tells us that it is ludicrous for any Deputy or clergyman or anybody else who takes a serious interest in the western problem to suggest that Fianna Fáil were neglecting the west.</P>
      <P>What plans have they to improve the situation in the west?  The Minister for Transport and Power went to Galway, where he has a docks, one of the most pathetic sights in the State, one of the most inefficient bits of work ever undertaken.  It will not give Galway any status whatever as a port. It is thrown there as a sop to the people of Galway.  The Minister for Transport has the audacity to say that the people in Galway should be thankful for the State grant for this miserable development work that has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, in the past few weeks went to Mayo and Roscommon to inspect what he described as the pilot <Col N="442" /> area development scheme.  I want to be very blunt again.  The Minister for Agriculture went to a place in Roscommon called Ballinameen and met some of the local people.  He said he was very interested in the pilot area development scheme and his words were that he wanted to see schemes hatched out in these pilot areas which could be applied in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The other day, in the House, I asked his colleague who is sitting here now, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, what steps he was taking to implement drainage works of the Bridogue river which is in the area of the area pilot scheme and he told me that the earliest anything could be done about a survey would be 1967 and that after that, when an assessment was made, if it was considered advisable, a drainage scheme would be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary and others that the pilot area scheme in that locality cannot be successful until the drainage scheme is implemented.  What kind of scheme does the Minister for Agriculture expect to see hatched out in that pilot area when the first and most important work to be done is drainage?  Is not a drainage scheme the first scheme that he should hatch out?  I mention that matter only in passing to show how lacking in sincerity the Government are with regard to their policy in the west.</P>

      <P>You did not get rid of the Ceann Comhairle.  You may have got rid of another man of your own Party but you have not got rid of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Minister for Lands holds up a new Land Bill as one of the means by which an improvement will take place in the economic circumstances of the small farmer in the west.  Let me be very brief on it, in reply to the Minister for Justice.  There are parts of the Land Bill referring to old age pensioners, invalids, and so forth, with which I am in full agreement. However, I want to make it quite clear it is a game of bluff for <Col N="445" /> Fianna Fáil to say it was necessary to introduce certain new sections in that Bill to enable the Land Commission to acquire extra land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Bill has been discussed long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only replying very briefly to what was said by the Minister for Justice.  The powers are there already but what we would like to see as a solution in the west of Ireland and in any other part of the country is a ceiling on the amount of land to be held by any person.  If that were done, we could be sure that the 45-acre holding about which we hear so much could be made available.  It cannot be made available under the Land Bill.  There is no use in trying to hoodwink the people of the west of Ireland that you will create holdings for them when no attempt is made to touch the parts of Ireland where the land is available, namely, the midlands.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Lands and his colleagues say the Bill is for the purpose of taking the land from the landlords in London and other places, I know who the landlords of London are. They are the small farmers in my constituency, in Roscommon, in Mayo and Leitrim, who were part-farmers and part county council workers.  They are men who worked for a period of the year with the local authority on the roads or drainage, men who, through the introduction of machinery by the local authorities, lost their jobs, were unable to live on their holdings and were driven out of the country.  They are now emigrants working in London and they are the people whose land it is hoped now to acquire.  Under the Land Bill, they are the absentee landlords in London.  They do not realise it themselves, the unfortunates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position in regard to industrial development generally in the west of Ireland?  This Government pin their faith, and indeed so do the major Opposition Party, on the activities of An Foras Tionscal and other such bodies.  Is it not a fact that the Undeveloped Areas Act has been a failure as far as the west of Ireland is concerned?  It has failed completely to stem the tide of emigration, to stop this <Col N="446" /> outflow of the young people.  All it has done is to provide grants and aid to private enterprise, to bolster up, to mollycoddle private enterprise, to allow big profits to be made by private enterprise, while at the same time, failing to safeguard the rights of the people of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The majority of the groups which have come to this country, and to the west particularly, under the Undeveloped Areas Act and with grants from An Foras Tionscal are subsidiaries, with their headquarters outside this State.  We can trace here in this country how good or how bad the parent company is by the activities of its subsidiary here.  In other words, we cannot make any long-term assessment of what the benefits of these branch industries will be to the economy.</P>
    <P>These industrialists are given very attractive grants.  They pay no tax on their exports for a period of, perhaps, 20 years, and they are attracted here by the idea of cheap and plentiful labour. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said the Government in no circumstances would seek to attract these people here on that basis.  Cheap labour is the main attraction here.</P>
    <P>I gave an instance here last week of these industrialists coming over here and establishing branch factories, branch factories which could have been established right beside the parent ones in cities in England and elsewhere. The view the people in charge of these firms took was: &ldquo;We are going to get a very good grant.  We are going to get assistance in the erection of our houses, and for the training of our workers, and we shall not have to pay taxation on our exports.  We are going to pay the workers one-third of what they would get if we were employing them here in England.&rdquo;  That is precisely why they are coming here.</P>
    <P>The position down in Shannon, in the Parliamentary Secretary's area, is such that soon they will have to send up a hovercraft to search the countryside for young girls to get them into this industrial maw in Shannon where they will be processed and streamlined before they go to England.  The <Col N="447" /> position is that they cannot get these young people.  There is nobody coming home from England, however, to work in Shannon.  There are no girls or boys being attracted home in the numbers we were told they would be attracted to come here to work.  Why? Because they know what the rate of pay is.  We were told Irish boys and girls would be thankful to get one-third or half of what they could earn in England, that because some foreigner graces our shores with his presence, we should all look up with our mouths open and say: &ldquo;He is a very decent man to come here at all. Do not say a word against him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That type of haphazard industrial development which has been initiated by the Government is no solution of the problems of the west of Ireland. I have been saying since that Act came in in 1952, that the most it could do was help.  It is not even doing that and it is high time the Government took steps to alter the situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce maintains &mdash; and I presume his colleagues agree with him &mdash; that the Undeveloped Areas Act still gives preference to the west of Ireland.  It certainly does not.  The idea of the Undeveloped Areas Act was to give special consideration to the west but the Government thought so little of the west that they decided to widen the scope of the Act and now the benefits of this Act, the high grants, no taxation, or reduction of taxation on profits, and so on, apply all over the country, including the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>If I want to give an example of what this Government think of the west of Ireland and particularly of a constituency like Roscommon or Leitrim, I could put it this way.  In the past ten years in that area of Roscommon and Leitrim, a total of £65,000 was given in grants to start industries.  Only last year in the city of Dublin, one firm engaged in the bacon processing industry had a grant of £200,000 sanctioned for the expansion of a factory for an industry that should be placed in the heart of Ireland, in the west of Ireland, because pig rearing is <Col N="448" /> one of the most important elements of the small farmer's output.  If that amount was to be spent on the expansion of the pig industry it is in the area where the pigs were being bred and reared.  I mention that only in passing to show what this Government think of the west as compared with what they think of people nearer home in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said some time ago that I was indulging in obstruction and destructive criticisms.  I am merely pointing out the deficiencies in Government policy in order to spotlight the necessity for a change in outlook on the part of the Government and, indeed, a change in outlook on the part of any other Party which in the near future may hope to replace the bunch in office.  It is no good telling the people of the west of Ireland that you will derate their land.  That is no solution.  It will not wash.</P>
    <P>That outlook shows how little those people know about the fundamental problems facing the people in the west.  It is an election gimmick if ever there was one and, as far as I am concerned, I shall expose it on every platform in the country.  One of the important things any Government should do is spend money available to agriculture in the proper fashion.  The Government is boasting about how much is available in this Vote on Account for the agricultural industry.  Is that being spent properly?  Do we not know that, in effect, a large proportion of the money will go into the pockets of the very big farmer, the rancher and the waster?</P>
    <P>We hear people talking about derating. Why should the man who is not using his land and who is not a good farmer get the same encouragement or aids as the man who helps himself and works hard?</P>

      <P>What are the Government doing with regard to the relief of rates?  Is it not a blanket incentive given for the past ten or 12 years by the Fianna Fáil Party instead <Col N="449" /> of being given as a form of encouragement to those people who are working.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that the small man is working.  He has to work to live.  If he does not work he starves or gets out.  On my way here I look at the land in the midlands.  Passing through Mullingar I meet big cars moving down to the race meetings. The majority of these are so-called farmers getting a substantial relief in rates, instead of being taxed up to their two eyes.  We have the position then that the man with the jodhpurs, Colonel So-and-So and Captain So-and-So and all the Irish gentry as well, can spend their time at the race meetings and have their broad acres producing one-third of what the land could produce while the Government and the major Opposition Party are prepared to ease the rates burden by a subsidy each year, whereas the small man and the medium-size farmer is working hard and getting no incentive. You will not get the requisite output of agriculture while that mentality prevails among political Parties.</P>
      <P>One of the most important things in the eyes of the small farmer and, indeed, the general public is that if we are anxious to provide a living for the largest number of people on reasonably sized holdings in the country we will have to set about putting a ceiling on the amount of land that each individual may own.  I should like to know where the two major Parties stand in that regard.  More and more as each day passes they are closing in together and becoming more and more alike and are finding it harder and harder to pick artificial differences between themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy up to the present as far as the small farmer is concerned, particularly in the west, is geared to the store cattle trade.  I hear people say the cattle industry is not the means by which the small farmer can be rehabilitated and given a proper standard of living.  From the point of view of income for the small farmer and employment content, the cattle industry has one of the lowest contents of employment of any type of agricultural industry and yet the Government <Col N="450" /> deliberately plan between now and 1970 to increase the cattle population by 47 per cent and lower the human population by 30 per cent in the western areas.</P>
    <P>That is Government policy.  In other words: clear out the congests, clear out the small farmers, tell them the Land Bill will give them 45 acres and replace them with bullocks.  I suppose I will be accused now of denigrating the cattle industry by people in this House who cannot get down quickly enough to the chapel gate to say that I was talking against the cattle industry.  Let us have the cattle industry but let us not concentrate on it to the extent we are and to the exclusion of what can be of far greater benefit to the small farmer in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have had much talk recently about what credit can do for the small farmer.  People suggest that, given plenty of credit, the small farmer will be able to raise himself up by his wellingtons out of the floods.  That is not the fundamental difficulty that faces the small farmer at all in the west of Ireland.  It can be put as clearly as this.  No matter what credit you give him, no matter what expansion takes place, the cream of the production is siphoned off by the processing groups and by the commercial bandits that lie between the small farmer and the consumer.  They will get in turn their rake off any credit or any grants the small farmer may get.  The first thing that has to be done by any Government that are serious in aiding the small farmer is to put a tight knot on the people who are exploiting the small farmer in this country for the past 40 to 50 years.  We are entitled at least to go back to the time when native government was established here.</P>
    <P>I want to enlarge on that a bit.  We heard a lot about private enterprise and how much the Government believe in it.  We know, as far as the small farmer is concerned, private enterprise means he will be left on the marsh of processing, shortages and surpluses.  He is not getting a guaranteed price or a continuity price for his production, with a few negligible exceptions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> The beet industry to my mind is one of the finest examples we have of what should be in operation in other fields.  We have here a perfect example of co-operation; we have the co-operative movement established through the Beet Growers Association. They are there with power to fight their case with regard to the price for their product, to fight their case on the question of credit, and on the matter of machinery.  At the other end we have the State, through the Sugar Company, acting as a processing agent for the produce of the land.  The Sugar Company in turn make profits which are ploughed back for the good of the community.  The company in turn make available technical assistance, credit assistance, and so on, to the members of the co-operative, the people who grow the beet.  Is that not the proper integration of the State into the co-operative movement where there is no such thing as one dominating another?  We have a guaranteed price for the producer, first-class trade union employment for the worker and produce for the consumer at a reasonable rate.  That is the perfect example of an agricultural processing industry.</P>
    <P>Can we not apply that to other parts of agricultural output?  Can we not apply that, for instance, to the bacon industry instead of handing over £200,000 to this factory in Dublin and instead of having to send to some of the laziest bacon factories in parts of the west of Ireland, that are reaping large profits and at the same time wiping the eye of the farmer with regard to the prices given to him? What is wrong with a similar type of blueprint being put into operation for the bacon industry?  It is not for us to apologise to these people who are 40 years in the bacon industry and have made their money.  We should take over the bacon industry and run it for the people.  We should tell them to get out of it.  At the moment we are pretending to take over the bacon industry and run it for the community.  The Government have found that these people are lackadaisical, and are not even seeking a market for the bacon.  These people are jeopardising that industry in their <Col N="452" /> capacity as a private industry.  That is no way to get a healthy concern developed.</P>
    <P>Could we not apply that to the milling industry and the tremendous ramifications involved in that industry, in its by-products?  Why could we not run it ourselves and say to Odlums and Ranks and these outside people: &ldquo;We are willing to part company.  If you do not feel like modernising your factories or milling plants here because there is not enough profit for you, good-bye&rdquo;? That is what this Government, or whatever Government replaces them, must do and this is the only way the small farmer will get his profits.</P>
    <P>Why do we not do that?  A total of 70 per cent of the milling industry in this country control in their turn 80 per cent of the pig industry in that they control the entire output of the provender business and all food for pigs, poultry and so forth.  That is all controlled by those people, and can only be bought at whatever figure they feel inclined to charge.  What does it matter that every small farmer in the west of Ireland is at the mercy of these people?</P>
    <P>Let us take the county of Wexford, from which Deputy Corish comes.  I have nothing against the people of County Wexford getting their food-stuffs for animals at the prices they get them.  They pay anything up to one-third less for their products for feeding than the small farmer in the west of Ireland has to pay.  That is a very stiff handicap imposed on those small farmers in the west.  They have very small holdings and they are unable to grow feeding stuff themselves.  They must buy their feeding stuff and they have only one source to buy it from. They have to buy it from the people who control the milling, bacon and provender end of it.  It will take State interference to alter that situation.</P>
    <P>There is no question of a subsidy being provided to the small farmer in the west of Ireland for his feeding stuffs.  He has to pay more for it than the farmers in the rest of the country. Are any steps being taken by the Government to remedy that?  Perhaps we will be told there will be a subsidy.  I do not ask for a subsidy because it will go into the wrong pockets.  The <Col N="453" /> blueprint I have suggested in regard to the Sugar Company could be applied there.</P>
    <P>There is another processing industry in this country which can be of tremendous potentiality to the small farmer, his sons and the workers of this country, that is, the distilling industry which is based on the production of malting barley.  Our distillers last year sold £450,000 worth of whiskey outside the State.  A percentage of that is raw whiskey.  During the same period the Scotch whisky distillers exported £92 million worth as against £450,000 worth which we exported.  Since 1954, our distillers have failed to expand their industry and seek markets to produce the type of whiskey which would be attractive to certain countries abroad.  They have done damn-all about it.</P>
    <P>What can be done about that?  I shall not enlarge on this except to say I am satisfied there is a first-class market, particularly in America, if we produce the right type of whiskey.  If we do so, there is unlimited scope for the small and medium-size farmer, as far as the growing of malting barley is concerned.  Nobody will deny that it is a far more suitable crop in parts of this country than wheat and it is easier to grow than some of the crops for which guaranteed prices are given at the present time.  The value to the community of £10 million worth of whiskey exported abroad will be greater in employment content to Ireland than £50 million worth of exports in the cattle industry.  Has anybody taken any steps to expand that industry?  I do not see anything being done about it.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of agriculture which I could deal with in detail but I shall not do so now.  I shall just mention, on behalf of the small farmer, the production of turkeys. Is he not at the mercy of conditions abroad as regards prices?  He has not a clue, nor have the Government a clue, in the month before Christmas what the small farmer is likely to get for his produce.  Is it not the same position as regards the price of wool? We are not in a position to guarantee <Col N="454" /> the price of wool to the small farmer and say that he will get so much per pound for the amount he produces. There is no guarantee to the small farmer who produces turkeys or pigs. The small farmer finds it is not worth while producing wheat.  The security in that industry is for the big man.  I am not objecting to that security for him. The scope of it should be enlarged so that the small farmer, who is going out of business, and who is being driven out of his small holding, will be given an incentive to stay.  We should have a blueprint for the total agricultural production of the small farmers in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The proper way to deal with this matter is to process the maximum amount of goods which they produce. If the processing of those products is left in the hands of private enterprise, which for generations has failed in its duty to expand, as it ought, then the Government have a duty to step in and nationalise these industries on behalf of the community.  I make no bones about it.  That is where the Labour Party differ completely from the other two Parties which are worshipping to this day at the altar of private enterprise.  We say the small farmer and the producer must be protected from the bandit mentality of the processor.  The Government say &ldquo;we must remember that private enterprise is a sacred thing&rdquo; and it would be wrong to touch the processing agent, the distiller, the bacon factory, the flour millers, because they are all influential people.  If we look for the real reason why no major Party has felt like tampering with them we will see the reason when the annual reports of the various banks are published.  If we look at the names and photographs of the directors what do we see?  We see &ldquo;Mr. X&rdquo; director of such-and-such a bank, but we will also find that he is a big noise in a distillery, or in the milling industry, or the director of a bacon factory.</P>
    <P>All these people are interlocked; they are all part and parcel of the one gigantic set-up.  Then the Government say to the small farmer &ldquo;we are for you&rdquo;.  The Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="455" /> Deputy Haughey, says &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is the farmer's friend&rdquo;.  If he is it is only when he goes down to see him in the floods of Ballinameen but when he comes back to Dublin we know where his friends are; they are in the pig industry or the bacon industry and all these other vital industries which are based on the land.  We have not got minerals in this country such as oil but we have land and it is the Government's duty to see that we get the maximum production from it and that at the same time the small farmer is given his freedom and the right to live in this country.  What I suggest is not going to interfere in the slightest degree with the rights of the individual.  In fact, it would protect the rights of the individual to stay in his own country, live here and work efficiently just like the co-operative movement in Holland provides a good living for those engaged in it.  We want to see that extension of the co-operative movement with the Government co-operating with such companies as the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the activities of the Glencolumbcille group and to Father McDyer.  I have a great regard for the courageous and great work of Father McDyer and others like him but I want Father McDyer to realise that what he is preaching is socialism.  He will have to realise it and so will the three Bishops in Charlestown who stand over Father McDyer in the Charlestown Committee who have signed their names to what can only be described as a socialist manifesto in which they state that they believe it is the State's responsibility to save the west of Ireland.  They do not realise that they are preaching socialism but it is no harm to let them know because when I preached it in the west for many years they put horns on me and when Father Fahy preached it he was transferred from his parish and he was made a curate again.  But what I said is the policy now being preached by these people because they know the west is going and going fast.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see, as far as they are concerned, that they back the idea of <Col N="456" /> State enterprise, the idea of the State taking responsible actions as far as the west is concerned.  Outside of the agriculture end about which I have spoken, and which must be dealt with as far as these processing agents are concerned, there is another aspect the Government must examine and for which they must come up with an answer in the very near future.  Apart from the processing of agricultural products, guaranteed prices and a proper export market for products, it is necessary that other types of industry be established.  The Undeveloped Areas Act failed to bring about the necessary improvement in the rural areas and towns.  The Government will have to examine the situation in regard to setting up industrial centres. I have referred to the Shannon Development Zone and I have referred to it on the basis that a number of fly by night people have operated there but the whole idea is good and I am behind it.  That type of planning should be implemented in other parts.</P>
    <P>We know that the Shannon idea was mooted because Shannon Airport was in difficulties and this was to help the airport and to expand it.  I do not know what the hopes are for the future but I know that the intention was to stabilise the position there.  Why should areas where we have hundreds of people out of work, waiting each year to go to England to make a living, from which small farmers and their sons and daughters have to leave, not be selected by the Government and given the VIP treatment?  Would that not be a far better proposition for the Government instead of sending the Minister for Agriculture to Ballinameen to see a pilot scheme and where he discovers that drainage is the most important thing?  It would be far better to pick a number of towns in the west and make them development or key centres in which the Government would establish the industries, build factories and control them.  They could transfer some of the funds which to my mind are now being wasted on grants to people who have no intention of staying once the prospect of paying tax looms up in front of them.  Why should a lot of that money not be <Col N="457" /> transferred from the undeveloped areas and utilised for the setting up of State industries?  I know that the CIO have made a report on this, as have other groups, but there should be no delay in providing action as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>I know that the Government will be accused of moving away from private enterprise and moving deeper into the field of State enterprise.  That is more than desirable when private enterprise has failed as it has so ignominiously. The Government have already taken a very encouraging step by the recent acquisition of shipping lines.  That was a most admirable step.  Now we want to see further Government action in other areas and other key fields.  I have already referred to some of them. I will not delay the House any longer except to say that the safeguarding of the west, the development of the west, the reduction of emigration and the ending of unemployment in the west, must depend on Government plans and through Government intervention.  Too long have we looked at the inefficiency of private enterprise in this regard.  If this Government are going to stay on I hope that while they are in office they will at least prepare the ground in this regard for whatever Government follows them, whether it is in the next six months or 18 months.</P>

      <P>The Vote on Account gives us the opportunity of reviewing the whole economic situation.  In 1964, for the first time in over 100 years, the population increased.  That shows there is more confidence.  It shows people realise things are going well and that there is a future in the country. Emigration has decreased.  We should all like to see emigration decreasing still further and the population continuing to rise every year, but we have at least stemmed emigration and that is a fair indication of the progress the country is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main results of the increase in population has been the growth in industry over the past seven years.  There has been a steady 4 per cent increase each year and we are harvesting the results of that now.  The increase in population is one result.  That could not have been achieved were it not for the incentives given to foreign industrialists to establish factories here. It is all very fine asking the Government to set up factories and stating that Irishmen should set up factories. One must remember that our population numbers only some 2¾ million and one or two factories are sufficient to cater for the needs of our population in any particular commodity.  If we increase our factories we must also increase <Col N="460" /> our markets.  We must export our commodities.</P>
    <P>Production is not the most important aspect.  Selling is more important than producing.  It is no use producing if one cannot sell.  Foreign industrialists who establish factories here have markets at their disposal.  They have the knowhow. They have the sales organisation and that is why we must encourage them to come in and establish factories here.  Some people decry the idea of foreign industrialists coming in here. There are very few foreigners really on the staff of these factories.  Possibly one per cent represents foreign personnel. There are a few directors, a few key men, and the rest, over 90 per cent, are Irish men and women.  As time goes on Irish men and women will become general managers and directors.  With the exception of those foreigners who intend to make their homes here the rest will stay only sufficiently long to train Irish men and women to replace them.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should have skilled men and technicians to take over and run these factories.  From that point of view vocational education is of paramount importance. Nearly all our boys now are continuing on into secondary and vocational education.  These will have to be trained in the particular skills.  I am glad we are able to provide apprentices for these foreign industrialists. They have been given every possible assistance.  These industries are providing employment for the labour available.  Seven years ago, when we took office, large numbers of people were emigrating, large numbers were unemployed.  The worst feature was the chronic wail that one heard everywhere that the country was finished. There was despondency all over. That has changed completely; the people are full of confidence now.  Going around the country you cannot help asking yourself: &ldquo;Is it not a great little country we have?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are really only at the beginning as far as economic expansion is concerned. All along there has been a planned programme.  One has to plan in order to achieve anything.  It has taken a few years to get results.  The <Col N="461" /> First Programme was a success.  We are entering on the Second Programme now with the future planned up to 1970.  Only with planned economy can the country go ahead and achieve the desired results.  Every aspect of national life has been covered, with particular emphasis on industry, agriculture and tourism.  These are the main sources of income.  We have only to look back on 1932 when we were depending completely on agriculture At present we have industry and tourism running on a parallel with it.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> for farming we have set our target for increasing the cattle population year by year up to 1970.  One of the ideas there was the scheme for the heifer subsidy of £15.  There was a good deal of criticism of that scheme when it first came into operation.  Some did not understand it.  Others felt that it could not be achieved, but one thing that is obvious is the results.  We have seen that where the Minister had estimated for something like £½ million to cover the scheme in the first year in actual fact he had to find £3 million.  This just shows that he sees the farmers' needs and it is a good encouragement to the farmers.  The Minister has shown that in a very striking way, in that practically six times the number of heifers were put in calf that it was calculated would be achieved in the first year.  The results show that he got an exceptionally good start, and that when we were only planning for something like this in 1968 we have got it in the first year.  It is bound to keep increasing because, having so many calves now, the cattle population will will go up greatly all the time.  The land of Ireland can carry more cattle because of the added manures and fertilisers and good planning which will enable it to carry the extra cattle.</P>
    <P>We have seen some of the results of this in the past five or six years with the increase in every form of fertiliser, which has practically doubled&mdash;superphosphates, potash and nitrogen&mdash;in each one of them the increase has been very striking.  By driving around the country one can see in early spring how <Col N="462" /> many green fields there are as compared with the position 20 or 30 years ago when there were practically no green fields until perhaps May and during March you got dry harsh weather and nothing but a white landscape. Today with the fields getting fertilisers you can see the green coming on even in the middle of winter.  It is showing the results.  With more and more use of fertilisers the country will be able to carry the extra capital.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest incentives ever given to farming, to which not enough credit has been given, was the subsidy for artificial manures.  Because of these subsides we have seen the results today.  It is coming on slowly each year but gaining momentum in each year.</P>
    <P>The Government have been doing well in giving these incentives and have been phasing them properly so that when something is needed they have been able to afford the necessary incentive to get the desired results like our heifer scheme.</P>
    <P>They have also tackled the problems of where the surplus milk was going to.  With An Bord Bainne they have been able to achieve results, and have now for quite a long time been able to supply the market with a commodity carrying the one brand name.  They have achieved this by Kerrygold. Every other country has been selling one particular brand instead of going in under different brands or, as was often happening at that time, in 56 lb churns.  They got the sales end all right.  They are breaking in, going into the Irish areas and then branching out strongly in England and all over the world.  From what I gather, they have always been getting repeat orders. There was a danger that they might have oversold themselves, but the grass and the increase in milk was able to cover that.</P>
    <P>I know that they have the same thing coming this year, that they have been looking into the market and they know that the country will be able to produce the milk they will need.  Before I ever came into this House&mdash;and that is not too long away&mdash;we were worried about where we could sell our butter.  With a change in the broad planning and <Col N="463" /> in the sales organisation, we have been able to get this butter away. Now we are starting to encourage our people to use cheese and to sell it, as we are one of the lowest cheeseconsuming countries in the world.</P>
    <P>Farming, as with anything else, needs planning, and it covers very wide fields in this country with variation of soil and systems of farming.  It is a particularly hard thing to cover all the aspects of it.  In our Book of Estimates for agriculture every field has been covered in an encouraging way that is needed to get the best results.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is one of the really nice type of industries that you like to have, particularly from a Government point of view.  You have very little to spend and the amount of money brought into the country is very great.  In the case of no other industry that we have do we give so little and get so much.  But like everything else you cannot have it both ways.  You cannot expect the same results possible from all the others. It is great to see tourism gaining so much that it has become one of the three main sources of income for the country.  Every encouragement should be given to it, because although we hear from across the House people saying that it is only Irish people coming back again there are a certain number of them coming back but it is a small percentage compared to the people coming from other countries, with the world becoming so much smaller and with foreign people so keen to come to Ireland.  I find when I am abroad that they are very curious to know about Ireland and they are beginning to hear that it is a very nice country, very friendly, easy to drive around in and with very nice people looking after them, with the natural beauty of the country and of course our own make-up and the way we go out of our way to show a cead míle fáilte to visitors.</P>
    <P>The Department and Bord Fáilte have been sending booklets and literature abroad everywhere and people are beginning to see that we have a very nice country worth visiting. <Col N="464" /> It is not commercialised to the same extent as some other countries; we have views, and you can get around in comfort.  In England, for example, if you want to go out motoring especially at week-ends it is just one whole traffic jam possibly from start to finish, for miles and miles.  We count some of the traffic here in Dublin as fairly bad, but they have it all over the country.  Here you can drive around in comfort and see things.  Any encouragement needed by a tourist industry is more than justified.  Possibly we could have more grade B hotels to cater for a particular type of tourists who are not looking for very expensive hotels but want a family hotel.</P>
    <P>One section of the tourist industry of which we hear little is coarse fishing. Yet it attracts many visitors, mostly from England.  Last year the Irish championships were held along the canal at Prosperous in my own constituency. There were many foreign visitors fishing there.  They stretched five or six miles along the canal bank.  Most of these visitors go to the family type hotel or guest house.  We need more of these near our lakes, rivers and canals. When I was in Roscommon I was pleased to see that the road to every lake was signposted.  That is what is wanted.  These visitors can be given directions, but if the road is properly signposted it is much better.  Perhaps Bord Fáilte could give more grants to encourage this work.</P>
    <P>We have set ourselves a planting target in forestry of 25,000 acres per year, and we have been able to achieve it.  This is certainly building for the future.  It seems hard to believe that we can continue to get that amount of land each year.  But there are plenty of mountains and waste bogland than can be used for this purpose.  As a result of this planting we will have a very big forest industry in the future.  As an old farmer once said to me &ldquo;If a farmer sows a plantation, his son will reap the benefit of it.&rdquo; It is the same for the State.  In the years to come, the State will be reaping the benefit of this. When I was in Galway, I was particularly heartened to see large sections of mountainside planted.  I noticed this was giving a tremendous amount of <Col N="465" /> employment.  The impact was more noticeable than in my own constituency where the plantations are smaller and scattered.  We know employment is being given there, but the percentage is not as great.  When all these plantations are amalgamated not alone will we be getting money from them but we will be providing shelter belts for the adjoining farmers.  In time we hope to have a pulping industry to turn this timber into paper.  As it is, a lot of it is being used in industry.  It will also provide fuel for electricity and for the post offices.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that the Government had the foresight and the confidence in the future to buy the B and I Line. Irish Shipping Limited have done exceptionally well since their establishment during the troubled years of the war.  A country has to be independent in the matter of shipping, particularly in times of war.  Let us hope we never have these times again.  Their ships have all been paying and bringing extra currency into the country.  They have been flying the Irish flag all over the world.  The B and I Line provided a regular service between Ireland and England.  We had no control over it. The money was going over to England. Practically none of the ships were registered in Ireland.  Now we will have control over it, and quite an amount can be achieved.  We will be able to help the tourist industry by providing a car ferry service.  During the tourist season there is often a long wait for sailing tickets.  We hope that that can be got over with better organisation. This shipping line has also been carrying our main agricultural exports, cattle, and, in fact, most of the produce of our industry in agriculture as well as quite a number of tourists coming in.  A lot can be achieved by having it run as we would like ourselves.  I remember how hard it often was to get an extra boat for the cattle market in Dublin.  We will be able, possibly, to encourage particular markets by providing a boat for either agricultural or industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Since we took office in 1957 every year we have given social welfare increases.  I sincerely hope that this <Col N="466" /> trend will be continued in the coming year.  Our record in this matter has been particularly good.  No Government have been able to give anything like the social welfare increases we have given.  That could not be done unless the economy was sound.  The Government can give out only the money they are able to take in.  We would like to give a lot more, but you have to be careful to give only what the economy can bear.</P>
    <P>One of the great indicators of a country's progress is the building industry.  Unfortunately, it was stopped for a while last year.  If the building industry is going well, the country is going well.  You have only to look at the Dublin skyline today and at the number of new houses in the suburbs and throughout the country to know that the economy is sound.  All these are the results of good economy.  There is confidence in the future of Ireland. A person will not build a house unless he is sure that he will remain in the country</P>
    <P>Eight years ago when factories were closing down or laying off men, people had to go away.  Now they are confident of the future.  They are building houses.  Development in one sphere promotes development in other spheres.  If industry and farming are expanding, the building industry prospers. Building operatives are returning from work in England to employment here.</P>
    <P>From the Naas Road, one can see across the skyline of Dublin the new factories and new office blocks.  These developments would not take place unless it was realised that there was a future in Ireland.  Of course, good planning is essential for the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>The grants and encouragements that are available have brought about an increase in private building.  The demand is so great that difficulty is experienced in obtaining contractors. Contractors have orders which they cannot reasonably expect to complete in the coming year.</P>
    <P>There are many pointers to future prosperity.  Foreigners are coming <Col N="467" /> in to start new industries.  They have the sales organisation.  They employ Irish people to the fullest possible extent.  Farming is prospering.  Milk can be sold.  The heifer scheme is successful.  Perhaps the clearest pointer to a growth in the economy is the rise in population last year, for the first time in over 100 years.  I am confident that if the Minister's Budget for this year continues the planning visualised in his Budget for last year, Ireland will be a better place in which to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The change in procedure introduced last year, whereby the Estimates are not presented at the time of the Vote on Account, makes it difficult to compare the figures of last year's Estimates with those for this year.  However, it will be possible to make that comparison at a later stage. It is notable that the present expenditure is substantially higher than last year.  I do not think anyone objects to the expenditure or expects expenditure, in present circumstances, ever to show a reduction.  What is important is to see whether or not the money spent is giving the best return in the way in which it is spent.</P>
      <P>The revenue figures as published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> show that from 1st April, 1964, to 30th January, 1965, £172,615,000, in round figures, was spent, compared with £147,388,000 for 1st April, 1963, to 1st February, 1964, an increase of over £25 million.  That is a considerable increase in expenditure on existing services and, in fact, the Minister in introducing the Vote adverted to the fact that one of the factors contributing to the high cost of the supply services generally is the rise in prices which has taken place during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sections of the community have been struck by the very substantial increase in prices in the past year. When this general question of expenditure was considered last year in the debate on the Budget we directed attention to the fact that the introduction of the turnover tax had contributed and would contribute in the period ahead to a substantial increase <Col N="468" /> in prices which would not only affect consumers but would also affect costs of production.</P>
    <P>At that time certain sections of the community had benefited or were in process of benefiting from the wage and salary adjustments of the ninth round but, there are in the community a great many who did not benefit from the ninth round increase&mdash;persons who are self-employed and people of that category, working on their own account, many small traders and shopkeepers and other sections who did not participate or who, because of their particular type of work, did not have any adjustment comparable with that which was paid to wage and salary earners.  In addition, pensioners of all sorts and persons living on fixed incomes received no increases, with the exception of the very paltry increase in respect of certain social welfare recipients given in the Budget.  All these categories in the community found that they were adversely affected by price increases.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in recent months there has been a more widespread appreciation of the effects on the economy of all these prices rises and that even those who benefited from, and came within the ambit of, the ninth round increase in wages and salaries have found that for them the immediate apparent benefits which flowed from that have been offset to a considerable extent by subsequent price rises.</P>
    <P>Without even looking at the consumer price index or the cost of living index figure, it is obvious that a whole range of goods and services increased substantially in price.  Not merely were goods affected by the turnover tax but, in the Budget last year, petrol, tobacco, beers and spirits&mdash;what were in the past regarded as the traditional sources of revenue&mdash;bore additional taxation.  That, coupled with the turnover tax, started off a very substantial increase in prices.  It is in that situation we must consider this Vote on Account and the announced increase in the Book of Estimates which was given over the week-end.  This would indicate that a considerable increase will occur this year.  I do not believe it is possible or reasonable to expect that the Estimates can be reduced or that certain items of <Col N="469" /> expenditure can be eliminated.  It would be quite unrealistic to imagine that there would ever be a worthwhile reduction in any item of expenditure or certainly in the overall amount of expenditure covered by the Supply Estimates.</P>
    <P>What is significant, however, is the fact that with comparatively few increases in benefits or assistance provided, the rate of increase in expenditure has been absorbed by rising prices and by rising costs.  It would be informative to get the actual percentage, which only the Central Statistics Office or the Minister for Finance would have available, of the increase in the cost of government due to rising prices as distinct from any item of increased expenditure under any particular head or any benefit which had been raised. It is difficult to assess how increases would amount to a sum of £25 million, without getting some details of the extent of rising costs and the effect these costs, as well as wage and salary adjustments consequent on the ninth round or possibly in some cases consequent on the eighth round, have had on the total Supply Estimates.</P>
    <P>We have consistently advocated the essential need to have a considered policy on incomes, that unless wage and salary earners have some prospect of an incomes policy based on a realistic approach to prices, it is impossible to expect any degree of stability.  As long as prices continue to rise, wage and salary demands will inevitably follow at intervals.  In this case a very considerable amount of the price rise which has occurred was stimulated or initiated by the Government decision to introduce the turnover tax.  If price rises are excessive and irregular, it is inevitable that wage and salary adjustments will be, in many cases, irregular and unrelated to production or to the ability of the economy to meet the rises.</P>
    <P>For some years here import prices had been relatively stable and the price rises which occurred were in many cases due to internal price inflation. A great variety of items were affected by price changes, food, clothes, bus fares and so on, and one of the serious results of the price rises last year has <Col N="470" /> been the substantial increase in costs which has affected not merely the central Government, as reflected in the Supply Services, but also the expenditure of local authorities.  They have had to meet, as have other groups in the community, the ninth round, but in addition they have had to meet increased charges for institutions under their care or responsibility.  This year, every local authority will have to face a substantial increase and many of them have already adopted rate rises. In the case of the Dublin County Council, the rate rise adopted last week amounted to just 4/- in the £.  All these will have to be borne by the people, in addition to the other charges which were imposed by the Budget and the other increases which have followed as a consequence of these price changes.</P>
    <P>As I said a few minutes ago, the sections in the community who were probably more seriously affected by the increases in the cost of living and price rises in general are the social welfare categories.  We must make a much more radical approach to the problems and needs of social welfare recipients in the future, if any shadow of justice and equitable treatment is to be afforded to them.  Despite the very substantial rise in the present Supply Estimates and the substantial increases due to different causes in the financial year which began with the 1964 Budget, the social welfare recipients received only £750,000.</P>
    <P>Outside the categories covered by that, including old age pensioners, widows and orphans and others coming within the social welfare code, there are a great many retired persons living on fixed incomes, some of them persons who through past exertions have accumulated savings or are in receipt of a small income from investments or who are eating into capital.  There are other categories, retired ex-Army, Garda personnel, teachers, former local authority employees, post office workers, and so on, many of whom receive increases only some years after they have retired.  I have argued here before that we should adopt the system in operation in some European countries, that pensioners should have <Col N="471" /> their pensions adjusted on a cost of living basis in the same way as serving personnel&mdash;whether they are civil servants, Army, Garda, teachers or the other categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The people who are at work at the moment, employed directly by the State, and particularly those outside State employment, benefit from wage and salary adjustments.  Although they are affected by the rise in the cost of living, in most cases the adjustment compensates for whatever rise occurs. In the case of pensioners, adjustments, whenever they are made, lag behind the rise in the cost of living and for a great number no adjustment whatever was made during the past 12 or 18 months when all these price rises occurred.</P>
    <P>I believe we should adopt the system which is, as I say, in operation in certain countries and which is bound in the future to become more widespread. It is based on a more equitable assessment of the needs and wants of pensioners of all categories.  I for one do not object to the increase in taxation if it is designed to benefit this most needy section of the community who are now at a stage when they are unable by their own exertions to help themselves or to increase their income in any way, and certainly very few of them are capable of providing any such increase.  Possibly in some cases a small number of pensioners can get some part-time employment, but they are the exception rather than the rule.  It is obvious that the extent to which such employment will become available for that category of person is not likely to be very great.</P>
    <P>The approach to the problem of prices and problems of an incomes policy involves the whole question of industrial relations.  I believe there is an important need in the approach to that problem.  The old attitude of wages and salaries is out of date.  When we were in Government, we introduced the system of conciliation and arbitration not merely for civil servants but for other categories of public servants such as Army, Garda and teachers. That method is bound to commend itself not only to the categories in the communities to which it applies but to <Col N="472" /> others outside those covered by the State or semi-State organisations.  If there is, as I think there has been&mdash; and it is emphasised in negotiations and discussions that are taking place between employers and representatives of the trade unions&mdash;a more enlightened approach to the general problem of industrial relations, it would provide a basis for a stable policy in relation to prices and incomes, and a stable policy for incomes generally could be initiated and developed.  In that way the benefits would flow not merely to the interests concerned but to the general good of the community.</P>
    <P>Our industrial relations machinery has been in operation since the war and many changes have occurred elsewhere, changes based on different approaches and on the need for a different attitude from that which existed in the past. In this country, in the main, our industrial relations machinery is similar to that which is in operation in Britain, although in other countries, such as Norway and Sweden, an approach is based on the assessment of the situation from the point of view not only of the parties directly concerned but the wider interests of the community. Some system on a tripartite basis, including representatives of employers, workers' organisations and the State has succeeded in founding a machinery which has secured not merely in the main industrial harmony but also a satisfactory solution for many of the problems which existed prior to the introduction of the system.</P>
    <P>In this Vote on Account I notice there is some increase in the sum provided for education.  I have consistently stressed that heavy capital investment in education is necessary and that the demands here are growing almost daily.  Not merely do these demands involve greater capital investment in the form of buildings and equipment but also in the provision of trained personnel at all levels in the educational system, whether primary secondary, vocational or university. One of the greatest successes so far as the system here is concerned has been the growth of vocational education schools and I was interested to note in a statement made recently that it is <Col N="473" /> proposed to provide increased opportunities for technological developments here.  It is inevitable in the future that higher standards of training will mean better jobs and higher standards of workmanship than have obtained up to the present.</P>
    <P>In connection with the general problem of education, I should like to urge that the position in the fringe area of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire will, so far as schools are concerned, require a different approach from that adopted for financing schools in the past.  So far as I understand it, the same method of financing applies uniformly to the whole country.  While in many cases that may be reasonably satisfactory, the growth of population in the fringe area of Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire, is so great that schools are bursting at the seams and the problem for managers, religious orders and for parents, not to mention teachers, is so great that in many cases the people concerned are at their wit's end in order to provide the necessary accommodation.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to evolve a different method of financing the building programme in cases where there has been a substantial rise in the population, due to whatever fortuitous circumstances exist, but it is obvious that the increase in the population in the fringe area of Dublin as well as Dún Laoghaire, and possibly other cities and towns in the country, is peculiar to a few places.  In many parts of the west and in other parts of the country, the trend is different. There is a drop rather than an increase and different conditions entirely exist and probably present different problems. In any event, so far as the Dublin areas are concerned, that is, including the city, county and Dún Laoghaire, a different approach altogether is needed.</P>
    <P>The other item of expenditure, to which I wish to refer, is the question of local authority housing.  Some reference has been made here to the demands for grants for private house building.  I have here the figures for the number of houses built for the 10 years from 1954 to 1963 by local authorities.  There has been a very <Col N="474" /> remarkable drop during those years. The figures are: 1954, 5,643; 1955, 5,267; 1956, 4,011; 1957, 4,784; 1958, 3,467; 1959, 1,812; 1960, 2,414; 1961, 1,463; 1962, 1,238; and 1963, 1,828. That indicates the substantial change in the approach to housing by the Government from 1957.  Certainly, so far as Dublin county council and Dún Laoghaire borough are concerned the demand for houses at present is as acute as it ever was and the availability of land for building by the local authorities in areas adjacent to existing schemes in becoming much more scarce.  I believe a far more radical approach is warranted so far as local authority housing in the Dublin area is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is true, if you examine the capital programme for the period 1959 to 1964/65, that the amount of money granted for housing shows an increase. Some of that is absorbed by houses built under SDA loans schemes and by houses built with other State grants. There has been a very substantial decline in the number of local authority houses built in the past ten years, so much so that, as I say, there is now a very extensive waiting list so far as Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire are concerned.  The present position warrants an entirely different approach if the problem is to be dealt with on a realistic basis, taking into consideration the needs and the demands of the very large list of applicants, at times swollen by persons who have come on the list because of the demolition of houses and because of the decline in the safety or the living capacity of many of the existing houses.  The housing situation in Dublin generally is very serious and I believe that a much more radical approach is necessary.</P>
    <P>The other matter, which I should like to refer to, is the question of our trade arrangements.  I have advocated for many years, the need to review existing trade agreements.  Some time ago the Taoiseach announced it was proposed to review these agreements. Discussions were initiated, following the imposition of the British surcharge on exports, on the British Trade Agreement. I believe the House and the <Col N="475" /> country would be interested to hear from the Minister what progress has been made in regard to reviewing that arrangement as well as the other trade agreements, many of which have now been for many years in operation and which were negotiated in entirely different circumstances.</P>
    <P>In that connection, has there been any development on the GATT negotiations? As I understood it, this country revitalised the application to join GATT after the failure of the EEC negotiations.  The GATT application had been postponed pending a decision on the EEC application.  When the EEC application was suspended, following the French attitude, it was decided to reopen our application to join GATT.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, what developments have been taking place in that regard?</P>
    <P>Finally, reference was made in the course of this debate to the tourist industry.  One of the developments in that regard, so far as my constituency is concerned, is the decision to provide a car ferry service to Dún Laoghaire. That decision was generally welcomed from the point of view of providing a much needed service as well as the prospects of employment on the ferry at Dún Laoghaire harbour and the consequent development which would flow to the area as well as to the country generally.  Some concern has been expressed about the location of the ferry and I should be glad if the Minister would ensure that arrangements are made to avoid any interference with the amenities generally of the harbour in locating the ferry so that the existing amenities, which are of considerable attraction there, will not be seriously interfered with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate here, one could be pardoned for thinking that it was a different matter which the people on each side were debating. We have been, from this side, severely critical of the way the Government propose to spend, and have been spending, the money.  At the same time, we pointed out&mdash;and I want to repeat it&mdash;that we never have and never will <Col N="476" /> object to necessary expenditure.  On the other side we have people like Deputy Crinion who could see the fields getting greener under Fianna Fáil.  He really said that all we had to do was wait until the grass grew long enough and everything in the garden would be green.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, and the westerners who come there say they are.  The proposed increase is a substantial one.  If the Government are really serious about running the country properly and making provision for the governing of the country, then they should be able to justify how this money is being spent.  A Minister, followed by a number of backbenchers, tells us that unemployment is lower this year than it was last year.  We ask what the figures are and we are told there were 52 fewer unemployed this year than last year.  We find that there were 61,000 employed last Saturday and 61,052 last Saturday 12 months. That makes the comment that unemployment is lower seem very hollow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Donegan said, that the percentage unemployed is 6.6. We heard about the terrible state in which the British economy was over the past 12 months and there have been various views about whether it has been improving under the present Government, but the percentage in Britain is 1.5.  If things are bad in Britain with only 1.5 per cent.  unemployed, we certainly cannot boast of our figure 6.6.  We had at least two Deputies and a Minister claiming that emigration was reducing, despite the fact that they must know, because they have the figures as well, that in 1963 the number of people who left by land, sea and air was given as 21,840, while in 1964, the figure was 26,800, an increase of almost 5,000 more emigrating than in the previous year. I cannot understand why misstatements such as this should be made by Ministers and Fianna Fáil Deputies, or why the truth cannot be told, because it is quite easy to disprove a lie with the facts and figures available.  It is quite plain that anybody who says the <Col N="477" /> number of people emigrating is less now than it was 12 months ago is not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the question of whether or not there has been an increase in the numbers in employment.  It has been claimed from the Government benches that more people are employed now than there were over the years and particularly when the last inter-Party Government were in office.  I do not hold any brief for the last inter-Party Government or any inter-Party Government, but from the figures we have been getting, there are 16,000 fewer in employment than there were in 1958.  These are figures which can be checked by the Government or anybody inside or outside the House and if they are incorrect, they can be refuted.</P>
    <P>We had the famous case a couple of years ago when the figure for emigration was given as 12,500 and it was accepted by everybody until at a seminar in Wicklow the Minister for Health became rather angry when it was pointed out that if the figure of 12,500 for the previous year was correct, the figure of 25,000 for that year showed a very big increase.  Then the wheels started to move and the Taoiseach made an announcement to the effect that a mistake had been made and that the figure was 25,000.  That was one case where an incorrect figure had been allowed remain on the books for a long time.  The figures I have quoted have been on the books for quite a long time and if they were incorrect, I am quite sure they would have been corrected.  Therefore we must assume that the people who said the figures were other than what I said were not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>I know there is a by-election in the offing and that a general election may be in the offing, but surely no matter what sort of election is taking place, the truth should be told to show whether things are going right or wrong.  We also have the question of whether or not the flight from the land is continuing.  We know that the Government in their <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> have forecast that approximately 70,000 people will leave the land up to 1970. <Col N="478" /> They made a fairly good forecast because it appears that from June, 1963, to June, 1964, 10,600 people left the land.  They sought work elsewhere. They must not have gone into the industries about which we heard so much because if they had, there would be not a reduction but an increase in the number of people employed.  If we have people leaving the land and if people are not being employed in industry, they must be emigrating.  That should be easy enough for anybody to see.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which will have to be tackled either by this Government or some other Government in the near future is the question of redundancy.  At present there is no provision whatever for retraining. Despite numerous CIO reports, the Government have sat idly by and let the position continue as it has been. Does the Minister or the Government know that very many of the people who have left the land are over 50 years of age and are finding it extremely difficult to get employment elsewhere?  Ultimately they must find their way to the labour exchange and, after a while on the exchange, on to sickness benefit until they reach the age of 70.  The Government should face up to the fact that some provision will have to be made in a big way for retraining and a start will have to be made in this regard in agriculture.  Not alone are farm workers leaving because they, as Deputy Donegan rightly pointed out, will no longer agree to work for the minimum wage, but people who are owners or part owners of small farms are leaving.  Apparently the Government do not care.  As long as it does not happen at their own door, then it does not matter.  I was amazed to hear one Deputy speaking about the natural increase in the population.  Of course that is not correct, either.  A very interesting booklet called the <i>OECD Observer</i> has been in circulation for a number of years and some Deputies may remember that before the Christmas Recess, I asked the Minister for External Affairs why Ireland was never listed in the various statistics given in it.  At first he said that Ireland was listed <Col N="479" /> and then he pointed to a printed propaganda blurb which had been supplied by the Government and said that it was a reference to Ireland.  Eventually, he had to admit there was no reference at all to Ireland, at least in the statistics section.  I am very glad to see that in the December issue it is included and that statistics are given showing the situation in Ireland as compared with the other countries in the OECD.</P>
    <P>It makes very interesting reading and we can see why the Government were not too anxious to have statistics about this country included.  It showed that in most cases we were away behind; even our much-vaunted 4 per cent growth in national productivity was very little compared with that shown by other countries, some of them very much less developed than Ireland is supposed to be.  Where housing is concerned, we are the lowest country.  We show only half as much as Belgium, which is next to us. It is a good thing, and I do not decry the efforts being made here, that we should be able to see plainly how we compare with other countries and where we stand so that we will not get a false impression of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the efforts&mdash;perhaps I took this up wrongly &mdash;being made to educate our young people so that they will be able to work in the factories foreigners are starting here.  I do not care who starts factories as long as they give employment, but I should like to point out, with regard to education, that this country has not got a very good record. The amount of money being spent on education is very much lower than it should be, much lower than in any of the enlightened countries.  In fact, local authorities are tied in the amount of scholarships they can give to the amount of money made available for secondary school scholarships, and, therefore, only a very small proportion of those who win secondary school scholarships can win university scholarships if they qualify for such scholarships at a later date.  The Government will have to tackle this question <Col N="480" /> of education seriously and overhaul the system right through.  It is no use saying so many national schools are being renewed, so many thousands spent here and so many thousands spent there.  The problem must be tackled as a whole.  The only way in which this country can be a success is by educating its youth so that they can ultimately take their proper place in trade and commerce.</P>
    <P>We have then the farcical situation in which the health of our people is very gravely affected not by the action of the Minister but by the inaction of the Minister.  A Special Committee was set up by this House to review the operations of the Health Act.  There was a guarantee given that the review would be completed within six months. Subsequently that was extended to nine months, and later still to 12 months.  The Committee has not met since last May.  When one of the Labour Deputies asked the Minister why the Health Committee was not meeting, the Minister jeered at him and said the Health Committee had nothing to do with him, that he did not call the Committee and that he had not set it up.  There are some things about which the Government brag, things about which they ought not to brag.  I should like to know what the Government propose to do about the health services because, if we do not know we will not be able to agree that the money in the Book of Estimates should be voted.  It would be very like buying a pig in a poke.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to tourism.  Everybody admits tourism has been growing.  One thing I cannot accept is the attitude of the people who try to make out that the unfortunate emigrants, who had to go out of this country in order to earn a living, are tourists when they return home to visit their wives, their families, their fathers or their mothers.  Why cannot tourists proper be distinguished in our statistics from emigrants returning for a few weeks holiday?  Why must the tourist bodies try to claim credit for bringing to the country people who would have come anyway if there were never a Tourist Board in existence?  I know they are doing <Col N="481" /> their best, but they do themselves no service when they try to claim credit for bringing people in who would have come in anyway.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fishing industry.  Excellent efforts have been made to attract people for coarse fishing. I claim that quite a number of the people who come here, who are designated as tourists by the Tourist Board, are in fact nothing but our own kith and kin coming home on holidays.  Other countries distinguish between foreigners and their own nationals.  Their nationals, when they return home, are not designated as tourists.  We would get a much better idea of the numbers who are real tourists if there were some distinction. If our tourist personnel bent their energies to attracting real tourists, they would do a much better job than they are doing now when they claim as tourists people who are in no sense of the word tourists.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to agricultural grants.  A good deal of money has been expended on agriculture and different types of very useful grants have been given.  I believe the agricultural industry must be supported. I claim, however, that the grant system is something that should be reviewed because I believe grants are taken advantage of by people who do not need them and the people who really need them find, for one reason or another, that they have not the necessary money to put up to qualify for the grants.</P>
    <P>With regard to the heifer subsidy scheme, I was surprised to hear Deputy Crinion, who is a farmer, say that the subsidy will keep growing.  As any schoolboy could tell the Minister, and as he must know himself, what happened last year cannot happen again for quite a number of years.  People went into the scheme for one year only and picked up the subsidy.  The result was that expenditure jumped from £500,000 to almost £3 million.  The first estimate was £500,000 roughly. As the Minister knows, but apparently Deputy Crinion does not, it is only on the extra cows the subsidy can be granted.  Farmers increased their herds last year but they cannot increase them <Col N="482" /> again this year because the land will not carry any more.  One of two things will happen.  The heifers on which the subsidy has been collected will be sold as butchers' meat so that in a couple of years time, farmers can again qualify for subsidy, or they will remain as they are, in which case no further subsidy can be collected, no further grant will be payable, and no further increase in the herd can be effected. These are facts, and facts should be stated plainly.  Deputy Crinion said the subsidy was a great start.  He could also have said there was a great finish to it because it was a one-year effort. That, I am afraid, is as far as it goes.</P>
    <P>People do not seem to like to admit that there is such a thing as nationalisation in this country.  In actual fact, many of our most progressive and most successful industries are nationalised. We are proud of the efforts being made to make them a success.  With regard to the B and I take-over, we would all like to know whether or not we are taking over something which is just another &ldquo;hot&rdquo; one, in which a subsidy will be needed for a while before it can become a paying concern.  There is, at least, one advantage.  We need no longer listen in this House to talk about the truly shocking conditions in which people have to travel on this route because, if there is anything wrong, the State will be responsible. Deputy Crinion referred to our main export as livestock: I say &ldquo;people&rdquo;. If we provide decent travelling conditions for them, I say we will be doing a darned good job.  I am glad that the decision has been taken, and the full support of the Labour Party will be given to the Minister in his action.</P>
    <P>I have heard speakers from both sides of the House, and I have also heard the Minister for Transport and Power on a number of occasions, referring in glowing terms to the necessity for an incomes policy in this country.  After they have expanded it a bit it usually finishes up that they are talking not about an incomes policy but about a wages policy.  I want to make one thing very clear.  The Labour Party and the trade union movement <Col N="483" /> are fully behind the Government or any Government that will introduce an incomes policy, but we will not allow, if we can prevent it in any way, a wages policy without any other effort being made to tie incomes. The question of having a wages or salary standstill under another guise will not work again.  It worked on one or two occasions but I can assure the Minister that it will not work again.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that we are not prepared to honour any national agreement made between workers and employers.  We here welcomed the agreement made which resulted in the ninth round of wage increases.  I was proud to be one of the negotiating team on the workers' side but, as was pointed out here tonight, there is an escape clause, and that escape clause may have to be put into operation unless the Government face up to their responsibility and make an effort to tie prices.  I do not know why the Government cannot see it, but everybody outside the Government and their immediate supporters knows that prices are getting out of hand.  They are going up in waves.  Immediately the ninth round wage increase was put into operation&mdash;and I would agree with the suggestion made here earlier that the turnover tax had a very big impact not alone on the ninth round but, in fact, on its amount&mdash;we had the first wave of price increases.  Again and again there have been adjustments without very much justification.  I am amazed to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce stating both inside the House and outside it that he had various price increases investigated and could find no reason for refusing or objecting to the increases which have been put on.  Can the Minister or the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us how anybody could justify a 12 per cent increase in the cost of an article because of the fact that there was a 12 per cent increase in the wages of employees in that firm, because if we accept that we must agree that the entire outlay of the firm with regard to money is on wages?  I think the Minister would agree that that would be a <Col N="484" /> ridiculous suggestion.  Again and again prices have been increased by manufacturers particularly, and by others, and apparently the Government are perfectly satisfied that this situation should continue.</P>
    <P>In the country at present, particularly in the cities and bigger towns, we have the supermarket growing up and the small trader complaining that the supermarket is putting him out of business because of the fact that it is undercutting.  I am sure that the Minister is as well aware as I am that again and again we find those supermarkets selling goods at roughly two-thirds of the price which is charged in the local small shops.  The reason they can do that is because bulk buying from the wholesaler gives them the goods at very much lower prices than that at which the small shopkeeper gets them.  If there was not a lot of fat in the price that could not happen. The Minister for Industry and Commerce would be well advised to look at that aspect of the case, because he would be doing a good turn not alone to the ordinary people of the country but to the small trader for whom he has on numerous occasions expressed concern.</P>
    <P>We have heard of all the building going on and we are told that there is a boom in building.  Let me repeat something which cannot be repeated too often&mdash;we still have not got back to building the number of houses which were built in what the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government like to refer to as the black year of 1956.  We were building more houses then than we are building now.  I would suggest to Deputy Crinion, and I am not criticising him for it, that the buildings he saw on the skyline coming into the city were possibly the big office buildings which, while they give a good deal of employment, do not house people.  The big demand at the present time is for houses for people.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister for Local Government must bear a certain responsibility, because recently I discovered a neat little trick that, when local authorities submitted plans for new housing estates, be the number of <Col N="485" /> houses 10, 20, 50, 100 or 150, the Minister for Local Government or his officials, after holding the application for a number of weeks, asked how it fitted into the new plan which the local authority must introduce within three years.  Of course, they knew quite well, when sending out that query, that the local authority could not possibly say how the plan for the houses would fit into a plan which had not been drawn up or would not be drawn up for at least another 12 or 18 months. In other words, they are simply saying: &ldquo;We will put this in cold storage. Come back in another 12 or 18 months and we will have another look at it.&rdquo; That is very cold comfort to people who are trying to get houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister must do two things. First of all, he must clear up this question immediately.  Is all local authority housing to be held up until the planning that the local authorities must do is finalised?  Secondly, will he bring in the new Housing Bill which we have heard so much about?  Does he realise that certain grants which he announced almost two years ago in this House and which his Department is paying for almost two years have no legal sanction, and that local authorities have not been able to put the Bill into operation for supplementary grants because the Bill has not yet been introduced, not to talk about being passed in the House? Would the Minister consider doing something about it, because there is no use in saying &ldquo;We will introduce it in a couple of weeks time.&rdquo;  We have heard that so often that it is just an old phrase repeated again and again.</P>
    <P>One thing I would like to ask the Minister, who is the Minister responsible for it, concerns the Pensions Abatement Bill, 1964, the Second Stage of which has been ordered for some time.  Does the Minister not realise that because of the fact that it has not been passed&mdash;I understand it would be a non-contentious Bill in this House and in the Seanad&mdash;certain employees of the State, who had previous army service have, in fact, not received the benefit of the ninth round wage increase?  Does he realise that <Col N="486" /> the State are collecting their share, but because the Minister has not passed the Bill through, the unfortunate people who are affected by it have not got what they are justly entitled to?  We must all assume, of course, that there will be retrospective effect given to the enactment when it passes through, but surely people should not be kept waiting for something to which they are justly entitled.  Would the Minister, when he is replying, say when he hopes to bring the Bill into the House or will he explain what is the cause of the delay?</P>
    <P>There is just one thing I want to say finally in regard to housing.  This is something which, I think, cannot be repeated too often.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> to anyone who looks closely at it, shows clearly that the Government do not intend a big expansion in housing over the years ending in 1970 and that, in fact, there is not an increase but a reduction in the number of houses proposed in that programme.  Perhaps the Minister might explain how that tallies with the statements being made by Government speakers that there is to be continuous expansion in housing?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the impact on the rates of various increases. My local authority has the lowest rate in Ireland.  Nevertheless, the proposal there was to increase that rate by 4/6 in the £.  I am sure the Minister is aware that, because the State has been balancing its Budget at the expense of local authorities, the rates of Meath County Council and every other county council are very much higher than they should be.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the system by which the grants payable to local authorities are retained in the national Exchequer until the last minute.  Some of them are paid on a three-monthly or six-monthly basis, but by far the largest are retained until 31st March.  The retention of amounts as large as £250,000 in the national Exchequer to 31st March has caused overdrafts to be obtained by those local authorities, with a consequential increase in the rates of these local authorities. The Government should have a look at this question.  If they are seriously interested in keeping rates down, they should pay the grants as <Col N="487" /> they become due and allow local authorities to strike a far lower rate than they have to strike at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote on Account gives an opportunity of reviewing the progress of the previous year.  I could find no more eloquent words than those used by the Opposition this afternoon, particularly Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Corish and Deputy Tully.  It is pleasant for any Government to hear the Opposition admit that progress is being made, and substantial progress at that. Having said that, one expects them to find fault and point out sections not making the same progress.</P>
      <P>The best barometer of an increase in the standard of living and prosperity is housing.  Some speakers, particularly Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Tully, spoke at some length on this subject.  It is a far cry from 1956, 1957, 1958 and 1959 when there were houses vacant in Dublin and throughout the country. That position has completely changed. We now hear the cry that more needs to be done.  One thing that has never been corrected since then is the loss of our skilled building workers who emigrated at that time and never returned. Consequently. our rate of building today is retarded, not because of any Government policy or inactivity by local authorities but simply because the workers are not there.  This is proved by the recent action of the Minister for Local Government, who, to speed up the provision of houses, has introduced a new method of construction on the Albert College Estate. Something like 3,000 houses are being constructed there by a new method by a consortium of contractors who are bringing in new ideas from abroad. The cost of even these houses will be somewhere in the region of £10 million. When I hear the Opposition say that more was done in 1956 than today.  I say if this is true, the workers are not there to do it and they will not come back.</P>

I am a simple man but I cannot add that one up.&rdquo; The simple truth is that, as Deputy Cosgrave said, there is a natural increase in the demand for houses, and the increase in the standard of living is self-evident.</P>

      <P>The bill for 1965/66 is in the region of £221 million.  It is a sizeable bill for a progressive economy.  On the other side, we see revenue running fairly well.  My best guess is that it will be close to £194 million or £195 million this year.  There are sections inside and outside this House clamouring for more and more expenditure. There are those who denigrate the progress being made rather than encourage the productivity vitally necessary if we are to increase our standard of living as well as increasing social welfare payments, housing grants, health grants and so on.  Under every heading, it is necessary to achieve more and more productivity to accomplish these aims.  It is also necessary that the economy be built up and our productive force increased each year, so that the productive element in our economy can add their effort towards providing the money if we are to look after the social welfare classes and others.  Are they doing this?  The Government are endeavouring to encourage farmers, industrialists and workers to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by Fine Gael that there is no improvement and that it is waste of time trying.  We are told by Labour, even threatened by Labour, <Col N="489" /> that &ldquo;if you want us to do more, we want more&rdquo;.  This is not tackling the national problem in any sensible way. There is no doubt that conditions of employment in this country have changed considerably for the better over the past few years.  It is not in dispute.  Indeed, the Labour Members in this House freely admit it.  To come in here and constantly harangue the Minister that he must be careful of this, that and the other is not helpful or encouraging.</P>
    <P>All the speakers to this debate have referred to increases in prices.  Of course, there are increases in prices. The causes are many.  Not all of the causes are as the Opposition put them. Imported raw materials have increased considerably in price.  Very little allowance is made for that fact.  It must be borne in mind that the cost of all manufactured goods has increased abroad as well as here as a comparison of the prices obtaining in various countries will show.</P>
    <P>It was regrettable, and peculiar, that Deputy Sweetman should blame Fianna Fáil for encouraging workers and civil servants to look for an increase in their emoluments, an increase in their hourly rates and an improvement in their working conditions.  For so long as I have been here in the Fianna Fáil benches I have always supported the ideal of better conditions for workers at any level, whether it is a white collar worker or a man carrying a pick.  It is unfortunate that a Party in this House should speak in those terms.  The worker in this country has served his country very well and deserves well of the national Parliament and I will never deny him his fair share of the national loaf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The turnover tax has been attacked as one of the factors contributing to increased prices. Judging by the figures I have heard this evening, a two and a half per cent increase could not possibly affect the position.  I would imagine that a comparison of the figures for the year before the turnover tax was introduced and those for the present year would show that competition has increased <Col N="490" /> and profitability on certain goods has been reduced at the retail level.</P>
      <P>The point that Deputy Tully made must be borne in mind.  Deputy Tully said that there were supermarkets in this country who could afford to sell goods at two-thirds the price charged by the small corner shop.  His Leader comes in here and harasses the Minister for Industry and Commerce to control prices.  I must ask Deputies to indicate to me into whose pocket the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be putting profits if there is already a differential in price as between the supermarket and the small shop.  It can be taken that the small shopkeeper would not get the profits.  If there is such a differential, how can one ensure that the small shopkeeper will be able to sell at a reasonable price?</P>
      <P>There is no better means of fixing prices than competition.  Once control of prices is introduced, a profit must be fixed for the least, not the greatest. You cannot say that you will give a 10 per cent margin to the supermarket and shut down every small shop in the country.  That is what would happen. If the Labour Party want that type of thing, I do not think we will be able to accommodate them.  The small shopkeeper renders a real service to the community.  Price fixing is not necessary in our economy at the present time.  It is done in socialist countries where the profit motive does not exist, where they have a controlled economy and have not the advantages of the capitalist system such as we in the west enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of the Vote on Account covers many headings.  In some sectors of the economy, progress is being made.  In the entire agricultural sector considerable progress has been made. As the Minister stated, there has been something like a 16 per cent increase in farmers' prices.  I welcome this for the farmer.  He has been the backbone of this nation down through the years, our major producer, the major contributor to the economy and national wellbeing.  It is gratifying to learn that he is getting a price.  It is regrettable that the price the farmer is now getting for beef should be reflected <Col N="491" /> to some degree in a higher price to the consumer but I cannot see that there is anything that can be done about the retail price.  The high price does represent encouragement for the farmer to increase production.</P>
    <P>The increase in cattle prices, milk prices and general farm prices has greatly increased output on the farm. The volume of output may not have increased as much as we would like but certainly those employed on the land are producing more.  Increased production is achieved while the number of workers on the land declines.  I am not going to say that that reduction in the number employed on the land can be prevented or slowed down.  Increased production in agriculture, if it is to be economic, must be obtained by increased mechanisation.  Modern workers will not tolerate the conditions that obtained 30 to 40 years ago. Mechanisation naturally involves a reduction in the number of workers. That must be dealt with by another sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous increase in the past two years in the amount of aid given to farmers and to agriculture.  That is the real reason why farming is a profitable industry today.  With a well-managed farm, and intelligent planning, a farmer can have a happy and profitable life comparable with that obtainable in the city or town, always provided that he has a reasonable holding.</P>
    <P>Government policy has been directed to an examination of the problem of what is a reasonable holding and, for the present at any rate, a figure of 45 acres has been arrived at.  All this year we listened to attacks on the Land Bill which would empower the Land Commission to speed up the provision of economic holdings.  That Bill has not yet been enacted but I am hoping that it will be law before very long.  The steps taken by the Government indicate that they are aware of the national problem and are doing something about it.  The Government are beginning to get the co-operation <Col N="492" /> that any Government must get if they are to make the necessary progress.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce, which is charged with the responsibility of providing employment, are doing a very good job.  I think it was Deputy McQuillan who suggested the creation of development centres similar to the centre at Shannon.  I fully agree with the idea of creating development and industrial centres. They are necessary.  However, the method by which Deputy McQuillan would think of doing it and the way we in this Party would think of doing it are poles apart.  It is generally accepted that those industries that could be established with markets for their products in this country have been established and that, apart from expansion in some lines, increased productivity must find outlets in the export market.  If it is thought we can recruit the necessary skill, obtain the markets and start manufacturing these goods in selected areas overnight under State management, it is easier to dream about it than to put it into effect.  It is only those who have been involved in industrialisation for years who can clearly indicate the problems and unseen obstacles that can crop up from day to day.</P>
    <P>Careful thought is needed in regard to this problem.  I would be the first to encourage such an idea for my own constituency.  As far back as 1932, the Taoiseach thought along those lines and if it were possible, it would have been done.  Industrialisation is still a job that must be handled by experts. If you would have it otherwise, you must be prepared to pay the price, that is, years of frustration, years of trial and error, after which you may achieve something.  However, to make fast progress in industry, the experts must be brought in from the word go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish sought to decry, by comparison, our efforts in regard to the gross national product.  He said our achievement of 4.5 for 1964 was not very great compared with that of Belgium, Germany, Holland, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Geographically, as regards population and size in square miles <Col N="493" /> there might be some comparison between this country and Belgium, but in the field of industry, there is no comparison.  In Ireland, we still have something like 34 per cent engaged in agriculture whereas in Belgium it is something like 5 per cent.  If it is thought we are doing badly at 4.5, let us turn to the United Kingdom which achieved 4.3 last year.  The number of people employed in agriculture in England is 4 per cent so that there is no comparison between the two.  We are still an agricultural country without having at our disposal the required skill; we are in fact achieving 4.5 while we are learning our job.  There is a figure of 19.5 for Japan but are our social conditions better or worse than those in Japan? In this country real progress is being made.  We are not claiming we are the foremost country in the world or in Europe.  The Government have made real progress during the past year and since we came into office in 1957, and I believe they will continue to make progress with the support of the majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I feel a glowing pride in the efforts made by this country.  I travel up and down the country and I see the fields of Ireland greener, although Deputy Tully may not see them greener.  I fully endorse Deputy Crinion's statement that more and more fertiliser is being used.  There is no point in expecting increased productivity without fertilisation and this increased use of fertiliser is evident all over the country.</P>
    <P>When the Socialist Government came into power in Britain recently, they imposed unilaterally and without consultation with any other country, a surcharge of 15 per cent on all imports. This was a breach of our 1938 and 1948 Trade Agreements.  It is this sort of thing that tends to create doubts and misgivings in the minds of producers for export, and especially those in the manufactured goods line.  However, I am pleased that those engaged in that industry here reacted correctly.  Far from losing heart or becoming despondent, they reacted in a positive way, and I am glad to say that the Government also reacted in a positive way. <Col N="494" /> No serious damage has been done and our exports continue to go out month by month in ever-increasing volume.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made that there is a degree of profiteering in the building industry, a very vital industry. Examining this industry from every possible angle, I find it hard to get real evidence of this.  One must consider the price of land.  Even the Dublin Corporation recently paid something like £1,400 a statute acre for land in or near Dublin, and that is not all; other lands went as high as £3,000.  One must remember that local authorities restrict and control by way of planning the number of houses that can be built per acre.  Generally throughout the country it is limited to about six houses per acre.  Taking the small amount the private builder will have to pay for a loan of about £3,000, it will cost something like £500 for the site alone.  I also keep an eye on local authority houses and the prices paid.  While the normal tender price for a local authority house has been for some time £2,500, without any reference to site development, purchasing of land, architect's fees and all the other costs involved, it is hard to find any real substance until steps are taken to control the price of land.  This, to my mind, is something which should be examined.  It would probably be a better idea to examine this problem than to adopt the suggestion put forward by Deputy Corish that there should be a capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>This has been employed in the United States for a number of years and we know that the present socialist Government in England are considering it in the present Budget.  A capital gains tax for a country like Ireland would not be very rewarding except in one or two cases.  I doubt very much whether hereditary owners of land would be called upon for this capital gains tax.  It would not apply to them and the only person involved would be the speculator.  I do not think there are many of them here or that they make millions.  Deputy Corish said an expert told him it would produce a million.  I have doubts about that and I know a bit about that side of the business.  However, if it can produce a million, go ahead and examine it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> Deputy Tully took Deputy Crinion to task for saying that the heifer subsidy was a success for one year.  I think Deputy Tully need not have got so excited about it.  He knows what the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> says and he knows what the Government hope to achieve in that field.  Any normal thinking person realises that a farm of land can sustain only so many livestock.  When that figure is reached, there is an end to what can be done.  The heifer subsidy will, I am confident, achieve the increase that is aimed at in the Brown Book on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> as envisaged by the Government.  If it does that, surely it will have done the job it was put there to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully goes on to say that the health services should be improved. The bill for the health services is a sizeable one, and I and my colleagues on this side of the House want to improve the health services.  What Government does not?  We are doing this as fast as the economy will permit, having regard to the priorities that exist for national development along other lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully goes on to criticise to a large extent the taking off of statistics in so far as tourism is concerned. If they are taken off in the same manner year after year, the comparison we are looking for will show up.  Whether our tourists are emigrants, the children of Irish people, their grandchildren, great-grandchildren, friends or wives is not so important. What is important is that we will provide the facilities so that even our Irish emigrants coming back can enjoy a better holiday in this country than was possible when they left, and can enjoy and be provided with better facilities.</P>
    <P>The whole idea is to provide facilities for those people coming in and to advertise and tell people abroad that those facilities exist in Ireland.  Anybody who denigrates or takes from this work is not doing a national service, although it may suit his own political purpose quite well.  I am always shocked when I hear public representatives <Col N="496" /> talking like this.  I would always recommend to them the policy of the musical &ldquo;Anything you can do, I can do better&rdquo;, but this idea of denigrating is not to my mind good from the national point of view, although it might suit party politics.  Tourism is one of the major industries and should be recognised as such and encouraged on every side of the House.  Apart from reviewing and watching and ensuring that there is no abuse of public money in this field, it should continue to get our support and the support of every section of the community.</P>
    <P>I heard a western Deputy decry the policy in relation to hotels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and say that these luxury hotels were a waste of time.  I would remind the Deputy who said that luxury hotels are a waste of time and that we should build factories instead that these hotels give employment to perhaps 200 people, whereas you might get a factory which would employ 150 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are providing employment and at the same time providing an outlet and basis for a solid industry.  All this is in the national interest and not one iota of it must be neglected.  I would point out to Deputy Coogan that they still make Rolls Royce and Ford 8 cars in England and they find their place in the British economy.  I think there is a need for both types of hotels.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House any more but I am pleased to have the opportunity to stand up and say my few words, that this Fianna Fáil Government have given the Irish people, encouragement and confidence to bring our economy to the fine healthy state in which it is today and may it long continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We really find ourselves in a period of political instability&mdash;very great instability.  The newspapers are writing up rumours of a general election.  The Government are denying a general election.  We have a minority Government in office, a Government, more important still, who have been rejected.  Their policy has been rejected; their cabinet has been rejected; its Taoiseach has been rejected by the people of Dublin in a by-election, by the people of Galway in a by-election and by the people of Roscommon in a by-election.  If it were not for the fact that an all-round 12 per cent increase in wages was promised 48 hours before the by-elections in Cork city and Kildare, the voters of Cork city and Kildare would also have rejected the Government and their policy.</P>
      <P>We now find that that minority Government are kept in office by the support of Deputies who were elected by voters who rejected Fianna Fáil. We find that the Government.  having been badly beaten in three by-elections, and a by-election for the first time in the history of this country where Fianna Fáil always had a majority in the home of Fianna Fáil in the county of Galway, are now holding on by the vote of those Deputies.</P>

      <P>We now find that this Government are facing a similar beating in a by-election in mid-Cork and, I have no hesitation in saying, being defeated in all by-elections that are to come.  Newspapers are writing up disturbing rumours and reports of a general election.  Whenever there are reports of a general election, it usually reflects on our markets, our industrial trends and the Stock Exchange.  It reflects on the business and commercial life of the country. Everybody with any intelligence knows while the Government are hanging on to office, they are losing the support, trust and confidence of the voters. Judging by their conduct and policy over the past 12 months, this Government want to hear about anything in the world except an election and they will stay in office until they are dragged out by the people.  Even though they were rejected in Dublin, Roscommon, and Galway and the same thing is coming in no uncertain manner from the people in mid-Cork, which will add to the embarrassment of the Government, they will hold on and they will stay until they are dragged out by the people because they know quite well that on their past 12 months' performance they could not hope to win a general election and that our people are now in the mood for a change of Government.  The people realise that there is a better Party, a better policy and better prospects for the future of this country. We have the Taoiseach and the members of the Government masquerading and parading throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and talking about co-operation with the north of Ireland.  We have seen in recent weeks what has been described as an historical occasion, the meeting of the Taoiseach and Captain O'Neill to discuss measures of greater co-operation between north and south.  It is very necessary.  We did not hear what was responsible or what was the cause of the sudden necessity for co-operation between north and south. <Col N="499" /> The facts are that the British Government have already told our Government and the Government of Northern Ireland that they are fed up subsidising the North and that Captain O'Neill and Mr. Lemass, our Taoiseach, will have to put their heads together because Britain was not going to continue subsidising the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to explain, if I may, how the Taoiseach is now ready to put unemployment, emigration, high taxation, the high cost of living, bad housing conditions and bad health services out of mind and instead to show himself as a man anxious to bring a greater measure of co-operation between north and south.  If he had done that or if Fianna Fáil had done that 40 years ago, this would be a different country for us to live in today.  He is now trying to derive a certain degree of popularity from the co-operation talks which are 40 years too late. Our people are not falling for that kind of insincere and political propaganda. No matter what any Fianna Fáil Deputy says, per head of the population, we must be one of the highest-taxed countries in the world. When we hear Deputies, like the last Deputy who spoke, refer to the fact that we have made progress in this country, surely a Government, who have been in office for 33 years, would be bound to hit the nail on the head and do something that would be of benefit to the community during those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I feel that Fianna Fáil Deputies speaking of improved conditions for workers do not seem to realise that conditions for workers have improved in Britain, Germany, France and Spain.  Have conditions for workers not improved in the USA?  Surely Fianna Fáil cannot take credit for the improved conditions for workers in these countries?  The conditions of workers all over the world have improved because we are living in modern <Col N="500" /> times.  If Fianna Fáil were never in office or never heard of, the conditions of the workers would improve.</P>
    <P>Next May or June, the British Congress of Trade Unions are to consider a motion whereby a decision will be taken as to whether there will be a half-day on a Friday in addition to the whole day off on Saturday.  Should they in Britain decide to have the halfday on Friday as well as the five-day week, that will, as surely as we are here, follow in this country, whether Fianna Fáil are in office or not.  If working conditions all over the world improve, they are bound to improve in this country.  When the five-day week came to Britain, it was not too long until the five-day week came to this country.  The improved conditions that prevail in most European countries in the world and in the United States are bound to be reflected here.</P>
    <P>Let us for one moment calmly examine the position in this country today.  The cost of living is almost as high as that of the United States.  It has been admitted in motoring journals that motoring costs here must be the highest in any country in the world&mdash; cost of cars, petrol, oil, tax and insurance.  As I have already said, in relation to our size and the number of our population, we must be one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world.  The cost of living has gone completely beyond the reach of the people. We have an unemployment problem which is very serious and the housing shortage has already been referred to.  One finds it hard to understand why in Dublin people have to live in disused barracks such as Griffith Barracks.  Their houses were falling down on them.  Two children were killed when a house fell on them and it took the Fire Brigade half a day to find them under the debris.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary that in order to create an impression of progress and prosperity skyscrapers are being built for offices and at the same time houses cannot be built for the people? They will tell us that the skyscrapers are providing employment.  Of course they are, and rightly so, and we welcome <Col N="501" /> that, but could not the same measure of employment be given in providing houses for the people so that people will not be killed by houses collapsing on them.  The housing situation is deplorable.  Everybody is aware of the situation in Dublin but every provincial town has the same problem.  There were 23 applicants for one vacant house in Portarlington. We speak of progress and prosperity but we cannot provide a single house for the people.  The people in this city have been driven like sheep before the shepherd into disused barracks.  That is the Government's housing progress, the result of their housing policy over 33 years of Fianna Fáil activities&mdash;a disused barracks for the homeless. There is no hope of houses being built for tens of thousands of people throughout rural Ireland.  Even rural cottages are not being built.</P>
    <P>There is a serious unemployment problem.  Fianna Fáil always quote figures for the registered unemployed but what about the thousands who are not registered?  In regard to the emigration problem, we find ample evidence that during the past year, as well as during the previous three years, people have left in thousands in search of work in Birmingham, London, Bristol, Hull, Manchester and elsewhere. No effort has been made to stem the tide of emigration or provide full time employment for the people.</P>
    <P>If I remember correctly, the undertaking given this day 33 years ago was to provide full employment and to stem the tide of emigration.  Here we are 33 years later and it has taken a generation to realise that the Fianna Fáil Party, their Leader, their programme and policy, are complete and utter frauds.  Not alone are they frauds because they have produced no results but now they find that they are afraid to face the people in an election because they know quite well what is going to happen when they do face the people in an election.  I should like to hear what the Fianna Fáil Party are going to tell the people in the next general election, whenever it comes, because they are going to have a difficult job convincing the housewife that the cost of living has gone down. <Col N="502" /> The price of essential foodstuffs such as bread and flour has been increased brutally.  This Party has always felt and still feels that no matter what the consequences, essential foodstuffs should not be subject to taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the social welfare services.  Our social welfare services must be very nearly the worst in the world.  Bearing in mind that we all admit that we have the worst health services in the world, we must be very near the worst as far as social welfare benefits are concerned.  I should not be surprised if in the next Budget there was an increase of 5/- a week for the old age pensioners, but such an increase would be of little value having regard to the present cost of living.  Nothing less than £1 per week would be any good to our old age pensioners.  We have in this country a vast amount of poverty, concealed poverty.  We have people possessed of the good Irish characteristic of self-respect who are too proud to admit they are in straitened circumstances, who do not want it to be known that they are on the verge of starvation.  If one wants evidence of that, one need only ask the members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the members of other charitable organisations and they will disclose quite astonishing information about the poverty that exists behind the smiling faces of both children and adults.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what Fianna Fáil have done over the past 12 months to alleviate the poverty that exists in our society.  We all remember the words of the late President Kennedy: &ldquo;A country that cannot provide for its poor cannot be expected to provide too long for its rich.&rdquo;  The one thing that has been very sadly neglected is provision for our sick, for the blind, for widows, for orphans, for the aged, for the people in receipt of home assistance.  These are the sections hardest hit by Fianna Fáil's mishandling and mismanagement of affairs.  They are the sections suffering most severely from the high cost of living.  Our social welfare benefits bear no relationship whatever to our <Col N="503" /> living costs.  I would not be thankful to the Government if they gave our old age pensioners £1 a week and no thanks at all for a paltry 5/-.  What provision is there for the disabled and the sick who are compelled to live on £2 per week with a supplementary allowance by way of home assistance? What provision do they propose to make for widows and orphans?  Many people are living on fixed incomes. There are many people who got no ninth round increase.  All these have to try to live and meet the Government increases in living costs.</P>
    <P>This side of the House has never objected to the Government finding money for the purposes I have mentioned. Quite the contrary, and we are satisfied that our health services and our social welfare service must be the worst in the world.  Deputy Tully referred to a Committee set up by this House to inquire into and report on our health services.  Is it not astonishing that that Committee has not met since last May?  Does everybody not know&mdash;who better than the Minister&mdash;that the present health services do not provide for our people's needs?  There are hundreds of our people who are denied health services, who cannot obtain the services they require.  There is no means by which their health can be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Finance making a speech here, when he was Minister for Health, when the Health Act was being piloted through this House; he said the Health Act might mean 2/- in the rates, and it might be a little more, but it was impossible to forecast accurately at the time what it might be.  I should like to know what the Government's policy is in regard to the financing of our health services.  Local authorities are now striking the rates.  They appreciate that it is the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  The last straw, they know, has been laid on the camel's back.  The ratepaying community are faced with the biggest demand for rates in local authority history.  One of the reasons why the rates are increasing is that we have in operation <Col N="504" /> unsound and unworkable health services.</P>
    <P>I remember the late Dr. O'Higgins, may the Lord have mercy on him, saying in this House that the Health Act was so bad it would never work and it could never be amended.  How true his words were.  Are the ratepayers today not faced with the biggest demand ever?  The policy of this Government has been to put their hands deep into the pockets of every taxpayer and, having done that, to dig their hands deep into the purse and shopping bag of the housewife and the family.  All the time they are imposing new taxation on our people.</P>
    <P>There was a time when new taxes were imposed once a year, on Budget Day, but we have reached the stage when practically every week in the Dáil is Budget week; we have some order, regulation or Bill being passed which imposes taxation on our people. Do all of us not know that cannot continue?  We are elected to Parliament as servants of the people and not their masters.  The Government, however, have taken the view that they are not elected as the servants of the people but as their masters.  That is why they are so anxious to run away from the people.  That is why they shiver every time they read newspaper articles about a general election.  They are afraid of it. We can see very clearly that our taxpayers and ratepayers have reached the peak of their capacity to pay.  That is why so many of the people with high rate demands are anxious to leave rural Ireland.  This is what we describe as the flight from the land&mdash;people leaving the country to go across the Irish Sea to Britain or across the Atlantic to America, or leaving the country to come up here to the city.</P>
    <P>In this Vote on Account, we are told what the Government have done and are doing for agriculture, but I have yet to meet a farmer who is satisfied with Government policy in relation to agriculture.  If our farmers are to meet the present rates of taxation, the present rates demand, the increased wages for agricultural workers and the increased valuations on their buildings and outoffices, it is not an increase of <Col N="505" /> five shillings per barrel they should be getting for wheat, oats and barley and five shillings a ton for beet.  What they want is at least ten shillings per barrel of an increase for all their cereal crops. Further, in order to assist them to meet the heavy rates demand, the ratepayers should be relieved of the burden of the health services which they have to meet in the rates.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Finance, who spoke about the high degree of prosperity the country is now enjoying, to show me where it is.  I travel around a fair amount and I cannot see it.</P>

      <P>Ask any of those people where is the wave of prosperity.  The markets and fairs have practically disappeared from our country towns.  I visited two towns in mid-Cork last weekend.  No doubt the Deputy opposite will have the pleasure of visiting the same towns in the next few weeks.  I was told that there was no business there.  There was gloom and depression hanging over those towns.  If we are to save our country towns and improve their prosperity, what plans have the Government to bring life back to the towns of rural Ireland?  High taxation, high living costs and high prices have been mainly responsible for depressing business in our country towns.  No matter what the Deputy for North Tipperary may say about a great wave of prosperity in North Tipperary, I am not envious that I do not represent that constituency.</P>
