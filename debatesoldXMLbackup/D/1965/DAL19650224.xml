      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health (a) the number of mentally handicapped children from Cavan who are on the waiting list to enter institutions; (b) the period those children are waiting; and (c) how long more they will be obliged to wait.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are nine mentally handicapped children from Cavan on the waiting list for admission to special institutions. Of these, five have been less than one year on the waiting list; two have been from one to two years on the waiting list; and two have been from two to three years on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say when these children will secure admission but works in progress will add 260 beds to the accommodation available for mentally handicapped children. Approval has been given for the provision of a further 240 beds and negotiations are proceeding which, it is anticipated, will result in the provision of an additional 200 beds or more.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the <Col N="1005" /> reference to the Shannon Development Zone is to the Industrial Estate situated in the Free Airport area.  The conditions applicable to the Industrial Estate arise out of the situation in which Shannon Airport is a Free Airport, which, for administrative reasons, must be of necessity limited in size.

      <P>When the reports to which the Deputy refers first appeared, an immediate approach was made to the United States authorities through the usual diplomatic channels.  It transpired that the proposal is not likely to be implemented.  I regret to say, however, that the message which the President of the United States sent to Congress regarding the United States balance of payments has recommended that legislation should be passed to reduce the duty exemption on foreign purchases by United States citizens returning from abroad.  While the exact scope of the proposal is not yet clear, it could reduce our earnings from American tourists, including those who visit the Duty Free Shop at Shannon Airport.  Representations have also been made to the US authorities on this proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the information sought by Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Farrelly is not readily available.  The Board do not maintain records of their consumers on a county basis or keep separate records of those paying special service charges and accordingly the extraction of the data necessary to provide a full answer would involve much time and trouble.  If the Deputies communicate direct with the Board, however, the Board will endeavour to provide as much information as possible.</P>

The lower fares on these services should be an inducement and a special survey of requirements is being made bearing in mind changes in the pattern of demand arising from such factors as the five-day week.

      <P>The Irish company is Erin Foods Ltd. and when that company was set up, it was established exclusively for the purpose of processing Irish foodstuffs and selling them on export markets.  At that time they were permitted to sell up to 10 per cent on the home market and that arrangement was quite acceptable to the Irish Sugar Company, which was the parent company.  The other companies are privately-owned companies established to a large extent with Irish money and using almost exclusively Irish-manufactured goods.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increased costs involved in the building and reconstruction of houses at the present time.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records, 104 new house grants and 341 reconstruction grants were paid in respect of completed works in Cavan in the calendar year 1964.  The figure of 1,350 houses stated by the Deputy to be urgently in need of reconstruction in County Cavan is less than half the total number of reconstruction grants allocated in the county over the sixyear period 1958-59 to 1963-64.  The number of reconstruction grants allocated in Cavan in the year 1963-64 was 451, and the average annual allocation in the county for the past six years was 460.  While I agree that both the rate of construction of new houses and reconstruction of existing houses could be stepped up in Cavan, the demand for all types of housing grants is at a record level generally.  These circumstances do not indicate that an increase in the grants is necessary.</P>

      <P>The site referred to comprises an area of almost 10 acres of a holding with a total area of 39 acres.  The owners objected to the acquisition of this land on the grounds that it was the best land on the farm, that its acquisition would result in the severence of a further area of 3½ acres of high quality agricultural land from the rest of the farm and would make the holding completely uneconomic and inadequate to support the persons who were dependent on the farm for their livelihood and support.</P>
      <P>At the public local inquiry held to consider the order, the objectors put forward detailed evidence in support of their objections and, having considered this evidence and the report of the inspector who held the inquiry, I decided that it would impose undue hardship on the objectors if the Compulsory Purchase Order were to be confirmed in respect of this site.</P>

The outline specification and detailed drawings were submitted in August, 1964, but contained insufficient information for proper evaluation.  Most of the additional information required by the Department was received on 1st January, 1965, and the local authority has been notified that, subject to subsoil conditions being satisfactory, contract documents may now be prepared. It will be seen, therefore, that there has been no undue delay in my Department in dealing with this proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position generally&mdash;in County Meath, as elsewhere &mdash;is that for shooting rights of some value over lands on hands of the Land Commission, tenders for letting are invited by way of advertisement either in the booklet published each year by my Department or, if late for inclusion therein, in the public Press.  Where an individual inquiry is received in relation to shooting rights which appear to be of little value, a seasonal letting may be made without advertisement. In such cases, however, the rights, if still undisposed of, are included in the booklet for the succeeding year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I am satisfied, having regard to the comparatively small numbers of persons who are serving prison sentences and to the limits within which the powers of temporary release can usefully be exercised, that the establishment <Col N="1023" /> of a parole board would cause needless overlapping of the existing machinery and would serve no practical purpose.  If the Deputy has in mind the re-establishment, under a parole board, of a system of release on licence such as obtained in this country up to about 20 years ago for penal servitude prisoners and Borstal inmates I would not agree with him.</P>
      <P>Remission in whole or in part of sentences imposed by the Courts is exercised by the Minister for Justice pursuant to the powers given to him under the provisions of section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, 1951.</P>
      <P>The grant of temporary release is also exercised by the Minister pursuant to the powers given to him by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 for the purposes of taking up employment, attending to urgent farm work, visiting sick relatives, attending at funerals of near relatives and matters of that kind and are, again, matters for my personal consideration based on the police and prison reports which may incorporate the views of the chaplains, medical officers and visiting committees.</P>
      <P>I experience no difficulty in dealing expeditiously with cases submitted to me.  I am satisfied that the prison administration including the Governors, chaplains, medical officers and visiting committees are exercising their functions in a conscientious, humane manner and I do not propose to make any change from the existing systems of permanent or temporary release.</P>

    <Title>Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Bill, 1965: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend, for a further period of three years, the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 which was to expire on 31st March, 1959 but which was renewed for two further periods of three years each.</P>
      <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by Order the exportation of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  Orders made under the Act have a life of 12 months and are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and if a resolution annulling any Order is passed by either House at any time during the currency of the Order, the Order is annulled accordingly. At present a number of goods are subject to export control under the Control of Exports Orders, 1964 which were made under the powers conferred under this Act.</P>
      <P>I consider that the time has not yet come when the export controls may be dispensed with.  Accordingly, it will be necessary to continue these powers for some further time, and to enact legislation to that end.  The need is threefold:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  to conserve, for the benefit of the home industry, raw materials continuing or likely to continue in <Col N="1025" /> short supply.  Examples of such commodities which are the subject of current orders are scrap metals, including iron, steel, aluminium, lead and zinc;</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to Communist countries or that this country is not used as a base through which such materials may be sent to Communist countries from other countries, and</P>
    <P>(c)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with the situation in the event of an international emergency developing in which the country could be drained of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned, I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the reasons given for the necessity for this Bill, some of them are clear to us as justifying the retantion of this power by the Minister.  However, I wish to ask one question in connection with the first reason the Minister gave to justify the power of controlling exports in respect of raw materials which would normally be associated with periods of scarcity.  What is the point of controlling exports of scrap metals?  Are not scrap metals international trade passing freely in every direction?  There is no world scarcity of scrap metal that I have heard of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture it came to my knowledge, I forget in regard to what detail of administration, that we were then prohibiting the export of timber in the round which I think very materially interferes with the economic operation of the national forests and for which I can see no justification at all, once the international scarcity of timber has disappeared.  There is not any scarcity of international timber at present and it would appear that the national forests should be allowed to obtain whatever market they can find to get rid of the output from the forests.  I should be glad if the Minister <Col N="1026" /> would say whether he considers that the world supply of scrap metal justifies this and, secondly, whether these powers are still being used to control the export of timber in the round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us whether there have been any exceptions in recent times?  The 1956 Act provides for exceptions to be made in respect of commodities over which the Minister may have control.  Without disclosing any confidential information, perhaps he could tell us in respect of what commodities exceptions have been granted in the past 12 months or two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point made is the best point on which I can mention the type of exceptions that have been made.  Contrary to what Deputy Dillon suggests, scrap metal is in comparatively short supply throughout the world.  In fact, I understand that most countries exert control on the export of scrap metal, the main purpose being to conserve whatever supplies there are within the country for the benefit of home fabrication of iron and steel manufacture.  In some cases it would be unfair to the people who procure scrap metal to prevent them from exporting it.  One exception was in the case of CIE when they had rails for export.  They were able to command on the export market a very high price compared with the price the home steel mills could offer.  In these circumstances, a certain percentage figure was decided upon and that percentage was high enough over the prevailing market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another exception is this.  In shipbreaking a peculiar anomaly exists. While new ship building is a very competitive business, ships for shipbreaking can command very high prices. There is a shipbreaking industry within the country and they have to compete in the purchase of these old ships with shipyards throughout the world and it is regarded as only fair for the purpose of the industry, and particularly for the employment they offer, that they be permitted to export; otherwise it would not be economic for ship-breakers in Ireland to purchase ships <Col N="1027" /> and break them up and then be restricted to selling at home.</P>
    <P>Timber in the round does not arise in this Bill.  It arises under the control of timber exports which comes under the Agricultural and Fisheries Products (Regulations) Act, 1947.  Again there is a shortage of a certain type of timber in the round.  This is mainly timber suitable for the manufacture of veneers.  We have one or two veneer manufacturers and unless a control were exercised, it would be difficult for these factories to procure raw materials at economic prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has nothing to do with the export of agricultural products?  Can the Minister say whether or not tinned foods would be regarded as agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose that the price of cattle became so high that people could not buy meat&mdash;this is only a supposition&mdash;would the Minister not consider, <i>apropos</i> the question he was asked today, restricting to some extent exports of tinned food which might be essential to the people?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he can see his way towards giving financial assistance to the Irish Centre in London.

It may be rather complicated for the Minister to involve himself but possibly under some heading he may be able to provide some funds to assist the Irish Centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago, the Minister was queried with regard to the possibility and the desirability of providing control over young people going to Great Britain.  He interjected to the effect that he might be able to deal with this matter on the Estimate. I merely rise to ask him if he would be good enough to give us his considered and expanded views on this problem. To try to do something about it may be an even bigger matter than the original problem but it is undeniable that it is desirable children under a certain age, 15 or 16 years, should be required to produce permission from their parents or guardians to travel out of this country to Great Britain or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I do not say this is widespread but I know of occasions when young boys or girls, particularly boys, had got themselves into trouble with the Garda. If they were near a boat passenger port and were still fairly well heeled with money they had stolen, they were off to great Britain and it became very difficult to find them.  To prevent that sort of thing there ought to be some attempt at control.  The Minister explained some of the difficulties in respect of the type of control necessary when a question was put to him.  He said the problem had been considered over the years and he still could not find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a perfect example, but the State has power to prevent boys and girls under a certain age from entering a dancehall.  Whether that portion of the law is observed is anybody's guess and I know how most people would guess.  In any case, the State took unto itself power years ago to prevent people <Col N="1030" /> of a certain age from attending dancehalls. It is much more desirable that the State should take power unto itself to ensure that minors&mdash;let the age be determined at 15, 16 or 17&mdash;should not be allowed to leave this country without the permission of their parents and guardians because we all can guess how they may end up in some of the big cities and towns in Great Britain. From the point of view of both morals and health, they need protection.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I should be obliged if the Minister would consider the matter.  If he has already considered it, he might tell us what his considered views are.  I would urge that something be done to see that young children, particularly those who have stolen money and have got themselves into trouble with the Garda, are not allowed to jump on a boat and leave the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not having a Whip, I often do not know what is coming up and have to consider what I should say in a hurry.  We have now been handed back the remains of Casement and I think it is a good opportunity to take steps to bring to finality other similar cases, such as the Connaught Rangers. I understand one Connaught Ranger was executed and that one or two others died in prison where they were serving sentence following the mutiny. The bodies of those men should be returned to Ireland.  I should also like to urge that the bodies of those concerned in the shooting of Henry Wilson be returned to Ireland.</P>
      <P>All of them were associated with the national struggle and their remains should be brought back for reinterment. I would ask the Minister to do all he can to achieve this. Naturally, there will be hesitation among those concerned but I suggest that if at all possible the remains of those men should not be allowed to lie in alien prisons as they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the matter mentioned by Deputy Corish more than once.  I have spoken about young girls going to England.  I read the English press a lot <Col N="1031" /> and I hear a great deal about what happens to certain females in England. I believe that a fair percentage of the people who do a certain class of work, of which we are and they should be ashamed, are Irish.  If it is too difficult to have a passport system, as the Minister says, there ought to be some form of extradition.  I understand an Extradition Bill is to come up before the House but I do not know whether we can, under any of its provisions, bring girls back.</P>
    <P>If girls under a certain age leave the country without their parents' consent and if the parents want them returned, it should be possible to have them brought back.  If their parents do not object, then the parents must be quite satisfied, but where they are not satisfied, I submit there should be power of extradition.</P>
    <P>There are one or two minor points I should like to mention.  One is the Minister's decision in relation to China having a seat in the Security Council. I have heard it argued here and while I do not claim to be an authority, I agree with the Minister that a large and rather dangerous country like China should not be on the loose.  If it is the Minister's view that this large and dangerous country should become a member of the Security Council so that its actions could be influenced by other members of the Council, then I think the Minister is right in advocating that.  I do not think the question should arise as to whether they are Red or not.  Unless matters of this kind are handled carefully, they could lead to a further struggle far worse than we have ever had in the world before.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, may I just ask him if he will be good enough in his observations to give us an up-to-date appraisal of what the situation is in relation to the United Nations, since the situation in regard to it has evolved considerably since this debate began?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin has made a new suggestion to deal with the young people who leave this country without the consent of their parents. <Col N="1032" /> That suggestion is, I think, well worth examining.  It would, of course, require the co-operation of both the British Government and the British courts, but it is one of the things I shall have examined in an effort to see what can be done about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and I seem to be in agreement on one point in regard to this problem of young Irish emigrants to Britain.  Deputy Dillon fully acknowledges that we cannot set up a duplicate social service in Britain.  It is estimated there are 1,000,000 Irish-born living in Britain at the moment. There are only 3,000,000 of us here. One of the reasons why there are 1,000,000 Irish in Britain is that we cannot build up here quickly enough and the more money we devote to other purposes, such as money guaranteeing everybody from the cradle to the grave in Great Britain if they have been born in Ireland, the less we shall have with which to build up here to keep others from going or to attract those who have gone to come back.</P>
      <P>All Governments for a number of years have examined this problem.  We all wish there was an effective means of stopping young people going to Britain.  During the war there was a travel permit system.  No one could leave the Twenty-six Counties without producing a travel permit.  That was effective in stopping young people whom the Irish Government wanted to stop because the British were also interested in stopping unauthorised entry.  They did not want people who had come in from outside moving around in Britain unless they were armed with identification papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the situation today and last year the British Government indicated that they could not effectively stop people entering Britain from Ireland.  They could not do it in ordinary peacetime.  If we were to reimpose a travel permit or a passport system, it would also have to be imposed between ourselves and the Six Counties.  Now there might be some chance of stopping young people getting on board a plane or boat because there are only half a dozen points of departure but it would be impossible to stop them crossing <Col N="1033" /> the 270 miles of border.  All people who want to go to Britain need do is take a bus at a cost of a few shillings and walk over the Border at any point along the 270 miles without any identification papers or passport.  The situation would be impossible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin's suggestion is worth pursuing with the British Government, if I get the approval of our Government to such a course.  To establish a passport system would cause great inconvenience to people travelling back and forth, as they do, in great numbers. How are we to distinguish between a young person who goes off against the wishes of his parents and those who do not?  If they are asked to produce their parents' consent at the gangway to the boat or plane it will be very easy for them to produce a letter of consent purporting to have been signed by their parents or guardians, and who is to tell?  Will it be the intention, too, to hold up every young person who travels between here and Britain on holidays?  Anyone can see all the inconvenience that would be caused and all the disruption of the ordinary flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>In peak periods, the difficulty is to handle with reasonable speed all the passengers who come forward for places on a boat or plane.  It is hard enough as it is to handle that traffic; it would be impossible if we had to go through this scrutiny of people who appeared to come within whatever age we set.  I doubt if such a system would be acceptable for very long.  We would be accused of imposing a general passport system and the Government would be accused of coralling the young people here, forcing them to stay in Ireland against their will.</P>
    <P>The other approach spoken of by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Costello, Deputy Corish and others, of helping these young people in Britain is one that I have actively promoted for a number of years.  There is no substitute for the voluntary worker in this particular regard.  If a young person landing in Britain fears approach in an official way, he or she will quickly get out of the road of the official.  The Irish people living over there and the <Col N="1034" /> people of Irish extraction living over there who have an interest in this matter can get in touch with them at their work or at the ordinary places of social contact and persuade them to go home if they are too young to be on their own in Britain.</P>
    <P>There are innumerable Irish clubs doing that work.  One of the best of such foundations is the Irish Centre in London.  They are doing extremely good work.  I visited it myself quite recently and had a talk with the people in charge.  They are short of money. They want more money.  The best way for them to get it is by voluntary collections either in Britain, as they are doing, or even if they were to spread over here to Ireland and do it in an organised way.  The innumerable smaller sporting and social clubs are helping them and the 200 or 300 in London are giving very handsome subscriptions either to the Irish Centre or to clubs doing similar work in other towns.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which I hope to deal with in a much better way than heretofore.  The Minister for Finance is prepared to give us permission to send home young people who are willing to come back home if we think they should be in Ireland instead of over there.  Heretofore, we had to go through a long process of getting financial assistance for each case.  If we act a little more quickly and if young persons obviously should be at home and we can help them to get home, it would result in having sent back to Ireland persons who, because of age or infirmity, should be at home with their people.</P>
    <P>The social services in Britain for the ordinary person out of work are, <i>vis-á-vis</i> what is provided here, very high but the most we can promise to do for anybody who does not want to live in Britain is to say to them that if they come home here, they will be as well treated as anybody else in the country.  That offer is there for them. We could not undertake to give a weekly pension to any Irish person who wants to live over there.  If they want help and if they want care and they feel they cannot get it in Britain, <Col N="1035" /> or if some of their friends think they would be better off in Ireland, we are prepared to help those who cannot help themselves and when they return to Ireland, the social services are available to them in the same way as to everybody else.</P>

      <P>We have an official in the Embassy who is engaged wholetime in that work.  All the members of the Embassy staff attend social functions of all sorts in London particularly, but also in other towns.  In that way we have very close contact with the whole of the big centres of Irish population.  Where there are only a few individuals scattered around, we cannot make contact with them.  One of the things I feel would be bad in the introduction of a passport system is that the ordinary traveller going from here to Britain passes through the airports and goes by boat and train and we know pretty well where they are going to land on the other side.</P>
      <P>There are voluntary organisations that meet boats and trains and try to contact anybody who looks as if he needs help.  If we were to impose a passport system and stop them taking these normal routes and ending up in Britain at the normal places where one expects young Irish people to disembark from train or boat, if we force them to go over the Border and scatter all over England and Scotland, we would never get into contact with them.</P>

      <P>How are a Government to decide between the various clubs? Once a Government give a sum of money to any group or any individual, every other group and individual demand the same sum, whether or not they are in need of it.  Instead of taxation by the State to distribute money from the Exchequer to such groups, it <Col N="1036" /> is better that it should be done in a voluntary way.  That is being done magnificently by the Irish in Britain. In the past few years, the growth of self-help by the Irish community has increased enormously.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn to some of the points made by Deputy Dillon and others.  Deputy Dillon thought that I was being over-optimistic in thinking there was a <i>détente</i> at the present time between the two great power blocs.  He <Col N="1039" /> said my talk about the non-dissemination and the danger of an increase in the number of nuclear powers was altogether illusory.  He went on to say that anybody can make the bomb but that there were only two effective nuclear powers.  Of course, quite a number of people can make the bomb and unless there is some agreement come to fairly shortly, the number making the nuclear bomb will probably double every ten years.  It is true that there are only two effective nuclear powers at the present time, each of whom could blow up the rest of the world, but the fact that they would be able to do it is helping to keep the peace between them.</P>
      <P>Since Cuba, it has been more and more borne in on the great nuclear powers that if one of them starts a nuclear war, the other would have sufficient retaliatory power to blot it out.  That is one of the reasons why there is some easement in this situation. Up until Cuba a great number of people were very worried that the two great nuclear powers might stumble into nuclear war.  The fact that one of them, Russia, stepped across the Atlantic and took with it its nuclear weapons and threatened the United States of America with nuclear weapons and had to draw back is a proof that they realise the enormity of the weapons they control and are not likely to use them deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always the danger of the great nuclear powers being drawn into war by accident.  There is less chance of that in the case of the United States of America and Russia than there was, in my opinion, and I am hoping that if we can get an agreement between the nuclear powers that they will not spread the weapon or give it to other people and that they will protect the smaller powers with the capacity to make nuclear weapons in case they were attacked by a nuclear power &mdash; if we can get these agreements and guarantees &mdash; there will be less chance of those powers that at present are not making nuclear weapons commencing to make them.  The Chinese bomb revealed how much nearer a number <Col N="1040" /> of countries were to making nuclear weapons than many people thought. There is no doubt that if any one of the potential nuclear powers starts to make the bomb, it will attract its neighbour, who feels threatened by it, also to make it.  There are a number of States with nuclear potential that have given very much more attention to the development of the techniques necessary to making nuclear weapons than they were giving to it before the Chinese bomb was exploded.</P>
    <P>However, apart from outright nuclear war between the major powers, which I do not think is likely unless one of them becomes dominated by a crazy dictator, there is the danger that if the smaller States start making the bomb the Governments in control will not be as steady or as knowledgeable as the two great nuclear powers of today and they might easily in a fit of temper or in a spirit of revenge let loose a nuclear weapon.  There is the other danger that if nuclear weapons spread around the world and become the conventional weapons of all armies and States, they will be used in revolutions and then there will be real nuclear anarchy.  It is very important that we should try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons now.  It was bad enough with three and now five but we do not want it to be ten as it could easily become within a number of years.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is true to say, as Deputy Dillon seemed to indicate, that unless they have very modern missiles or supersonic planes a nuclear attack could not be effectively delivered. There are many ways of delivering it besides carrying it in a suitcase.  There is the shipping all round the world. Any one ship could carry enough nuclear explosive to destroy any of the vast ports around the world.</P>
    <P>This nuclear weapon is something new in the history of man.  We have never had to face its like before.  I believe it could be stopped from spreading if we could persuade the nuclear powers to get down to business. The four nuclear powers that existed before China, agreed to the non-dissemination resolution which <Col N="1041" /> was passed by the United Nations a few years ago.  They agreed to put it on the agenda for Geneva.  They have had conversations about it and it is of the utmost urgency that they should get together and agree not to give the bomb to other countries or give them the knowledge of making it.  At the same time they should agree to go to the assistance of any small State attacked by a nuclear power. If that guarantee is not given and if the States with a nuclear potential are not satisfied with the guarantees they get, undoubtedly within the next couple of years we shall have at least two, if not three or more, nuclear powers added to the number we have. The nuclear powers have found it difficult to get agreement.  We hope they will now realise that something must be done immediately or they will face the problem in a few years of having double the number of nuclear powers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello dealt with the problem of the non-recognition of China. He said that it is probable that within the next two years a two-thirds majority for the admission of China will be forthcoming and that then the protection of Formosa will become a real problem.  The best advice I can get is that if the Assembly had continued we would have been up against the immediate danger of Formosa being kicked out of the United Nations and substituted by Peking.  I suggested to the smaller States that it was in the interests of all small States not to let this happen.  Formosa is an old nation. It has been for the past few hundred years invaded by one country and another, first by the Portuguese, then by some of the Southern Chinese; later it was invaded by Japan and, at the end of the war when Japan was defeated, its fate was left undecided. The Yalta Agreement did not provide either for giving it back to Japan who had posesssion of it for 40 years or letting it go independent.  In the end, as we know, it was taken over by Chiang Kai Shek's forces.</P>
    <P>The Formosans &mdash; the 12,000,000 or so of them &mdash; have as much right to independence as dozens of other small nations in the United Nations, including <Col N="1042" /> ourselves, and I do not think it would have been right not to raise the problem and have it fully debated.  I am convinced that if we cannot persuade the great majority of the smaller States that they have an interest in protecting the freedom of Formosa a number of them will be cajoled into voting for the admission of Peking at the expense of throwing Formosa out of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter raised by Deputy Clinton to which I want to allude.  He mentioned the question of the Entertainment Vote and referred to the fact that this year the Vote was for £23,000.  That Vote, as Deputies know &mdash; some of them may not know &mdash; covers all the entertainment by all Departments of State and not only by External Affairs.  The Department of External Affairs would hardly spend one-tenth of it.  It covers all the various international congresses and meetings held here, as well as all State visitors, people coming here for trade agreements and so forth.  It is altogether wrong to compare what was spent in 1957 with what is being spent now. For the one dozen visitors we had in 1956 or 1957, we have 100 today.  Some of these congresses have over 1,000 people who have to be entertained and our people will realise that it is important for this country to entertain distinguished guests and congresses of various kinds in a reasonable way. After all, the £23,000 represents less than 1½d. per family per year and it is money very well spent.  Those who have had the experience of being entertained by foreign States &mdash; and there is a great number of Deputies who have been so entertained &mdash; will realise that the entertainment given here is on a very modest scale.  I do not think we could do it fittingly on any smaller scale.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the question put to me by Deputy Dr. Browne, asking me to give details of expenditure in individual cases where distinguished visitors and congresses were entertained.  I have refused to do that. I pointed out that the only two countries I know of which publish figures in detail, or which separate the expenditure <Col N="1043" /> on the various groups entertained, are Great Britain and South Africa.  In the case of Great Britain, there are many other bodies beside the State which entertain distinguished visitors: the city of London, for instance, entertains on a very high scale distinguished visitors to that city.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I would be quite prepared in any case in which the Leader of the main Opposition Party wanted to know the details of any case to give them to him but I am not prepared to do it publicly.  It would be an embarrassment for our guests if, while they were here, a question were put down as to the cost to the Exchequer of the entertainment of a particular visitor or group of visitors. Another reason is that I fear if we gave the cost as it is given in Britain or South Africa, the individual group of visitors would be embarrassed by questions such as those put down by Deputy Clinton and remarks would be made like: &ldquo;Why was so-and-so entertained at £X when I could not get £X for this, that or the other good cause.&rdquo;  Every pound spent on a foreign visitor could be spent here by Deputies a million times over.</P>
    <P>The country is getting good value for the entertainment of these groups of visitors.  It is important that the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and other Departments should entertain the various congresses and delegations who come here and that their members should look back kindly on their visit to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he can give us any information about what the situation is going to be arising from the present deadlock in connection with the payments due by certain States which has prevented any decision, affirmative or negative, being taken during the present session of the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I overlooked answering that question.  The Deputy knows the situation that presented itself to the Assembly last November.  Russia and certain other countries had refused to pay expenses of peacekeeping operations, with the result that they were over two years in arrear.  It was decided to postpone having a confrontation on that point.  If a vote had been taken in the General Assembly in November, December or January, the question would have been immediately raised that a number of countries were not entitled to vote.  A great number of countries did not wish to face that issue.  I must say that if my will had been the law, I would have faced it, as the Deputy can see quite clearly from the speech I made on 8th November.  I do not believe that the UN can be an effective organisation unless every member nation pays its assessment within the appropriate time.  Any country that refuses to pay for two years should be deprived of its vote.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly confined itself for the months of November, December and January to the general debate and did no business that required a vote.  Anything that was likely to attract a negative vote, anything that could not be passed by unanimous agreement, was not put to the Assembly. The Assembly has adjourned until next September unless a special meeting is called.  If so, the Assembly will be faced with the dilemma again that it must, if a vote arises, decide one way or another whether a country with more than two years arrears has a vote or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was hoped last November that by not having this confrontation, not having a showdown on the issue, some of the great powers in arrears, if not all of them, would pay into the UN sufficient funds to take their debt <Col N="1045" /> below the two-year amount.  What will happen between now and next September I do not know.  I feel that unless the UN has a sound financial basis, it cannot be a success.  It is dangerous for the UN to continue to make a pretence that it can do some effective work when in fact it cannot.  I fear it is creating a haze and a smokescreen between the great powers and that if this situation continued, the UN would have to drop the pretence of being able to do anything and say to the great powers: &ldquo;There is nothing we can do to keep the peace.  You will have to face up to it yourselves and if you fall out, you will not have the UN to keep the peace between you as they did in Cuba, in Cyprus, as they did in the Congo, as is being done in the Middle East.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am hoping that the great powers will in the course of the next seven or eight months come to the conclusion that it is in their interests as well as in the interests of the smaller powers to put the matter to rights and that those of them who are more than two years in arrears will pay up.  I cannot prophesy whether that will happen or not.  I am hoping it will.  The sort of world we are living in requires the help of the smaller powers to keep the peace between the great.  There is also a need to keep the peace between the smaller powers.  If a great power intervenes, even at the call of the Government concerned, to protect a small nation against aggression, the other nuclear powers begin to sit up and take notice and they may all be drawn into the maelstrom.</P>
    <P>That was the situation in the Congo, certainly.  Cyprus is different but the situation there, too, was dangerous and still remains dangerous.  In regard to Cyprus, Deputy Dillon asked when it was likely to come to an end.  Unfortunately I do not know.  Even though this Government might not be prepared to carry on for very much longer on the present basis, it is important that a number of the smaller States should be prepared to go in there and lend a hand for as long as is necessary. It is rather a costly operation but <Col N="1046" /> nothing like as costly as a conflagration in the Mediterranean would be.  That is the situation the UN forces in Cyprus have had to stave off up to now.</P>
    <P>I do not like going into the merits of any discussion on the political situation in Cyprus.  Our troops are there and they are keeping the peace between two communities who are very emotionally &ldquo;het up&rdquo; at the moment.  I feel the best we can do is try to keep the guns silent and let negotiations go on.  As Deputy Dillon and others remarked, you have not only the UN peace-keeping forces there but you have also a direct representative of the Secretary General and side by side with him a conciliator.  The first conciliator died but his successor has been at work.  He is keeping up the visits to Turkey, Greece and Cyprus itself.  Let us pray he will be able to persuade all the interested powers to come together and make an arrangement that will keep the peace.  That is all we are interested in.  Again, how long that will take I do not know but it is a very heartening thing to compare the situation in Cyprus to-day with that which obtained this time last year when great numbers were being killed or driven out of their homes, the crops destroyed and so on.  If we can keep the peace and promote neighbourly relations between Cypriots of all extractions, they may be able ultimately to make an arrangement which will enable them to live in peace and govern their little island for the benefit of all their people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The objects of the Bill are stated briefly in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the text.  Under the provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, the Warsaw Convention has the force of law in this country in relation to carriage by air between Ireland and other countries to which the Convention applies.  In general terms, the Convention provides that when an accident occurring during international carriage by air causes death or injury to a passenger or damage to cargo, there is a presumption of liability on the carrier.  The Convention enables some compensation for death or loss to be obtained without litigation.  The contracting carrier's liability for each passenger under the Warsaw Convention was limited to 125,000 gold francs (approx. £3,000). Under the Hague Protocol to the Convention, which was given effect here by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1959, the limit was doubled to about £6,000.  In any case, however, where wilful neglect or misconduct can be established against the carrier there is no limit to his liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Warsaw Convention governs only cases where the contracting carrier performs the carriage and does not contain particular rules relating to international carriage by a person who is not a party to the agreement for carriage such as, for example, the case <Col N="1048" /> where a passenger has made an agreement for carriage by one airline and that airline arranges for the passenger to be carried by another airline.</P>
    <P>In order to cover cases of this kind, the Convention, supplementary to the Warsaw Convention, for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Performed by a Person other than the Contracting Carrier was concluded at Guadalajara, Mexico, on 18th September, 1961.  Under this Convention, if an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the Agreement of the contracting carrier with the passenger or consignor, is carriage subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention, then he, as well as the contracting carrier, shall be subject to those rules.  The contracting carrier is subject for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the Agreement, the actual carrier solely for the carriage which he performs.  Section 2 of the Bill will apply the Guadalajara Convention to carriage between this country and other contracting States.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill re-enacts with amendments section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, which concerns the manner in which the liability imposed on the carrier by the Warsaw Convention in respect of the death of a passenger shall be enforceable and contains for the purpose of enforcement a definition of the expression &ldquo;member of a family&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the 1936 Act was first amended by section 4 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1959, to provide that, in deducing any relationship, a person adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952, shall be considered a lawful child of the adopters and a person in loco parentis to another shall be considered the parent of that other.  The Civil Liability Act, 1961, further amended and replaced section 18.  This amendment was designed to bring the law in regard to fatal air accidents, as far as possible, in line with the general law governing fatal injuries.  The Civil Liability Act, 1964, amended the general law for fatal injuries by repealing the provision in earlier Acts limiting claims for <Col N="1049" /> mental distress to three years.  It is desirable to make the same provision in respect of air accidents.  It is also necessary to take account of the Guadalajara Convention in the application of the section.  Rather than introduce a series of amendments in the present Bill, it is proposed to reenact the entire section as amended.</P>
    <P>The Warsaw Convention, as amended by the Hague Protocol, can by section 20 of the 1936 Act and section 8 of the 1959 Act be applied to internal carriage as well as international carriage by air.  It is desirable that internal carriage should also have the benefits of the Guadalajara Convention and section 5 of the present Bill so provides.</P>
    <P>The control of air services is one of the main purposes of the Bill.  At present the Minister's powers in this matter derive from two measures.  The first is the Air Navigation (International Lines) Order, 1935.</P>
    <P>This Order, which was made under the Air Navigation Act, 1920, was expressed to give effect to certain provisions of the 1919 Paris Convention on Aerial Navigation.  Under the Convention, each contracting State was to make prior authorisation a condition of the establishment of international airways on its territory.  The Paris Convention has been superseded by the Chicago Convention of 1944 but the International Lines Order was continued in force under section 15 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  There are, however, certain doubts as to the validity and efficiency of the Order in present day conditions and its replacement is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, provided for the bringing into operation of and giving effect to the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago in 1944. The Chicago Convention recognises that each contracting State has control of the air space over its territory and consequently proceeds to lay down that no scheduled international air services may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State except with the special permission or authorisation of the State concerned <Col N="1050" /> and then only in accordance with the terms of such permission or authorisation.</P>
    <P>Contracting States, including Ireland, normally accord this permission or authorisation by way of bilateral air agreement with the State of Registry of the airline concerned.  Such agreements are based on the premise that the State has control and that the Minister for Transport and Power, acting for the State, may attach any conditions he thinks fit to permissions or authorisations for air services issued by him.  It is thought desirable, therefore, at this stage, by enactment of the present measure, to put beyond doubt the State's control over air services to, from, within or over its territory.</P>
    <P>It should perhaps be made clear that the intention is not to introduce any new or onerous restrictions on international aviation operations but to ensure that the State's powers are clearcut and unequivocal.  It is proposed that this control will be exercised through the provisions of section 6 of the Bill in conjunction with sections 7 and 8. The main control authorised by section 6 will be brought into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by Order.  This will afford sufficient time for the preparation and publication of the necessary Orders under section 7 and authorisations under section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill restricts the operation of air services to, from within or over the territory of the State unless the service is either covered by by order under section 7 of the Bill or by an authorisation under section 8. The services to be permitted by order under section 7 will include:</P>
    <P>(a)  the type of services covered by our bilateral air agreements;</P>
    <P>(b)  flights for non-traffic purposes and overflights which may be operated by countries which, like Ireland, are parties to the International Air Services Transit Agreement which ensures between signatories automatic rights to overfly and make stops for non-traffic purposes; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the individual flights or short series of non-scheduled flights permitted <Col N="1051" /> by the Multilateral Agreement on Commercial Rights of Non-scheduled Air Services in Europe.</P>
    <P>These flights are all of a type covered by international agreements, either bilateral or multilateral.  The list is not exhaustive; other categories of flights and extension of the present categories may arise in future.  It would be difficult to delineate and keep up to date all categories of flights in the present Bill; authorisation by Order seems therefore a more appropriate method of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to the types of services to be covered by Order, a number of air services of various kinds are operated, such as charters, inclusive tours, casual non-scheduled flights etc. Control over such services is intended to be operated under section 8 of the Bill.  Under this section the Minister may issue authorisations to operate one or more flights under such provisions and conditions as he thinks appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the sections of the Bill which authorise control of international services will be used also for control over internal air services and over Irish aviation businesses.  At present under section 84 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, the Minister for Transport and Power may authorise the operation of internal air services only if they are carried on by one of the statutory companies &mdash;Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus or a subsidiary company &mdash; or by a person who is already authorised to establish an international air service, provided such international air service and the internal service are carried on with the same aircraft.</P>
    <P>Conditions have changed to such an extent since 1936 as to justify repeal of section 84 and the introduction of the measure proposed in sections 6 and 8 of the present Bill.  This enables the Minister for Transport and Power in his discretion to grant an authorisation to any person to operate an air service within the State.</P>
    <P>Apart from the categories of flights <Col N="1052" /> which I have already mentioned there is in Ireland a certain amount of small aviation business which at present is carried on by virtue of licences granted under Part X of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  The work authorised under these licences falls into three categories (i) aviation private hire business (ii) pleasure flights; (iii) instruction flights.  Private flying as such is not subject to control under this part of the Act, neither is aerial photography or other such aerial work.  It is most desirable that our legislation regarding the control of air space should be as compact and consolidated as possible and in view of the generality of sections 6 and 8 of the present Bill it is no longer necessary to retain Parts IX and X of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>It is proposed therefore to repeal these Parts and to cancel licences issued under Part X.  Fresh authorisations under section 8 of the present Bill will be issued to the holders of existing licences and the conditions and provisions attaching to the new authorisations will as far as practicable be in line with those attaching to the existing licences.  The definition of an air service in this Bill will exclude from the proposed controls private flying, executive type flying and aerial work generally as well as instruction flights.  These excluded categories will therefore in future be subject only to the operational control exercised from a technical and safety aspect and will not require a special licence or authorisation under this Part of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part X of the 1936 Act contains provisions relating to applications for the grant and renewal of licences, attachment and amendment of conditions, commencement and duration of licences and other similar matters of detail.  It seems more appropriate to deal with these matters of detail by means of regulations rather than by an Act of the Oireachtas and it is so proposed in the present Bill.  The fees to be charged for authorisations will be fixed in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It has already been mentioned that <Col N="1053" /> under the Chicago Convention scheduled international air services may be operated over or into the territory of a contracting State only in accordance with the terms of the permission or authorisation given by the State concerned.  Here also it is felt desirable, at this stage, to put the position beyond doubt by enacting sections 9 and 10 of the present Bill.  Section 9 gives the Minister power to fix by Order rates and fares charged on air services, while section 10 gives him the right to approve or refuse to approve of the fares or rates proposed to be charged on such services.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the necessity for fixing rates for carriage of passengers, cargo or mail by Order will arise very frequently because the present method of fixing international rates is on the whole working satisfactorily. This method, which is set out in most of our bilateral air agreements, provides that the rates to be charged on the air routes governed by the bilaterals shall be agreed by the designated airlines of the countries concerned.  Agreement shall where possible be reached through the rate-fixing machinery of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  The rates so agreed must then be submitted for approval to the Aeronautical Authorities of the countries concerned. If agreement is not reached, the Aeronautical Authorities themselves shall try to determine the tariffs.  If the Aeronautical Authorities fail, the matter can be referred to arbitration appointed by the parties themselves or, in the final analysis, by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the IATA arrangements insofar as they affect transport to or from Ireland are subject to my approval.  In these circumstances, it is not likely that use will often be made of the rate fixing powers in the present Bill to control scheduled airline operations unless IATA fails to agree on rates.  The fixing powers will, of course, also be applicable to non-scheduled operations and to non-IATA airlines, so that if necessary, control of these rates, which are not at present <Col N="1054" /> subject to any special control, can be effected.</P>
    <P>Sections 11, 15 and 16 of the Bill provide for the making of regulations for the keeping of records and statistics, the production and inspection of these records and the submission of extracts, copies and summaries.  I think Deputies will agree that these provisions are desirable.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 of the Bill provide for penalties and detention of aircraft. There are two types of penalties, administrative and legal.  Administrative penalties can take the form of revocation or suspension of the traffic rights of the airline concerned.  The advantage of this type is that it is efficient and can be implemented at once.  The disadvantage is that it is on occasion too strong a sanction and may not then be enforceable in that it would mean an unfair punishment on the travelling public.  Legal penalties as provided in section 12 of the Bill include fines and/or imprisonment.  On summary conviction, the fine proposed in section 12 is £100 or imprisonment for six months or both.  On conviction on indictment, the money penalty is raised to £1,000.  These sums are of course small as far as airlines are concerned; a more real deterrent is the power of detention of aircraft under section 13 of the Bill.  The ultimate sanction would, of course, be denunciation of the bi-lateral agreement with the country of registration of the air operator concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill relates to commercial aviation only and therefore proposes to exclude State aircraft from its scope. The Minister for Transport and Power may, however, by Order, direct that such provisions of the Bill as may be specified in the Order shall apply to State aircraft.  A similar provision appears in the 1936 Act, and it is desirable to repeat it here.</P>
    <P>The usual provision regarding the laying of Orders and Regulations before the House applies to all Orders and Regulations made under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill substantially to give effect to the provisions of the Guadalajara Convention and to <Col N="1055" /> effect certain amendments to the Warsaw Convention relating to air transport.  It is a highly technical measure.  We are in the rather peculiar situation here that we have only one airline operating, the Government airline. Therefore, representations regarding matters of this character are not likely to reach the Opposition from interested parties because there is only one interested party so far as our inside operations are concerned and that is the State company.  However, I do not suppose there are any provisions in this Bill which are calculated to give rise to legitimate objection by people operating air services in the country but there are only one or two questions which I would like to ask the Minister because they require clarification in the light of his statement.</P>
      <P>At page 6 of his statement, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>Conditions have changed to such an extent since 1936 as to justify repeal of section 84 and the introduction of the measure proposed in sections 6 and 8 of the present Bill. This enables the Minister for Transport and Power in his discretion to grant an authorisation to any person to operate an air service within the State.</P>
      <P>Is it intended that we should grant anybody a licence to operate an air service inside the State other than the national air service, Aer Lingus?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be an occasion when Aer Lingus did not want to operate and where some other company could operate a service.  It is conceivable that it might happen, that it might pay a small air service and would not pay Aer Lingus to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>I think that is reasonable and proper control which the Minister ought to have but a further question arises in connection with what the Minister says at page 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of an air service in <Col N="1057" /> this Bill will exclude from the proposed controls private flying, executive type flying and aerial work generally as well as instruction flights.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister excluding from the proposed controls private flying, executive type flying &mdash; I take it that means where a company operates aircraft for the convenience of its executives &mdash; but when you come to the question of instruction flights, it occurs to me that that is a matter over which the Minister ought to have power of control and inspection.  We have seen in Great Britain and elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I can follow all that quite clearly, but then he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The definition of an air service in this Bill will exclude from the proposed controls private flying, executive type flying and aerial work generally as well as instruction flights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to trip the Minister up.  I know these complex pieces of legislation are not always easy to prepare in detail but it is just interesting that if you are supposed to fine the subject £100, you are quite resolved to give him six months if he does not pay, but when you speak of conviction on indictment and raise the penalty to £1,000, you do not make any corresponding provision.</P>
      <P>The last point of detail I would like to ask the Minister about is this.  At paragraph 18 of his statement on page 10, he says:</P>
      <P>This Bill relates to commercial aviation only and therefore proposes to exclude State aircraft from its scope.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;State aircraft&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Army planes, customs or police planes.  It does not apply to Aer Lingus planes that would be used by the Army, the police or customs authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say that if you are speaking of the Air Force which is under the control of the Minister for Defence, that is understandable, <Col N="1060" /> but I very much doubt that the Minister ought to strip himself of power to control through safety regulations aircraft to be used by the customs or by the police.  If he does, who is to control them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, if the Deputy reads on, he will see that I actually have power to make an Order whereby such provisions of the Bill as I may specify can apply to State aircraft so that if customs authorities bought aircraft for some reason and I thought that there should be some control, I could issue an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the Minister says he retains the power, I can agree with him.  Where he is dealing with State aircraft as is meant by aircraft under the control and direction of the Minister for Defence, it is reasonable for him to say, as a civil Minister, he does not concern himself with that. However, if on the executive side, say, in the Department of Justice, Posts and Telegraphs or some other Department, it is proposed to use aircraft, I cannot see who is to control them from the point of view of safety if it is not the Minister for Transport and Power. While he could properly overlook military aircraft, he ought to make regulations in regard to aircraft being used by branches of the civil government which would bring them under his general power of control and inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made a reference at the outset of his remarks to the difficulty of separating commercial airlines from State-owned airlines such as we have here.  It is very difficult to appreciate that Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are commercial airlines and at the same time State-owned airlines. This has been confusing me for some considerable time.  Our airlines are members of IATA, and the Minister has pointed out that this is the body to which the commercial airlines apply particularly in regard to the fixing of passenger rates and the fixing of air freight commodity prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand purely commercial airline companies, which are public companies or private-owned companies <Col N="1061" /> but, nevertheless, strictly commercial airlines, having some kind of organisation to prevent unfair competition, to prevent the introduction of conditions which could bring about deterioration in the development of air services generally, but what I cannot understand is that a State-owned organisation should allow itself to be bound by rules, regulations or rates that are arranged purely for commercial companies.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I protested on this matter.  Our airlines are State-owned and run as far as possible as a commercial undertaking.  However, not enough consideration is given by that company to our national requirements. I have for a number of years examined and followed possibilities of development on the air freight side. If air freight charges are made economic for people who want to use air freight facilities, not only will it bring added trade to our country but it will bring considerable growth in the carrying of freight by our airlines.  Apparently the requirements of the nation are to be second to what one might call the commitments of our airlines to IATA.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why a more progressive approach is not made to the development of our air services. It is true that our air services have been more than successful as a commercial undertaking.  It is true that they contribute greatly to the arrival here of great numbers of tourists.  We should not blind our eyes to the situation that an air service to be successful has to have a two-way traffic and while it brings people here, it also brings our people out.  One only has to examine the numbers of Irish people who go abroad as tourists, due to the useful service provided by our airlines, to realise that there may be very little difference as between the outgoings and the incomings.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for a long time with the question of the largescale and rapid development of the air freight service.  Air freight service means that perishable goods can be transported long distances without any damaging effect on the goods <Col N="1062" /> themselves.  However, the rates for freight are such that it is impossible for ordinary commercial people to avail of air transport.  If you have a valuable cargo of gold or diamonds, the rates that are current make no difference to the value of the amount of goods being sent but if you have goods which not only are perishable but have to complete in the place of destination of such goods, air freight rates being too high end the possibility of its development.</P>
    <P>I could give many instances of items I have in mind but I shall not bore the House with them.  If anybody makes investigation into this, they will find that what I say is correct.  A State-owned organisation such as Aer Lingus or Aerlínte should hesitate to be bound entirely and absolutely by an international organisation which really was set up for ordinary commercial undertakings. There should be some power remaining with the Minister for Transport and Power here as far as our country is concerned to disagree, if necessary, with a rate fixed for a commodity which adversely affects the possibility of the development of air freight from this country to other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that on any approach I made to our air companies on that matter, I have been told definitely and forcibly &ldquo;we are bound by IATA and we can make no changes,&rdquo; and there has never been a suggestion &ldquo;unless the Minister so desires.&rdquo;  Therefore, I say the Minister should make it clear &mdash; later, if he wants to look it up &mdash; that that power is reserved in him and that it will be operated if a suitable case is made.</P>
      <P>This is not the occasion to praise or to criticise our air companies.  Nevertheless, it is the occasion on which we should make sure that we will not allow our transatlantic or European air services to be hampered by being bound as they are by IATA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that we know what takes place at a meeting of such an international organisation.  I am told that if a new rate is proposed, a new commodity or any other rate, unless <Col N="1063" /> the decision is unanimous, it cannot be passed, that one company can object to a proposal for a new rate and that is the end of it.  With the number of companies now operating, with members in an organisation like this, that appears to be an impossible situation. If it were a matter of a majority decision, one could see some reason to it.  I remember some years ago approaching a transatlantic airline, during the time when our operations here had been suspended, to get a commodity rate for a perishable line of goods for export to the USA.  The company concerned were quite satisfied this was a proposal that would have a good future but when they put it to a meeting of IATA, they found it was being objected to by Aer Lingus, although, as I say, at the time there was no transatlantic line operating between Ireland and the United States. That is the kind of thing I believe is objectionable when it is a question of trying to ensure that our exports can be improved and developed and it is necessary to employ air carriage to develop them.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to make a study of this to see what our company's commitments are in being members of IATA and to see to what extent the State is committed to rules and regulations and conditions of an organisation which, I repeat, was set up purely for the purpose of keeping some order among the commercial undertakings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon said, this is a very technical Bill and I am disappointed that the Minister on such an important matter did not see fit to give us a more elaborate explanation of what the law is at present and what alterations are to be made.  It appears to me that in this Bill we are giving power to the Minister to make regulations on anything and everything.  While that may be desirable and necessary because conditions and circumstances are changing and, as Deputy Briscoe properly pointed out, one set of people who are parties to this international agreement may say: &ldquo;No, we will not have it,&rdquo; and then take what steps they <Col N="1064" /> like, the Minister should have given some indication of how the agreement was operating and what defects he saw on the international side as well as what steps he was taking to protect national interests.</P>
      <P>It is important that in regard to all flights in the country, whether they are under the control of the Army, the Navy, the customs or anybody else, there should be a governing principle to make sure as far as humanly possible that safety precautions are taken. We know that in other countries serious accidents have occurred because planes were flying where they should not fly or flying in a way they should not fly.  As conditions obtain now, we could reach a point within the next ten years at which we may require traffic regulations for the air space over Dublin, just as we have traffic regulations in the streets.  That may appear to be a bit far-fetched but I can assure the House that as far back as 1954 in Buenos Aires, there was an amazing number of people who had small planes to bring in fresh milk and fresh eggs, for which they had contracts, to the city, and they parked along a race-course.  There were as many small planes parked as there were cars in a square.  Both the Army and commercial people were complaining at that time that it was impossible to control these people and that they flew at whatever heights suited them and were a menace to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have power to deal with such matters.  He should tell us whether he has or not.  In introducing a Bill such as this, he should have specifically stated what powers he has and what additional powers, if any, he is taking.  The question of excluding certain people is, I presume, all right but the Minister says he has authority to make regulations for them, or he appeared to indicate in reply to Deputy Dillon that he had, but I should like to see it more specifically stated.  In regard to the question of punishment, I take it that it follows from the fact that where a fine of £100 and six months imprisonment is imposed, that when a fine of £1,000 is <Col N="1065" /> imposed, it means the imprisonment would be for six years because the imprisonment operates on the same scale for the larger sum as the smaller sum.  Therefore, I presume the Minister means that if a pilot is convicted on indictment, he may be fined up to £1,000 or given six years imprisonment, or both.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years.  It is a matter of simple mathematics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall settle for five, though it is a very serious offence. However, it is a highly technical Bill and I suggest the Minister should have given us a much more exhaustive explanatory memorandum on its implications. He should have shown us lucidly exactly what he intends doing.  On the question of charges and tariffs, he should have told us how these operate at the moment, whether he is satisfied with the position or whether he would like to see the provisions amended and, if so, how far.  He should have indicated what powers he would like to have and, if it is not possible to give him those powers, whether he should seek to secure them by international agreement.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the manner in which the Bill has been presented.  As I have said, it is a very technical measure.  Air traffic is developing and progressing, and legislation which today may be perfectly all right, may be obsolete in a short space of time.  The Minister should have told us that and explained what the position is likely to be in, say, five years.  It appears to be an essential Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as possible, we should try to introduce legislation in keeping with international Conventions, particularly in such matters as air traffic.  The Conventions governing air traffic have been set up to regulate fares for the different routes throughout the world.  In Ireland we have one of the few airlines in the world which has been able to pay its way.  Most of the world's airlines are bigger than ours but we have beaten them all from the point of view of viability, though many of the bigger air companies are <Col N="1066" /> subsidised by their respective Governments.</P>
      <P>The secret of the success of our airline is that we go most carefully into the selection of routes.  We do not choose our routes for prestige purposes as do some of the other airlines.  Last year, BOAC had to pull out of South America which obviously was a prestige route.  We have always complied with Convention regulations in regard to air fares.</P>
      <P>As others have said, this is a very technical Bill but there are many provisions in it which will affect future air traffic into the country.  In matters of air transport, you cannot retain for long, say, the green lights you have in O'Connell Street and in other such streets in our cities: we must have the most up-to-date technical equipment for such matters as the provision of thousand-foot ceilings for the stacking of planes over our airports and so forth.  Therefore, we must be very careful in dealing with the technical aspects of air traffic, particularly when we consider the number of lives at stake.</P>
      <P>Even under present legislation, according to statisticians, one is safer travelling by air than by any other form of transport.  It is all the more important, therefore, that we keep up with the times and in touch with the improvements being carried out in other countries and at other airports. We have been voicing our opinions very forcibly at international conferences. They have been listened to and in fact one of our Aer Lingus officials has been President of the International Conference.  That is another reason why we must conform with international Conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will tidy up quite a number of Acts and bring them up-to-date.  It will prepare us for what is coming in air transport in the years ahead.  Aer Lingus, as I have said, has been doing a very good job, not alone in paying its way but in bringing tourists to the country.  I have travelled on quite a number of airlines and have no hesitation in saying that Aer Lingus has something extra to add.  Possibly it is the hostesses, but the entire service is second to none.  This has been given <Col N="1067" /> recognition in hard figures of £s. d.  It is the company's efficient service that has achieved those results.  We have an excellent record of safety, having had only one crash, in the Welsh mountains, some years ago.  I do not think any airline in the world has such an excellent safety record.  Our accidentfree record has been the result of the extra precautions we have been taking over the years.</P>
    <P>The House should always agree to the enactment of any legislation that will help us to keep that safety record intact because an air accident can take a terrible toll of lives.  So that we can keep our record and, in order to keep that record, we must keep in touch with what is happening in air transport and air development.  Air transport is growing and it is inevitable that there must be new regulations.  This Bill brings old regulations up to date and introduces new ones.  It is a very technical Bill but I welcome it because it is designed to keep us abreast of the times from the point of view of air transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Proper control of air traffic is very important and it is something that should be subject to international agreement.  We have a magnificent air service and it is only right that we should be a party to this Agreement in order that, putting it at its lowest, our aircraft will get facilities from the countries which expect facilities from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker spoke of the magnificent record of both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  It is only proper to draw the Minister's attention to the achievements of this State company.  It is one of the extraordinary contradictions of the Minister's life that he spends most of his political time telling us the magnificent benefits to be derived from private enterprise while, at the same time, he administers a Department devoted almost exclusively to the supervision of State companies of one kind or another.  That is a point that should be made when discussing these matters.  All these organisations were <Col N="1068" /> built up from practically non-existent services to their present remarkable level of efficiency, competency and reliability.  There was no background knowledge; the technicians, the pilots, the technocrats, the administrative staff and the directorate needed to operate these services all came forward from the ordinary people.  We built up these services without any significant outside assistance or know-how.</P>
    <P>The Minister should learn something from that when he is being critical of State enterprises of one kind or another.  Everybody can be very proud of the remarkable safety record, long may it last, of both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, to say nothing of their universally accepted record of courtesy, punctuality and complete reliability. Theirs is a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>The need for air traffic control is self-evident.  The growth of air traffic is quite phenomenal.  Most passengers, if they appreciated the growth of air traffic into Dublin or into the Greater London airports, would probably be rather frightened at the prospect. There is the difficulty of maintaining the schedule of inflow and out flow. All this is achieved with remarkable efficiency.  Traffic flows as fast as it can.  It grows heavier every day.  In the midst of all that, there is the constant endeavour to keep the accident rate to what we hope is an irreducible minimum and that is really the origin of the need for international agreements of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some powers for fixing air fares and the extent to which we here could decide what air fare to charge.  The implication seemed to be that he is free to make any decision he wants.  In section 10 the phrase appears &ldquo;The Minister may in his absolute discretion...&rdquo; Are not air fares fixed by what is effectively an international <i>cartel</i>, of which we are a member?  If that is so, then the Minister has not in fact absolute discretion.  He is bound by international agreement.  This seems to me to be so much wishful thinking. It would be nice to think he had absolute discretion but it strikes me that he has not.  On occasion certain air <Col N="1069" /> companies have tried to reduce fares and found they were bound by this type of international agreement to retain a particular level of air fare.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the fact that we are not operating a prestige type of enterprise.  Other airlines have tried uneconomic propositions. Our airlines provide only what they regard as an economic proposition from the point of view of service.  To what extent are we hindered in extending the scope of our air transport to the maximum number of people by a reduction of fares because we are compelled to keep our fares level with those companies which indulge in prestige air services?  To what extent can Pakistani Airlines run a service to London?  Can they afford to run one to New York?  Is it justified?  Is it an economic proposition?  It is the same with Air India and British Overseas Airways which used to fly to South America.  To what extent is there a costly factor in the structure because of these type of prestige services?  To what extent are we bound to maintain a high fare, a fare which could be reduced if the service were run in a more levelheaded way, the way our airlines are run.  We have a service to New York and to London.  To what extent has the Minister or Aer Lingus any discretion in fixing fares in the face of this international <i>cartel</i>?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to raising the compensation from £3,000 to £6,000. In the case of the scheduled airlines one has some sort of redress.  What is the position in the case of charter planes?  There are mushroom companies with no really sound financial backing.  Are there arrangements whereby such companies must lodge money to an amount which might compensate if there were a catastrophe? To what extent can compensation be recovered?  I am speaking of the charter plane that can be rented by somebody for a flight to London, New York or anywhere you like, which gets into trouble and crashes.  If culpable negligence can be proved, the company may find itself liable for tremendous costs.  How can those costs be recovered when such a plane crashes with large loss of life and the next-of-kin are <Col N="1070" /> trying to collect compensation?  Is there any fund like the Road Fund or agreement amongst insurance companies whereby compensation will be paid in respect of the passengers in that type of plane?  Does the company have to be party to any kind of international insurance?  Can compensation be recovered if it is of a sufficiently high level?</P>
    <P>We have regulations here requiring companies to operate certain services and carry out certain kinds of maintenance. When it comes to an airline which has been in breach of some or any of these regulations which we feel are necessary for safety or any other reason, what are our powers to bring those in default of our regulations before a court or an inquiry or to apply whatever other disciplinary measure we choose to impose?  Has the Minister any real power in such a situation?  If the aeroplane has left our territory, has the Minister any redress?  Is there anything comparable with, say extradition from one country to another?  Is there any arrangement whereby the company in default of this Convention in respect of one country like Ireland can be, in trade terms, &ldquo;blacked&rdquo; as far as the rest of the members are concerned? Can they be brought to book by the country against which they have committed the offence by the co-operation of other countries party to the Convention?  What action are we liable to take in circumstances of this kind?</P>
    <P>I was interested to see that small aircraft of the executive, pleasure and instructional type are not subject to this legislation, but only subject to the ordinary rules of air safety.  Possibly it is rather too cumbersome to expect these smaller type craft to run the administrative services which would be required to fulfil all the needs of a commercial airline.  However, in view of the tremendous expansion there inevitably will be in smaller type aircraft, such as executive craft, is the Minister satisfied that he has sufficient control?  These craft, being in the air, can be a very serious danger to the great passenger aircraft.  Is the Minister satisfied with this position in regard to private aircraft?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> Recently, I asked a question in regard to the air traffic control personnel. It struck me that there appeared to be a rather excessive amount of overtime and so on in regard to these duties.  Is the Minister satisfied that excessive overtime is not worked by these people?  There is probably no other service in which people need to be more wide awake and able to cope with stresses than in a job of this kind. Is there international agreement on the length of time people should work in duties of this sort &mdash; the radar scanners and various other people who operate the flow in and out of our airports? Are there standard conditions of service for these operatives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only honour one's obligations in regard to air safety if one is using one's operatives in the most careful possible way.</P>
      <P>I see that State aircraft are exempted from this Bill.  Presumably, this refers to military aircraft?  What is the position in regard to them?  Is there any agreement at all between countries?  Is it permissible for one country to fly at any particular height over the territory of another?  Is there any sort of 12 mile limit as far as military aircraft are concerned?  If there are flights over our territory, is notice given or required?  Why is it that State aircraft are excluded from a Bill of this kind? If a passenger aircraft is hit by a State aircraft rather than an executive craft or a passenger craft, it does not matter very much to the passengers in the other plane.  Is there a separate Convention in regard to State aircraft?  Is that the reason they are excluded from the scope of this Bill?  Otherwise, the Bill seems to be admirable in every way.  If it adds at all to the safety record of our aircraft and other aircraft using our air space, then it is absolutely essential that it should be put through without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne raised the question of State companies which, of course, does not arise on this Bill at all.  I think he should already know <Col N="1072" /> that I approve of State companies on a pragmatic basis, not on a philosophical basis.  That is the difference between Dr. Browne and myself but we can go a long way together on that before we disagree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was for pragmatic reasons, not for reasons of socialism.  Deputy Briscoe suggested that the actions of IATA were restrictive and that we would have a greater volume of traffic if the fares were reduced. Aer Lingus is a public company founded on State funds but it operates on commercial lines, and for such a company, it is reasonable to have a body such as IATA whose rules will be accepted by the members and in the making of which all the members will have a say.  Otherwise, you would have widespread chaos which would result in some air lines being heavily loaded and others losing money.</P>
      <P>While it is true that nothing is more expensive than an empty plane because of the high capital costs, it is equally true that it is possible to carry goods at totally uneconomic prices.  If you add all the running costs and head-quarters costs to the cost of operation, you have to make certain that if you are going to reduce fares, the net result will be economic.  You have to be sure that the result will not be that the aircraft will be losing money for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In actual fact, it is true that regulations proposed by IATA have to be agreed unanimously.  That involves a great number of meetings but it is true to say that through these meetings numerous changes have been made in the right direction, in the reduction of air freight rates, in changes in rates for particular commodities, the arrangement of new commodity rates and in other ways.  In the case of the air freight rates across the Atlantic, there were some changes that were very much to our advantage in relation to the differential rates between New York and Shannon and New York and London where, before, the rates were the same.  There have <Col N="1073" /> been changes in relation to bulk rates and the point at which reductions could be made for a given minimum cargo which, we hope, may lead to the use of the warehouses at Shannon.  The whole of that picture is constantly changing.</P>
    <P>One of the things that may make all Governments think again is the changes that may take place in the cost of running airplanes.  We hope there will be reductions to come in this and Mr. Dempsey, General Manager of Aer Lingus, both as President of IATA and in his capacity as General Manager, has been urging constantly that more research should be done in the matter of low cost planes covering medium distances.  If some of the money now diverted to supersonic planes were devoted to the development of mass air traffic, it is possible that it would lead to the reduction of fares.</P>
    <P>The growth of containerisation by sea transport, particularly in the area surrounding Shannon, has given a temporary fillip of competition to sea transport on a marginal basis where an importer asks himself whether he should use the alternative of a fast container service by sea transport or use air transport.  That has heightened competition in many areas and it may cause air companies to take action to see if they can get a reduction or modification in air rates by way of bulk rates and special commodity rates. May I say also to Deputy Briscoe that air freight is increasing enormously? I have not got the figures with me but at Dublin Airport it has been increasing at the rate of 16 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent per annum in recent years, if I can remember the figures correctly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne asked whether in fact I have legal power to approve or disapprove of IATA fares.  We are clarifying that question in this Bill by making it obviously clear that when the Bill is passed, I will have power to approve or disapprove of a particular set of fares.  Deputy Browne also asks if IATA is an international <i>cartel.</i> The answer to that is that by and large all the Governments have for years agreed <Col N="1074" /> to the general fare regulations of IATA.  Where they had not, companies have fought for lower or higher fares. You get groups of countries arguing in order to represent the interests of particular administrations who feel that the air fare in a particular area is too high or too low.  You have these countries seeking the support of other countries for their case and you get modifications in that way.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to refuse to accept a particular structure of air fares, in which case IATA would have to meet again to discuss the matter.  In that case if we had an agreement with some other country or countries, it would be open to us to negotiate with them in the matter in order to reduce or modify the IATA fares.  So far as possible, we should try to avoid international chaos in air fares through the operation of IATA and there has been a good deal of flexibility in these matters.</P>
    <P>There was a case recently where there was a tremendous feeling that passenger rates ought to be reduced on the Atlantic.  IATA took a certain view and the American Government took another view.  In the end there was a further examination of the problem and the changes that took place as a result will be for the better.  We can only look at this matter from the pragmatic point of view.  The system works reasonably well and the amount of co-operation by the members of IATA has been successful.  There is power to bring pressure on other members in IATA and, on the whole, there has been fairly intelligent thinking on these matters.  Deputy Browne asked about charter aircraft and liability for damages in those cases.  A great number of countries have come to an agreement that is not covered by this Bill through the International Civil Aviation Organisation whereby charter planes must have adequate insurance to cover possible compensation and a great number of countries have subscribed to this regulation.  So, when charter planes come to this country we can generally assume that if they come from the countries from which travellers generally come the country <Col N="1075" /> itself has agreed to this compulsory insurance principle.  So that, even although the Hague Convention and the Warsaw Convention may not apply in this particular case, in fact there is coverage.</P>
    <P>Similarly in reply to Deputy Dr. Browne, insurance in our case is obligatory for instructional aircraft.  It is not obligatory for private aircraft but I think in most cases insurance of that kind is taken in the interest of the party.  A civil action can be taken in the ordinary way against the owner of a private aircraft which causes damage to himself or to passengers but we have not insisted, on giving a licence, that there should be insurance and, so far, I have not had any complaints in regard to that.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Dr. Browne, I am satisfied with the general air safety regulations that we have enacted.  I should say that I do not think I am supposed to give an account on the occasion of this Bill of all the legislation that now exists; it would take a very long time; but perhaps I should have said in connection with the Bill that all the legislation governing air safety in general, the licensing and inspection and regulation of aerodromes, the control of flights, air traffic control, are all contained in Part II of the Air Navigation Transport Act, 1946, which is not being repealed or reenacted in this Bill.  That all remains as legislation that has already been passed by the Oireachtas and which, in fact, has proved generally to be very successful.</P>
    <P>Again in reply to Deputy Dr. Browne there is an order prohibiting over-flights by military aircraft.  Permission has to be secured from the Department of External Affairs and is given only under compliance with Air Traffic Control.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the questions that have been asked.  As I have said, Deputy MacEoin suggested that I should have said more on this Bill but I hope the Second Reading made it clear that, apart from our adhering to the ICAO Convention, most of it was re-enaction for the sake of certainty, that I had certain powers <Col N="1076" /> in previous legislation and I did clarify the extent to which the legislation was being altered.  I hoped I made it sufficiently clear.  Maybe I am now making it clear that that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the amendments of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, adopted at an international conference in London in April, 1962, at which this country was represented. The 1954 Convention was given effect in this country by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956.  The Bill proposes to amend and extend the provisions of the 1956 Act.</P>
      <P>Pollution of the seas and beaches by oil dates back to the beginning of the century when oil began to replace coal as a bunker fuel on ships.  It did not, however, become serious and widespread until World War II when a number of ships carrying oil cargoes were sunk.  Since the war the transport of increasingly large quantities of crude oil by tankers &mdash; 500 million tons in 1963 &mdash; has led to a marked worsening of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Ireland has not been as seriously affected as some other countries, there have been a number of complaints of pollution of our coasts <Col N="1077" /> and coastal waters.  Bathing and boating facilities at some of our seaside resorts have been affected which is not only unpleasant for our own people but could become a matter of concern to our important tourist industry.  Oil pollution can also cause damage to fishermen's gear and boats and to marine installations.  It is a potential danger to fish life and the fishing industry and has resulted in heavy mortality and injury to sea birds.</P>
    <P>Gasoline, kerosene and lighter gas oils do not cause pollution since they are volatile and quickly evaporate when discharged.  On the other hand crude oil, fuel oil, heavy diesel oil and lubricating oil which are known as the persistent oils are only slowly affected by evaporation and persist in the sea for very long periods and can be carried considerable distances by ocean currents and winds.  It is these persistent oils which can pollute our beaches, and, of the persistent oils, crude oil forms by far the greatest proportion.</P>
    <P>The principal cause of oil pollution is the practice of cleaning the cargo tanks of crude oil tankers at sea and discharging the washings overboard, even though this is normally carried out at a considerable distance from land.  After discharging cargo, tankers have to take on board large quantities of water ballast to make them seaworthy on the return voyage.  This water ballast, when afterwards discharged into the sea from tanks which may have contained oils of the persistent type, carries with it some of the oil residue which remains in the tanks from previous cargoes.  The quantity of crude oil that remains in a tanker after its cargo is discharged varies with temperature, with the characteristics of the particular oil and with the structure of the ship's tanks, but on average amounts to about 0.4 per cent of cargo capacity.  A 30,000 tons tanker cleaning all its tanks would, for example, discharge 120 tons of crude oil into the sea.</P>
    <P>The only hope of dealing with this problem lies in concerted international action.  The first effective steps in this direction were taken in 1954 when an international conference representative of 42 countries, including Ireland, was <Col N="1078" /> convened in London to consider the problem.  The Conference which was representative of 95 per cent of the world's merchant shipping adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, together with eight resolutions. The Convention prohibited the discharge of persistent oils into the sea by tankers and dry cargo vessels of over 500 tons gross within certain prescribed zones.  The Convention also provided for the fitting of equipment to ships for preventing the discharge of oil into the sea and for the provision in main ports of adequate reception facilities for oily residues from vessels other than tankers.  Reception for oily residues from tankers would normally fall to be provided at the loading ports.  The Convention provided for the keeping of records of oil operations on all ships covered by the Convention.</P>
    <P>One of the resolutions adopted by the 1954 Conference recognised that the only entirely effective method of preventing oil pollution was complete avoidance of the discharge of persistent oils into the sea.  The Conference urged Governments and other bodies concerned to create the conditions under which it would be possible to achieve this objective at the earliest practicable date and recommended that a further conference should be held within three years to review the position.</P>
    <P>The Conference envisaged in the resolution referred to in the preceding paragraph was not convened until April, 1962.  The Governments of 41 countries, including Ireland, accredited representatives to the Conference and the Governments of 14 nations sent observers.  This Conference reached the conclusion that the complete avoidance of the discharge of oil and oily residues into the sea was not yet a practical proposition but that in the light of experience gained in the working of the 1954 Convention an extension of the provisions of that Convention was warranted and that this might best be achieved by amendment of the 1954 Convention.</P>
    <P>The principal amendments of the 1954 Convention which were adopted <Col N="1079" /> by the Conference were as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  that the Convention be extended to apply to tankers of between 150 and 500 tons gross;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the discharge of oil or oily mixture should be completely prohibited, except in exceptional circumstances, from ships of 20,000 tons gross or more for which the building contract is placed on or after the date on which this provision comes into force;</P>
    <P>(c)  that the zones into which persistent oil or oily mixture may not be discharged should be substantially extended;</P>
    <P>(d)  that Contracting Governments should take all appropriate steps to promote the provision of adequate reception facilities for oily residues and oily mixtures from ships; each Contracting Government shall determine which ports and terminals in its territories are suitable for these purposes.</P>
    <P>The amendments adopted by the Conference were signed, subject to acceptance, by the Irish delegation.  In accordance with the provisions of the 1954 Convention the amendments will become effective 12 months after acceptance by two-thirds of the Contracting Governments, except for those Governments which within that period indicate that they do not accept them. The present position is that 28 States have accepted the 1954 Convention and of these, 12 have accepted the 1962 amendments.  The 1962 amendments will not accordingly come into force until at least seven more States have accepted them.  Enactment of the Bill will enable the Government to accept the amendments on behalf of this country.  Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Ghana, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Kuwait, Liberia and the United Arab Republic have already accepted the amendments.</P>
    <P>If all ships were to follow strictly the provisions of the Convention and Amendments, pollution of the seas by oil would be lessened considerably but as it will still be permissible to discharge oil in certain areas, observance <Col N="1080" /> of the provisions will not entirely eliminate pollution.  For this reason it is gratifying to note that Shell International Marine Ltd., British Petroleum Tanker Co. Ltd. and Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. are taking more positive action to solve the problem.  These companies have developed a scheme known as the &ldquo;load on top&rdquo; system which it is believed will make a substantial contribution towards reducing pollution.  Under this system, the oily waste from all tanks is collected into one tank.  Here it is left to settle into a layer of oil floating on top of a layer of emulsified oil and water which in turn floats on clean sea water; as much of the water as can be pumped off without including traces of oil is then discharged back into the sea.  The oily residue is either pumped ashore or retained on board, depending on circumstances, and the succeeding cargo loaded on top, provided that the residue and the new cargo are compatible.  The companies are designing equipment to separate the oily water mixture more efficiently, and hope that other oil companies and shipowners will follow their example. This action by the oil companies is particularly welcome and should have a noticeable effect on the cleanliness of the sea.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the shipping industry in this country has always given the fullest co-operation in any steps necessary to combat oil pollution. Subsequent to the drawing up of the 1954 Convention Irish shipowners agreed to give immediate effect on a voluntary basis to its provisions providing for the prohibition of oil discharge in prohibited zones and to the keeping of records of oil operations on board ship.  Since the Convention came into force there have been no complaints against Irish vessels.  The only prosecution in this country under the 1956 Act has been in respect of a foreign vessel.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that while Ireland suffers comparatively severely from oil pollution our shipowners are not responsible for causing pollution. It is accordingly in our interests that the amendments of the Convention should be brought into effect at an <Col N="1081" /> early date.  While the 1954 Convention did not apply to ships of under 500 tons gross, the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956 went beyond the requirements of the Convention and applies to all ships registered in the State which include ships in excess of 15 net register tons.  No amendment of the Act is therefore necessary to give effect to the amendment of the Convention which provides that the Convention shall apply to tankers of 150 tons and over as the Act already applies to such ships.</P>
    <P>Whilst there are no ships of 20,000 tons gross or over on the Irish register, the modern trend is towards larger ships and it is possible that ships of this size may in time be acquired by Irish owners.  Accordingly, provision is made in the Bill for the total prohibition, except in exceptional circumstances, of the discharge of oil into the sea from ships of 20,000 tons gross or more which are ordered on or after the date on which this provision comes into force.</P>
    <P>Under the 1954 Convention the prohibited zones for tankers were generally more extensive than those for other ships.  The 1962 amendments to the Convention radically alter this position, so that apart from the special provision for the new 20,000 ton ships the same prohibited zones will apply to all classes of ships irrespective of the trade in which they are engaged.  It is proposed to give effect initially to this new requirement by section 4 of the Bill which provides that the existing prohibited zones for tankers shall be prohibited zones for all ships registered in the State.  Extension of these zones can be effected by Ministerial Order under section 9 of the 1956 Act.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken under section 5 of the Bill to require the owner of an oil refinery, shipbuilding or ship repairing yard to provide facilities for the discharge and reception of oil and oily residue from ships where such facilities are necessary or the existing facilities are inadequate.  It is not anticipated that this requirement should create any serious difficulty for the interests concerned and in any event there will be the fullest consultation before any <Col N="1082" /> action is taken under this provision. The remaining provisions of the Bill give effect to minor amendments of the Convention adopted by the 1962 Conference.</P>
    <P>Enactment of the Bill will enable the Government to accept the amendments adopted by the 1962 Conference and, therefore, help to bring these amendments into operation internationally. The Bill will place no significant burden on shipowners or other private interests nor will it involve any additional charge on public funds.  I have every confidence that the Bill will meet with the general approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We approve of this Bill which is, as the Minister says, substantially for the purpose of giving effect to amendments of existing international agreements for the control of this serious nuisance.  The Minister has spoken of the States which have ratified the 1962 Convention but he does not mention the names of the States whose failure to ratify it so far has prevented it coming into force.  Perhaps he would find it convenient to do so before the debate closes.</P>
      <P>Oil pollution which this Bill is designed to help in checking has not only extremely disagreeable consequences to the foreshore but also deplorable results for sea birds.  The extent to which birds are slaughtered by oil pollution is in many areas something approaching a catastrophe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are bound to admit here, although I understand on the south and east coasts there has been a great deal of trouble from this matter, we are by no means the country worst affected in Europe by this type of oil pollution.  The southern coast of England, certain parts of the Mediterranean coast and the Atlantic coasts of Spain and France have suffered very much more severely, and for that we may be proportionately grateful.  It would be a mistake from the point of view of our tourist industry to exaggerate the extent of this problem.  In so far as we are concerned, for hundreds of miles of our beaches on our west, north-west and south-west coasts, there is virtually no oil pollution.  I am happy to think that even here it is not <Col N="1083" /> at all on as grievous a scale as other countries have to complain of.</P>
    <P>However, we cordially approve of our Government playing their full part in seeking to control this international evil and it is gratifying to learn that the only prosecution we have had to take under the 1956 Act was in regard to a foreign vessel and not one of our own, and that as far as our information goes no ship registered here has contributed to this international evil.  I hope that the Government and the Governments of the several countries associated with this Agreement will be able to look forward to further and better regulations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the companies which he mentioned, who have introduced a system of their own for mitigating this evil, are to be congratulated. I should be glad to hear that some of the international bodies such as the Council of Europe or the United Nations would be invoked to persuade companies everywhere, engaged in traffic similar to that mentioned by the Minister, to follow the good example of the companies to which he has referred.</P>
    <P>Mark you, sometimes a body like the Council of Europe has a contribution to make in this regard and I believe that if this problem of oil pollution were brought to the attention of the appropriate committee on the Council of Europe, and the value of the contribution made by the British Petroleum Tanker Company, the Shell International Marine Company and Esso Petroleum Company brought to their attention, they might be able to help in persuading companies in the member countries to follow this example and make their contribution towards the elimination of this evil. Oil pollution of the sea is something that no individual country can itself control.  It is eminently desirable that we should continue to be in the forefront of international action for its control.  I should be glad to know from the Minister when he expects the additional countries to ratify the 1962 Convention so that it can be brought into force.</P>
    <Col N="1084" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One welcomes a provision of this kind for many reasons, mostly because we have such a tremendous coastline and consequently it is possible for oil which has been discharged pretty well anywhere in the Atlantic to end up on one of our beaches particularly in the west, at Connemara, or the south-west or on the north-west.  We welcome it also, of course, for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Dillon, the rather horrible sight of sea birds and other birds which are completely disabled by this oil pollution of the beaches.  There is also the unpleasantness it creates for people, tourists and so on, using the beaches and that I suppose is the major objection.</P>
      <P>The Minister was slightly selfsatisfied&mdash;&ldquo;smug&rdquo; is the word I was going to use, but I will use &ldquo;selfsatisfied&rdquo;&mdash;about our shipowners not being responsible for causing pollution. Taken in the context of so many countries with large merchant fleets, I do not think that it is really such a tremendous achievement on our part. It is a pity that so much advance has been made in regard to the Air Navigation Bill with which we have just been dealing and on which there is so much agreement, while there is such relatively little agreement in regard to this one.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the Second World War finished 20 years ago and we have the position that of the 42 countries that attended the Conference, only 28 accepted the 1954 Agreement and only 12 the Amendment to that Agreement.  The latest Agreement, the 1962 Agreement, will not come into operation until at least seven more agree to support it. Therefore it looks as if we are making very slow progress in dealing with this problem.  I suppose there is very little we, a tiny country, can do to expedite an international agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note the contrast between the progress made in regard to the other Agreement on air navigation and the very slow progress on this Agreement.  I suppose there are reasons for that but obviously there are people who are not affected by this use of oil in merchant fleets, particularly <Col N="1085" /> since the war.  As Deputy Dillon says, the Minister did not mention the countries which have not accepted the Agreement.  I was interested in one country, to know whether it had made any attempt to go to the Conference or to make any agreement, that is, Greece, which has a very large merchant fleet.  The Minister has not given any indication as to what attitude Greece takes with regard to a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill regarding the building of ships of 20,000 tons and over which states if the building contract for it has been entered into after the date on which the section comes into operation, the ship shall be prohibited from discharging oil or oily mixture except in exceptional circumstances.  Why was this tonnage decided on and why was it decided&mdash;while it is very desirable&mdash; to impose such a decision on that type of ship and not extend it? If it is possible to make that decision effective in regard to certain ships, what makes it possible for us to impose this condition on such ships and not impose it on other ships?  How will that be made effective?</P>
    <P>In regard to the zones in which oil is being discharged, who makes the decision?  Do the international group make it?  Have we been party to the decisions made in regard to the zones in which persistent oil may be discharged? How is agreement reached?  I am fairly certain we in this country will try to have all oil being discharged into the Atlantic and the Irish Sea completely prohibited, but who will allow or disallow the discharge into the sea anywhere around our territory? How is agreement on that arrived at? Is it by this conference, this group of nations?  Do they decide the zones in which this persistent oil can be discharged? To what extent have people a right to say they do not particularly want the oil discharged in any area near their own country?</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision whereby Governments will designate ports at which oil is offloaded, what is the position?  Whose responsibility will it <Col N="1086" /> be?  Is it the responsibility of the port concerned to provide the necessary storage facilities or will it be, from the point of view of the cost, the responsibility of the Government.  The same questions apply to shipbuilding and ship repairing concerns.  To what extent will they be liable?  What does one do with all this persistent oil?  How does one get rid of it?  It seems to me it will become a pretty formidable task in a very short time.  It seems to be quite a difficult problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it is not anticipated this will create any serious difficulties for the interests concerned and that he will discuss it with the various interests.  Is it a problem which will create any significant expenditure from the point of view of a port like Galway, or Dublin, of course, with its tremendous inflow of traffic?  How is the Convention to be made effective in that respect?  Is there some register of the amount of oil taken aboard?  To what extent is that Convention enforceable?  Has the Minister any reason to believe that there is likely to be any kind of expeditious resolution of the present impasse?  If it goes on at the rate at which it is present progressing, it seems to me it will be quite a long time before there will be effective control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We in this country must have considerable interest in anything that will tend to help in the solving of this oil pollution nuisance which is growing every day. It is of particular interest to us because we are at the receiving end: our waters are being polluted, as the Minister rightly said, not by our own ships but by those of other nations.  It appears to me that the 1954 Convention has failed to achieve its object.  At the <Col N="1087" /> 1954 Convention, the idea was that the oil could be discharged from ships only outside prohibited zones.  It was always a rather flexible Convention because it was difficult to prove who was polluting the water and, secondly, if you did know, it was very difficult to prevent its being done.</P>
      <P>This Bill seems to be a new attempt to meet the situation by, first of all, dealing with ships of more than 20,000 tons and secondly, by making some sort of legal requirement binding on all nations whereby legal proceedings can be taken against anyone responsible for pollution.  The 20,000 ton vessels would not seriously concern us.  In the first instance, if a vessel of that size is responsible, it should not be very difficult to nail it down because there are not so many 20,000 ton tankers riding the high seas as there are smaller tankers.</P>
      <P>The whole thing is complicated and the Minister dealt cursorily with it.  I do not think he has had sufficient technical advice to clarify fully the procedure it is intended to adopt between the different countries.  It may well be that science has not reached the stage of arriving at any effective answer. Deputy Dillon spoke about the emulsification of the oil.  That is laborious and applies only to the bigger tankers. The little tankers would not be in a position to do this but then, perhaps, the risk from smaller ships is not as great.</P>
      <P>Enforcement seems to be the main core of the Bill.  If oil is discharged, section 5 gives the right to countries that signed the Convention to enforce the law against anybody responsible for polluting the water within the prohibited zone.  It seems to raise the point as far as we are concerned&mdash;and it is ourselves we are interested in&mdash; first of all, how will we prove who has polluted our waters?  That is a difficult question unless we have sufficient naval patrols or air surveillance. Secondly, how are we to enforce the legislative action we propose to take?  That, too, will be difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing somebody discharges oil in our territorial waters and is guilty of <Col N="1088" /> an infringement of the law.  Supposing those responsible are discovered, how will we enforce this?  It is true there is an international Convention, but there are many problems involved.  First of all, one has to capture the ship, bring it in and make it responsible in the same way as ships which infringe our territorial waters are brought in. Are we competent to do that with three corvettes which can be seen many miles away and which are somewhat limited in speed?  They are, in fact, about the slowest fighting ships afloat.  I see very great difficulties in this and if the Minister has the information, he should inform us how it will be possible to enforce the law and uphold this suggested Convention.  We should all like to know that.  We should be glad to learn that he is in a position to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>We should also have a little more information as to what the oil companies are responsible for exactly. According to the Minister the big tankers will have to carry out this process of pumping out the water and bringing the residual oil into a receiving depot which we, under the international Convention, will afford to the acceding parties to the Convention.  We will have to have certain facilities for these people.  Deputy Dr. Browne rightly said that considerable cost would be involved.  Considerable organisation will be needed.  Of course, the Convention will not become effective overnight.  There is no specific date mentioned.  Certain preparations will be needed.  I presume it will be necessary to have one port as a receiving depot.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  As I said earlier, I do not know if the Minister has had full technical advice on these matters.  The House is entitled to information.  The kernel seems to be that we must provide these facilities for tankers of 20,000 tons and upwards so that they can dispose of the residue.  We should like to know if the Minister knows what exactly the facilities are.  International agencies will be interested in our discussions here in order that they may know exactly how we stand and the way in which we are prepared to fulfil our obligations under this Convention.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think anything that alleviates the situation that has arisen with regard to pollution of our beaches is to be welcomed.  In the past few years, the position has been very bad.  Bird life and fish have suffered. Our tourist industry has been affected.  The position is not as serious here as it is in the United Kingdom.  There the waters are narrower and there is a greater volume of shipping.  At the same time we are confined to a certain extent.  The waters are fairly shallow.  Unless something is done under international law, there will be a considerable deterioration in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems pretty obvious from the discussion that this problem of oil pollution will not be solved in the near future.  It seems equally clear that the cure for this can only be a voluntary cure because it will not be possible to impose penalties over such <Col N="1090" /> a wide area on those guilty of oil pollution, either by accident or by design. The Minister is perfectly correct when he talks about the seriousness of this problem as far as the tourist trade is concerned, and not alone tourists coming from abroad but also trippers who visit the seaside.</P>
      <P>Nothing can be done in a short time.  I wonder has the Minister considered whether it is possible to do something, from the point of view of the tourist industry, to ensure there will be unblemished beaches. Living in a maritime county, I have a fair experience of the local beaches.  I know something about the beaches in other counties as well, and have a fair appreciation of what the problem is.  I have also an appreciation of what the results of pollution are.  It is a worse menace than tar.  It sticks to the soles of children's feet.  It clings to their legs.  People's clothes are destroyed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully has just reminded me that, when word goes around that Laytown beach is polluted, the people shun it.  The same thing happens in Rosslare, Curracloe, Duncannon, Rossmore, Courtown, and all these other places.  It is for that reason I ask the Minister has he ever considered what could be done to rid the beaches of this kind of pollution.  I do not care whether it is done by hand or not.  I am posing the problem to him.  Has the Minister seen this pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are places where the people pick it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not buried deeply in the sand; it is visible.  Would the Minister consider giving a grant from the Vote for tourism to local authorities to help them rid the beaches of this objectionable stuff?  It may be a formidable problem but it should not be an expensive problem because most of the beaches are not very big.  In Tramore there is the accepted section of beach.  The Minister could well consider with local authorities to find out what could be done during the season to keep the beaches free.  The Minister could also co-operate by giving some sort of grant from the <Col N="1091" /> moneys allotted to his Department for the tourist industry.  If word gets round that this pollution is on any of the recognised beaches, people are inclined to shun them, to the detriment of traders, hoteliers and all those who benefit from the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered that problem.  He should not toss it aside, because it is a serious problem.  If an effort by his Department or the local authorities or the expenditure of a not unreasonable amount could do anything to alleviate the problem, it would be well worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome.  We have all seen the damage that can be done to our coasts by oil pollution.  This oil is a thick, sticky mess, just as bad as tar.  A person goes to the seaside for a day's enjoyment and does not want to come back with his clothes destroyed.  It is particularly hazardous for children, who may have to go through it to get to a swimming place.  We all know when we change the oil in a tractor on the farm, the mess that remains on the ground for a long time afterwards.  That is nothing compared with the crude oil from ships.</P>
      <P>I was glad to see that a number of the big companies are experimenting by putting all the waste into one section of the ship and trying to get rid of it in that way.  It is startling to learn that, when a tanker of 30,000 tons cleans its tanks, 120 tons of waste crude oil are discharged.  You can imagine the way that will scatter over a huge area. It is frightening to think of the amount of harm it can do.  At present, the whole trend is towards building bigger tankers.  Therefore, we will have to have legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>We have been lucky here in that over the years we have not had as much pollution as other countries. Anybody who has seen it on our coast will never forget it.  When the oil is on the strands in Meath, people do not come there.  Seemingly, the word gets round very quickly, and there is a loss of income to the hoteliers and other people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The tourist industry is one aspect of this, but an even more important one is the fishing industry.  This oil gets on to the nets and gear of the fishermen and even affects the fish themselves. It puts a complete scum over the sea, so that the feeding and air for the fish are affected.  We all know how difficult it is to wash oil off our hands. You can imagine how hard it must be for the fishermen to wash this stuff off their nets and gear and the amount of detergent they must use.  It gets completely matted up in the nets and must leave them in an awful mess.  The amount of time the fishermen must spend cleaning their nets when they should be at sea earning their livelihood results in a loss of income for them.  In some cases they have to go to other fishing grounds in order to avoid this oil pollution.</P>
    <P>We know that when an accident occurs at sea and a ship is sinking, if there is a discharge of oil, it hinders people in the water trying to get to lifeboats and rafts.  It gets into their mouths and lungs and they cannot swim in it.  I read of people having to try to swim around it in order to have any hope of survival.</P>
    <P>We have all seen pictures of sea birds caught in this oil.  Members of the SPCA have to catch these birds and wash them.  I remember a television programme some years ago in which it was stated, I think, that it is a full week before the birds can go back again.  They are unable to fend for themselves and, if not assisted, simply die off.  Their feathers are stuck together and they cannot preen themselves.  Perhaps sea birds do not bring a lot into the country from the economic point of view, but nevertheless those people are doing a great service by protecting and washing them.  The number of birds they save is small compared with the number lost at sea.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that we have facilities for those ships to discharge their waste oil in Dublin and Whitegate. They have tankers coming in at all times and, when a 30,000 ton tanker can discharge 120 tons of waste crude oil, it is good to see that we have <Col N="1093" /> those facilities in two of our main ports.  The ships can go in there, discharge their cargoes and clean their tanks.  They have to take in salt water as ballast&mdash;otherwise, they would be too high in the water &mdash; and I was pleased to hear that at Whitegate they can clear their tanks, take on seawater as ballast and go on their way to collect a fresh cargo.  Where these facilities do not exist, there is a great temptation to tankers to clear out their tanks at sea where they cannot be seen.  Now they can be doing some of that work in port when they are finishing discharging and the work will not take too long.</P>
    <P>Here we are agreeing to an international Convention that has been delayed for quite a long time.  It is a pity it has taken so long to get in the other countries.  The conference at which the Convention was made was held in 1954 and there were some amendments afterwards.  Ireland is one of the countries affected more than most by what we are doing now, but we hope that these discharges will stop now.  For that reason I welcome this Bill and I am glad to see that some of the tanker companies are experimenting in an effort to find a use for the waste oil so that they will not have to waste much time in discharging it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make only a brief comment on this matter.  I live on the sea coast and perhaps for that reason I have more experience of this matter than most people who have spoken. My house overlooks the sea and the ships coming in and out of the port of Drogheda pass quite close and discharge their crude oil off the coast. This happens all around the year.  In the summer time, not many birds of any kind are affected but in the winter the crude oil so discharged comes in in the seaweed.  In the normal way, most of that would be carried out again by the ebb and flow of the sea but when it comes in in the seaweed, it tends to become covered with sand and in the summer time children building sandcastles dig it up.  Before long the oil which has come in six months earlier has the whole coastline contaminated. <Col N="1094" /> The suggestion of Deputy Corish that a grant be given to local authorities to clean up the oil so brought in is a reasonable one, but prevention is better than cure.</P>
      <P>While the signing of this Convention is a very good idea, I think there is a lot of wishful thinking about it.  It does not achieve very much and unless the necessary number of countries sign it, we will be back in the same position. Much more strenuous efforts will have to be made to prevent pollution of our coast by tankers.  These tankers should be made to discharge their waste oil in port.  It would cost them less.  If the port authorities and the tanker companies co-operated, it should be possible to have these tankers going to sea again without having contaminated the sea or coastline and without any extra cost.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the figure of 120 tons of waste crude oil being discharged into the sea by a 30,000 ton tanker.  I am sure that a nought must have got lost somewhere.  I suggest to the Minister that he should make every effort to get a conclusion on this issue.  If he simply says to the tanker companies that they must not discharge crude oil within a certain area, they will do it at night when they cannot be seen and this can be very expensive for those who are earning their living by the seaside.</P>
      <P>The area from which I come has not been badly contaminated over the past two years but up to that time the situation was appalling.  Tankers discharge oil within a half mile of the coast and that oil ruins the beach for the whole season.  Far more strenuous efforts are necessary to stop this.  The signing of the agreement is all right but I believe it will not do very much to help.  If there has to be unilateral action taken by the Government to stop this, that action must be taken at once.</P>

I understand that ships using Drogheda would be cross-Channel in most cases or near-continental and would not use the persistent oil which is dealt with in this Convention.

      <P>Deputy Dillon asked for the names of the countries which have not yet signed the 1962 Convention.  First of all, I think I can give the names of the countries who do not accept the 1954 Convention and obviously they are not going to go ahead on this occasion. They are: Japan, Russia, China, Brazil, India, Peru, Bulgaria, Portugal, Roumania.  The countries which at the moment have not yet accepted the 1962 amendments&mdash;the fact that they have not yet accepted them does not mean that they will not do so; legislation is probably proceeding as ours is today&mdash;are: Belgium, Finland, West Germany, the United States of America, Iceland, Ireland, Australia, Jordan, The Dominican Republic, Mexico, Spain, Panama.</P>
      <P>There is no reflection cast on these countries.  I am quite certain the vast majority of them will duly subscribe to the Convention.  So that that list does not really signify very much.  As with our country, legislation has to be fitted in whenever it is possible.  I do not think the list is in itself very significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy asked how the zones can be enforced under the Convention. Section 4 of the Bill deals with that and the extension of the present prohibited zones for tankers which is provided for means that the large zones subscribed by the new Article of the Convention will be implemented by me under Ministerial Order, under section 9 subsection (3) of the old Act.  This empowers me to make use of a section <Col N="1096" /> in the old Act to subscribe to Article 3 of the Convention which has been laid on the Table of the House, which everybody can see.</P>
    <P>I cannot describe exactly the 1962 prohibited zone for all ships but there is quite an amount of sea which stretches 1,100 miles to the west of our country and which stretches 400 miles to the north west, 600 miles to the north and 400 miles to the south and south-west.  It is not an exactly uniform pattern.  I have given a rough indication of the mileage limits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne and others asked how this Convention was enforced and the answer is that there are very few prosecutions.  Most of the effect of this Convention is that of moral pressure, getting people to sign an instrument to carry out the terms of the Convention, to keep records. There is no prescribed machinery in the sense of ships that watch other ships, but any ship can report another ship.  If a ship belonging to a member of the Convention is passing a ship and the captain sees a great flow of crude oil in the water, an obvious discharge, he can report it and if the ship can be identified and if the country admits that that ship of its fleet committed an offence, the owner can be fined.  The House knows these international regulations more often have effect through moral pressure than anything else and, as far as I know, there have been very few prosecutions indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that oil is not being discharged or that people are not prosecuting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the situation is slightly better.  So we understand. But, as the Deputy will realise, if two ships pass each other in a prohibited zone and someone on one ship sees a great pool of oil in the water, it is almost impossible to prove that it came from the ship that has passed.  It is very difficult to prove.  There is the problem.  It is the keeping of records by those who sign the Convention and the fact that the records can be seen and inspected by marine surveyors under the various State administrations that is probably the best compulsive <Col N="1097" /> force to try to end this very serious menace to our coasts and to the coasts of other countries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned the fact that 20,000 ton ships that have been built after a certain date may not discharge oil anywhere when this Convention comes into force and asked why could not we extend that provision to existing 20,000 ton ships.  The answer is that it is extremely difficult to get agreement.  Unless I was to read through the minutes of these meetings, which I do not think would get us anywhere, the answer is that the Convention is the result of the efforts that have been made to achieve the possible. It is extraordinarily difficult to secure agreement in regard to these kinds of shipping problems because freight rates in international shipping have been depressed for a number of years as a result of a huge number of old ships still sailing the Seven Seas and a great number of new ships have come into operation.  So, everybody is thinking of perhaps even petty cost to themselves.  It has been difficult to get the perfect instrument.  All I can say is that we are advancing gradually.</P>
      <P>I have already said that facilities exist at Whitegate and Dublin so that I do not have to enforce that part of the Convention which when it comes into operation makes it clear that those who sign the Convention can compel their port authorities to provide these facilities.  We have already got them at Dublin and Whitegate.</P>
      <P>I understand that the waste oil that is finally discharged in the ports can be treated, emulsified or refined in some way, and disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,100,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Pending the enactment of the Transport Act, 1964, and the determination of the subvention payable to CIE in the current financial year, only a token estimate of £10 grant moneys for CIE was provided in the Estimates for my Department for that year.  Section 6 of the Transport Act, 1964, which became law on the 28th July, 1964, provided for payment to CIE in 1964-65 and in each subsequent financial year of a grant of £2 million subject to review in the year 1969-70.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to give effect, in respect of the current financial year, to the decision of the Oireachtas, taken after prolonged debate in both Houses, to pay the £2 million subsidy to CIE and we are dealing here only with the mechanism necessary to give effect to that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made clear during the debate on the Transport Act, 1964, the fixed subsidy of £2 million per annum which will fall to be reviewed after five years has been calculated on a realistic basis after careful examination of the estimates supplied by CIE.  This is the minimum subsidy which, taking the five year period as a whole, CIE <Col N="1099" /> can get by with.  If in any particular year due to exceptionally favourable circumstances losses amount to less than £2 million, the savings will have to be applied to meet higher losses in less favourable years.  Indeed, from previous experience of CIE's financial position, any savings effected will certainly be essential for this purpose. There is absolutely no question of the amount of subsidy being reviewed before 1969-70 and, as this is a very heavy charge on the taxpayer, I trust that the whole staff of the CIE will think in terms of a five year plan for the advancement and the promotion of the Board's business.</P>
    <P>In the Vote for Transport and Power for the current financial year, provision was made for payment of £410,000 by way of Grant-in-Aid to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. to meet administration and general expenses and to provide financial assistance to industries, including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and training of workers.  It is now estimated that the amount of Grant-in-Aid required for the year will be £480,000 and, accordingly, a supplementary grant of £70,000 is needed to enable the company to meet their obligations up to 31st March, 1965.</P>
    <P>The provision of £410,000 was made up of £200,000 for running expenses and £295,000 for grants to industries, less £85,000 net income from revenue earning activities.  The additional sum of £70,000 now sought is to cover an anticipated increase from £295,000 to £330,000 in the amount of grants likely to be paid to industrialists and an expected reduction of about £35,000 in net income.  The reduction in income is attributable mainly to the income from factory rents being less than anticipated, due to buildings not becoming available as early as expected.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to review the activities of the Development Company as Deputies will shortly be afforded an opportunity for a full debate on the affairs of the company when legislation at present being prepared is introduced <Col N="1100" /> to raise the statutory limits on investment in the company.  I might say, however, that the rate of progress by the company continues to be very satisfactory as is evidenced by the fact that employment is now about 2,700, having increased by 700 in the past year, and also by the expansion of existing firms and the continued interest of further firms in setting up at Shannon.</P>
    <P>An additional £250,000 is also required to meet salaries, wages and allowances increases in the Department. The amount is in the main due to the ninth round increase and brings the total expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances to £1,280,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>The total amount required for CIE, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. and for salaries, wages etc. is £2,319,990, but it has been found possible to set off against this sum savings of £219,990 in my Department's Vote, leaving the net sum required at £2,100,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate, so far as the annual subsidy to CIE is concerned, is based on a more realistic assessment of the financial position of CIE than that which operated prior to the decision taken last year.  Most of us who have had experience of dealing with the financial problems of CIE over many years recognised, with all the experience that had been gained over the years, that it was unrealistic and nonsensical to imagine that CIE could have got to the position of operating without a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision which was taken last year recognised the inevitable.  From the point of view of taxpayers and the responsibility which the House has of voting money to subsidise public transport, it has been a pretty melancholy record, but we must accept that very considerable losses will occur and that occasionally there may be a brief period, as happened in some cases for even a period of as long as a year when certain improvements were effected and it was possible to work <Col N="1101" /> without the same subsidy as has generally been the pattern over many years. My recollection is that the subsidy for CIE has varied for the past ten or 15 years between £1 million and £2 million. As I say, it varies up or down but, by and large, the pattern is the same.  If costs rise, either because of adjustments in wages or salaries or adjustments in the cost of fuel or other changes of that sort, the loss will vary within the wide limits mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether the arrangements made in relation to labour relations in CIE are satisfactory.  Over a number of years, certain aspects of staff relations, such as the adjustment of wages and salaries, or in regard to conditions, gave rise to recurrent problems and certain investigations were undertaken with a view to evolving a more satisfactory system.  Some of these problems were confined to certain grades and were not common to the whole range of personnel, but nevertheless the problems of those persons did give rise to concern and from time to time caused friction which reacted badly on the whole atmosphere and indeed had repercussions outside the particular groups or sections involved.</P>
    <P>A great number of retired CIE personnel have not yet had their super-annuation award made by the arbitrator and very considerable delays have occurred in dealing with cases.  I should like to know whether it would be possible to expedite decisions in outstanding cases.  Cases of hardship have occurred because the award has not been made.  Individuals who have retired have not been in a position to commute in favour of their wives where they wished to do so.  In some cases some of the personnel have died before an award was made and consequently they were unable to make the commutation which some of them might have made.  A serious effort should be made to ensure that all possible steps are taken to expedite the superannuation award in regard to retired CIE employees.  These people, who have given a lifetime of service and whose record in whatever classification <Col N="1102" /> was allotted to them was satisfactory, feel very much aggrieved that the award has not been made.</P>
    <P>The fact that this subsidy is necessary means that the people are entitled to the best possible service which can be provided for them.  While in general the services are satisfactory, there are certain aspects here and there which require certain improvements.  For instance, in some cases the heating of trains leaves a good deal to be desired. Very often passengers are told that the heating system is not working as it should be, or perhaps they travel over a certain mileage of their journey before it heats up adequately.  Care should be taken to ensure that the heating system operates properly.  The provision of bus shelters at places where some form of alternative shelter is not available should be undertaken quickly wherever stops are provided. Quite a number of places in my constituency require shelters and that is true of many other parts of the country. Care should also be taken to ensure where shelters are erected, particularly in housing estates, that the surrounds to them are either of concrete or macadam so that people will not be standing in the wet or mud at the bus stop.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I believe is being examined by CIE but in this regard I believe that if such investigations were carried out before changes were made, it would avoid inconvenience to people.  Since the one-way street system was extended in Dublin, people travelling on the Nos. 6, 7, and 8 buses from Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Sallynoggin and Blackrock to the city, and who wish to go to Grafton Street, Dame Street or that portion of the city for business or shopping purposes, find that the nearest point to alight from their bus is Clare Street.  That is a very considerable distance, particularly for elderly people or people trying to get to work on time.</P>
    <P>I understand from CIE that an investigation is being made to see if they can provide some alternative routes for some buses in order to facilitate people.  If some attention had been devoted to this by CIE, in conjunction <Col N="1103" /> with the Garda authorities, before the changes were made, it might have been possible to ensure that as little inconvenience as possible was caused to the people and adequate care could have been taken to provide a service to enable people to get to work without having to walk long distances, which is difficult enough at any time but particularly so in inclement weather.  Subject to these remarks, we approve of the Estimate in respect of CIE.</P>
    <P>In respect of that portion of the Supplementary Estimate relating to the Shannon Free Airport, I notice that there was an improvement in the numbers employed there in the past year. During the past few weeks a report appeared in the Press indicating that a firm at Shannon had closed down.  I should like to hear from the Minister the circumstances in which the firm went out of production, because I think it is of general interest to note that there has been an improvement in the numbers employed.  There may be some explanation in regard to that firm.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has said, this measure was subject to long debate during the passage of the 1964 Act when the whole question of the type of services to be provided was discussed.  The Minister was a great believer in the idea that the company might break even and held on to that belief for a very long time, in spite of our repeated assurances that it was most unlikely the company would break even.  Now, the Minister has obviously been faced with the profit and loss account of the public transport service and this bill amounts to a further subsidy of £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One gets the impression from the Minister's speech that even yet he seems to feel that merely by repeating something sufficiently frequently he can make it become a fact.  He says there is absolutely no question of the amount of the subsidy being reviewed before 1969-70.  I do not know why he bothered to put that into his speech. We must assume that the company will be operated in such a way that it will be run efficiently but there are factors which might arise and involve unexpected <Col N="1104" /> expenditure.  In such circumstances somebody must foot the bill and, of course, the taxpayer will be called on to do it.</P>
    <P>If the state of the country were allowed to continue to progress towards further price increases and for that reason there must be increases in wages, then clearly a situation could arise in which the present subsidy might become inadequate.  I have been surprised in the past by the Minister and many of his predecessors, by their incredulous amazement when, in the Labour Court and elsewhere, there were protests that it was impossible to give certain wage increases because the company could not afford them, being bound within certain limits of expenditure.  But the Minister and his predecessors seemed to live in a completely separate world as Ministers for Transport and Power and Ministers of Governments who, by allowing the cost of living to go up, made wage demands inevitable and thus increased the operating costs of the public transport system.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any reason to say here that there can be no question of the subsidy being reviewed. He might feel it desirable it should not be reveiwed but I do not see how he can be in any way certain it will not be reviewed.  The trouble is, of course &mdash; and to some extent I can see the Minister's difficulty when talking of a service of this kind &mdash; the promise of unlimited subsidy leads to the likelihood that there will be unlimited demand on such a subsidy if a ceiling is not put on it.  The Minister's attitude is that there will be unlimited demand.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that is an implied vote of no confidence, an implication of no confidence in the people who have been put in charge of CIE.  If he believes they will run the company in such an inefficient way as to involve unnecessary expenditure, then clearly the wrong people are in control of CIE. It should be simply possible for us to put people in control of a company and say: &ldquo;Run it as efficiently as you possibly can.&rdquo;  Then one would have to agree to pay the bill because the basic point is that this is a public <Col N="1105" /> utility and in certain circumstances it must lose money inevitably and one must accept that, provided an efficient service is operated.</P>
    <P>Here we are having the worst of both worlds.  We are getting an indifferent service in some places and a bad service in others.  Occasionally, one comes across a good service.  I remember the Minister once saying that he travelled by public transport on one or possibly two occasions.  It might not be a bad idea if he used the bus services, and if the members of the company used them.  They would find out how inadequate they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I must confess I do not use the buses very much but I have watched people in queues during the peak hours from 5 to 7 p.m.  The reason I do not use the buses is that I live in a place, Enniskerry, from which it takes an hour to do the 12 miles to Dublin and I have not got the time.  One sees very large queues in this type of weather.  We know from the timetable that there has been a curtailment of services.  That is why I say we are having the worst of both worlds.  We are paying a heavy subsidy, as this certainly is, and having a considerable curtailment of services.</P>
      <P>The main objection I took last year was to the curtailment of rail services &mdash;a very big one on the southern line from Greystones and Bray up &mdash; while at the same time, there was no attempt by the Government or the Minister to co-ordinate the offload of traffic from the railways to the congested and in many cases very bad roads.  As the Minister said the other night, in Trinity College, I think, it will be many years before we have arterial roads capable of taking high speed transport.  That is true; yet we have closed down rail services which were safe and expeditious, and thrown a tremendous added burden on the roads, increasing greatly all sorts of traffic hazards and congestion of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government decided to close <Col N="1106" /> down the railways, they should have co-ordinated policy: they should have created an arterial road system.  That would have been an intelligent reappraisal of our transport policy.  They saved on the railways and at the same time saved on the roads.  The saving came because they did not build the alternative transport amenities in the form of roads capable of carrying a fast bus service.  So the savings on the railways were completely illusory because there was no alternative service or certainly an inefficient alternative road service.  That has been the trouble the whole time in regard to public transport.</P>
    <P>I am not underestimating the complications of the transport problem we have to face.  At the same time it is a problem which requires very much deeper thought, less superficial thought, than we appear to have given it over the years.  We had, as I say, the false economy of closing the railways and diverting traffic on to roads which were never intended to carry that traffic. One of the strangest disabilities in the CIE management was in their approach.  They had relatively undeveloped freight transport facilities and amenities and they went out and inaugurated a most intensive propaganda drive to get people to use these freight services.  They were moderately successful.  Certainly the prices were reasonable.  The strange thing is there did not appear to be any conviction that they could prevail on the public to use the rail passenger services.  They seemed to take a decision that these could not be improved.  A sufficiently frequent rail service could not be provided.  There was no question of a particular type of train of a particular size, to be followed by a propaganda campaign to encourage people to use the service.  They did not seem to have any conviction that a passenger service could be developed in the same way as they had developed the freight service as a result of an intensive propaganda drive.</P>
    <P>People have become so despairing of the CIE services that there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of personal transport on our roads. This has led to a proliferation of <Col N="1107" /> vehicles of all kinds, shapes and sizes, adding to the extraordinary congestion already on our roads, roads which were not designed to take the density of traffic now on them.  This has all been most unfair as far as the public are concerned because the people are asked to provide taxation for a service they do not get.  As Deputy Cosgrave said, they are asked to provide taxation for an inefficient service and, in addition to paying that taxation, they have to provide their own private transport.  Most Deputies know that in the suburbs, like Ballyfermot, Finglas, Coolock and in my county, Wicklow, the general practice now is for three or four people to get together and buy some sort of car. They ignore the fact that there is a public transport service.  They cannot depend on it.  It is not there when they want it, to say nothing of the cost being far too high.  They find that it is cheaper on the whole for them to club together, buy a car and share the running expenses.  Whether or not that is legal is immaterial.  The practice is very widespread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Workers of various kinds also find it cheaper to hire taxis and share the expenses.  The Chairman of CIE may be very content with the widespread hatchet work he has done over the years in curtailing services, to say nothing of increasing fares.  As far as I am concerned, he has been a complete failure in what should have been his primary objective, namely, the provision of efficient, reasonably-priced transport services for the public. Because of that failure, we are now faced with a very big subsidy which could, as time goes on, become an even bigger subsidy, because of the continuing decreasing use of the transport services.  It will be a question of diminishing returns.  As they are used less and less, the overheads will remain constant.</P>
    <P>The primary costs will not change very much.  Shutting down a station here and there is relatively unimportant from the point of view of cost.  The decreasing use of the service will mean that indirectly the demands on the taxpayer <Col N="1108" /> in the form of a subsidy will increase. An optimum use of the services might mean that one could maintain a particular level of subsidy.  If money values remain constant, it might be possible to reduce the amount of subsidy required.  As I say, we are getting the worst of both worlds.  We are paying in taxation and getting a bad service in return.</P>
    <P>The other disappointing feature from the point of view of the public is the fact that high fares take a sizeable bite out of a man's income, particularly if he has to pay fares for himself to reach his place of employment, for his children to attend school and for his wife to go shopping.  In addition to that, he will now have to pay some part of this £2 million in indirect taxation.  This change from direct to indirect taxation is just one more of the unfairnesses of this Government.  A burden which should be carried by the wealthier sections of the community has to be borne virtually entirely by the ordinary travelling public.  They are hit every way.  If they travel by bus, they have to pay high fares, getting in return a very indifferent service.  In addition to that, those who find they cannot use the service have to provide their own transport as well as pay taxation for one they do not use.</P>
    <P>Judging by the Minister's speech, unless he thumps the table, as it were, and tells the Chairman there is absolutely no question of subsidy, he will not get the services run as economically as they could be run; that seems to me to show a lack of confidence in the Chairman's ability because, presumably, he is running the services as cheaply as it is possible to run them. The Minister is not, of course, master of the situation at all because, a sufficient measure of inflation in the next five years, and that promise would not be worth the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>Before there is a complete dismantling of the rail services, I hope there will be some re-thinking by the Minister on the whole question of our transport services.  He should not feel committed to any decisions that have been taken in the past because obviously changes are taking place all the time.  There are countries in which <Col N="1109" /> they are deciding to re-introduce rail services of one kind or another.  It would be worthwhile, before taking a final decision, to consider the whole position.  If there are to be further curtailment and restriction, there is a moral obligation on the Government to consider the alternative they must face.  The alternative is a very costly arterial road programme.</P>
    <P>The present position is frightening. There are these huge industrial pantechnicons rumbling along the roads, making the position of the private motorist very hazardous indeed.  Firms are carrying their own goods over roads which were never built to take this traffic.  Consequently, there are great increases in the traffic risks of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I do not know which of us will be here in 1970, but it would not surprise me, if we carry on as we are going with the rather unimaginative policy for public transport being pursued at present, if there were increasing costs, not only the inflationary ones we have been talking about, but increasing costs due to decreasing usage of the public transport service.  Because of the relative inadequacy and inefficiency, the Minister will find himself increasing his demands on this House for greater and greater subsidies and we will have no alternatives but to pay them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised some matters to which I should like to reply.  In relation to the time taken in dealing with arbitration cases for redundancy pay, there have been some delays.  I am exerting all the pressure possible to expedite matters in this regard.</P>
      <P>The heating in CIE trains is improving.  Arrangements have been made to have terminal pre-heating apparatus, so that the trains will be warmed up at the beginning of the day before the passengers arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that a great effort has been made to see that the very best possible labour relations exist.  Of course, this depends partly on the development of the group union principle for negotiations.  There are a <Col N="1110" /> great number of joint consultative councils within CIE, where matters are discussed at local level, suggestions for improving the service made, and matters discussed in relation to wages, conditions and so forth.  I hope the system is resulting in a better understanding of all the problems involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the difficulties about stopping places on bus routes 6, 7 and 8 in Dublin.  I understand CIE has been looking into complaints about this.  CIE bus services are to a very considerable degree under the authority of the Garda Síochána. They have to follow street traffic regulations in connection with the movement of buses in that area.  It is not always the responsibility of CIE if things are not as perfect as they can be.  It relates to what needs to be done to try and minimise the congestion of traffic in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with Deputy Dr. Browne in everything he said about CIE, and I do not see any point in entering into an argument with him about it.  He completely misunderstands the functions of CIE.  He knows nothing about it whatever.  In actual fact there is no company which is doing more on a modern basis to analyse traffic needs, to ascertain traffic needs, to conduct surveys of traffic needs, to carry out an analysis of tickets bought and destinations of passengers.  Surveys of every description are being carried out by the present administration of CIE.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting them for the very advanced work they are doing, particularly in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I disagree absolutely with Deputy Dr. Browne that CIE are trying to run down the services, to provide too thin a service, and, as a result, there may be need for a still larger future Government subvention.  In connection with the Dublin bus service, the Deputy evidently has not read any of the things CIE and I have said, and which nobody has seriously contested, that the problem in Dublin is caused by bunching and traffic congestion.  No matter how many buses you put on, if you start them at intervals of three minutes seven miles from Dublin, by <Col N="1111" /> the time they get through the centre of Dublin they have been bunched by traffic congestion.  That is happening in this and every other country.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy should know, the fact is that CIE have installed a radio car inspector control system in an effort to try and minimise the problem as much as possible and to modify the flow of buses, at peak periods.  When any particular situation arises, they can turn buses around, if that can have some good result.  But the position is going to become worse and worse unless Dublin Corporation solve the Dublin traffic problem. Merely putting on more buses, which would be completely idle for most of the day, is no solution and will only result in more buses being bunched together.</P>
    <P>CIE do advertise the rail passenger service.  There are rather clever advertisements around the country suggesting it is more comfortable to go by CIE train.  I have encouraged them to do more imaginative advertising for the railway.  I will go that far with Deputy Dr. Browne.  I do not think they do sufficient imaginative advertising in the newspapers, but they certainly do a great deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>People are buying private cars everywhere as well as here.  Every country in the world is facing the problem of private car transport competing with public transport. This country is one of the least densely populated countries in Europe. The number of scattered house-holds and people here who do not reside in hamlets, villages or small towns is almost a European record, I think, with Sweden.  This presents a particular problem for public transport companies.  The same is not true in France, where a very great proportion of the community live in villages. The position is different here, partly because of our appalling history and partly because of other social differences. The problem of transport here, therefore, is much more difficult. <Col N="1112" /> Even the present reduced mileage of CIE railway, if you calculate it as a percentage of national income, is still very high.  Even though we cut off 621 miles of railway, it is still extremely high by European standards.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne said we did not have a co-ordinated system of transport when the railways closed down. The answer to that is, first, the improvement grants to the main roads in those areas were subsequently increased. Special once-and-for all grants were made available by the Minister for Local Government which helped to improve the roads where railways were closed.  Secondly, by almost any definition applied by almost any country in the world, the railways closed were carrying so little traffic that they would not enter into the marginal considerations which, for example, operated in England, where Dr. Beeching's proposals have been examined by the previous Government and by the Labour Government and where the present Minister for Transport is deciding whether lines should be closed or left open.  The lines we closed were in the lowest category of utilisation, where the provision of a road service was more suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been over all that before, and I am surprised anybody would raise it now.  The proof of all that lies in the fact that for 621 miles of railroad and 218 stations closed during the period of the 1958 Act, if I remember rightly, it required a substitution of something like 52 buses and just over 50 lorries, a number of which were already in the service of CIE and were simply utilised to a greater degree.  A number of other lorries were required for particular seasons.  The railway which operates on the basis of requiring so few substitute road vehicles is in the very lowest class of utilisation and does not come into the class where there would have been quite serious questions raised, and rightly, in regard to whether a railway should close on the grounds that, 50 years from now, the people would be very glad to have the railway because of intense congestion close to some cities, as in the case of certain British railways.  The railway <Col N="1113" /> services that were closed down here were not of that kind.</P>
    <P>I examined the cost of the bus fares in the CIE city services and I do not think the average cost per passengermile of 2.3d. is excessive by European standards in general.  Another Deputy suggested that the Dublin city services were making an excessive profit.  Their profit at a recent date was one-seventh of a penny per journey and I could not regard that as excessive.</P>

      <P>Deputies who have complaints about bus or freight services will find that the CIE area managers are very good at investigating and answering complaints.  I have few complaints with regard to that.  A very exhaustive survey is taking place in Dublin in relation to the railway and bus services with the object of effecting most substantial improvements. One part of that survey has already been completed and as a result of the overhaul of the Ballyfermot bus services, the people are very satisfied with the changes that have taken place. Where it is practicable, CIE issue forms to passengers asking them for information about the kind of bus services they would like.  That has been done in Cork, Limerick and, I think, in Waterford.  In each of these cities, the changes made as a result were most <Col N="1114" /> satisfactory.  I thank the House for the way they have accepted the Estimate.</P>
