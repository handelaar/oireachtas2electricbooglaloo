      <P>We approve of the Budget for what it does in a positive way, even though on a limited basis.  It provides improved pensions for old age pensioners, widows and orphans and other social welfare recipients. Though it is not clear in some ways, these may be offset by reductions in home assistance payments.  I hope steps will be taken to ensure this does not happen.</P>
      <P>The Budget also provides some improvements in the pensions of retired State pensioners such as the Army, Garda, teachers, <i>et cetera</i>.  Leaving aside these benefits, it is important to consider what the Budget does not do or how it may affect the economy generally.  The picture last year, while showing some improvements in the economy generally, indicated a slowing down in the rate of expansion.  The most notable features in that respect were the slowing down in the rate of employment and the reduction in the latter quarter of that year in the rate of industrial expansion.</P>
      <P>To examine first of all the numbers in employment, particulars are given in the <i>Economic Statistics</i> at Table XV, and according to that Table, it would appear that the total numbers at work in 1964 amounted to 1,059,000.  This compares with a figure of 1,084,000 in 1957 and 1,125,000 in 1956 but, to come to a more recent figure, it would seem that the 1964 figure is now approximately at the 1959 level, that is four years earlier, of 1,060,000.</P>
      <P>The National Industrial Economic Council in their comments in the Department of Finance Review, adverted to this fact and suggested that certain steps should be taken in order to achieve a faster growth in employment under four headings.  Firstly, they suggest we should lay greater emphasis on the establishment and expansion of employment in intensive growth industries, especially those employing workers with a higher level of skills such as electronics and engineering.  I do not know whether to any extent that would require to be modified in the light of recent experience in the GEC, as far as action of that sort is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Their second suggestion, in part to facilitate the first, is:</P>
    <P>The speedy implementation of a manpower policy so that shortages of particular skills or shortages of labour in particular areas can be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Their third recommendation is:</P>
    <P>By raising public investment, though we recognise that in the light of the present high and buoyant demand of pressure on resources in building and construction and in the rapid increase in public investment in recent years the scope for doing so at this stage may be limited.</P>
    <P>Their fourth comment reads:</P>
    <P>By using some part of the actual increase in production to reduce prices and thus make possible an expansion in sales and open up new employment opportunities.  If the full benefits of rising productivity accrue directly to the factor of production rather than indirectly by way of lower prices, there is not likely to be a sufficiently large increase in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>They are four headings under which this body, which made a careful and critical analysis and, arising out of that analysis, give what I assume was their considered assessment of what would be necessary in order to step up or at any rate to prevent a slowing down in the economic position.  In that connection it is important to examine what has happened and to try to see to what extent certain factors have contributed to the changes that have occurred or to the lack of growth.</P>
    <P>In the Second Programme publication, which gives very full data about various developments, reference is made to the fact that the total expenditure in respect of industry, the capital expenditure, for last year fell short on the amount which was originally programmed.  It refers at paragraph 308 to the total expenditure covered by a number of industrial grants and capital issues and states that it amounted to a total of £6.85 millions compared with a programmes estimate of £9.16 millions.  Similarly <Col N="1280" /> in connection with housing&mdash;although I will refer to that later&mdash;the estimates as laid down in the capital Budget last year showed that the target was not reached.  That again may have been due to some extent to the effect of the building strike, but the targets estimated fell short by over £1 million.</P>
    <P>In connection with the manpower policy programme which has been announced, it seems to me that there is one very big problem which might be the subject of an examination by that section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This is the continuous drift from rural employment, particularly in the West and congested areas where emigration is still a big problem, and also the fact that in the eastern portion of the country and the midlands, many farmers&mdash; although they are willing to pay not merely the standard agricultural rate but in some cases above the minimum laid down&mdash;cannot get skilled agricultural labour.  There seems to be an opportunity for an investigation in order to achieve an improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>A great number of small farmers' sons and persons on holdings in the West and other congested areas who seek employment and who have experience of farm work, would obviously prefer to get work in their own area or if that is not possible, in some other part of the country, rather than have to seek it abroad.  I believe something could be done by the manpower investigation to bring these together. They might provide some opportunities for increased employment as well as providing an essential skill which is of a rare, and in many respects a unique kind, a skilled agricultural worker on whose exertions, knowledge and experience future agricultural production and output must to a very great extent depend.</P>
    <P>One of the matters referred to by the Minister in the course of his speech and also by the National Industrial Economic Council was the continuing high rate of emigration.  It would appear from the figures published, as well as from the Minister's statement, that the emigration rate is running at around 25,000 a year.  I do not in any way wish <Col N="1281" /> to exaggerate this.  To some extent there has been an improvement compared with other years but it is difficult to reconcile the British employment permits granted for the first time to Irish people seeking work in England which would appear to indicate a higher figure than the 25,000 a year, which is the figure which appears to be generally accepted.  Unemployment is still high and, of course, some of those on the register are obviously unemployable, but a great many of them seek employment either in their own areas or in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The data which have been published indicate that last year, in the latter quarters, the export expansion appeared to be declining.  It would appear from the first three months of this year that that tendency has continued. Coupled with that, the volume of production of manufacturing industries for 1963-64 to base 1953, shows a significant drop in the third and fourth quarters.  The first two quarters showed a satisfactory rise compared with the first two quarters of 1963.  The first quarter showed a rise of 11.1 per cent and the second quarter a rise of 13.2 per cent.  The third quarter dropped to a rise of 8.7 per cent and in the fourth the rise was 6.6 per cent.  It is possible that to some extent the last quarter was affected by the introduction of the British levy and to some extent by apprehension at the probable effect rather than the actual consequences of it.</P>
    <P>Very considerable sums have been spent in recent years in encouraging industrial expansion and it may be that the time has arrived when we ought have a more critical examination of the system of providing incentives for industry.  The schemes for giving direct grants and subsidies to industries were initially introduced by the Industrial Grants Act in 1956.  Those grants were introduced to meet an urgent need at the time.  It was generally recognised that only by some form of unusual incentive, either by way of direct grant or by what might be described as a subsidy, could the development programme be given that necessary incentive and there was a general recognition that the prospects of a satisfactory <Col N="1282" /> industrial expansion depended not merely on the skill and knowledge of our own people but also on the attraction here of outside interests with capital and know-how.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Industrial Grants Act, and the tax remission on exports, very considerable expansion of industry was achieved and within a very short time, to such an extent&mdash;and I have referred on many occasions to the remarks of Professor Carter of Queen's University&mdash;that he believes that the biggest technical factor in industrial expansion and in increasing industrial exports was the tax remission. That has been the subject of comment in the Second Programme and reference has been made to the extent to which the Industrial Development Authority and the other bodies charged with the responsibility for grants as well as for investigating the possibilities of new industries and providing markets, have contributed.</P>
    <P>That situation now appears in some respects to be changing.  There is, on the one hand, a much greater confidence that some of the economic problems which confronted the country were not insoluble and that the country could be developed and made more prosperous.  External interest also increased and there has been a recognition and a realisation that this country offers worth-while possibilities as a place where stable economic and political conditions existed and where there was a readily available pool of labour, adaptable and capable of being trained, with natural abilities and skills, capable of being moulded in any direction necessary.  It was appreciated that close to this country we had a market which presented no difficulties and to which, by and large, there was free entry and where a common language existed, from the point of view of trading arrangements.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the system of providing industrial grants achieved a very considerable expansion but it appears that situation is changing to some extent, that some of the firms that have established either separate companies here or branches of the parent company, <Col N="1283" /> with increasing competitiveness in Britain and on the Continent, now find these marginal or fringe portions of their undertakings either no longer necessary or, because of the increasing competitiveness and transport and other charges, no longer capable of being worked on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>While this industrial grants system has attracted and has proved attractive to foreign investors, there are certain ways in which it may be harmful and to that extent it is now time to examine in a critical way not merely those that have been established but certainly any new undertakings that may be contemplated for this reason, among others: the fact that a number of these industries acquire machinery and materials outside the State and that while they are established here, a great deal of their machinery and equipment is bought elsewhere with little practical benefit to the economy, whereas, in contrast, investment might be directed more towards a very substantial increase in educational opportunities as well as in those industries that are based here on home production and the prospects of raw materials being available from home sources.</P>
    <P>In addition, the extent to which the capital programme involves heavy capital commitments means that the State incentive to establish these industries should be directed towards permanence rather than the mere purpose of providing a temporary relief in unemployment, although that is obviously desirable.  One of the attractive opportunities which the country can provide is that we have in the main, compared with other countries, relatively low transport charges and relatively low power costs and an available pool of workers.</P>
    <P>To what extent the increased tax on petrol will affect transport charges it is difficult to say.  Certainly, so far as CIE and large freight undertakings are concerns they are mainly run on diesel or other hydrocarbon oils not affected by the Budget proposals but a great number of smaller concerns, <Col N="1284" /> leaving aside the distributive trade which is almost entirely run on petrol-driven vans and lorries will be affected by it and consequently will have to bear increased transport costs.</P>
    <P>The extent to which it will in future be possible to attract here other industrial concerns and enhance prospects of future industrial expansion must, to a great extent, depend on our ability to get into the British market and on the consequences which the present levy may have, not so much on the immediate concerns but on the extent to which it may affect the faith and confidence which industrialists have, and which foreign enterprise has, in our economic prospects particularly in the export market.</P>
    <P>I believe we must continue to press, and I hope the Government will continue to do so, for a change in the present levy arrangements.  I know it has been announced that it is proposed to repeal the levy as soon as possible and that one reduction of five per cent has been made.  We recognise the fact that it would be difficult for Britain, with her EFTA arrangements as well as her arrangements with other trade groups, to make an exception of this country, but it is significant that in the circumstances in which levies had to be imposed some years ago, we made a specific exemption and gave preferential treatment in accordance with our trade agreements with Britain to goods imported from Britain.  On this occasion no such exemption or exception was made in our case.  I know representations were made at the time but this is a matter we should continue to press because it may have a reaction on the extent to which this country can be regarded as a safe base from which to export, a position which, up to now, gave us very considerable preferential advantages compared with other countries and particularly compared with countries that had a pattern of trade and especially of trade with Britain.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that it is important for us to ensure that in future whatever industrial grants are provided should be provided in cases of exceptional national importance as part <Col N="1285" /> of a co-ordinated plan of national development where particular projects, although economically possible for maybe a temporary period, are clearly beyond the scope of private enterprise or where it is obvious that private enterprise is incapable of carrying them out or unable to do so.  These industrial grants should be directed to the extent that we should exploit wherever possible the processing of agricultural products and the utilisation of materials which are readily available.</P>
    <P>I know that there has been one very considerable effort made in that direction by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and although many initial difficulties had to be overcome and I think it is true to say that a number of them have not yet been satisfactorily surmounted, there is a belief based on the confidence which that organisation has shown and the skill and ability of the personnel concerned, that, although they are endeavouring to break into a sphere of activity for which others are already highly geared elsewhere and are competing with companies that are long and well established, nevertheless, if they once make a breakthrough, it will be possible for them to expand considerably. For that reason it is more than ever important that we should impress on the British authorities the effect which the breach of the Trade Agreement has had on our trading position as well as on our future prospects.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Taoiseach will be in a position to say at this stage what general changes, if any, he envisages in our trading arrangements and whether any developments have occured in connection with our application to join the EEC. As I understand it, the application is still in a state of suspension and although there have been some discussions between EFTA and the EEC the position is still rather fluid.  By way of parliamentary question recently I asked whether it would be possible to consider, as distinct from membership, which may well be postponed for some time, a trade agreement with the European Economic Community.  I <Col N="1286" /> understand that the possibility of trade agreements has been the subject of consideration by the Community and it may afford us some temporary arrangement which would act as an interim solution of the difficulties until the ultimate membership problem is resolved.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in present circumstances to be precise or definite about what approach we should adopt to trade matters and difficult to be firm in one direction or another but there has been the recent experience of the effect of the British levy.  While it was possible, by considerable exertion on the part of a number of industrialists and because of the fact that the State was prepared to meet 50 per cent of the effect of the levy, to prevent any serious dislocation, nevertheless, we have the experience here that a number of low cost imports are still possible in certain categories.  At the same time, our manufacturers are expected to compete with industrialists and manufacturers elsewhere who have available to them raw materials at a lower price and have access to the British market without having to bear the effect of the levy.</P>
    <P>I believe that some consideration should be given to the prospect of concerted action by this country and other countries, say, members of the Council of Europe or other European countries that are, like ourselves, anxious to join the EEC, so that some concerted or united effort might be made to achieve either more stable trading arrangements or a trade arrangement with the EEC.</P>
    <P>The position so far as trade is concerned would indicate that the drop in the value of our exports for the first three months of this year is a warning that we cannot be complacent about this or cannot be satisfied with the present position.  For that reason I believe some concerted and united effort should be made both by ourselves and by any other countries with which we can secure common ground in this matter.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the question of housing.  As I said earlier, the Government programme of housing falls far <Col N="1287" /> short of the need, even of the limited target which was announced in the White Paper, <i>Housing Progress and Prospects</i>, published last year by the Department of Local Government.  In that White Paper it was estimated that between 12,000 and 13,000 houses a year would be required to meet the demand.  For the year ended 31st March, 1964, the numbers completed amounted to about half that figure, about 7,500.  The capital programme which was announced in the Capital Budget last year showed that £1.28 million less was spent than was originally provided for.  As I mentioned earlier, the figure may have been affected by the building strike.  While it is true that the Capital Budget this year proposes an increase in expenditure of £4.25 million, there is a very heavy backlog to be overtaken and the progress of our time in Government has not been maintained although at that time we did not consider it adequate and we were certainly criticised, not merely in the House but outside it, for the fact that more houses were not being built.</P>
    <P>This is primarily an urban problem. It is to a very considerable extent a problem affecting Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and other cities but even leaving the cities aside there are great rural areas where new houses and reconstruction are necessary.  In the main, however, the real housing problem is in the cities.  For that reason I believe that a much more imaginative approach is necessary and that it ought to be possible for the local authorities to plan on a different basis.</P>
    <P>In the past, the arrangements for housing, so far as I understand it, have been that there was a waiting list of persons who made application; that periodically the local authorities concerned, whether corporations or county councils, made a survey and planned a certain number of houses.  So far as I am aware, there is no carefully worked-out programme of a certain number of houses each year.  The Dublin Corporation may have a limited plan over an extended period but in regard to the other local authorities there is no long-term planning.  The basis on which <Col N="1288" /> housing programmes are carried out is on an examination of the waiting lists and an effort being made by the authority to acquire sites, very often on a short-term basis.  That situation is entirely altered so far as a number of local authorities are concerned because sites are no longer readily available. Certainly in regard to Dublin and a number of other urban authorities it is impossible to acquire sites.  I know from my own constituency in Dún Laoghaire and the Rathdown part of it under the jurisdiction of the Dublin County Council, the possibility of sites being available within reasonable proximity is now out of consideration. They must go much further out and that involves a great deal of consequential planning, both physical and technical planning which makes it difficult in many cases to provide houses quickly or in proximity to places of employment.  It is not sufficient, therefore, to put a figure in the Capital Budget or in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance that when these targets are agreed they must be adhered to.  In fact, putting figures into the Capital Budget and then falling short of them is progress in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in connection with hospitals and the health scheme, the hospitals construction target that was laid down fell short of the figure proposed.  The target for last year was £2.9 million but only £1.8 million was spent, a drop of £1.1 million. This year, according to the Capital Budget, it is proposed to spend only £1.7 million, which is less than the amount spent last year and less than the target that was announced by the Government in the Capital Budget last year.  If the targets as originally set were arrived at after full and careful examination of the needs and requirements&mdash;and we can only assume they were&mdash;then there is something wrong. Either the targets have had to be hastily revised or the commitments elsewhere make it necessary to cut back on them.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is worth emphasising&mdash;although it does not directly affect local authority housing except possibly to a very slight degree <Col N="1289" />&mdash;that there is at present, particularly in the city of Dublin, a definite credit squeeze on housing loans.  A number of building societies have announced or have indicated to their borrowers that they will not provide loans for houses in excess of a certain price. That has consequential disadvantages. It puts out of the category the applications of persons who would normally apply for those loans; they in turn apply under the Small Dwellings Act and force persons who are possible Small Dwellings loan applicants to seek accommodation from the Corporation which is already overburdened and incapable of dealing with their own applications.</P>
    <P>Some examination of the present credit position is urgently required.  I know it is not within the competence of the Government to decide entirely the credit position.  We are affected by conditions in Britain and, according to a newspaper report today, it would appear that the restriction of credit there is having repercussions here.  It is always recognised that a credit squeeze in Britain will sooner or later have effects here.  I notice from another newspaper report today that the proposed hatchery in Bandon, which seems to me to be a worthwhile and sound enterprise based on exploiting what we have in abundance here, agricultural produce, and which was regarded as suitable and capable of being established there, has now been deferred because of the credit squeeze in Britain.  That is the conclusion that one must deduce from the report because the company has announced that the financial arrangements which were to operate in order to establish the undertaking are not now possible. I hope it will be possible both in that case and in other cases to ensure that the effect of this credit squeeze will not impinge on persons anxious to purchase houses.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to a suggestion that I made here some time ago.  With the present serious shortage of houses of nearly every category, we ought to plan on a long-term basis the total building potential and not have the situation in which capital and labour are being used to build offices or other <Col N="1290" /> buildings that could take their place in the queue.  This idea was discussed here previously and I suggested that it would not in any way interfere with the building worker, that it would result in a better prospect of continuity of employment which is the one thing building workers and skilled tradesmen wish to have, and that, in addition, it would enable us to devote our resources of skilled and unskilled personnel as well as our capital resources, to fulfilling the most necessary part of the whole building programme, houses and hospitals, in an order of priority, then dealing with offices, warehouses or other undertakings that could take their place in the queue.</P>
    <P>That possibly means some measure, if not of control or direction, certainly of goodwill on the part of industrialists and traders which is not at present in existence.  However, some time ago the Minister for Local Government or the Government established a National Building Agency.  There was a certain amount of talk and publicity about it when it was established but so far it appears to have done little. This is an eminently suitable assignment for a body of that sort, to get the builders' organisations together, to initiate discussions with the Builders' Federation and the various local authorities, and to get together representatives of the Federated Union of Employers and other organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>Whatever justification there was for this when the suggestion was made a year or two ago, when money was more readily available and when there was a backlog not merely in housing but in offices and warehouses, there is certainly a very cogent reason for considering this matter now when credit appears to be getting tighter and when it is not merely a political assertion but an economic fact, a fact founded in experience by applicants for loans to building societies which those societies will not sanction or are not prepared in present circumstances to give for houses above £3,000.  That situation is one that may have and possibly will have serious repercussions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> If there is one thing we want to avoid in this country&mdash;I should have thought that, so far as Britain is concerned, measures would have been taken before this, but we have, perhaps, enough to do looking after our own affairs&mdash;it is &ldquo;Stop-Go&rdquo; policies and the &ldquo;Stop-Go&rdquo; situations that have occured at pretty regular intervals ever since the end of the last war. Initially, these may have been inevitable in the sense that experience did not afford any guide lines or headlines as to what action might or might not be taken, but we have now had almost two decades in which at intervals of varying duration, not precisely defined or regular, repeated &ldquo;Stop-Go&rdquo; policies have operated.  These have operated particularly in the case of Britain and have in certain respects also affected this country.  We have been undoubtedly affected by the British position.  We ought now to endeavour to minimise that influence, if not eliminate it altogether, in so far as we have within our own control and our own direction certain spheres of activity and influence.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government through the National Building Agency should exercise, or endeavour to exercise, some measure of direction or give some indication, not to use a stronger word, of the pattern the Government, through its contact with local authorities and with other responsible organisations, consider to be not only in the national interest but, in the long run, in the interests of all those concerned.</P>
    <P>I want now for a moment to refer to the position of prices.  Speaking here last year, I mentioned that it seemed to me that the prices position in this country had been to a very considerable extent in the last couple of years the result of an internal price inflation. I am fortified in that view by comments made in the <i>Economic Statistics</i> published prior to the Budget.  At page 16 of that publication, having reviewed the position and given data of the consumer price index and of the wholesale and import price index, the publication goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> Thus the price changes in this country over the period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is over the period 1963-1964 particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>have not been caused by rises in the price of imports but by internal factors.</P>
    <P>At page 17 it refers to this situation and I find the comments somewhat difficult to interpret.  It says:</P>
    <P>Of the remaining margin of about 4 per cent only about 0.6 per cent can be attributed to the changes in import prices so that a residual increase of 3.4 per cent can be attributed to other causes, mainly the direct effects of the ninth round of wage and salary increases.  In considering the full effects of the ninth round on consumer prices everyone must take into account as well the effect on prices of the taxation of commodities occasioned by the necessity to increase the revenue of public authorities, to meet the increased wage and salary bill in the Public Service generally, including Education, Health, the Army, the Civic Guards, etc.  It is not, of course, possible to earmark certain taxes to particular expenditure so that the overall effect of the ninth round cannot be precisely determined.</P>
    <P>Now that comment highlights the great problem a number of local bodies and institutions have had in meeting the effect of the turnover tax.  There is not much point now, I believe, in dwelling at any great length on this tax because the tax is in operation, but I believe the adverse effects of the tax have entirely obliterated any Exchequer advantages achieved by the revenue derived from it.  I believe also that, if it were to be faced now, it is obvious from the fact that it has been possible in two years running to tax and get, because of the buoyancy of the revenue and the fact that these particular commodities were capable of bearing it, additional revenue from beer, tobacco, spirits and so on such a tax would not have been adopted.  But the effect of this tax has had repercussions <Col N="1293" /> that have affected not merely our industrial costs but seriously affected, for want of a better description, the housekeeping bills of local authorities and institutions such as hospitals and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the very big problems&mdash;it is one to which I believe attention should be directed and for which there is no measure of relief proposed in this Budget&mdash;is the increased costs health authorities have to meet and which generate a whole range of disadvantages, not the least being the rise in rates.  The phenomenal rise in the Dublin city and county rates is due to the added charges the Dublin Health Authority has to meet.  Some of these charges may have been caused by factors other than turnover tax but, in the main, they have been caused directly by the turnover tax.  I know one college in proximity to this city in which there are about 300 students. The bursar of that college has told me that the turnover tax meant an increase of £1,500 a month in his outgoings to cover the effect of the tax for that limited category.  So far as the Dublin Health Authority is concerned, and I can speak in this connection from experience in my own constituency, a hospital like the one at Loughlinstown or St. Kevin's has had to meet very considerable additional charges.</P>
    <P>That is also true of other bodies. These charges have had to be borne to a considerable extent on the rates, but they have also had to be borne by the patients and their families.  A great many relatively poor patients, particularly elderly persons living on pensions, have had to meet some portion of these costs.  Undoubtedly, the Authority itself has had to meet the greater proportion and that is, in turn, borne by the ratepayers.  The high cost of drugs has an important bearing. The effect of the turnover tax was to increase still further the cost of medicinal preparations.  These charges are presenting a very serious problem to a great many people and it is one to which, I believe, the Budget should have adverted.</P>
    <P>There is a welcome for the long <Col N="1294" /> overdue improvement in social welfare benefits, covering the different social welfare categories such as old age, widows, and blind pensioners.  Leaving those aside, there is a pressing need for an improvement in health services. Again, leaving aside any political argument or any disagreements we may have here, I believe that need for improvement was generally recognised during the course of the election; it was certainly recognised in the closing stages of the election by the Taoiseach in his speeches.  The fact that the last Select Committee did little or nothing about the problem except assemble data and get information is a certain rebuke to that Committee and the last Dáil.  I hope the present Minister for Health, whom I believe to be a person of energy and initiative, will do something, and do it quickly, to alleviate the position of these classes.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, there are middle-class people and white collar workers who for one reason or another, because of age or family circumstances, are unable to meet these costs.  These are people for whom some attempt must be made to solve their problems if they are not to be put into a much more serious position than they have been in up to now. The cost of hospital treatment, particularly the cost in local authority hospitals and institutions under health authorities, requires urgent investigation with a view to alleviating some of the charges on these people.</P>
    <P>In that connection, one of the disappointing aspects of the Budget is that no relief of any sort is provided for what have been described as white collar workers.  The income tax allowances in respect of children and dependent relatives have remained at the existing level for a number of years, while, at the same time, the cost of living has risen sharply and consistently. These categories include not merely married people with families but people with dependent relatives, particularly persons over 65 who are in most cases no longer able to supplement their incomes.  For instance, nurses have a very heavy burden to bear in providing the absolutely essential services which they, and only they, <Col N="1295" /> can provide in our hospitals and institutions. They find income tax a very heavy burden, in addition to meeting the other charges that have arisen.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I wanted to refer to in connection with State companies. It is a matter that has been the subject of consideration over many years.  Some system of review is required.  By and large, there is general recognition that these companies have been satisfactory and are doing a good job.  At the same time, there is some public uneasiness that the present system is unsatisfactory.  While it is difficult to institute an effective system which will not interfere with the freedom of action of those companies, there is a growing volume of opinion that whereas in all these cases, in some more than others, considerable public investment is involved, some method of review of the capital programme and policy should be established. I do not believe there is any desire on the part of Deputies or of the public that these companies should be the subject of annoying scrutiny or tedious investigation of details.  That should not be permitted in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The matter has been under consideration in Britain for many years because of the greater number of State undertakings established there since the war. Therefore, there is a view&mdash;not confined to here&mdash;that it ought to be possible to devise some system, either by a Select Committee of the Dáil, a Committee in some way analogous to the Public Accounts Committee or even a Committee consisting of a certain number of Deputies and officials selected by interested parties, of examining how the general policy in regard to capital and otherwise of these companies could be the subject of full investigation from time to time, if not on an annual basis, then certainly over a period.</P>
    <P>I know one of the arguments that have been brought forward by the Taoiseach and others is that the annual accounts of these companies are presented and, if a Deputy wishes, he can table a motion.  But that involves a <Col N="1296" /> full debate in the Dáil which in many cases is likely to be the worst kind of investigation, because somebody interested in some aspect of his own constituency will raise that and not the general policy.  We have, therefore, a diffuse debate that does not pinpoint the essentials but rather concentrates on local matters.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of our general shake-up, that is, the telephone service.  The Progress Report on the Second Programme adverted to this and said:</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure amounted to £6.1 million as against a Second Programme estimate of £6 million. The number of subscriber lines had grown by 31 December, 1964, to 150,560, an increase of more than 100,000 over the 1950 figure.  Nevertheless, there has been no reduction in the number of applicants on the waiting list and the telephone system in this country is still relatively undeveloped compared with the major Western European countries.  For the present, however, the development programme must continue to be concentrated mainly on the task of overtaking arrears of development works, i.e. the expansion of the trunk network and the provision of further automatic exchanges.</P>
    <P>Here is a field in which there is a vast potential for improvement, a field in which we can employ the skilled personnel that can be trained in our vocational schools.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would be interested to hear from the Government what part the vocational schools are expected to play in training personnel under the new manpower proposals.  I understand it is intended to establish a separate either statutory or other body to deal with that problem.  I do not know whether that is the right decision or not.  We can only await the definite proposals before commenting on them.  There is widespread appreciation of the manner in which our vocational schools are conducted.  It is one of the most satisfactory features of the whole educational system, a feature that has expanded out of all recognition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The vocational schools provide skills, training and knowledge and have enabled boys and girls in various parts of the country to avail of education that would not otherwise be available to them.  They have provided them with the technical training on a practical basis so essential in so many spheres.  That particular aspect of our educational system should not be bypassed in any proposals the Government may have for a manpower policy. In fact, these schools and the knowledge and experience of the teachers should be harnessed to a general scheme of education for boys and girls.  That in no way reflects on the other very admirable educational schemes carried out at primary, secondary and other levels.  The vocational system has generally proved more than its worth and it has been so recognised by the people in general.</P>
    <P>I want, before concluding, to make a few general comments.  I would like to say, so far as I am concerned, that I propose to provide from the Fine Gael Party a constructive opposition. We will criticise, where necessary or justified, but, so far as I am concerned, there will be no opposition during the lifetime of this Dáil for the sake of opposition.</P>

      <P>I believe we have the duty to examine proposals on their merits and, where we consider suitable, as in the case of social welfare proposals introduced, to give them our support.  In other cases, where possible, we shall seek to secure amendments of any proposals which we consider capable of amendment.  We will oppose any proposals, legislative or financial, when we consider it in the national interest to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we will provide responsible and informed comments on all measures brought forward for consideration. Some of the proposals which affect the country will require the best efforts of all who are charged with responsibility to solve them.  There are common objectives in many spheres of activity.  Differences may arise on how to achieve these aims but I believe <Col N="1298" /> all agree on the desirability of bringing them about.</P>
    <P>We all have to face the great challenge of the future.  There are changes here, in Europe and in the world.  Ireland must play some part in these developments.  Our people have a natural ability.  Most of our people are now getting a better education than before.  Many are better equipped but more should be better educated and equipped to face the future.  We should value, in the world of today, our great Christian traditions, our ancient heritage and culture and see that these are used in our own interests and in the welfare of the human race.</P>

      <P>Both the Opposition Parties have claimed parenthood of this Budget.  If I had to exercise the judgement of Solomon in this connection and apply the test that he applied when the two women claimed to be parents of the same baby, I would give the verdict against Fine Gael.  When the test came, Fine Gael were prepared to see the baby knifed, while the Labour Party moved into the Division Lobby to vote for what is a not very popular tax, in order to preserve the Budget proposals.  I suppose we shall have to put up with this situation for some time, the situation in which we on this side of the House, we in the Government, will do the work and the Opposition Parties will try to snaffle all the credit.</P>
      <P>I would urge Deputy Cosgrave, now that he has been elevated to leadership of his Party, to try to get his Party away from this old pretension, to encourage them to stand on their own feet and not to be looking always for free rides on Fianna Fáil's coat-tails.  I think his speech today reflected his recognition of this need for his Party and I hope his example will be followed by his colleagues.  All Deputies, irrespective of Party, desire to see the country going ahead and solving all the problems that now exist and that are likely to arise in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tendency in recent months, in the previous Dáil, of Opposition <Col N="1299" /> Deputies to deny the reality of recent economic progress and to play up the magnitude of the continuing economic and social problems was no doubt related to the political situation which then prevailed.  That situation has been changed by reason of the general election. Our progress in recent years has been very real and very substantial but there is certainly no guarantee that it will go on and I ask the co-operation of other political Parties in this House in killing the illusion that progress will go on of its own accord, and that even the present rate of economic growth can be kept up without a very great effort embracing all our people and requiring the complete co-operation of all the elements which make up our national community.</P>
    <P>I have never denied that the acceleration of the country's economic progress in recent years was helped by a favourable international climate.  The point which I have often stressed and which I wish to reiterate now is that because international conditions have been favourable to our economic development here, this nation has now opportunities for development, which, if not fully used now, may not recur in our time.  Posterity would be unforgiving if we in these years achieve less than is possible by reason of Party political dissensions, differences in employer-worker relations, or between urban and rural interests or any similar cause.</P>
    <P>There is not going to be another general election for many years.  I suggest and urge that Party political interests can now be left aside for a time so that the national interests can be served.  If the Opposition Parties adopt this attitude, I can assure them that we of the Government will not be outdone in patriotism.</P>

      <P>I am certainly not asking for a cessation of criticism.  On the contrary, constructive criticism, in this House, of all proposals brought here by the Government, is a stimulus to any Government and it certainly <Col N="1300" /> would not be in the national interest that criticism of that kind should be stilled or muted at any time, but criticism should be based on facts and realities.</P>
      <P>The Budget which the Minister for Finance introduced here on Tuesday last was generally foreshadowed in the newspapers and by political commentators. I do not think anybody was surprised by its main features.  Some new taxes were imposed to provide for higher social welfare benefits.  Nobody likes taxes and nobody is expected to like them.  If our sole purpose were to avoid higher taxation in this year, then, as the Minister for Finance pointed out in his Budget Statement, we could have come here with virtually a stand still Budget, no new taxes and no new expenditures.</P>
      <P>Once we took the decision that social welfare allowances had to be further improved, then new taxation became unavoidable.  We are asking the people to accept this taxation because they approve of the purposes for which it is imposed.  The purpose of all taxes is, of course, to raise money.  If the taxes, the increased charges announced by the Minister for Finance on tobacco and drink, have the effect of slowing down the increase in the consumption of tobacco and drink, then this will serve a good purpose.  When considering the form of taxation we proposed in the Budget, we desired to avoid anything which might be a disincentive to the country's economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision that tobacco and drink can now bear higher rates of taxation, higher rates than those in operation two years ago when the turnover tax was imposed, is a reflection of the higher level of personal incomes which have since been established.  I know that the Opposition Parties have to justify their attitude to the turnover tax when it was first imposed but I am sure they must recognise now that it is a permanent feature of the tax structure of the State and that it will never be repealed.  It will never be possible to consider its repeal.  Consequently, there is no point in maintaining the old controversy about it.  The fact that the increases in taxes here could, in this year, be kept well below the recent <Col N="1301" /> increases in Great Britain&mdash;and it is with that country that our tax rates are most frequently compared&mdash;may not make them more acceptable, but it is worth nothing.</P>
    <P>This has been described as a social welfare Budget.  While we have often emphasised that economic progress is designed primarily to serve social ends, we need to emphasise that these ends are not entirely or solely expressed in the country's social welfare arrangements. This country is facing problems of social adjustment, facing the need to think about the development of social policy, but it would be very inadvisable if ideas on these matters were limited to changes in the State's social services.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned in some recent speeches the possibility of defining a social welfare programme in line or connected in some way with the economic development programme. This seems to have been interpreted by some as meaning nothing more than a programmed increase in our social welfare arrangements, our health services, and so on.  A detailed programme of that kind would, I think, hardly be necessary although a reexamination of the scope and administration of these services is required and this is now being undertaken as the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget Statement and as the Minister for Social Welfare stated yesterday and the Minister for Health, in reply to a Dáil Question last week.  Otherwise, it is just a matter of how much money can be provided at any particular time and, while it is possible to announce, as we have done, the intention of allocating a rising share of expanding national resources to these services, an estimate of how much these might amount to in any future year would be little more than guesswork and have no particular value.</P>
    <P>A social development programme, as I understand it, would be a much wider conception than a review of social welfare arrangements although, of course, adequate social services would be an important part of it.  In the fullest form, it could no doubt extend to attempting to sketch the type of society we desire to build here, recognising that this would not solely or even <Col N="1302" /> mainly be a function of the Government or a matter of expanding the functions of Government or of the enactment of legislation by the Dáil but of developing a social attitude in, and defining the social obligations of, business concerns and trade unions and arising in other similar activities so as to place the improvement of relations within our society and the general welfare of the country in at least equal importance with the particular aims of individual concerns and organisations, leading perhaps eventually to the setting up of arrangements and procedures which would reflect these new attitudes.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence anywhere in the world that the growth of affluence necessarily means greater human happiness. There is, indeed, much evidence to the contrary, even in the very wealthiest countries.  We, as a nation, now, for the first time in our history, have to consider the implications of steadily rising national wealth, steadily rising living standards for our people, and to think about the social problems which in this situation will certainly be generated for us.  This is the kind of study I should like to see beginning and it would have far more significance in relation to the country's future than the commitment of money in future years to the expansion of the State social services.</P>
    <P>The new problems which we shall have to face, while different from those of the past, different from those of endemic poverty, are not likely to be less easy to cope with.  Can we, by taking thought now, by drawing on the resources of inspiration and information, internal and external, which are available to us and which help to determine our national policies, avoid some or all of the less desirable consequences which have appeared in other countries?  It is not enough to say, I think, that the answers are to be found in the Encyclicals of Pope John XXIII.  These are inspiring documents but the principles enshrined therein are of universal application.  Our need is to try to translate them into precise measures for practical application in the circumstances prevailing here at the present time&mdash;when it is practical application rather than the development <Col N="1303" /> of a state of mind that is involved&mdash;and recognising that changing circumstances will constantly call for new applications.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this is something that lies entirely in the field of government or which can be entrusted to a Government Commission or any similar procedure although perhaps specific aspects of the problem could be dealt with in that way.  If this type of social development programme is to be built up here, there will need to be much wider public discussion of its possible character and implications and much more public education on the issues it will present than heretofore, so that we shall all realise that social progress is not just a matter of increased government activity or of spending more public money but mainly a process of adjustment of individual and sectional attitudes which must embrace the whole population and be reflected in all human relationships which make up the day to day life of our people.</P>
    <P>Glib phrases like &ldquo;a just society&rdquo; are meaningless in this context.  I find them completely nauseating.  They are merely an excuse for sloppy thinking or a justification of minimum effort in any of these fields.  If my Party should ever resort to gimmicks of that kind, I shall certainly bow myself out of it.  I want to try to dispose fully and completely of the idea that this Budget and the improvements in the social welfare arrangements which the Minister for Finance announced, were brought about by reason of any pressure exercised on the Government by the Opposition Parties during the election campaign or since.  That is completely absurd.  Indeed, the proposals which the Minister for Finance announced on Tuesday last in relation to social welfare are a logical and inevitable extension of a process which began when this Government came into office in 1957.</P>
    <P>It is true that the increases in the benefit rates under the social services proposed in this year are greater than in any previous year.  It is true also that we were influenced in the decision to propose a greater increase in these rates in this year, and the taxation <Col N="1304" /> necessary to make it possible, by reason of our appreciation of the fact that the Opposition Parties had come to accept the fact that improvements in these services required taxation adjustments. Over all these years, total State expenditure, under the various proposals brought forward year after year by the present Government for the extension of social welfare services, has increased from £23 million to £36 million.  The total expenditure upon the income maintenance services administered by the Department of Social Welfare increased by more than that because, apart altogether from the higher allocation of State funds to these services, there were increased contributions under the social insurance scheme which brought the total expenditure upon these services in this year to £49 million as contrasting with £28 million in the year 1956-57.  Of course, the proposals of the Minister for Finance will next year add another £5,750,000 to that total.</P>
    <P>The insurance rates operating here were increased four times during that period and, more important than that, there were a considerable number of relaxations in restrictions in the scope of these benefits, including the expansion of supplementary payments in respect of all children of beneficiaries instead of their being confined as they were previous to these changes, to the first two children in each family.  It is of course natural and inevitable that members of the Dáil and probably members of the public tend to look at the level of these insurance and assistance benefit rates on the basis of what is provided for the single adult, and when increases are announced, to relate them to the single adult rate.  In fact, the expansion of the supplementary allowances, the improved provision for the dependent wives and children of these beneficiaries which the Government has made from time to time, have been far more important, both from the financial and social aspects.  In the case of a widow with six children, the actual increase in the amount of pension received by her each week since 1960 amounted to £2 17s. 0d. per week and in the case of a man on unemployment benefit with similar family circumstances&mdash;a wife and six children&mdash;<Col N="1305" /> the increase in his weekly income by reason of the changes we have introduced is £3 9s. 0d.</P>
    <P>In 1961 we introduced for the first time in this country the old age contributory pension scheme, which improved considerably the position of wage-earners in retirement by providing pensions at a higher rate than were available under the non-contributory scheme, and by paying these pensions without a means test so that the recipients can obtain them without any reduction in respect of other pensions which they are entitled to draw.  The rates of pension under the contributory old age pension scheme up to 1960 were increased again in 1961, further increased in 1962, increased for a third time in 1963 and in 1964 increases in respect of dependent children came into effect.  These rates will, of course, be again increased from 1st January next.</P>
    <P>So far as the assistance payments are concerned, that is, those paid subject to a means test and without any contribution condition being applied including old age, widows' and orphans' and blind pensioners, these have been increased no less than seven times in varying amounts since 1957.  The qualifying means limit has been raised on a number of occasions and again the supplementary benefits have been extended to include all children in a family.  By reason of the raising of the means limit, a very considerable number of additional persons were brought within the scope of the schemes.  None of those increases are of course comparable with those now intended, but they represent the policy which the Government have been following since coming back into power in 1957 of building up these rates consistently to a higher level.</P>
    <P>In 1963 the children's allowances were extended to include the first child in every family in respect of which they were not previously payable and were increased all round.  Apart from higher benefits rates as now announced, the main developments in the social welfare field which we envisaged in this year will be, first, the alteration of the method of calculating means under the Unemployment Assistance Act in the <Col N="1306" /> case of smallholders, in order to re-remove what has been described as the disincentive effect of the old method of calculating means and which will be of immense help in the fulfilment of the overall campaign to secure increased output from the small farms of the country, particularly in the West which will involve a cost of £950,000 in a full year; and secondly, the enactment of legislation to replace the workmen's compensation code by a State scheme of industrial accident insurance.</P>
    <P>I think our social welfare income maintenance services are now adequate in scope.  There will be changes in their methods of application and changes in their administration from time to time.  These are being considered, but I think it is possible now to say that further improvements in the income maintenance services administered by the Department of Social Welfare will in the main take the form of increased benefits rather than further extension in their scope.</P>
    <P>In the case of health services, and I heard a Front Bench member of the Fine Gael Party say in the course of the discussion on the formation of the new Government that there had been stagnation in this field under this Government, expenditure has increased since 1957 from £16 million to £30 million.  It would take too long to deal now with all the Acts which were submitted to and passed by the Dáil since 1957 for the improvement and expansion of these health services.  The income maintenance services which are administered by the Department of Health, those under which disabled persons' allowances and allowances for persons suffering from infectious diseases are provided, have also been increased on many occasions.  The disabled person's allowance has been increased in each of the past four years, and the infectious diseases allowance has been increased three times in each of the past three years and will be further increased under the arrangements coming into operation now announced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In the hospital building and improvement programme, there has been a sustained level of high activity. <Col N="1307" /> Thirty-one projects have been completed since 1957.  There are 47 hospital buildings and improvement projects now in progress, and 71 further projects involving a capital outlay of £15 million are now in course of planning. The Minister for Health has made known to the House that the adequacy of our health services is now under detailed examination by him, and that it is hoped that decisions upon the further expansion of these services will be made during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education spoke yesterday about the development of our educational services but, again, it is necessary to emphasise&mdash;and to remind Deputies and the public of the vast changes that have taken place in this field during this period&mdash;that expenditure on educational services increased since 1957 from £15 million to £33 million, an increase of £18 million. There have been increases under every head of expenditure arising in the educational field.  The increase this year over last year is just £2 million.  Now, it is true that a considerable part of this higher expenditure on education represents higher pay to teachers.  This was considered to be not just a routine adjustment of salary rates but a very deliberate policy of enhancing the status of teachers within our community and an integral part of our overall educational development programme.</P>
    <P>As Deputies who know the facts are aware, there has been a considerable expansion in the school building programme. We have expended £14 million on new primary schools since 1957, and a further expansion of the output of new schools is considered to be feasible in this year.  The number of trained teachers has been increased, and in each of the past six years the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has been improved.  In 1961, a vastly extended scheme of scholarships was introduced, both in post-primary schools and universities.  For the first time in the history of the State, the Government began to contribute to the cost of these scholarships.  A further <Col N="1308" /> doubling of the number of scholarships is now intended, and legislation to facilitate that is being drafted, and provision for the cost is included in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>On the secondary education level, there has been a very remarkable and very significant growth in those years as indicated by a 50 per cent increase in the number of pupils attending our secondary schools and the very great expansion in the number of schools and the number of teachers in the schools. In the past year, again for the first time in the history of the State, the Government began giving capital grants for the construction and expansion of secondary schools, recognising the situation which was developing in the field of secondary education and the need to encourage further expansion there.</P>
    <P>The erection of four new comprehensive schools is now proceeding.  I am sure I do not have to emphasise the significance of the policy decision taken by the Government, which is expressed in the construction of these comprehensive schools, to bring the State, in a way which was not previously considered desirable, into the field of secondary education.  Those are matters which arise primarily in connection with the work of the Minister for Education, and I do not want to elaborate on them now.  I mention them merely to show that in this social field, as in all others, a progressive policy has been consistently applied over all these years.</P>
    <P>On the vocational education side there has also been a spectacular rate of expansion involving an increase of more than 50 per cent in the number of pupils and the number of schools, and a very considerable expansion of expenditure.  The decision to set up the regional technical colleges represents a new breakthrough in the field of technical education, and they are now under way in eight centres.</P>
    <P>In the field of higher education the story is similar.  There has been a very great increase in the number of pupils taking university courses, which has given rise to a very serious problem of accommodation.  This involved the <Col N="1309" /> decision, so far as University College Dublin was concerned, to build an entirely new university college outside the boundaries of the city, and additional buildings at Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>We set up the Commission on Higher Education to help us to plan the course of the development of our higher educational services for a long time ahead.  I am told that the Commission are now completing their report and that it will be available to us shortly.  Decisions will then be taken which will settle the pattern of future development in the field of higher education.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite frequently suggest that in regard to housing the Government have in some way been derelict in their duty or have not been anxious to proceed with the fulfilment of the provision of housing where it is required at the maximum feasible rate.  The aims which we have set ourselves, and the policy which we have devised for the realisation of those aims have been published to the House and to the country in the White Paper, and a new comprehensive Bill to give effect to the proposals in the White Paper will be before the Dáil in the course of a few weeks.</P>
    <P>When we came back into office in 1957 we found there was such a high vacancy rate in most of the housing estates because of heavy emigration that the local authorities were cutting down upon their activities.  Indeed, when I became Taoiseach I met the officials of the Dublin Corporation and I discussed the housing position in Dublin with them.  They told me that at that moment there were 1,500 vacant dwellings in the city of Dublin.</P>

In those circumstances I could not urge on them that a new and more ambitious housing programme than they then envisaged should be undertaken. I also met the representatives of the trade unions catering for the Dublin building workers, and I discussed with them the desirability of a crash programme to complete the housing needs of the city.  None of us could have <Col N="1310" /> envisaged then the economic development which has taken place since, but they preferred, in the circumstances of the time, a more orderly and consistent programme of development which would avoid the risks they saw as possible of a crash programme being followed by a serious building slump. That danger, as Deputies know, has been completely averted.</P>

      <P>Last year the target output figure for new housing set in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was exceeded, and it seems probable that the higher target set for this year will be reached.  The number of houses now under construction or on tender is 50 per cent higher, both in Dublin and in the country as a whole, than it was this time last year.  In Dublin, of course, the most remarkable development in this regard, representing another important policy decision by the Government, is the Ballymun project, which represents a very considerable new development.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Government to step in to supplement the output of the Dublin Corporation, assuming the corporation's output will be the highest they are capable of achieving, through the National Building Agency, will make an important contribution to catching up on the backlog of housing in Dublin.</P>
      <P>A new Housing Bill will be before the Dáil in the course of a few weeks and this will be a more appropriate occasion for a discussion on housing which I shall not anticipate now.  We have set an output target for new houses, designed to bring the annual number up to something between 12,000 to 14,000 per year.  This is far more than was ever previously envisaged in this country, much less accomplished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> This output will not be possible at all unless there is a considerable increase in the skilled labour force engaged in house building and a concerted effort by all involved to develop new building methods which will reduce the time required for house construction. Deputy Cosgrave referred to the desirability of introducing a system of building controls in order to ensure the concentration of the available resources in the building industry on the constructional projects deemed to be of the greatest national and social importance.</P>
    <P>It seems to me he envisaged a system of licences such as we had during the war and the refusal of licences to persons putting forward proposals of lesser importance.  I can foresee the possibility that circumstances may arise which may require us to impose such a system.  I do not think they exist now or that Deputy Cosgrave took into account the extent to which the level of activity in the building industry is reflected by the volume of Government building orders which are available to it.  We have been in recent years very deliberately utilising this great volume of business, financed by and administered by the Government, in order to try to maintain both the output of the building industry at the highest practical level and keep it uniformly at that level.</P>
    <P>Under these three heads of social services&mdash;social welfare income maintenance arrangements, health services and education&mdash;current expenditure chargeable against taxation has increased since 1957 by no less than £45 million and this year's Budget will, as I pointed out already, add a further £5¾ million.  This was made possible by the increase in national resources, the rising national income, but it necessitated tax changes to ensure that the improvements carried out were made financially feasible.</P>
    <P>Deputies have pointed out in the course of the discussion that the increase in employment recorded last year was not enough to realise the targets set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> for <Col N="1312" /> the overall employment figure of 1970. This is true, though I am not certain that the figures available to Deputies present a complete picture.  The reduction in the numbers occupied in agriculture has apparently been offset by increasing employment in industry and other services but there is, of course, a great deal of activity in the country which is not recorded in these figures.  On the basis of the average weekly sales of insurance stamps sold last year, taking an average one week with another, the number employed in 1964 was higher by 16,900 than in 1963 and higher by 33,000 than 1962.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an indication of the level of activity in the country, something which is not fully recorded in statistics.  In regard to the number of new jobs outside agriculture, the margin is not still wide enough to give us the overall expansion we require. This indicates again the need for a concentration of the national purpose on this aspect of our affairs and by this I mean precisely giving the increase in the number of jobs a greater priority than the improvement of the living standards, the remuneration, of those already in employment.</P>
      <P>While the numbers on the employment register have been this year consistently below those of last year, the numbers registered as unemployed last year still represented an average of 5.7 per cent of the total labour force. The number who emigrated, about 25,000, is still too high, though it is below the natural increase in population. Since 1961, it is estimated that our increase in population has been 31,000 and that the population will increase by 5,000 in this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is the total since 1961.  The Government's proposals for consideration by the Dáil arising out of the development of a manpower policy will be coming available and the first of these, in the form of a Bill, will, I hope, be before <Col N="1313" /> the Dáil for consideration before the summer.  I must confess I am worried about the possibility of delays in the enactment of these measures, which are urgently important to assist us in the national effort, due to the interruption of the Dáil's work by the General Election.  I hope to be able to give the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties our programme of legislation for the remainder of the session in the course of the next two weeks when I shall be looking for their co-operation in the allocation of Dáil time.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this is likely to be a difficult as well as a crucial year in the matter of maintaining the State's rate of economic growth.  As Deputy Cosgrave, I think, stated, the difficulties are mainly related to the maintenance of the stability of our costs and prices. If either should get out of hand we can experience a serious setback with permanent consequences to the country's future development.  The prospects are that if internal forces can be restrained now, prices will become stabilised during the year and if the productivity increase in industry in this year equals that of last year, then some reduction of industrial prices should become possible by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Government are relying mainly on pointing out these facts and exhorting all interests to relate their sectional policies to them, preferring to assume that people will want to act constructively and responsibly.  By and large this is so, even if there are occassionally occurrences which suggest otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have ever to contemplate more direct methods of Government regulation it would create a very difficult situation, indeed, in which serious friction would almost certainly develop and in which the processes of regulating the forces working in the economy would be continuously extended to meet new problems.  I know that the Fine Gael Party in recent months have been tempted by this idea of progress regulated and controlled by the Government, disguised under the term &ldquo;planning.&rdquo;  However, Fine Gael have not expressed any views as far as I know as to how far this control should be taken, once started.  Indeed they do <Col N="1314" /> not seem to have thought that out at all.</P>
    <P>General control of prices would be meaningless without the control of costs, including wages.  Recently, an increase in the price of bread was sanctioned by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That was because there had been an agreement between employers and workers in the bakery industry for the alterations in working conditions which increased the production costs.  The Government could have said there will be no increase permitted and presumably that would have meant that these changes in working conditions would not have been able to take place which would probably have created a very strained situation in that industry and in its future working.  It would only be in abnormal circumstances, such as those that prevailed here during the war, or where the situation was clearly out of hand, that we would think of extending Government controls in this way even as a temporary device.  Whatever the difficulties of trying to work out a coherent national policy or the danger of its being disrupted by irresponsible sectional action this is the method we must try to work to the end.  In our long-term reliance on individual commonsense and individual responsibilities I think we are likely to find a much more effective method of dealing with our national affairs than reliance on Government control, no matter how ruthlessly that might be enforced.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should allow ourselves to be hypnotised by vague ideas and slick phrases about an incomes policy without fully understanding it or being able to state clearly what this expression is intended to mean. Whether what some people call an incomes policy is practicable at all depends really on what is meant by it. Most of the ideas I have heard expressed seem to me to be clearly and completely impracticable.  The broad aim of the Government is to ensure that all sections of our people will share fully and freely in rising national prosperity.  So far as earned incomes are concerned, and I am referring to wages and salaries in particular, this can, in my view, be best achieved by periodic adjustments under national <Col N="1315" /> agreements freely negotiated following full consideration of the general economic situation and the effect upon prices and employment to make sure that so far as it is possible the gains of workers from increased wages will be real gains and will be made certain in the context of increasing national resources and rising employment.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of achieving this aim have been high-lighted by some recent experiences but no system can be expected to operate from the start without some difficulties.  It would be a serious mistake in my view to discard the idea and turn to a consideration of the possibility of controls because of these difficulties.  Most people, and this includes in particular most of our workers, agree that the time has come when some procedure, more rational than jungle law, should be devised to settle these matters.  The maintenance and application of the national wage agreement negotiated last year is the responsibility of those who negotiated it&mdash;the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash;and it is on their capacity to maintain and apply this agreement would seem to depend the success of similar negotiations for another agreement next year.</P>
    <P>There is, so far as I know, a common aim embracing the Government, the employers' organisation and the trade unions, in this matter.  This does not mean that there is agreement in any sort of detail but a desire to work out arrangements by which periodic improvements of workers' living standards can be brought about with a minimum of disruption or friction, and that procedures should be set up by which the application of a general agreement in particular cases could be carried out without undue difficulty. It is in the interests of all workers, and of the general progress of the country, that these aims should not be allowed to be frustrated by any short-sighted action at this time.  This year would seem to be crucial for the whole future of this new concept of worker-employer relations.</P>
    <P>In the course of a reply to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="1316" /> recently, I undertook that on this occasion I would make a statement regarding our external trading situation and about the developments which have been taking place in recent times regarding the European trade groups. As Deputies know, the external trading environment in which our economy has to operate is dominated by this division of our principal export markets in Western Europe into two trading groups, to neither of which does this country belong.  The implications of this situation for our export trade and for our whole future economic development are of such importance that we cannot afford to neglect any measures which will help to promote the internal strength of the national economy and offset the disadvantages inherent in this present situation.</P>
    <P>Internal tariffs on industrial products within the European Free Trade Association will be eliminated by January, 1967 and it appears highly probable that a single market for both industrial and agricultural products will be established within the European Economic Community by the middle of 1967.  It is in these areas we have to sell the bulk of our exports in competition with domestic producers who will in two years time have the advantage of tariff-free access to wider markets within their respective groups.  To maintain and extend our sales within these areas we must keep pace with the general advance in freer trade and also as far as possible obtain for our exporters equal treatment with their competitors in a wider market.</P>
    <P>Membership of an enlarged European community, embracing our principal export markets, would be a trading arrangement best calculated to meet our needs.  Despite doubts expressed in some quarters I am still of the opinion that it is reasonable to anticipate we shall have gained entry into the European Economic Community by 1970.  The scale and pace of developments within the Community are now such as to underline the necessity in the course of the next few years to solve the economic and political difficulties confronting Western Europe. Initiatives will be forthcoming and that these will be ultimately successful <Col N="1317" /> I have no doubt.  While this prospect can sustain us in our efforts to raise our economy to a level of development at which we could hope to compete on equal terms with other countries, the expectation that we shall have to take our place in a large economic grouping by the end of this decade does not in itself provide the answer to the trading problems arising in the years immediately ahead of us.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made in the GATT, through the Kennedy Round negotiations, to moderate the more serious adverse difficulties of the economic division of Europe by reducing tariffs on industrial products and entering into more equitable arrangements for trade in agricultural products.  As the Minister for Finance told the House in his Budget speech, we are proceeding with our application for accession to the GATT.  By participation in the GATT, and the Kennedy Round, we shall acquire a right to share in whatever trading concessions may be negotiated. These will ease to some extent the barriers to our trade with areas like Continental Europe and the USA, thereby assisting the further diversification of our export markets.</P>
    <P>That will not, however, afford us any advantage at all in our principal market which is Great Britain, and indeed by reducing the margins of preference we now enjoy in respect of a wide range of products exported to Great Britain it will increase the competition we will encounter there.  The GATT, therefore, while it can contribute to the better ordering of world trade&mdash;a development in which a trading country like ourselves has a considerable interest&mdash;does not provide a substitute for participation in a major trading group like the European Economic Community or the European Free Trade Area.  There are not of course the same obstacles to joining the EFTA as there are to entering the European Economic Community, nor are there the same advantages.  This is a matter which, like all other possibilities, the Government will continue to keep under examination.  It might conceivably emerge at some future date that the national interest would be served by joining EFTA as an interim step <Col N="1318" /> towards participation in a wider European Community.  For the present, however, it seems sensible to concentrate on our relations with our principal trading partner, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the British Prime Minister and myself at our meeting last November agreed that the two Governments should consult together about the possibilities of improving the trading relations between the two countries.  Discussions have since been continuing at the level of officials and matters are now reaching a stage at which can be discerned the outline of possible improvement in our trade relations which, if agreement can be reached, would confer additional advantages on both sides and would at the same time be consistent with the eventual entry of both countries to an enlarged European community.</P>
    <P>Any new trading arrangements must be well balanced and must provide opportunities for an increased flow of trade between the two countries with reasonable scope for expanding our agricultural exports to the British market. By using these opportunities to the full we can ensure continued economic progress and so help to prepare the economy for eventual entry into a larger trading group in which we shall have to face wider competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what we are now talking about.  Reference might be made to the plan or idea attributed to the British Prime Minister for some form of arrangement or liaison between the European Economic Community and EFTA which may take a more precise form at the EFTA Council Meeting which is due to be held on May 24th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the British Prime Minister has asked for a meeting of the EFTA Council at Prime Minister level.  It is not yet known what is the scope of the action he may propose or what ideas he may ask the Council to consider but there is some considerable Press speculation in that connection.  The purpose may be to <Col N="1319" /> achieve no more at this time than to prevent a crystallisation of the two blocs and very probably he does not think that a lasting or satisfactory solution of the problem of the European situation can be accomplished at this stage.  The project for setting up a European Free Trade Area, in the negotiations of which we participated, and which died in November, 1958 does not seem to us to be capable of revival.  EFTA was never so far as we know envisaged heretofore as an end in itself but as a possible step to a wider European Common Market but it may last for some time and may even go on to the consideration of measures which will bring it closer to the concept of a common market including the extension of its scope to cover agricultural arrangements.</P>
    <P>The significance of these events, in my judgment, is that they show that some movement has been introduced again into this situation and that this seems to be mainly on the initiative of the British Government.  While it is impossible to say what may eventuate it is not unlikely that events may begin to move, if they move at all, rapidly enough.</P>
    <P>In the course of some speeches during the election campaign.  I made known the Government's concern about the situation which is developing in respect of the rising level of local rates. The House was informed previously that the Government are examining this position in detail.  The inquiries which were set up have been completed and the Minister for Local Government has informed me that the material upon which policy decisions can be based is now collected and available. The method by which decisions can best be reached is now under our consideration. There is something to be said for a Government Commission, provided it could be so constituted as to enable it to submit a report without delay which would mean confining it to people who are more or less whole-time engaged in employment related to this matter.  There is certainly a sufficient element of urgency to indicate the choice of the speediest method of getting decisions made.  In a matter of <Col N="1320" /> this kind, on which there is a great deal of misinformation current in the country and a widespread tendency to brush aside as of no consequence difficulties which are very real indeed, the publication of the considered report of a commission or of a Government White Paper of a factual and preliminary kind would help to provoke public discussion and to make that discussion more useful.  It could also contribute both to the clarification of the purposes to be achieved and help to secure some measure of agreement as to methods.</P>
    <P>I accept that any proposals relating to the financing of our local authorities are bound to provoke opposition by some interests and to be generally controversial in character.  We do not expect other people to share our responsibilities and we certainly do not anticipate avoiding criticism of whatever we may propose but it would be helpful if the criticism could be kept within such limits as would facilitate speedy as well as effective action.  In this matter, that is to say, the means by which decisions on policy can now be put in train, I expect to be in a position to make known the Government's view in a matter of a few weeks.</P>
    <P>Every Budget is, of course, received with disappointment by some interests who are either seeking tax reliefs or increased Exchequer subventions and, long before the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance was available to the majority of our people, these disappointments had been expressed on the one hand by the spokesman of the Federation of Irish Industries and on the other by a spokesman of the National Farmers Association.  There is always a tendency to ignore increased provision for particular services set out in the Book of Estimates or decisions already announced by the Government although the purpose of the Budget is to make arrangements to meet the costs of these decisions, made and announced earlier, as well as to meet the cost of new proposals which are not announced until Budget Day. There is always a temptation on the part of a Government to keep the announcement of any improvement of <Col N="1321" /> Government services or new arrangement of a popular kind for the Budget Statement but this is often undesirable from an administrative point of view and both in respect of the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and the announcement regarding the bonus for quality milk the Minister for Agriculture and the Government agreed that these announcements should not be withheld for the Budget Statement even though it might have eased some political problem for us.</P>
    <P>In the case of agriculture, the Estimate provides for services to agriculture in this year which will get over £3 million more than last year and the cost of the quality milk scheme has to be added to that.  Details of the Government's proposed expenditure are set out in the White Paper which was circulated to Deputies entitled &ldquo;Current Budget Tables&rdquo;.  It will be seen that the main increases to be met in this year are a further £1,600,000 in respect of milk subsidy and another £1,300,000 in respect of relief of rates. The total cost of these items alone is not far short of the whole cost in this year of the higher social welfare services which have been announced.</P>
    <P>As far as the comments of the Federation of Irish Industries are concerned, there are, no doubt, many forms of tax remission which would be helpful to industrial expansion but which are just not practicable in this year.  Whether some of them may be considered in future years it is not now possible to say.  It never was and it never will be possible to do all that we would wish either in respect of tax reliefs or higher Government spending, much less all that people would desire us to do in these matters.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the Minister for Finance has announced, have tried to make available to Deputies and to the country the maximum information possible about our national circumstances. There is much more knowledge available now to the Government, to Deputies and to the country regarding the state of our affairs than ever before and, indeed, without this great accession of detailed information regarding these affairs the preparation and fulfilment of the Government's programme <Col N="1322" /> for economic expansion would hardly have been possible at all and certainly the detailed supervision of the fulfilment of that programme would be much more difficult.</P>
    <P>Our task as a Government is to point out to the Dáil and to the country what can be achieved provided the necessary conditions are created.  provided our people make the necessary effort, and to warn them of any dangers that we foresee.</P>
    <P>In the course of a general election, it is not unusual for every political Party to try to create the impression that their victory at the polls will remove all difficulties and facilitate progress in every way.  After a general election and irrespective of the result, there is always a need to present the national circumstances again in a realistic and factual way so that the work of national development will be resumed in a commonsense manner.</P>
    <P>The forecasts for this year set out in the documents which have been made available to Deputies show continuous progress but, again, it must be emphasised that these are forecasts, not promises.  The Government will do all that is possible to make these forecasts come true but we will need the help of every organised element in our community and particularly the avoidance of courses which could operate to defeat us.  Given this help and given this co-operation, I hope that next year it will be possible for us to record another significant advance on every front of the national endeavour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's undertaking to make a statement on the occasion of the Budget on the future relations of this country with the Common Market naturally excited anticipation. I listened to the Taoiseach today speaking on the Common Market and on the European Free Trade Area and I do not think I offend against charity if I say that his allocution on that subject was about as clear as mud.  We know just precisely as much now as we knew before he began talking on this topic.  After all the circumlocution is disposed of, we get back to the fundamental question: if Great Britain does <Col N="1323" /> not enter the Common Market in 1970 what does Ireland propose to do?  Is it the policy of our Government to enter the Common Market while Great Britain remains outside it and, if so, what do the Government propose to do when the Common Market tariff wall rises between this country and Great Britain?</P>
      <P>Everybody in the House who understands these problems knows perfectly well that the kind of vague maundering in which the Taoiseach engaged this morning on this subject is ludicrous and irrelevant.  The plain inescapable economic fact is, if Great Britain enters the Common Market in 1970, it will be possible and almost obligatory on us to do the same thing.  If Great Britain does not enter the Common Market, it is economically impossible for us to do so in 1970 or any other year because our trade relations with Great Britain are of such fundamental importance that it is unthinkable that we would allow the Common Market tariff wall to rise between us and the market in which we do more than 70 per cent of our entire external trade.  I do not know what the Taoiseach has in mind on this subject now, any more than I did before he spoke, but I am glad that his mind has been opened to the fact that the European Free Trade Area agreement is in a process of flux and that the question of extending its functions to agriculture is under review.</P>
      <P>If EFTA should be expanded to deal not only with industrial goods but with agricultural produce as well, then this country would have very carefully to consider the desirability of acceding to that agreement and becoming part of EFTA and joining in the general trend that could reasonably be anticipated over the next ten or 20 years of a growing approximation between EFTA and the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We waited with interest to hear what the Taoiseach had to say on the subject of rates.  It is quite true, as he suddenly discovered after the election campaign, that the rates situation is becoming intolerable and he announced today that he proposed to inform us of the Government's intentions in this regard.  If his statement in <Col N="1324" /> regard to the Common Market was as clear as mud, his statement in regard to the rates situation was as clear as a pea-soup fog and boiled down to the fact that he proposed to set up a commission to examine the whole question, with the assurance that the Minister for Local Government has collected the material which that commission could profitably excogitate.  We are not going to get much forrader by erecting a commission.  Everybody in the country knows what the position is, that is, that rates have reached a level which people can no longer afford to pay and people living in towns and villages in the country who do not get any relief from the agricultural grant are finding the situation utterly intolerable. If, now, the only proposal to meet that situation is to set up a commission, then the people of the country will legitimately have a grave sense of disappointment at the announcement the Taoiseach made on the subject here today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, in opening this debate yesterday, directed the attention of the House to the extremely reckless and evil practice of furnishing the House with false information. Whether that was done from cowardice or from sheer laziness, I am not in a position to say, but it is a great evil, a shocking thing, that Ministers should come in and furnish the House with false figures and when these figures are by published record demonstrably false, the Minister for Finance does not even bother to express regret to the House or to offer the House any explanation about the discrepancies that have arisen.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to this growing evil and very serious danger of false information being furnished to the House by Ministers of an Irish Government.  People only too often forget that our whole way of life in this country depends on the proper functioning of Oireachtas Éireann.  We operate here in Dáil Éireann under self-imposed rules and obligations. Ministers accept the obligation of making available to Members of this House on requisition, true information. The moment that obligation ceases to bind Ministers of an Irish Government, <Col N="1325" /> then Dáil Éireann can no longer function as a free and effective Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time Ministers have come in here and as far as any human, detached judgement can function, sought deliberately to mislead the House.  It is only two years since I heard the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance of that day defend in this House their proposal to introduce the turnover tax, on the ground that they had no other source to which to turn. They gave it as their considered judgment acting on the best advice they could get from the Revenue Commissioners, that the traditional sources of taxation were no longer capable of yielding revenue, and for that reason they had to make a dramatic departure and tax the necessaries of every person living in the country through a turnover tax.  They defended the proposals to tax the essential food, fuel and clothing of the people, on the ground that they had no other source to which to turn.  Yet the same Government, not in one Budget but in two succeeding Budgets have returned to tobacco, beer, spirits and petrol and propose to raise, by additional taxes imposed on these four commodities, a sum approximating to that which the turnover tax produced.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is unreasonable to say that this is yet another instance of a deliberate decision on the part of the Government to mislead the House. I do not believe they ever had the advice that the traditional sources of taxation would not yield the required revenue, and I believe their action in the two subsequent years makes that manifest.  It is a shocking thing that an Irish Government should sink to the level of an expedient of that kind in order to sell to the people the new concept of taxation which they knew they could not persuade the people to accept except on the basis of a misrepresentation of which I cannot but feel they knew they were guilty at the time they made it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask this question.  We have built up in this country a system of social services which functions within a certain framework.  I am amused today to hear the Taoiseach reacting <Col N="1326" /> most energetically and violently against the description employed by us in the general election of the just society, and expressing his detestation of such a phrase.  It is a phrase which has produced some results.  It has thrown the Taoiseach into a panic of self-justification here today and has actually produced some results in the Budget proposals, which we welcome.</P>

      <P>One of the proposals in this Budget, which, typically enough, is represented in the Government-kept newspaper as 10/- a week for old age pensioners, is of an entirely novel character.  We jettisoned the means test normally associated with the administration of old age pensions and we are now creating a new means test which provides 10/- a week increase on the basic rate for those who have an income of £26 a year or less and of 5/- for all those who have an income in excess of £26 a year.</P>

    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what would have been the cost of a straight increase of 10/- in the basic rate.  Would it have added very materially to the burden ?  Would it have been impossible to find the revenue to provide that basic increase ? It is a cruel thing, and I believe it will prove to be an unjust thing to create a new category of persons who are entitled to this supplement to their old age pension.  I do not know of any old age pensioner in this country who can be described as very prosperous or well-to-do.  There will be thousands and thousands of old people excluded from the additional 5/-, which, at first glance, they expect to get under the <Col N="1327" /> Budget proposals, by a fiction that they have an income of £30 a year.  That will create a deep sense of grievance which at present the means test, which is graduated in shillings rather than in jumps of 5/-, has so far avoided.  The Minister ought, before these proposals are finally disposed of by the House, reconsider this proposal and see if this 10/- increase cannot be given on the basic rate of income for old age pensioners and eliminate this new concept of creating two categories.</P>
    <P>I presume this idea is a revival of the procedure that obtained during the War in which, for certain persons living in the cities and urban areas, there was a supplement given by way of fuel and even, I think, food, to the value of 5/-. That system obtained up to 1947; then we incorporated that supplement in the basic rate of old age pension in 1948 and made a flat rate for the whole country.  It is a retrograde step to reintroduce that system now and the Minister ought to consider changing his mind in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I thought one of the most dramatic paragraphs in the Taoiseach's speech today was when he spoke of his experience in 1957, meeting the Dublin Corporation and being told they had so many more houses than they had tenants to go into them that they did not think it necessary to build any more houses.  I wonder did that conversation ever take place.  I doubt if the Corporation ever said they did not think it was necessary to build more houses, because the Corporation ought to have known, and probably did know, the real nature of the housing problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, one thing is now conceded, that in 1957 we had more houses in this country than we had tenants to put into them.  The Taoiseach has said that he was confronted with that situation when he came back into office in 1957.  Compare that situation with the situation today. There are families living in Griffith Barracks and an unfortunate woman living on the doorstep of a house in Mountjoy Square, holding up a <Col N="1328" /> placard bearing the legend: &ldquo;I was evicted from this house.  I have nowhere else to go and no one will offer me a shelter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seeks to cover up that disgraceful record with promises of marvels in Ballymun.  I should like to hear more about Ballymun.  I am not in the least impressed by Ballymun. I know it is a wonderful thing to sign a contract for £9 million with a big firm of English contractors.  Nine million pounds is a great deal of money.  I should like to know what value will we get for the expenditure of that money in Ballymun.  What will the individual housing units cost? What will the rents be?  What advantage did an English consortium of builders offer that a consortium of Irish builders was not in a position to supply?</P>
    <P>Novelty in itself is no recommendation. I wish somebody would undertake&mdash;I suppose it should be the Minister for Local Government, but I doubt if he will&mdash;to give us further relevant particulars in relation to what happened about Ballymun and why it was thought desirable to sign this £9 million contract with the English consortium of builders.  I can assure the Minister for Finance that there will be further very close inquiry into the whole background of this transaction and its probable outcome before we finish with Ballymun.  I have heard nothing so far which leads me to believe that any advantage is available under this arrangement which could not have been just as readily got by the ordinary secure procedure of public tender where everybody knows what every contractor is prepared to do and for how much in contradistinction to the strange procedure adopted in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I understand that certain persons, whose authority is quoted as giving their approval and approbation to some of these plans, have indignantly denied they were ever consulted.  I admit that the Minister for Finance though he was not then Minister for Finance, was not personally consulted about this matter; but, if he had been, he should have taken a very close interest in this whole transaction.  I <Col N="1329" /> assume we must wait now for the Minister for Local Government to explain the Ballymun adventure to us in greater detail than possibly the Minister for Finance is in a position to do.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance, however, a very specific question.  It strikes, I think, at the heart of the whole question of whether or not this Government is really in earnest about making houses available. At the moment, there are hundreds of people anxious to build their own houses, hundreds of people who have made arrangements to build them, who have entered into agreements with building societies to finance the transactions and who now find that the buildings societies say they have not got the money and they cannot advance the loan.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance is there any reason why he does not send for the building societies, individually or collectively, and say to them: &ldquo;If you are short of money I will deposit with you, the same as any ordinary depositer, a sum of £1 million and go and lend the money to the people who want to build houses.&rdquo;  So far as I know, that would cost the Government nothing and it would put in train the building of far more houses in the next 48 hours than the Ballymun scheme will do in the next four years.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that a great many of these houses are of a category more expensive than municipal houses, but it is equally true that, in respect of at least half of them, tenants are moving into them from houses they at present occupy.  If we facilitated these people in building their own houses forthwith the houses in which they at present live would become available for those who cannot afford to build houses for themselves and who want houses to rent. Perhaps, the Minister would give us an express answer to that constructive proposal for the expedition of the housing programme.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, this is a proposal which would produce more houses in 48 hours than Ballymun will produce in four years, and it will cost the Government nothing.  All the Government need do is provide the money the <Col N="1330" /> same as any depositor does with the building societies and tell the building societies to go ahead.  I shall be interested to hear what the Minister for Finance has to say on that concrete proposal for easing the housing problem at present afflicting the country.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House unduly, but there is one topic that requires to be examined by this House. It is a topic to which Dáil Éireann never likes to turn its mind.  The Minister referred in the earlier part of his Budget speech, in a very gingerly way, to the particular matter.  I want to put it to the House that any country which finds itself simultaneously confronted with a steady rise in the cost of living, a steady rise in the adverse balance of trade and a steady increase in the adverse balance of payments is in great danger of economic disaster.  If these three things are allowed to proceed <i>pari passu</i> unchecked economic catastrophe is as certain as tomorrow's day will dawn.  I refer to the Consumer Price Index, Table 16 in the Appendix of the Central Bank Report for April, 1965.  Taking mid-August, 1947, as the base year of 100, the consumer price index for all items has risen from 160 in February, 1963, to 177 in February, 1965.  I believe it has gone up again since.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is steadily and relentlessly rising and it will be a useful and salutary practice for every Deputy in this House to compare the value of wages, social service payments, and receipts by the agricultural community for their produce with the cost-of-living figures as recorded in these tables.  It is true to say, I think, that the farmers were getting more for creamery milk in terms of purchasing power in 1948 than they are getting today.  Yet, the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, are continually thumping their chest about the subsidies they have to find for the farmers for the output of milk.  I believe the price the farmers receive for milk today is lower in purchasing power than the price they received in 1948.</P>
    <P>Those are the figures in regard to <Col N="1331" /> the cost of living.  The adverse balance of trade of this country for the twelve months ended March, 1965 are referred to in <i>Economic Statistics</i> for 1965, page 5, which states:</P>
    <P>The provisional figures for the import excess in the twelve months ended March, 1965 was £136.8 million, a further increase attributable equally to the rise in the value of imports and to the fall in the value of exports in the first quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any recent authoritative estimated figure for the adverse balance of payments for the twelve months ended 31st March, but I do not think I exaggerate when I say it will fall between £30 million and £32 million.  I believe if these trends continue the country will be faced with an economic crisis of formidable proportions.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country at present who console themselves that the adverse balance of payments is not producing that reduction in the net external assets of the banking system which might ordinarily be expected because there is a substantial influx of foreign capital.  Has anybody asked himself the question: what level of imports of foreign capital is desirable?  How far do we think it expedient to sell this country to external financial interests?  Do we differentiate or intend to differentiate between foreign capital that comes in here to start a new enterprise and which will generate exports sufficient to meet the annual cost of financing that capital import, and the influx of capital designed not to start a new enterprise, not to create new exports, but to purchase as an investment an existing industry or enterprise exclusively functioning within our economy, such as the distributive trade, the dairy trade and a variety of other activities which have recently been made the subject of take-overs by large international combines?</P>
    <P>If we propose to sell the whole country, land and services, to foreign enterprises, we can for a considerable time continue to live on the proceeds <Col N="1332" /> of our sales.  But is it false philosophy to say that, if we are prepared to do that, the British must have been mad to spend so much blood, sweat and tears to conquer this country during seven centuries when in seven years they could buy the whole thing for £.s.d.?  What was the point of all the blood, sweat and tears?  If they had only discovered this exquisite device, all that would have been unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Do we want to sell out the whole country?  It began with the purchase of land.  It is now spreading to the city of Dublin.  I think Deputy Moore knows the number of large buildings in the city of Dublin built by foreign capital and the number of enterprises taken over by foreign combines, which generate no new exports but which collect profits.  How far do we propose to go in the sale of land and enterprises of that kind to foreign capital?  If we are prepared to go the whole hog and sell everything we can find, nobody will deny that we can finance an adverse balance of payments for quite a considerable time.  But, sooner or later, we will come to the end of that road.</P>
    <P>Deputies would do well to ask themselves what lies at the end of the road when we have nothing more to sell.  I welcome the advent of foreign capital into this country when it results in the creation of a new industry, gives good employment to our people and generates exports sufficient to meet the charges which will come in course of payment when the investor proceeds to collect his interest on the investment he has made.  But I view with suspicion and growing apprehension the practice of selling agricultural land and property in our towns and cities and the right to function in our distributive trade and other services for money which is at present being used to cover up the economic consequences of an adverse balance of payments, which should engage our earnest attention and which we should concern ourselves to eliminate without recourse to the sale of assets such as I have described.</P>
    <P>I concede that the Minister referred to this problem in the opening paragraph of his Budget speech, but he did not tell us what he proposed to do <Col N="1333" /> about it.  With a cost-of-living index figure of 177 in February, 1965, an adverse trade balance of £136.8 million in our visible trade and an adverse balance of payments of £30 million, it is time we faced the facts of economic life.  It is the function and duty of the Minister for Finance to face them in the presence of this House and to tell us what the Government propose to do about the situation.  The steady rise in the cost of living is a burden on those sections of our people least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>I could elaborate at length on a variety of other aspects of the cost of living, but I elect deliberately, for the purpose of bringing this whole problem into focus, to dwell on this tripartite dilemma&mdash;rising cost of living, rising adverse balance of trade, rising adverse balance of payments.  That cannot go on indefinitely.  What remedy do the Government propose whereby to correct this deadly evil which, if allowed to continue, will one day have to be faced?  The longer we wait to face it the greater menace it will become for the survival of this country, not only in economic freedom but in political freedom too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like just briefly to refer to a few points which I feel should be drawn to the attention of the Minister.  Firstly, I should like to congratulate him on his Budget.  It is a good Budget by Fianna Fáil standards.  Certainly, when we compare it with the budgets of some of his Fianna Fáil predecessors in office, it is almost benevolent.  We all remember some of the unhappy, harsh and cruel budgets his predecessors in office inflicted on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad, as it is the Minister's first Budget, that he has set a change of course and has set a new example both to his Party and to any successors that the object of the Budget should not be to oppress the people.  Benevolence to those who are most in need of it is something to be aimed at.  The fact that the Government have seen fit to increase the old age pension by 10/- a week, even though this increase is only 5/- for the vast majority of the old <Col N="1334" /> age pensioners, is something to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other way around.  The vast majority will get the full increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not go the whole hog and give it to everybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that the vast majority will get the 10/-.  Why did he not extend his heart, as Deputy Dillon said, and give it to all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would oppose the tax&mdash;at least Fine Gael would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You can be sure the Labour Party will not oppose taxation when it is in a just cause.  It is certain the Minister would have the support of the Labour Party if he extended his heart and gave the increase to all old age pensioners.  I accept that the increase goes to the majority of the people.  I am delighted to hear that. The fact that the Government have seen fit to give such a large increase to the social welfare section of the community is an admission by them that the previous rate of 37/6 a week was no longer acceptable.  Surely, as the Chinese would say, this is the year of the social conscience.  First, we have Fine Gael developing one and now, in the past day or two, Fianna Fáil have provided us with one as well.  Was it only the worry of the 72 seats and the possibility of by-elections which brought forth this measure of generosity on the part of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to impose the necessary taxation to finance the increase is one which we in the Labour Party&mdash;I will not say we are happy to support it&mdash; are prepared to support.  We are prepared to accept responsibility for the taxation which is necessary if these increases are to be given.  The fact that we supported the Government and voted for the taxation was not that we wished to vote for taxes as such, but to demonstrate to Fianna Fáil and the country that we not merely advocate higher social welfare benefits but <Col N="1335" /> are prepared to carry the burden of providing the means to make these increases possible.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes new taxes, we all know, but at least, in this case, there was some justification for them.  There is just one type of tax which was increased in the Budget and on which I am afraid I cannot see eye to eye with the Government.  This was the increase in the tax on spirits and beer. I feel that the tax on imported spirits should have been at a higher rate than on home-produced spirits.  I am not saying that an increase on home-produced spirits was not necessary at all but that it should have been possible to impose a higher tax on imported spirits.  I feel we must protect our home industry, particularly at this time when Irish spirits going into the English Market are subject to a ten per cent tariff.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating a new form of protection, a new form of tariff or taxation, but, since it was necessary to increase the price to bring in extra revenue, I feel our own industry should have been considered more benevolently and that imported Scotch, which is the main competitor, should have been hit at least this year more than it was.  This is a very important industry and one which relies totally on our own resources.  I feel the Minister has not been considerate enough in dealing with this industry.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention is the turnover tax.  I am glad to see the Minister did not touch this.  I should like to think that perhaps he is bringing a fresh mind to bear on this and that he will consider the application and collection of this tax in a different way.  The principle of the turnover tax is not, I think, disagreeable to anybody.  It is the method of collecting off every single item which is most unfair.  The Minister should consider collecting this tax at source, at the factory, if manufactured here, or at the port, if imported.  We already have customs officers at the port and if the tax were collected there and at the factory, it would be a far cheaper process.  It would be far simpler and would give rise to less chance of evasion.  It would be more economic to <Col N="1336" /> collect and it would remove a lot of irritation and many of the difficulties which the Minister must experience in collecting this tax from thousands and thousands of small retailers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It would also have another important effect.  It would be possible to vary the rate of tax from industry to industry. There is a very good case to be made for having a higher rate of turnover tax on luxury items.  I can see no reason why luxury goods such as motor cars, jewellery, furs and other such items should not be taxed at a very high rate. The price is not important if a person wants to buy these things.  There is no reason why the State should not impose an extra tax on these items as well as on cosmetics and other semi-luxury goods.  The rate of tax for these goods could vary from industry to industry. This would make it possible to exempt foodstuffs and essential medicines from the tax.  The turnover tax should not be applied to these items.</P>
    <P>The case which the Government made when the turnover tax was introduced was that it was impossible to differentiate between one article and another.  This difficulty would be overcome if the tax were collected at source.  A higher rate of tax on nonessentials or luxuries would more than make up for the yield from the tax on the essential items of life.  This would be both social and economic justice.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the absence of any type of prices advisory body.  It seems peculiar that the Government see fit completely to ignore the necessity for such a body.  When we had a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce the Prices Advisory Body was set up and, while it may not have been exactly what everybody wanted, it did give a measure of justice and worked extremely well.  Anybody who contemplated increasing his prices knew he might have to justify the increases before a tribunal.  Every manufacturer must feel the temptation to slip on a little extra for himself.  When the Prices Advisory Body was in operation, not only were the public made aware of the reasons for price increases but justice was done and seen to be <Col N="1337" /> done.  It is important that the public should have confidence that, when prices are increased, they are not being robbed or put upon and that the Government have some control in the matter.</P>
    <P>I come now to the availability of credit in banks operating in this country.  There is a pretty severe credit squeeze in operation by the commercial banks in this country at the moment.  There may be a case for curtailing the purchasing power of the public in order to reduce the balance of payments deficit but I feel it should be directed towards the non-essential type of expenditure.  Consider, for instance, motor cars and other luxuries, some of which are not essential.</P>
    <P>When people apply for loans for houses, for business rebuilding, for expansion or for any sensible purpose which creates a lasting asset, it is stupid, unnecessary and unreasonable that the banks should be allowed to operate a policy of credit restriction which makes no distinction between what is desirable, what is unnecessary and what is absolutely frivolous.  Considerable amounts of foreign capital are coming into this country to purchase our land, houses, businesses and property.  Yet this is the time the Irish banks choose to restrict loans to their customers.  It is not a matter of creditworthiness but just a policy of credit restriction.</P>
    <P>We are not to be given credit facilities to enable us to compete with this invasion of foreign capital into our country.  Deputy Dillon said we could survive economically for a long while if we are prepared to sell our country piecemeal.  It is unwise to part with any of our assets to foreign control.  We should be foolish to refuse capital from abroad which will be used to set up new industries, to give employment and know-how and to help exports.  Indeed, we should do all we can to ensure that this type of capital comes into our country.  However, in the case of money brought over here for safe keeping, some of it hot money in the sense that the owners cannot explain it away to their own Government, it is a different matter because such money contributes <Col N="1338" /> nothing to the national economy and is only making Irish people tenants and workers in their own country.  If such foreign money is used to buy up existing assets, property and business, I think it should be resisted.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Munster and Leinster Bank, the policy of banks operating here, with headquarters in London from which the credit policies are directed, is to restrict credit and it is unwise and silly that we should allow this to continue.  It is noteworthy that when the banks wish to rebuild or extend or make their existing premises more lavish there is no shortage of funds for that purpose.  They, themselves, are not subject to any form of credit restriction while their unfortunate customers are kept short.  Such a shortsighted credit policy should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always liked to call themselves the Irish Republican Party. This restriction of credit policy is neither Irish nor republican.  I hope the Minister will change this policy and ensure that Irish business people are enabled to compete with foreign money here and that our banks will operate in the interests of their Irish customers and not in the interests of their English masters.</P>
    <P>I shall be interested to hear if the Minister has anything to say about changing the turnover tax to a more sensible and economic way of collecting money.  I shall also be very interested to hear if he has any views on our commercial banks operating their loans to assist Irish people to compete with foreign capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy, I am somewhat disappointed with the contributions to this debate from the Opposition benches.  I had hoped for more constructive views.  Criticism is always welcome, provided it is constructive, but what I have heard in this debate has fallen very far short of my expectations.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party spoke this morning and we can expect a new line of approach from that Party with regard to national affairs.  I think he indicated that his Party are prepared to be constructive <Col N="1339" /> and practical in their approach to national affairs.</P>
      <P>Last evening Deputy Donegan said that Fianna Fáil never had a social policy.  We always had a social policy but we were never satisfied that sufficient was done to meet the needs of the less fortunate.  I am sure this Budget will clear the minds of the public in that respect where the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned.  I am not one who likes to look back, I prefer to look to the future, so I shall not comment on the policy of Fine Gael with regard to social justice in the past.  I shall leave that to the people who remember it best.</P>
      <P>Last night many Deputies stood up here and attacked all aspects of Fianna Fáil policy.  It makes one wonder why this Party have always had the support of a majority of the people.  Of course, the answer is given by the people, who are against unwarranted criticism. Yesterday housing was mentioned here. We have many problems in Cork city with regard to housing but I should like to make one thing clear: Never have the Department of Local Government held up our housing programme in Cork.  We have in the city at the moment an acute shortage of labour. That is a good thing, to my mind, and we have on many occasions met the various traders involved in building and have discussed ways and means to improve our housing output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an increasing population in Cork city, another problem confronting the local authority.  I should mention also that there is a lack of building sites at the moment.  We hope, especially on the southern side of our city, on the extension of the borough boundary, that this position will be rectified.  I think it only right to say that the manager and his officials are doing everything in their power to speed up the housing programme in Cork city.  There is a demand for houses there, a natural development in a situation in which there is an improved standard of living and an increased population.  I feel that closer co-operation between the <Col N="1340" /> local authorities and the Department of Local Government will in some way help to ease this position.  A long-term policy is essential and I hope that all the local authorities will get down to this particular task of planning for the future so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan said last night we should go and look at the housing position in Great Britain.  I do not think the Deputy was very serious when he made that suggestion. Every fairminded member of this Dáil knows of the awful housing conditions in Great Britain.  The Deputy must have been there on his holidays wearing black sunglasses when he did not see the derelict sites around Birmingham and Manchester.</P>
    <P>Industrially, great progress has been made in recent years.  That cannot be denied and the people in Cork will vouch for it.  The time has come when we should no longer look to the Government to provide new industries.  It is, to my mind, essential that local authorities and voluntary organisations such as chambers of commerce should get together and find new industries. It has proved successful in other parts of the country and we should be thinking on those lines now.  I hope this new Dáil will in some way encourage that kind of approach to industry. There is no point in coming in here, shedding crocodile tears and making speeches mainly in support of one's personal reputation where industry is concerned.  That will never provide industries.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal with any other aspect of this because I think the Taoiseach dealt fully with it this morning, but I do hope this new Dáil will set about putting aside its political affiliations and will settle down and do constructive work for the nation.  That is what is wanted today.  The people are looking to this House for that kind of guidance, and it is our responsibility and our duty now to provide it.</P>

      <Col N="1341" /> I should like to advert to two points raised by Deputy Norton.  The first relates to his suggestion that the turnover tax should be collected at source. That was debated at length when the turnover tax went through this House and it was seen that one of the reasons which determined the Minister for Finance at that time to have it collected at the pay level was the simple reason of getting more money.</P>

Many of them thought that if it were applied at source, they would find it more tolerable.  The amount of annoyance they get in trying to get the matter straightened is their main objection.  I am sure there are many other Deputies who during the election campaign were told the same story.  If so, they should get up and tell the Minister and it might help in getting the matter reappraised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): Some of us object to the principle but we object also in that we believe the turnover tax should not apply to such items as food and clothing.  The Minister should reconsider the method of collecting it at source.  Perhaps he could bring about an alteration by regulation.</P>
      <P>The question of the creation of bad credit, mentioned by Deputy Norton, is another matter to which I would ask the Minister to address his attention. We have very reputable commercial banking concerns.  In the nature of things, their first loyalty is to their depositors and their shareholders. They are commercial concerns, and if it is a question of giving an advance for a local dance hall&mdash;which might be a good investment from the banks' point of view&mdash;or perhaps to a local building project &mdash;which they might be more doubtful about&mdash;they would naturally tend to give the advance more readily to the concern which they felt had the better collateral or security.</P>
      <P>In most countries banking credit is managed by the Central Bank, but in this country it is mainly in the hands of the commercial banks.  There should be closer correlation between the economic policy of the Government, on the one hand, and the credit policy exercised by the Central Bank, on the other.  This would bring fiscal and economic policy more into the sort of harmony which obtains in most other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a considerable influx of capital here over the past two or three years.  I should like the Minister to give us some indication as to how that influx of foreign capital has been distributed, roughly.  Some foreign capital has come in for industrial development.  That is very welcome. Undoubtedly some has come in to buy equity shares on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  Unfortunately some <Col N="1343" /> has come in to buy land and to buy hospitals.  Of course some has come in to buy loans floated.  I think Aer Lingus floated a loan in New York. This will have to be repaid.  Undoubtedly some of the capital which has come in has been the panic transfer of capital from Britain, due to the political situation obtaining there.</P>
    <P>Our economic position here faces four difficulties at the moment.  Deputy Dillon has mentioned three of them: the rising cost of living, difficulties with our trade balance occasioning an adverse balance of payments, and a tendency for our external reserves to fall.  For the latter half of last year, our trading position as regards exports deteriorated.  For the first quarter of this year, our imports have increased in the region of £5 million, and our exports have decreased by a corresponding amount.  For the past few years, we have enjoyed good terms of trade: by that I mean prices for imports <i>vis-á-vis</i> prices for exports.  If there is a reduction in the inflow of capital which has come in here in the past few years, and if the terms of trade begin to run against us, we could have a very unpleasant recession here, and all this talk about our expanding economy would receive a serious jar.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in this House before, ours is a very fragile economy.  In the past year in the United States there was a balance of payments deficit of approximately £1,000 million; yet that country had a trade balance of approximately the same amount, because the United States were exporting dollars.  The United States have tremendous foreign investments and very expensive military commitments abroad. They could rectify their difficulties by simply withdrawing their foreign commitments. A country with such tremendous reserves could rectify any difficulty.  A country like that can pursue a policy of a planned balance of payments deficit with impunity, but a country like ours cannot so readily pursue a policy of a planned balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>According to the economic advisers, it would be inadvisable for us to pursue <Col N="1344" /> a policy which gives a balance of payments deficit of much less than £16 million per year.  That is the figure suggested in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> but I find that this year we have a balance of payments deficit of £30 million odd, and it is prognosticated that we will have a similar deficit next year: that our exports will increase and our imports will increase by exactly the same amount.  It is not impossible that our balance of payments deficit might not be more than £30 million next year.  It was stated that if we had bad trading terms it would have been £5 million or £6 million higher this year than it was.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some information as to the nature of this capital influx, because it is a rather important matter.  There is no objection to the importation of capital or of know-how to help us stimulate our exports, but we do not want capital, or welcome it, if it is really calculated to buy up the little we have.</P>
    <P>We are not the only country faced with this problem of trying to differentiate between the uses that may be made of capital inflow.  Many reports have been made during the years by leading economists in Canada, for instance, about the buying up of Canada by the United States.  General de Gaulle has been protesting one of his irritations at the large investment of American money in France, giving American industrialists control in France.  We, as a very undeveloped country, need have no fears in that respect at this stage, but we have legitimate grounds for worry if money is coming here merely to escape a difficult political situation in Britain, merely to buy existing assets here without in any way contributing to our productivity or exports.  It is for that reason I have stressed this point.  I ask the Minister for Finance to give us an indication of what this influx of capital consists of.  I expect all the information may not be available to him, but I should be obliged if he would give us the information he has.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when speaking this morning, was anxious to disabuse the House and the public of any notion that the improved social welfare benefits <Col N="1345" /> envisaged in the Budget were in any way due to outside pressure on him or his Party.  I do not think that will be accepted by the rank and file of the general public.  We are all perfectly aware that it was only in the middle of the election period that the Taoiseach announced that social welfare services might have to be adjusted and reconsidered in relation to increased national wealth.  It was a departure in the thinking of the Taoiseach, due entirely to the pressure of the election campaign.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that had there not been a general election, the old age pensioners would not now be getting 10/- extra a week.  They might have got a halfcrown; they might even have got 4/-; but I doubt if they would have got 10/-.  It was also at the height of the election campaign that the Taoiseach thought of the health services and announced that Fianna Fáil as well as Fine Gael were prepared to give free choice of doctor.  I was on the Select Committee on Health Services appointed by this House in 1961, which continued deliberations here until the dissolution of the last Dáil or, to put it more correctly, until the Labour representatives and the Fine Gael representatives resigned and the Committee kind of died of malnutrition. I do not know whether a report will ever be submitted to the House from that Committee but there was no question during the deliberations of that Committee about choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the then Minister for Health was adamant that the dispensary services should be continued with a little improvement here and there, but that, by and large, they constituted an excellent service, having the great advantage that the service was cheap and that one could easily dismiss the doctor.  When, in the middle of the election campaign, the Taoiseach announced there would be free choice of doctor and that Deputy MacEntee would not be seeking reappointment as Minister for Health, these facts seemed to me to hang together and demonstrate pretty clearly that adjustments in social welfare in its narrow sense&mdash; assistance to social welfare classes&mdash;<Col N="1346" /> and health in its narrow sense&mdash;free choice of doctor&mdash;were virtually imposed on the Taoiseach by the election activity and the publicity campaign of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave us a long list of all the social welfare benefits given down through the years but he did not stress that the cost of living mounted steadily and negatived and in many cases completely outbalanced any improved benefits accruing from those increases, so much so that we had a situation arising where many old age pensioners, trying to live on 37/6 a week, were compelled to go into county homes throughout the country, far from their natural environment, simply because they could not afford to live on the small amount of money allowed each week.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach dealt with rates and when he had concluded, I was as wise as when he began.  This question of rates has come up here at Budget time, on every Local Government debate and, year in year out, at Question Time, and so far we have been unable to get any concrete answer from the Government benches about what they propose to do about mounting rates.  On one occasion the reply was given that an economic body were investigating the question.  The body was the Institute for Economic Research, a very excellent body which has submitted various reports on economic affairs.  We were also told that a committee in the Custom House was considering the matter.  On another occasion, the Taoiseach said it might be possible to devise new sources of income for local bodies.  During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, the Minister for Local Government suggested a new source of revenue&mdash;we could increase the rents on pre 1950 houses. Those rents cover 60,000 houses.  The Minister was going to place every local authority in the uncomfortable and unhappy position of going to everybody with a pre-1950 house and saying: &ldquo;We are going to raise your rent to such an amount on such a date&rdquo;.  That is merely passing the burden to somebody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> The latest effort is that a commission is to be set up.  The Taoiseach tells us that he has been assured by the Minister for Local Government that a lot of data have now been collected on which a commission could get to work and after that we would hear something informative and helpful about the entire question of rates.  I hope we do. Certainly we have been waiting a long time and in the meantime the rates have risen to disproportionate levels all over the country.</P>
    <P>The question of housing is a matter of concern to every county councillor, urban councillor and every Deputy; yet down the years we have all experienced the difficulties that arise apparently at local level in regard to the building of houses.  I am satisfied that the difficulties are difficulties not of administration but the result of a deliberate policy decision made by the Government.  The grant for private houses, for instance, is not much higher now than it was in 1958 but the price of building has soared in the meantime. If the Government were sincere about housing, surely the grant should have been raised to a more realistic figure in the past few years?  A housing survey which was begun in 1962 has not yet been completed in many places; yet we have been told by the Minister for Local Government that a survey, for planning proposals, could be made for about 10,000 people within a couple of weeks.  It seems extraordinary that we should have to wait since 1962 for a survey of housing needs which has not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the method of assessment of need has been extremely rigorous in the past.  You had to prove that the house was overcrowded or unfit for human habitation and there was no liberal approach to the method of assessing housing needs.  The latest figure is that we have something like 70,000 unfit houses.  In regard to houses built by local authorities, the Deputy on the opposite side who spoke before me paid tribute to what is being done in Cork.  He found that he was dealing with an excellent manager, excellent officials, and never had any <Col N="1348" /> trouble with the Department.  He admitted that there was an increase in the population but otherwise he found no building difficulties.  What is the position in Cork?  The position is that in 1954, 229 houses were built; in 1955, 317 houses were built; in 1956, 365 houses were built; in 1957, 491 houses were built; in 1958, 366 houses were built; in 1959, 228 houses were built; in 1960, 344, in 1961, 224; and in 1962, 226.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, since my talks with Captain O'Neill, a number of meetings at ministerial level have taken place.  Discussions have also been held at the level of officials.  These meetings and discussions, which covered a wide range of subjects offering possibilities of co-operation and consultation, have already produced concrete results.</P>
      <P>A Joint Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Josiah Eccles has been set up to investigate the scope for agreement in cross-border co-operation between the electricity supply systems, to advise on the economic and technical problems involved and to estimate broadly the savings in costs which might be achieved.  The Committee has already held its first meeting and it is hoped that the investigation will be completed within twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have been invited by the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister of Commerce to appoint a joint committee to consult on any improvements that may be desirable and practical to facilitate and encourage cross-border tourist traffic in both directions, the improvement of <Col N="1349" /> tourist statistics and on promotional efforts.  The Joint Committee would also make recommendations to the two Ministers on further measures of co-operation. The first meeting of the joint committee took place yesterday.</P>
    <P>Improvements have also been made in the arrangements for cross-border traffic, including the provision of four new customs posts, which it is hoped will be in operation for the coming tourist season, and the abolition of the requirement of a triptyque on entering Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of co-operation in trade, industrial research and in the training and retraining of workers were discussed at the meeting between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister of Commerce.  It was arranged that detailed discussions would take place at official level and such meetings have since taken place on industrial research and on training and retraining of workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has had informal meetings with the Miniister of Agriculture of Northern Ireland and the scope for the extension of the wide contacts which already exist is being examined.</P>
    <P>At the meeting between the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, a number of matters were discussed, including the Foyle fisheries, the development of inland fisheries, marketing of fish, processing factories and co-operation in fishery research.  It was agreed that meetings at the level of officials would be arranged to look further into the matters raised in these discussions.</P>
    <P>There was a preliminary review of subjects of common interest at the meeting between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister of Development.  It was agreed to hold further discussions between officials leading to an exchange of information which would facilitate co-ordination on development in the interests of regional planning.  Co-operation in the investigation of traffic, transport and communications systems is also visualised.  Other matters considered were inter-communication methods for assisting tourist traffic, the financing <Col N="1350" /> and integration of arterial roads on each side of the border and construction standards and new methods of building.</P>
    <P>There have been discussions between the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, and the Inspector General of the RUC, as well as between senior officers of the two police forces, on the detection and prevention of crime to which the Extradition Bill now before the Dáil applies.</P>

      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>) asked the Minister for Transport and Power how ESB special service charges are calculated; whether such charges are arrived at on the basis of a rigid formula; and whether there is ever any arbitrary element in their computation.</P>

      <P>As the answer to this question is somewhat lengthy and complicated, I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the answer:</P>
      <P>The provision of electricity supply in a rural area gives rise to substantial costs for service of the capital involved and for subsequent maintenance, repair, etc.  To meet these costs, after allowing for State subsidy amounting to 75 per cent of the capital cost with a maximum of £75 per dwelling, the ESB require a minimum return by way of fixed charge.  The minimum rate of return which at present amounts to 4.5 per cent of the capital cost of connection takes into account not only State subsidy but the surplus arising in those cases where the normal rate of fixed charge is more than sufficient to meet costs.  In cases where the normal rate of fixed charge yields a return of less than 4.5 per cent on the capital cost, the consumer is required to pay a special service charge sufficient to bring his total fixed charges up to this level.  The surplus arising from the most economic connections is thus used to secure the connection of the maximum number of consumers at relatively reasonable charges; to date out of a total of 375,000 rural premises some 313,000 or 83 per cent have been connected of which 21,000 pay special service charges and it is expected that eventually some 360,000 or 95 per cent of all rural premises will be connected of which some 45,000 may be liable for special service charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surplus arising from profitable connections is not, however, sufficient to benefit all rural premises and is not extended to some 12,000 relatively isolated premises which could not in any case be offered connection at a reasonable level of fixed charge.  In these cases electricity is supplied only on payment of special service charges sufficient to yield an economic return on the total capital cost after allowing for maximum State subsidy.  These <Col N="1358" /> premises are, of course, eligible for bottled gas subsidy as an alternative.</P>
    <P>The special service charges are arrived at by a strictly mathematical application of the principles above and the Board does not apply any arbitrary considerations in determining the amount of charge in individual cases or in different areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has examined the powers conferred on housing authorities in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land for the purpose of the provision of sites for private building, having regard to his decision to refuse the confirmation of a compulsory purchase order made by the Naas Urban District Council mentioned in a reply of 5th May, 1964; and if he will make an explanatory statement in relation to the powers of housing authorities to acquire sites in advance of actual need in areas where land owners refuse to sell land to a housing authority, indicating the methods by which a housing authority can secure a compulsory purchase order under existing land acquisition legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing authorities are fully empowered under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Labourers Acts to make compulsory purchase orders for the acquisition of land for the purpose of providing sites for private housing.  The relevant <Col N="1361" /> statutory powers are contained in section 8 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, and sections 31 and 35 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1952.  As regards the compulsory acquisition of land for the purpose of providing such sites in advance of actual need, the position appears to be adequately covered by the provisions of subsection (4) of section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946, which provides that the power conferred on a local authority by any Act to acquire land for a particular purpose shall be deemed to include power to acquire land which the local authority do not require immediately for that purpose but which, in their opinion, they will require for that purpose in the future. In order to substantiate their case for the compulsory acquisition of land in advance of need, a housing authority must be in a position to show that, having regard to the circumstances in the particular area, there is some reasonable expectation that they will require the land in the future for the provision of private housing sites.  This was not done in the case of the Naas compulsory purchase order referred to by the Deputy.  The general question is receiving further consideration in connection with the drafting of the Housing Bill but the intention to have each housing authority prepare a statutory five-year housing programme may be of sufficient assistance to them in compulsory purchase proceedings where section 82 (4) of the 1946 Act is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The powers of planning authorities under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, might also be employed in appropriate cases to ensure that adequate provision is made to meet the needs for private housing sites in particular districts, but in this case also the planning authority must be in a position to put forward a reasonable case in support of compulsory acquisition and to relate it to the objectives in their development plan or proposed to be included in such plan.  The work which is now being done on the preparation of development plans will assist housing authorities in this respect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that a law agent advised a county manager against implementing a section 4 resolution under the 1955 Act regarding the acquisition of land by agreement on the grounds that the estate exceeded forseeable requirements; that the local authority could have purchased it at a reasonable price and sold the surplus area thus acquiring an adequate area for present and future needs; and that the authority now has to pay a high price for building land for present needs and is deprived of land for future needs; and if he intends to introduce legislation to extend the power of local authorities under section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946 to purchase land on offer which may be in excess of requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 82 of the Local Government Act, 1946 enables a local authority with the consent of the Minister, to acquire land by agreement which in their opinion they will require in the future for the purposes of their powers and duties notwithstanding that they have not decided on the use to be made of the land.  In the particular case referred to the council proposed to acquire an estate of 260 acres and a Georgian mansion.  There was evidence that seven acres would satisfy their housing requirements.  The council's legal adviser advised that the acquisition could not be effected under section 82 because any opinion that the council would require the 260 acres in question was unwarranted by the facts.  In the event the estate was acquired by the Land Commission and I understand that the Commission is prepared to consider making a portion of the lands available to the council for housing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of section 82 of the 1946 Act is very wide.  It enables local authorities to acquire land in advance for the purpose of any of their needs, including their functions as housing, roads and sanitary authorities and their powers to undertake or promote structural or amenity development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  I think <Col N="1363" /> it would be wrong to conclude from the particular case in question, and I have no reason to believe, that the powers of local authorities to acquire land by agreement are inadequate to enable them to provide sites as required for the accommodation of public or private housing.  If it should be established that difficulties in this regard are being experienced by local authorities generally I would not hesitate to review the relevant statutory provisions.  I must say, however, that the requirement in section 82 of the 1946 Act that the local authority must be of opinion that they will require the land for the purpose of their powers and functions before committing public funds to its acquisition seems a reasonable reservation if local authorities are not themselves to become involved in speculative land transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the recommendations to which the Deputy refers.  As regards housing accommodation for old people, housing authorities have been asked from time to time to include in their housing schemes a reasonable number of small dwellings of suitable design to meet the needs of small families, particularly old people and a substantial number of these dwellings have already been provided.  The new assessment of housing needs which I propose to require them to make will show the number of dwellings which they will need to provide for elderly persons in their expanded building programmes.  It is also intended to enable subsidy up to the higher rate of 66.2/3 per cent of loan charges to be paid for the housing of elderly persons.</P>
      <P>Apart from local authority action, State grants of £300 per dwelling are available under the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, to bodies providing housing accommodation for elderly persons.  Some philanthropic bodies have already carried out schemes with the aid of these grants and there is reason to expect further progress by the active participation of others.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Health Acts over 85 per cent of the population are estimated to be eligible for services in public hospital accommodation free of charge or at moderate charges which are fixed by Health Authorities having regard to individual financial circumstances, but not exceeding 10/- a day in any case.

      <P>Charges for services provided in local authority hospitals for persons ineligible for hospital services under the Health Acts are adjusted from time to time and are related generally to the rates at which health authorities pay for patients sent by them for treatment in voluntary hospitals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): Before Question Time, I was giving a list of the number of houses built by local authorities from 1954 onwards. In relation to Cork, I had got as far as 1962, for which the figure was 226. For 1963, it was 182.  The Taoiseach said this morning that he was horrified to find 1,500 empty houses in Dublin.  Of course, he has hindsight now and I think we should all be very happy that there were 1,500 empty houses in Dublin at that time.  The demand at the moment is for 10,000 houses and that demand would be larger by 1,500, were it not for the fact that these 1,500 houses were there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the edification of new Deputies, some of whom seem to have been reared in ivory towers, let me give statistics of the building that took place in Dublin over a period.  In 1954, local authority houses built by the inter-Party Government numbered 1,368; in 1955, the number was 1,922; in 1956, 1,311; in 1957, 1,564; in 1958, 1,021.  Then Deputy Lemass returned to Government and discovered 1,500 empty houses.  In 1959 the number of houses built in Dublin by local authority effort was 460; in 1960,505; in 1961, 277; in 1962, 392; in 1963, 643.  That is the picture of the building activity under Fianna Fáil.  In one year, 1961, only 277 local authority houses were built in Dublin, an area occupied <Col N="1382" /> by 25 per cent of the total population of the State.</P>
    <P>To complete the picture, let us take housing activities by local authorities over the country as a whole.  In 1954, 5,643 local authority houses were built; in 1955, 5,267; in 1956, 4,011; in 1957, 4,784; in 1958, 3,467; in 1959, 1,812; in 1960, 2,414; in 1961, 1,463; in 1962, 1,238; in 1963, 1,828.  Clearly, that building rate would not meet ordinary obsolescence, which is circulated at 1¼ per cent.  Some people may be more strict in their calculation of obsolescence rates, but, taking it at 1¼ or 1½ per cent, the rate of building activity represented in the figures I have just quoted would not meet even obsolescence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that the building target envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was reached last year.  Perhaps it was.  I cannot find particulars at the moment amongst these papers I have, but it is true that the amount of money allocated for building was not spent.  It can hardly be contended that the Government are sincere in their housing programme when they fail to spend the money, money to the tune of £1.2 million, provided by the Dáil for the building of houses for our people. Every Deputy in this House must agree with me that the provision of housing for our people is the lowest in Europe. I have travelled fairly extensively in England, Scotland and on the Continent. Judging by what one sees on one's travels our housing situation here is extremely bad.  Whole sections of the capital city are crying out for renewal.  The same applies to the residential areas of Limerick.  Many of our towns are old Norman towns and the buildings in them have long passed their allotted span.  The present housing drive is nothing like adequate to meet the existing housing demand, much less improve the existing position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government exposed his hand rather by his remark here during the debate on Local Government.  I suggest he made the remark inadvertently.  He said it was all right spending a lot of money on housing but we did not want to rush <Col N="1383" /> ourselves into the same position that happened under the previous inter-Party Government which went burst. The economic conditions, due to external causes, which prevailed at that time may have frightened the Government to a certain extent from expenditure on housing of the degree all of us would have liked to see.  Surely, with all the boasting we have now about our affluent society, with Ministers making fancy speeches at every dinner to which they get an invitation, we could be a little bit more generous in our expenditure on houses for our people, for those who are unable through economic circumstances to provide houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said, quite rightly, that social welfare expenditure and social investment in the broadest sense is dependent entirely on how successful our production drive and our economy are.  It will, of course, largely depend upon the viability of our economy in the field of exports.  There is a great deal of talk about industrialisation. Not for a moment do I decry industrialisation, but let us not forget the basic fact that any affluence we have is due largely to the export of agricultural produce, particularly cattle and meat.  Of our exports last year of £222 million, cattle accounted for £66 million and meat for £34 million. From agricultural products or products of near-agricultural origin, I dare say our exports amounted to £140 million. It is nice to find the Taoiseach and various Ministers now paying such attention to the cattle trade, to find they have forgotten the sad, dark days when they were cutting their throats.</P>

      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): The Minister does not like to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome the social welfare benefits given to the most unprivileged sections of our community in this Budget.  In general the country drew a sigh of relief that at last the plight of <Col N="1384" /> the old age pensioners and other social welfare classes was in a measure taken off their conscience.  I regret it was not found possible to provide these classes with these benefits on the same day as the new taxation measures were introduced. I do not know how it has arisen that the social welfare classes and old age pensioners must wait from a May Budget until 1st August before they receive their new benefits.  I understand as regards contributory pensions that they come into operation on 1st January.  I should like to point out the probability that we will have on 1st of January another addition to the national health insurance stamps. These many little welts are imposed by the Government nicely and quietly throughout the year.  They hope the public will have forgotten them in 12 months' time, and frequently they do.</P>
    <P>I hope that those recipients of improved pensions who have also been getting home assistance will not be deprived of it because the Government have come to their aid and given them 10/-.  A few days ago I put down a question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking him would he consider paying home assistance on certification of its necessity by local county council officials.  His reply was, in effect, that that was a Budget matter.  Since it is a Budget matter, I am submitting it to the Minister for Finance for his consideration. I do not know how many old age pensioners are also in receipt of home assistance supplementary to their old age pension.  I do not know how the number varies from county to county and whether it is big or small. Social assistance, in so far as it is provided by county councils, must be rather irregular in its distribution.</P>
    <P>I can well imagine that the counties where, perhaps, it is most needed are possibly counties less able to pay or less liberal in their paying.  Judging by the distribution, for example, of health cards along the western seaboard, I could imagine some counties finding greater difficulty in providing a reasonable amount of home assistance to the very poor than in the wealthier counties. This should not be a matter paid for out of rates.  Here is a central service, part of the social welfare service, <Col N="1385" /> which could well be provided out of central funds and administered by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I regret that, in providing this extra social financial help, the Minister should have seen fit to introduce what is, in effect, a new means test.  In truth, we have enough of them already. Now, he has introduced a new means test of £26.  If they are under £26, they will get the full 10/-; if they are over £26, they will get only 5/-.  The majority, I know, will get the 10/- and only a minority will get the 5/-, but it is rather cheeseparing.  It was not worth the effort and will cause a certain degree of annoyance.  Most old people will have concluded by now that they are getting the 10/-.  In two months' time they will be very annoyed to find that, in fact, they are getting only 5/-.  When the Minister was giving the 10/-, he should have given it over all, without making a differential at the £26 income level. To-day, £26 as an annual income is neither here nor there.  It is a rather cheeseparing attitude to adopt that, due to the efforts of the Party on this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): The Minister expects to secure £1.3 <Col N="1386" /> million from the increase of 3d per gallon in the price of petrol.  This is a tax on industry.  The amount of revenue on every gallon of petrol was, I understand, up to now 3/- per gallon. It will now be 3/3d on every gallon of petrol bought.  The position now is that motoring here will be more expensive than in Northern Ireland or England.  We will be the most expensive motoring country in the British Isles.  I am not concerned particularly &mdash;in fact I am not concerned at all&mdash; with private motorists.  It is a pleasure for them and in so far as we are prepared to tax more our whiskey, cigarettes and beer, I suppose we can say it is fair to tax private motorists for the pleasure of driving.</P>
      <P>I understand it is agreed that 80 per cent of the petrol used here is used for purely commercial purposes.  This 3d extra will be a very severe burden on the many people who use commercial vehicles for their livelihood.  Taxi and hackney drivers, commercial travellers, breadvan drivers who go around our towns, and lorries using petrol will be severely hit.  Many private lorry firms suffer already from the restrictions imposed on them over the years to keep CIE economically viable.  Farmers bringing milk to creameries&mdash;most farmers nowadays use road trailers for this purpose&mdash;will be very hard hit. They use these trailers in my part of the country, at any rate, because the modern roads are not suitable for horse vehicles.  The Government for that reason are ill-advised to put this extra tax on petrol.</P>
      <P>At the beginning there was a general reaction that this was a good Budget in so far as it provided extra benefits for the lower income classes.  When you come to examine it, you find that for the total social welfare increases only £3.2 million has been provided out of a total estimated revenue expenditure of £242.8 million.  We could say, on that basis, that social welfare investment is nothing we can be very proud of and that it is not comparable with the social investment percentages in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed in this Budget in that there is no reference to improvements in our health services.  Perhaps <Col N="1387" /> we might hear something from the Minister for Health when he comes to present his Estimate, but, judging from the replies obtained from that source so far, it is a matter of: &ldquo;This matter is receiving my attention and it will receive every consideration in due course.&rdquo;  Now that we have had a Select Committee sitting here for 3½ years, of which the present Minister for Health was a member, may one express the hope that he will be able to give us some indication in the near future what he intends to do with regard to our health services?</P>
    <P>I must again express my regret at the continuing attitude of the Government as regards prices.  Consumer prices have been raised 8.1 per cent between November 1963 and February 1965; yet we can find no evidence of any change of attitude or any real thinking on the part of the Government on the fundamental question of price control. Fine Gael, during the election campaign, in their literature, advocated a prices-incomes policy.  Considering the Minister for Agriculture has not seen fit to follow our guidance by providing pound for pound for the agricultural organisation, and which was suggested in our policy programme, maybe the Minister for Finance may see fit to follow our suggestion of developing something on the lines of an incomes-prices policy.</P>
    <P>It has always been insisted by the Government that price control is impracticable, only justifiable during periods of extreme national emergency. I recognise there may be considerable difficulties in the implementation of anything in the way of price control, but I am equally convinced, if we are ever to have any measure of industrial peace here for a protracted period, we must make some effort towards price control, particularly in the essential commodities.</P>
    <P>We all desire that we should have freedom from economic unrest.  When any group of wage or salary earners get an increase, the next day prices go up. The wage earners are then biding their time for the next round.  I would strongly urge on the Minister to get <Col N="1388" /> down to formulating something on the lines of an incomes-prices policy.  This matter is being studied at present by the British Government.  It will be much more difficult there but even so, they are attempting to do it.  I suppose, as usual, when they do it, we will naturally follow.</P>
    <P>The question of grants by Foras Tionscal and the question of semi-State bodies are matters which must have been agitating the minds of Deputies on every side of the House. For GEC's subsidiary, a large grant was given by Foras Tionscal but, within a year, the company folds up.  That highlights the necessity for greater supervision of grants and loans.  I understand that special terms are arranged for loans exceeding £250,000. One would expect that where special terms are provided there would be adequate investigation of the probable viability of the project concerned.</P>
    <P>The relative autonomy semi-State bodies enjoy is defended in this House on the argument that if too much interference occurs it cuts across their proper functioning and that undue information extracted from them may make it difficult for them to operate.  It is worth considering again the establishment of all-Party sub-committees of this House for a closer supervision of the activities of semi-State bodies.  That great democracy, the United States, uses sub-committees extensively for this work.  From questions which have been asked, I gather that the Taoiseach does not agree to having such sub-committees for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts merely examines revenue; it does not go into the detailed activities of semi-State bodies.  The time has now arrived to have another look at the desirability of having select committees of this House, manned by people with special knowledge, to investigate in a general way the activities of semi-State bodies which have now assumed such great importance in our economy not to speak of public expenditure.  This Dáil, in effect, is no longer designed to meet modern circumstances and is largely a talking shop while the actual work is done behind the scenes by <Col N="1389" /> various semi-State bodies and officials of one type or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister should re-examine the matter of death duties.  I understand that they do not amount to much more than 1½ per cent of total revenue.  No Minister for Finance likes to discard any source of revenue but if death duties were abolished we might attract foreigners to settle in this country when they retire.  Jersey enjoys a very nice economy because beer, whiskey and cigarettes are available there at reduced prices.  Taxation is low and many people retire there. These people bring money into the Channel Islands.  Sometimes they buy houses.  They do not look for employment and they do not displace anybody.  They do not send any money out.  That is the structure on which Jersey's economy is built.  It might be worth while considering the abolition of death duties with a view to securing ultimately, perhaps, a greater revenue.  I admit it is a gamble but then is this new national loan not a gamble and is the Minister not a member of a gambler's Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Budget to be introduced by our new Minister for Finance.  The increases to be given to old age pensioners and others are very welcome.  We do not claim that they represent the ultimate in social security and that these people have suddenly reached the affluent stage. The increases represent a declaration of our intention to create a society in which the under-privileged and the needy will be looked after and assured of their part in the nation and provision will be made to keep them in not less than frugal comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speeches by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish were reasonable. We have now got agreement that we can build a State with social security, full employment and prosperity on lines which suit the character and spirit of our people.  This morning, the Taoiseach mentioned that the affluent society is not necessarily a happy one.  One of the most progressive States in Europe, which boasts of having the best social welfare services, has the highest suicide rate.  In building <Col N="1390" /> up our new society, we must realise the truth of the statement that it is not by bread alone that man liveth. There are spiritual considerations also which must be kept in mind if we are not to go over completely to a materialistic welfare state.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign, there was much talk about the welfare state and an affluent society. In order to have these, we must have a sound economy.  In his Budget speech, the Minister said that there cannot be social advance except on the basis of economic advance, and the more economic progress is made the more social progress is possible. The plain fact of the whole policy of Fianna Fáil and the purpose of their economic planning is to bring social benefits to a stage at which we can all be proud of them, no matter what Party we belong to.  I believe the best chance we have of reaching that stage is through the Fianna Fáil Party and their policy.</P>
    <P>I sat here for a long time last night and I heard two speakers from the Fine Gael benches talk on housing. They made very convincing speeches indeed.  However, one member knew very little about the subject on which he was speaking.  One member actually said that no mention of housing appears in the Budget speech.  In his Budget Statement the Minister mentions that there is an increase of £4½ million for housing, bringing the total sum for housing this year to £20 million. Of the £20 million, over one-half is spent on local authority building.</P>
    <P>Each time a member speaks about housing, the unfortunate Dublin Corporation is always criticised for what it has and has not done.  It may be well to go back a few years, to the time when we had all the vacant houses on our hands, and to what caused that situation.  We remember in 1956 there was a credit squeeze and at the same time the import levies were imposed. They were probably necessary but they had an ill effect on many people in employment.  During the credit squeeze, the total operations of Dublin Corporation's Small Dwellings (Acquisition) <Col N="1391" /> Acts department came to a standstill. On one occasion the Dublin builders came to see the Housing Committee and asked for money to keep their loans going.  The chairman on that occasion, who is not a member of my Party, had to tell them that he had no money.  Because of the slowing down in building and the falling off in demand for houses through emigration, the huge scheme at Coolock in north-east Dublin had to be suspended. We did not regret the fact that we had 17,000 houses.  We wanted the houses.  We regretted the fact that there were no tenants for them.  There were no workers.  The building workers had emigrated with great bitterness in their hearts and never came back.</P>
    <P>In 1957, there was a change of Government and admittedly for the next two years, housing development was small, for the simple reason that one cannot just decide to build without preparation.  There has to be a plan, a site, and so on.  Thank God, we have got over that bad period and Dublin Corporation are at the moment building 1,500 dwellings and have placed orders for 1,350 more.  That excludes the temporary chalet type caravans and the Ballymun scheme.</P>
    <P>I heard a speaker criticise the Minister for Local Government yesterday. The Ballymun scheme is the brainchild of the Minister.  It was he who conceived it, first of all.  He sent six or seven members of the Dublin Corporation to Europe to examine the new system-type building there.  We saw the system and told him we thought such building could play a big part in solving, as far as was possible, the Dublin housing problem. That scheme has started and for the next three years it will give 1,000 dwellings a year.  These are supplementary to the ordinary housing programme.</P>
    <P>When this first started, there was uneasiness in trade union circles that it might injure the prospects of the building workers.  The Corporation and the Minister were able to assure the unions that this was a supplementary programme and that we would continue <Col N="1392" /> to build on the traditional methods.  So long as Dublin is a growing city, we will have a housing problem, just as any living city has. As somebody said the other day, the only city that has no housing problems is a dead city.  Dublin is a living and vibrant city at the moment and will continue to be so as the economy expands and as we move towards prosperity.</P>
    <P>I never believe in making political capital out of the housing shortage and I would not have mentioned the fact today except that it was said last night that there was no mention of housing in the Budget.  Apart from that, one speaker criticised the Dublin Corporation. It is true we have a serious housing problem on hands but we are overcoming it and I say that within 18 months it will no longer be a serious problem.  We will not have enough dwellings but we will at least have families of a father, mother and one child living in proper housing conditions.</P>
    <P>Since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1957, they have never on any occasion allowed lack of necessary capital to hold up the housing drive and that is a tribute to their policy and their Ministers.</P>

      <P>The last speaker decided to hold up his hands and say: &ldquo;I do not want to make political capital out of housing&rdquo;.  Having tried to stick the knife in and say there was no money for housing in the days of the inter-Party Government and houses were vacant because the workers had to clear out, he holds up his hands in holy horror and says that he would not like to bring housing into the political arena.  Now, if this debate did nothing more than put on the records of the House, from no less a person than the Taoiseach himself, that the day the inter-Party Government left office they left 1,500 houses unoccupied in the city of Dublin, it is something to be grateful for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more reliable than those of the British Government? They told me in 1957 that I was holding up money from them, that there was no money available for them, that there was a shortage of houses and they wanted to build houses.  Now the Taoiseach comes along and tells us there were 1,500 houses vacant at that particular time&mdash; 1,500 we left there for the people. What has happened since?  Deputy Moore tells us there would be a recession in the building of houses for a year or two.  Let me give him the figures given to me by the Minister for Local Government in reply to a question by me on 24th May, 1961.  I quote from Volume 189, column 749 of the Official Debates of 24th May, 1961.  I asked a simple question:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... the number of private dwellings and local authority houses erected <Col N="1394" /> in the State in each of the years ending 31st March, 1954 to 1961, inclusive.</P>
    <P>This is just a simple way of testing the veracity of what Deputy Moore has said.  The Minister's reply was that the inter-Party Government built 5,107 houses in 1954.  There were private houses built with SDA loans and other loans.  In 1955, 4,858 houses were built; in 1956, the number was 5,368; and in 1957, 5,561.  That is the last year the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>
    <P>Then the Fianna Fáil Government took over.  Listen to this for a record. During the first year after the Fianna Fáil Government took over, the number of houses built dropped 2,000, from 5,561 to 3,559.  In the second year, the number fell to 2,626, just one half.  I understand the Deputy said they were planning at that time, that they had not got into operation, that they had not got cracking, as they called it. In 1960, 3,190 houses were built and in 1960, 3,800 houses were built.  The Government did not build those houses. They were built with State grants.  The number fell from 5,000 to just under 4,000 in the short period of six years.</P>
    <P>What about local authority housing, about which the Deputy was concerned? At the same column of the same volume of the Official Report the Minister stated that on 31st March, 1954, when the inter-Party Government were in office, the local authorities built 5,600 houses, in 1955, 5,200, in 1956, 4,011, and in 1957, 4,700.  We then went out of office and in 1958, 3,400 houses were built, in 1959, 1,800, in 1960, 2,400, and in 1961, 1,400. That was Fianna Fáil progress in building houses.  As I said at the outset, if this debate did nothing else, at least in it the Taoiseach admitted that we left them 1,500 vacant houses.  Instead of a shortage of houses, and instead of no money being available, there were 1,500 houses in Dublin city, unoccupied and awaiting tenants.</P>
    <P>Let me go on now to something else. As Deputies know, the local authorities receive their money from various grants made by the Department of Local Government.  One grant which was made available when the inter-Party <Col N="1395" /> Government were in office was, as it is today, a grant for water and sewerage schemes.  At column 755, volume 189, of the Official Report, the Minister for Local Government gave us the figures of capital expenditure on sanitary service works.  In 1954, the inter-Party Government spent £1,400,000, odd, on sanitary services, in 1955, £1,500,000, in 1956, £1,800,000, and in the last year of the inter-Party Government the figure was the highest ever, £1,995,000.  We then went out of office and the figure fell in 1958 to £1,500,000, in 1959 to £1,600,000 and in 1960, four years after the inter-Party Government went out of office, to £1,281,000.  That was money granted by the Department of Local Government to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is one other figure which I should like to quote from column 757 of the same volume of the Official Report.  I asked the Minister for Local Government the total number of men employed by local authorities on road works during those years.  He told me that in 1953-54, 21,000 men were employed, in 1954-55, 16,000 men, and in 1959-60 the figure fell to 13,000, odd. The figure fell from 21,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has introduced his Budget and he has told us about the taxes which he imposed.  I wonder could we get an assurance from him that this is the last Budget that will be introduced this year?  Could we have an assurance that no further taxation will be introduced? Could we have an assurance that there will not be another petty Budget?  After Fianna Fáil came into office the last time we had an autumn Budget and a spring Budget.  Immediately before the previous Government went out of office, they introduced a petty Budget putting a penny on a telephone call if you used a coinbox. That is a sneaky way of procuring revenue.  Why did they not wait until Budget day to declare: &ldquo;This is another method of taxation; we want another penny&rdquo;?  If we could get the assurance from the Minister that there would not be another Budget it would go a long way to ensuring stability in so far as finance and taxation are concerned, which would be a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last weekend there was a leading <Col N="1398" /> article in one of the English newspapers, written by a gentleman whose name I do not recall, on the question of tourism.  Before I move to that, let me finish the subject I was dealing with.  The Minister has put taxes on certain commodities and he has also informed us he will float another loan, or bond issue.  If ever anything could be described as a gamble this bond issue is such.  It is repayable with 50 per cent interest after a period of 15 years, or one might take a chance of drawing a bond in every 40 and get payment at the end of twelve months.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying the bonds.  I hope they are successful.  However, I cannot help remembering when the prize bonds were introduced.  The Minister's colleague, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, said the country had come to a very low level when we had to run it on a raffle.  He was applauded by the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil for saying the country was being run on raffles.  He said it was a disgrace.  Not only did Fianna Fáil keep the money, the proceeds of the raffle, but under this bond plan they are trying to keep the prize as well because one must wait 15 years before getting what amounts to 4 per cent per annum on one's investment.  I hope it is a success but I should much prefer to see money raised on the system of prize bonds in existence, with an annual draw, or through national loans.</P>
    <P>Sometimes in Opposition we are asked: &ldquo;It is all right to criticise the actions of the Minister for Finance in raising money but can you suggest an alternative?&rdquo;  I am not the Minister for Finance.  It is not my duty to suggest means and methods whereby sufficient money can be raised to run the State for the coming year, but one of the things, I submit, the Minister has overlooked&mdash;Deputies Sweetman and T. F. O'Higgins referred to it earlier&mdash;is a tax on dancehalls.  I remember when £125,000 was pulled in from such a tax.  The Minister is well aware that one of the crazes and curses of the country is bingo. Thousands of pounds are being offered week after week, night after night, as <Col N="1399" /> bingo prizes.  Why are these luxury pastimes not taxed?</P>
    <P>Why have the pipeful of tobacco and the eyeful of whiskey of the old age pensioner to take a rap while those young people can sport themselves and enjoy these curses and crazes which could yield much heavier revenue if they were curbed in some way?  It is a matter which the Minister, through expediency or otherwise, has overlooked.  It is one of the methods, I suggest, by which the Minister could ensure that some relief of taxation is achieved to the benefit of others.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that on this side of the House we have no method whereby expenditure could be cut down.  I shall offer a suggestion to the Minister now which I hope he will pass on to his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  We have expended considerable capital throughout the country in the building of employment exchanges.  Some of the finest buildings in the State have been erected to house the staffs of the Department of Social Welfare.  In the small town of Dungloe we have expended a considerable amount in that way.  The same applies to towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The function of these exchanges at the moment is to pay out unemployment benefits and assistance benefits only.  The Department of Social Welfare also distribute disability pensions, dental and optical grants, maternity benefits, but these moneys are not paid out through the local offices of the Department. They are still paid out through this colossus created at Arus Mhic Dhiarmada.  If the Minister is keen to economise in that Department, if he is keen to decentralise, I appeal to him to decentralise the working of the Department of Social Welfare by giving the staffs in exchanges throughout the country authority to pay out disability allowances, optical, dental and maternity grants.</P>
    <P>I know exactly how it is being done at the moment.  I speak with experience as an employee of that Department.  If one wants unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance one goes to <Col N="1400" /> the local exchange and after going through certain formalities one is paid there and then, either by cheque or by cash.  But if one wants to procure disability allowances one must send a medical certificate to Arus Mhic Dhiarmada where there is a staff officer with about 14 writing assistants attached to one or two counties.  There are in all ten such sections with one clerical afficer and a number of writing assistants in each.</P>
    <P>A medical certificate comes in; it is checked by the clerical officer, cheques are written by the writing assistants and sent down to the local exchange or directly to the applicant.  That could all be done very simply through the local employment exchange without any additional staff other than a few writing assistants.  These writing assistants are all young girls, paid an average wage of between £6 and £8 a week.  They are expected to live here in Dublin on that.  They could live quite comfortably, I am sure, in the small towns in the country if there was decentralisation.  It would also speed up the payment of these various claims. Deputies are writing continually to the Department to find out causes of delays in these payments.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to find out from his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare why these grants are not paid through the local exchanges, why they are not paid in the manner in which unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are paid, thus cutting down considerably on expenditure in Arus Mhic Dhiarmada.</P>
    <P>One other matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the manner in which many clerical officers were recruited in the old days through open competitive examination. When these clerical officers were recruited they were put on a differential salary basis.  They were paid up to a maximum of £600 a year while they were single and after they were married they were paid a maximum of £800, plus £30 per annum for every child of that matrimonial union.  In later years clerical officers were admitted other than by open competitive examination.</P>

      <P>One of the major industries at the moment is tourism and one thing we have to ask ourselves is what incentive is there in this Budget to improve that industry.  We have to ask ourselves why do tourists come to a country: is it because of the scenery, the cheapness of living or the attractions of beach or city or country.  Having considered these things, we must find out from experience what brought tourists to this country.  There is no doubt that we have had a big influx of tourists up to this year.  One thing that really attracted tourists after the War was the low cost of living here as compared with across the water.  We should continue to examine the comparison between the cost of living here and across the water, from a tourist point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strange as it may seem, although <Col N="1402" /> this is an agricultural country, tourists who have made a close study of costs from their point of view find that bread, butter, cheese, eggs and bacon are dearer here than in England.  All these commodities are produced here but are actually dearer here than in Britain.  Prices in our hotels compare very unfavourably with those in Britain and one of the luxuries which tourists permit themselves is the alcoholic beverage but we are closing the gap very considerably indeed in regard to the cost of beer and spirits here and across the water and across the artificial Border.  It may surprise people to know that before the Minister announced his Budget, beer cost 6d. a pint more here than in Britain. Now we have to add the additional charge which the Minister has placed on beer.  It is all very fine to say we must procure additional revenue but one thing which we could do is kill the goose that lays this golden egg.</P>
    <P>Mark you, there are many ways of killing that goose.  I am only afraid, as the Minister's predecessor said here two years ago, that we are going to kill this goose which was laying this golden egg in the form of revenue from spirits, beer and tobacco.  At that time the Minister's predecessor said that these commodities would not stand further taxation and that we must find other methods of taxation.  The new method which he discovered was this turnover tax which was completely opposed throughout the State.  Now, not only has he got the turnover tax but the present Minister goes back on the word of his predecessor and again plucks a feather or two from the goose.</P>
    <P>I warn him that unless something is done to entice tourists to come here, whether by way of cheaper hotel accommodation, a lower cost of living, or cheaper luxuries, we may prevent them coming when they can skip across to France or Spain where sunshine is more or less guaranteed and where they can live much more cheaply.  I always thought that in catering for tourists, we looked far too much towards the west and far too little towards the east.  We spent practically all the money allocated to <Col N="1403" /> our tourist board on the building of luxury hotels to cater for our western visitors.  When I say &ldquo;western&rdquo;, I mean people from across the Atlantic.  We overlooked visitors from across the Irish Sea.  I do not wish in any way to take from the welcome we should extend to our friends from across the Atlantic but visitors from across the Irish Sea are much more beneficial to our economy and we should never forget it.  We should endeavour to cater for them.  Only the landlady in Dublin, the moderate guesthouse and the smaller hotel can cater for these people; the others have priced themselves out of that type of market.</P>
    <P>The picture painted by the Minister when introducing his Budget in regard to all these industries which have been set up was a bright one.  Like most of us, however, he received a bit of a jolt since then when he heard what happened in Dundalk but I am sure that today's Cork broiler project is a bigger jolt.  I know there is no person who deplores the failure of this project to start than the Minister because it is his own native county, but it is too bad that this project should have been announced immediately before the general election, informing us of the number of farmers in east, west and mid-Cork who were to benefit from growing feedstuffs for the poultry for this industry.  Now we are told that this factory will not go into production, for the present at least.</P>
    <P>Why?  We are told that it is lack of finance, not of Irish finance but of other finance because of a financial squeeze in London.  I wonder what sort of concern was this which was depending upon finances which would be raised on the London market and which I presume would procure a grant from the Government.  Some of the projects set up in the Minister's county&mdash;and I am not referring to the shipyard&mdash;might bear examination or, indeed, might not bear examination. It is much better to see these projects going out of production before Irish capital is put into them by way of grant or otherwise, although, as I say, we all regret that such a project could not materialise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> Today the Taoiseach said that the great majority of old age pensioners would benefit from the 10/- increase provided under the Budget.  I wonder why the Minister did not go the whole hog and give it to all old age pensioners. It would have been the charitable thing to do, because by not giving it to all, he now creates the position that the means of old age pensioners must be re-investigated.  This will cause considerable delay and possibly result in reducing pensions instead of increasing them.  It would have been much better if the Minister had said: &ldquo;We are giving the 10/- to the majority, so let us not quibble and give it to every old age pensioner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same applies to unemployment assistance.  The Minister says he is giving the 10/-, irrespective of everything else, but we all know the ferret &mdash;because he is nothing else&mdash;of an investigating officer is out already on the warpath investigating means and possibly increasing means, thereby reducing home assistance before the increase can be granted.  We are glad to see that these unfortunates are now to derive some benefit from the Budget. It is exactly what we said we would do if we got back into office. The only difference is that we said we thought it could be done without the imposition of taxation.  Everybody knows one of the stimulants needed by the old age pensioner is the little drop of whiskey and the only luxury, possibly, he has is his pipe or packet of cigarettes, but now before you give him the extra 5/- or 10/-, you take some of it away on these little items he enjoys.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has overestimated his capital expenditure on housing.  He has told us there will be an extra £4½ million, while he did not spend £500,000 of what he got last year.  If he is going to be generous, as I know that the Minister in his heart would be, let him give 10/- to all the old age pensioners.</P>

Everybody to whom I have spoken is astounded that a new Minister for <Col N="1405" /> Finance could do so much for so many people and affect so few.

      <P>I have listened to many Opposition speakers talking about the additional taxation being imposed on the community because of the increased social welfare benefits.  I should like to ask some of those speakers how they suggest those services could be financed, other than by taxation.  I have not heard any of them give a satisfactory answer to that question. On the other hand, we stated categorically that additional taxes would definitely be needed to keep up the rate of expansion and provide for better social services.  These objectives can be achieved and attained, as Deputy O. J. Flanagan said the other night, only by dipping into the pockets of the various individuals in the community and withdrawing a portion of their earnings.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister did not just slap on these taxes without giving due consideration to the advantages to be gained from them, and in deciding the extent to which the services could be improved, they attempted to lighten the burden as much as possible for everyone.  Just because we should like to give more social benefits to everybody does not mean we can do it.  It is very easy for the Opposition to make promises.  I remember, particularly during the by-election in mid-Cork, all the promises they made.  I think somebody worked it out that if every promise given by the various speakers on the different platforms were to be implemented, it would cost the Exchequer £65 million, which is a lot of money.  It was easy to make these promises because they knew they would not have to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister on his tremendous initiative and enterprise in introducing a new type of national loan.  But that is just what the public have come to expect <Col N="1406" /> from Fianna Fáil&mdash;initiative and enterprise.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about the rise in the cost of living but none of the Opposition speakers compared it with the rise in prices.  There has been a rise in the cost of living but I want to give some figures to show how wages have kept ahead of the cost of living. Goods which in 1957 cost £100 now cost £133; wages which were £100 in 1957 are now £163, giving a net gain in wages of £33.  In spite of Deputy P. O'Donnell's attempt to make people forget the last dismal months of the last Coalition, it is now a matter of history that they left a shrinking economy behind them and no amount of bluff or smart or slick talk can deny that fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell referred to tourism in a rather critical vein but if the inter-Party people had had their way, there would have been a tax on every tourist coming into the country. The net receipts from tourism in 1958 were £18.5 million and in 1964, £32.9 million.  At a very early stage, Fianna Fáil recognised that tourism would become one of the most important industries in our economy and they set out then, not by putting a tax on every tourist coming here but by giving every possible incentive, by advertising and sales promotion in the various countries of the world, to attract foreigners to our shores.  That paid off handsomely.</P>
    <P>The real test of a nation's economy is whether its gross national product is shrinking or expanding.  Under the Coalition Government, it was shrinking rapidly; in the ten years prior to the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> the gross national product had expanded at an average rate of only one per cent per annum.  When Fianna Fáil took office, they set out to double that rate of expansion.  At that time, according to the records, Fine Gael said this could not be achieved. In fact, not alone was it achieved, but the targets set in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> were more than doubled.  The economy expanded at an average rate of 4.3 per cent <Col N="1407" /> between 1958 and 1963.  This trend continued right into 1964 and, I am sure, will continue into 1965.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that, as a small island, this country must depend to an enormous extent on exports.  Of course, the difference in exports between 1958 and 1954 was again colossal.  In fact, in 1964, exports amounted to £222.4 million or more than double the 1956 level of £108.1 million.  This, again, shows the initiative, planning and foresight on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government, who did not leave a stone unturned in order to ensure that the economy was boosted from every direction.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Donnell refer to the broiler factory in my constituency in Bandon.  I have had numerous meetings with the people associated with this project.  I can assure the Deputy that anything that did occur was completely outside the scope of the Government. In fact, the directors were promised, in writing, £500,000 last June by a finance company in this country and only last Thursday that promise was gone back on.  I do not think the Deputy is being fair when he criticises the Government in regard to this project.  I also am very disappointed that this project is not going through at this moment because in Bandon alone, my home town, it would give employment to over 500 persons and I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House would be very anxious that it would go into production.</P>
    <P>This broiler enterprise is only one of the enterprises started by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Just because things have not worked out according to the way they should be working out the Opposition criticise it.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan said here the other night that he felt that every effort should be made by the Government to give as much employment as possible in this country and should leave no stone unturned in an effort to attract anybody who is willing to set up industries here, for the reason that it is much better to have our people working in their own country, which is their right, and to be subsidised by the Government, than to be working in a foreign country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> So even if occasionally GEC does occur, the Government, like any individual or group of individuals, are not infallible and do make mistakes from time to time.  Not that I admit that GEC was a mistake.  GEC had already proved what they could do in Dunleer.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to try as soon as possible to do something for disabled persons.  There is a case in my constituency of a mother and son who are completely crippled.  The father, who was also crippled, died 12 months ago.  The daughter had to come home from England to look after her mother, her father and her brother.</P>

I would urge the Minister to provide extra money for that type of case which, in my opinion, is most deserving.  It is not the only such case. There are several disabled persons in the country who are suffering as a result of a serious lack of means.</P>
      <P>I have only one criticism of the Budget and that is in respect of the price of petrol.  This could hamper to a certain extent the distributive trade and also the many hundreds of commercial travellers who depend for their livelihood on being able to get around.  The day when enormous expenses were paid to travellers is gone.  Most travellers are on fixed expense accounts.  So, the increase in petrol could have a very great effect on, and cause hardship to some travellers.</P>
      <P>I have not quite calculated what the effect could be on the distributive trade but there are a great many small traders who have vans and lorries run on petrol and the increased tax will increase their costs of distribution.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Minister on a most imaginative and very charitable Budget.</P>

      <P>A Budget is a many-sided document and involves every aspect of the national scene and at times, either for its goodness or for its badness, it is adequate to tax the capacity and ingenuity even of a Corkman. We have been told by the last speaker, Deputy Crowley, that a Corkman when he sets himself out to do something, can do almost anything. Deputy Crowley's one criticism of the Budget was in respect of the petrol tax.  In the division, Deputy Crowley voted for the petrol tax.  Today, he spoke critically of it.  Amongst other things, Corkmen may have the capacity for rapid political conversion and even in speeches they have the capacity for an equally rapid political reconversion.  I have often wondered about how people can manage to say one thing and do another; how they can manage to vote for the imposition of taxation or for the implementation of certain aspects of policy in this or the other House of the Oireachtas and then speak against their very act of voting.  However, I suppose that is part of the Party system and that is the system which enables the Minister to bring in an unsatisfactory Budget.</P>
      <P>A Budget is the annual exposition of the Government's economic policy, their policy of taxation, on the one hand, and their policy of expenditure, on the other hand, and side by side with that their attitude towards the social services.  In the course of the general election campaign the Taoiseach at one stage stated that it would be necessary for his Party to consider what increases, if any, they would be enabled to give to the social services if returned to power.  Later on in the election he was driven by the force of Fine Gael argument to take a stand on social services, to give them a certain priority.  We take that as a very positive social win for our Party, if not accompanied by the electoral success that we would have liked.</P>

However, the increase of 10/- is only in respect of people whose income does not exceed £26 a year.  I wonder where that figure of £26 a year was obtained. Unless I am mistaken the figure of £26 a year occurred in the original means test under the Old Age Pensions Acts as far back as 1911.</P>
      <P>What will £26 a year or 10/- a week purchase for a person of 70 years of age or for any person?  Will it not involve, in the first place, a considerable re-investigation all over the country of people whose means have already been assessed in relation to £52 10s. per annum, which was and is for certain cases the basis of investigation? It would be interesting to know what £26 a year would buy and what £26 represents by way of purchasing power not alone as far back as 1911 but even as far back as 1938 or 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether in his assessment of £26 a year the rate of residence, maintenance <Col N="1411" /> and support is incorporated in a family agreement or whether it is something implied from the manner of living of a family and whether that will be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Crowley is starting his campaign in the Eighteenth Dáil by throwing challenges of that kind, of an implied personal nature, across this House, his challenge will be taken up and dealt with accordingly, within the Rules of Order of the House, of course, and in keeping with the concept of good manners of which the Deputy does not seem to have heard so far.  Perhaps he is one of those newly sent into the House to take part in this kind of parliamentary mudslinging.</P>
      <P>While we welcome the increases in the social services, we fear that the taxation that has been put on side by side with them will help to fritter them away.  Hard-pressed tobacco and spirits, in however small supplies they are required by old age pensioners, at 4d. per ounce and 2d. per glass, respectively, will do away with a considerable amount of the 5/- increase and whatever of the extra 5/- pensioners will succeed in getting on this re-investigation which I am sure will take place, if it is not already afoot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps this Government were afraid to give further increases.  Deputy Moore, at the beginning of his speech, said that one of the most progressive States in Europe, which boasts of having the best social services, also has the highest suicide rate.  Were the <Col N="1412" /> Fianna Fáil Party afraid to increase social welfare benefits any further in case people would start committing suicide from an overdose of wellbeing? That would appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>Having regard to his pre-by-election tendencies, I have to agree with Deputy Crowley when he criticises the imposition of 3d a gallon on petrol.  In my view, this will mean a considerable rise &mdash;slow, steady and awkward&mdash;in distributive costs and it will hit hardest those areas furthest away from the distributing centres.  That will be notably the case in relation to the west of Ireland, about the survival of which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture had so much to say and so much to promise in the course of the recent general election.  They described it as the one major issue to be resolved and they talked about the battle for the survival of the west.  With higher costs now for petrol, distributive costs will be higher and it is the people in the remoter, outlying areas, particularly the west, who will suffer most.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the west, and I come from a western constituency, I want to say categorically that there is nothing of any consequence in this Budget for these people about whom so much was said and to whom so much was promised.  There is an indication in the Budget that in the New Year there will be legislation making the rateable valuation the basis for the payment of employment assistance.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have ample time between this and Tuesday to find out if this £26 qualification will be reckoned in relation to that right of residence, maintenance and support, whether that be by family agreement, or otherwise.  Will that be taken into consideration even though the farm is in the grandfather's name? Will the old age pensioner be assessed as entitled to the rents, profits and such like, even though there is a son or daughter, with a wife or husband and a family, as the case may be.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister.  This Budget means, of course, an increase in prices.  That follows as the night the day.  With <Col N="1414" /> increasing prices we will have, I am sure, a demand when the time comes for increased wages and salaries.  All that is, I think, bad policy <i>vis-á-vis</i> exports because, the higher our prices for production, the greater will be the difficulty in the competitive markets of the world.  I have no less an authority for saying that than a speech made by the Chairman of the Board of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in Dublin last night.  Mr. Colur Barnes said&mdash;I quote from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Thursday, May 13th 1965&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>We are clearly edging ourselves towards the position of being high cost producers.  It is cheaper to build in Britain than in Ireland.  It is cheaper to produce the majority of consumer items there than here. We can price ourselves out of the export business.</P>
      <P>In my view that is a very serious warning of which the Government should take some cognisance in order to keep themselves right <i>vis-á-vis</i> the export market as at the present time and particularly to keep their eyes on the situation envisaged by 1970 when we will be in the position of having to join, or wishing to join, whichever you like, the European Economic Community where competition and prices will be of extreme importance.</P>
      <P>There is not very much in this Budget, as far as I can see, for tourism.  In passing, may I say I welcome the meeting in the last few days between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the obviously good atmosphere that prevailed at that meeting.  I welcome in particular the references made by the Northern Ireland representative when interviewed by Telefís Éireann. These are the things that are important.</P>

      <P>Lest I be suspected of inter-Party re-union, Deputy Corish wants to know if I am resuming on Tuesday.  That, of course, will depend on the fall of events as between now and Tuesday.  In any event, I should like to tell both Deputy Corish and the Minister that I shall continue speaking until five o'clock.  I was dealing with tourism.  This is a subject into which we can go in greater detail on the Estimate for Transport and Power, but I should like to say now that prices &mdash;prices in relation to food, drink, hotels and so on&mdash;should be kept as <Col N="1416" /> much in line as possible with Northern Ireland and with Great Britain because the greatest potential, as Deputy P. O'Donnell said, from the point of view of the tourist industry is from Britain. They are the tourists who come in the greatest numbers and they spend much more money than do their American counterparts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the text of a circular letter dated 9th March, 1951, addressed to housing authorities regarding purchase annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of the circular letter in question is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">COTTAGE-PURCHASE SCHEMES.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to state that he has under consideration the question of the extent to which tenants of labourers cottages have availed themselves of the provisions of the Labourers Act, 1936, relating to tenant purchase.  It has been ascertained that up to September, 1950, purchase schemes were made by housing authorities in respect of 56,900 cottages, approximately. Applications for purchase were <Col N="1379" /> received from 14,227 tenants, but only 8,209 cottages were vested in tenants in the period under review. These results fall considerably short of expectations, notwithstanding the general desire on the part of housing authorities to exercise the provisions of the Act to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received representations, including a Resolution from the County Councils General Council, in favour of a reduction in the existing annuities charged to applicants for tenant-purchase schemes under the Act.  The present terminable annuity is fixed at 75 per cent of the rent paid by the tenant (exclusive of rates) at the date of vesting.  In order to accelerate operations under the Act the Minister has decided to accede to the representations in favour of a revision of the basis on which the terminable annuity is fixed and he has accordingly decided that, in future, the amount of the terminable annuity which he will be prepared to approve, in normal cases, in respect of each cottage and plot will be 50 per cent of the rent, exclusive of rates.  The Department's circular letter of the 30th March, 1937 (circular H.B. 46/1937) dealing generally with the procedure and conditions to be observed in preparing cottage purchase schemes may, therefore, be read as amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am to request that the revised conditions be brought to the notice of all existing tenants whose cottages are not yet vested.  It should be made clear to the tenants that the accepance by them of the tenant-purchase facilities will result in an immediate reduction of 50 per cent of their existing rents, and that the annuity (or rent) to be charged as a tenant-purchaser will remain unaltered during the full repayment period.  They will thus be fully safeguarded against any increase in rents which the Council may from time to time propose to put into operation in respect of unvested cottages.  It is suggested that the rents charged as at the date of <Col N="1380" /> this circular letter should form the basis of the annuity calculation in respect of existing tenants who submit proposals for tenant-purchase.</P>
    <P>A report on the extent to which the terms of this circular letter have induced an increase in the number of applications for vesting should be furnished to this Department as soon as possible after the 30th June next and at regular half-yearly periods thereafter.&rdquo;</P>
