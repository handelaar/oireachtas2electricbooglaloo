      <P>Deputy Clinton had been inquiring from the Minister as to what a special condition was under this section.  It is easy to understand paragraph (a) which refers to payments in respect of the purchase money being paid punctually.  However, would the Minister define &ldquo;normal place of residence by the purchaser&rdquo;?  Does this mean that at some other time the person may not be in the premises and that it still could be held that he was?  The paragraph goes on to refer to the purchaser's successor in title and members of the family.  That is a tradition in the country which people have always regarded as being very valuable in respect of houses held from the local authority.  Is there any reason why there should be this provision in regard to &ldquo;normal place of residence&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>In regard to paragraph (c) which states that the dwelling shall not, without the consent of the housing authority, be mortgaged, charged or alienated, is the consent of the housing authority required in regard to what have become known as vested local authority houses?  Does the resident in one of these houses have to have the prior consent of the local authority before entering into any commitment in regard to the house?</P>

      <P>These conditions, as the House will realise, are permissive, but we expect they will be used invariably. I should imagine the advantage of using them would be that it will tend to help recovery where houses are not being used for the purpose for which they were intended.  Under late; sections there are other conditions which the local authorities may apply at their own discretion, but these are specially mentioned for the reason that there have been these difficulties experienced over the years of recovery either where the houses are not used or are not used for the purpose for which they were intended.  While they are permissive, my own feeling is that these are conditions which the local authorities will use invariably, apart from any other conditions they may themselves impose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Straight off the reel we must assume that the houses which are vested and in respect of which annuities are completed are outside the scope of this Bill.  Presumably it refers only to houses on which an annuity is still being paid.  At the present time there are literally thousands of these houses just locked up.  While we all have a certain amount of sympathy with the person who goes away to England to work for a few months or even for a longer period, and who intends to come back and live with the family when he is able to do so, the situation is not confined to that type of people.  There are many people who, out of pure cussedness, will just lock up a house, go away and abandon it, except for the payment of the annuity.  The result is that nobody can touch it.  Under the 1936 Act, the local authority has powers to inspect the house and make an order for its repair and even go in and carry out the repairs but no local authority wants to break in the door of a house and carry out the repairs when the owners is not there.  I am glad this section is included because it means that the local authority will be able to take some action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister will have to be very careful about the wording of <Col N="325" /> the section.  In many instances the person who owns the house may not be in the district at all and in such instances how is the local authority to repossess the house?  There may be furniture and other belongings of the absent owner in it.  Is the local authority to throw that property out on the roadside? There is no point in putting something into the Bill which it will be very difficult to carry out.  I am all with the section but the Minister will have to be more explicit in his wording of it.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the farmer who does not want a cottage on his land.  His father may have given a site for the cottage but now the father is dead and perhaps the original tenant of the cottage is dead and the farmer's son does not want the cottage there at all.  I know of cases where these cottages have been turned into cow-byres. I hope this section will deal with that matter and that it will be worded in such a way that it will be workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What has this section to do with cottages on a farmer's land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It will cover cases where a farmer has given a site for a cottage and where the farmer's son does not want that cottage on his land.  The case of the older cottages will be pretty hard to catch because of the short term of purchase.  The newer cottages have a longer purchase and it will be easy to deal with them. The recent Labourers Act has a bearing on this matter.  Would the Minister say if this section is tied up with the section of the Labourers Act which enables a local authority to repossess a house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is not tied up with it.  We can have another look at the section to see if it is strong enough and comprehensive enough to meet the points raised by Deputy Tully.  We already had this matter in mind as to whether it was strong enough and this is what we finally came up with but it is still possible that we might be able to strengthen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="326" /> consider putting in a definite period during which a cottage cannot be left vacant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Putting in a definite period might be a difficult matter.  If you put in a period that will be long enough to be reasonable in certain cases that could arise, it might be too long in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And if you have it too short a period, it could cause hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A calendar year should be quite enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we say a reasonable period, say, a year or so, that might be too restrictive in certain cases.  The best way to do it is to put in a period that will not be too restrictive but will be sufficient to meet the cases we have in mind, in the knowledge and belief that the local authorities will not move in cases where they know there was good reason for the person not coming back to resume possession.  If we put in a period restrictive enough in the knowledge that the local authority was going to apply this regulation strictly, I would be very hesitant to put in a period as restrictive as one year.  What I would like to do is to keep it pretty restrictive and rely on the local authority not to move unless there was real cause to do so and not to move in cases in which the circumstances were such that there was a reasonable belief that the person was coming back.</P>
      <P>I can only say that I will have another look at the question of strengthening the wording.  I am not too happy about saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a period, whether it be long or short, at the moment.  &ldquo;Short&rdquo; has its faults and &ldquo;long&rdquo; has its faults.  I should say that this section does not refer to sales that have already taken place. Section 101 is the section which will deal with cases where purchase has already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if any special arrangement is laid down as to how the owners of these houses will be notified?  If we leave the matter as it is in the section, the <Col N="327" /> officials of the local authorities will find a dozen different reasons as to why they cannot do different things.  There should be some arrangement by which a person who is a registered owner can be notified.  I know a number of cases where people have left the district and nobody knows where they are. There should be some method of dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase money or weekly payments must come from somebody.  If they can be got to the collector, the local authority should be able to get back to the person who gave them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that easy. I know of cases where no receipt can be issued because the local authority does not know where these people are. It is a most extraordinary thing but it is quite common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tighten up this section as much as possible so that no loopholes will be left.  There is what I might call a racket in every county in cottages.  In my county people have bought cottages worth up to £1,200 of ratepayers' money and have immediately sold them.  There are many types of case, as Deputy Tully has told the House. Farmers' sons buy cottages because they do not want agricultural labourers living on their lands.  They lock them up or turn them into cow-byres or stables.  We have cases of cottages unoccupied, and in County Meath alone at the moment there are between 300 and 400 such cottages, while we have a programme to build cottages for up to 400 people who are crying out for houses.  In these circumstances the Minister must tighten this section. It is wrong that ratepayers should provide the money to build a cottage at a cost of £1,600 and that a man should buy it out immediately and leave it unoccupied.  The period in this section should be not more than 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I should like to be clear on one thing. Is there anything in the Bill that will enable us to repossess cottages already closed up?  In most constituencies, <Col N="328" /> apart from cottages that have been sold to people who do not qualify for them, there are numerous cottages locked up, lying there idle for anything up to 18 months with the owner gone away, while we have a list of people looking for houses which we cannot build.  I take it this section will not touch those who have already bought out cottages.  What about the people in the process of buying them?  Is there anything in this section to strengthen our hand in that respect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I mention this to the Minister?  When he is looking into the question of the time limit and if he considers it expedient to put in a period of 12 months, I suggest he should specifically set out &ldquo;unless a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming from the tenant for the protracted vacancy of the cottage&rdquo;.  This would give the tenant the right to appeal against the local authority on the grounds of exceptional circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the local authorities in these matters proceed by way of seeking an order in court to repossess?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When they do that, the tenant or the person who owns the cottage has the opportunity of stating in court if there are any valid reasons why the house should not be repossessed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were debating the Electoral Act and came to the matter of the period during which a person should be left on the register, it was accepted that a person should <Col N="329" /> be kept on for 18 months.  Perhaps we might be able to deal with this question in the same way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, we are here dealing with a cottage that will be vested under the Act.  The real trouble here are the cases where the cottages have been vested for years without being used, while in the same area there are dozens of people crying out for houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 95a:</P>
      <P>In page 59, subsection (2), line 50, to delete &ldquo;dwelling or a&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This can be discussed with amendment No. 101a which proposes the addition of a new subsection setting out that where a housing authority have provided a cottage before 1st January, 1966 and the authority have not complied with the requirement of subsection (2) of section 12 of the 1936 Act in relation to the cottage, the authority shall, not later than 12 months after the commencement of the section, prepare and submit to the Minister a purchase scheme in relation to the cottage.  Amendment 101 will restrict the obligation of the housing authority to prepare such schemes before 1st January, 1966 and section 89 will accordingly enable housing authorities, if they think fit, to sell or lease any dwelling to which the section applies.  This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 101a.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of rural houses, repayments are small and are over a period, but in the case of urban houses in most cases the purchase scheme is in the form of a lump sum which sometimes is far more than the tenant can find.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Bill as circulated, we had the position covered, as it were, to ensure that rights already enjoyed by tenants occupying local authority houses, though there was a change in the law in regard to the purchase procedure and the purchase amounts, would be continued in the sense that the right to opt to purchase under the old advantageous terms&mdash;if they were advantageous&mdash;would be retained for a period after the coming into force of this enactment. In the Bill as circulated, and in regard to this amendment, we really had no point at which the right would stop.  In other words, persons who had been getting tenancies in the past four or five months since the Bill emerged are in fact, as the Bill stood, carrying with them rights which others who had tenancies earlier have retained and would be said to have a right to retain.  Somebody getting a tenancy yesterday would, in fact, be entitled to the same facilities as somebody who enjoyed a tenancy before this document issued and since we are terminating the right on the enactment of this Bill and for future tenants, what we are now saying <Col N="331" /> is something we should have said earlier, that in respect of this matter, 1st of January will be the date rather than the date of the enactment of the Bill.</P>
      <P>If we had looked at this more carefully at the time we would have said the date the Bill was circulated, or some such date, as the date for this change to have taken place.  We did not do it then or in the interim, and we are now saying we shall do it on 1st January. That is the termination date in this matter and that is really the purpose of the change.  It is a change which I feel is rather belated than coming too soon.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say what will be the position of tenants of the vested cottages or cottages they seek to have vested under purchase orders and for which they have been seeking repairs?  Meantime a number of local authorities have increased the rents and the position is generally that the purchase scheme that applies is based on the rent that is being paid. Can the Minister say is the interest of the tenant who has been paying a lower rent up to this protected in regard to the operation of a purchase scheme while he is still seeking the carrying out of repairs by the local authority and the local authority have increased his rent?  Is his right protected to secure possession of his home on terms of the rent he had been paying?</P>

      <P>No.  In Meath, there were over 5,000 cottages requiring repairs and these had to be taken on a list basis according to the date of application for repairs and in the case of some of those who applied for repairs four or five years ago, the repairs have yet to be done.  If, in fact, those people have applied for vesting <Col N="332" /> and the pre-vesting repairs have not been carried out but the period for vesting has expired, are their rights to vest at the old rate protected?

      <P>Strange things can happen.  We had a tenant who was told he was not entitled to have his cottage vested because he was not an agricultural labourer, although he had been appointed a tenant of the cottage only 12 months earlier.  Under this new arrangement about vesting, is it proposed, while that is being put into operation, not to take account of the subsidy being paid on the house?  From my reading of it, the idea seems to be that the new vesting order can be made on the economic rent of the house rather than the subsidised rent as is done at present.  At present it is 50 or 75 per cent of the subsidised rent.  Under the new proposal it appears&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that it is on the economic rent the terms will be based and somebody paying perhaps £1 rent will be asked to vest at £2.5s.</P>

      <P>If it is in respect of a house provided before 1st January, then at any time, within the stated period in this Bill the existing tenant will still have the right to opt to purchase and merely by applying, he obliges the local authority, whether they have already made a purchase scheme in respect of that house or not, to proceed with the vesting.  If for any reason this vesting is delayed&mdash;because of repairs or any other reason outside the control of the tenant&mdash;his right of vesting and purchase annuity will be related to the circumstances as at the time of his application and not at the time he actually gets the vesting carried out following repairs.</P>

      <P>That is not exactly the point.  The last scheme of house-building in County Meath was two or three years ago and these houses have not yet been put on vesting orders.  If the tenants do not get an option to vest until 1967, does it follow that their payments will be based on the economic rent rather than on the subsidised rent as at present?</P>

If they apply within the stipulated period, whether or not there is a purchase scheme existing, they are all right.  One must be drawn up if there is none and repairs have to be carried out.

      <P>In page 60, to insert before subsection (3) the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A sale or lease under this section shall be effected by means of an order (in this section referred to as a transfer order) made by the housing authority.</P>

      <P>Upon a sale under this section, the housing authority may, if they think fit, agree to the whole or part of the purchase money being paid by instalments or to the payment of part thereof being secured by mortgage or by a charge on the dwelling or in such other manner as they consider adequate. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I support the point that some of the purchase money may be paid over by way of lump sum, although in some counties the local authority may decide it shall be paid over a period or by means of half-yearly instalments. In this case, in regard to the mortgage, to whom will the mortgage be made? Could somebody else, who would provide money towards the purchase of the house, have a mortgage entered on it and obtain a right which the local authority should have?  When the question of mortgage enters into it, does it mean a mortgage by the local authority or may an outsider provide money and secure a mortgage on a house and so, perhaps, defeat the aim of the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem if the local authority provided money to purchase from themselves, they would have a mortgage on the house.  But in the ordinary way would a local authority require a mortgage on their own property?  If somebody outside the local authority can get a mortgage on a property by advancing the purchase price or part of it, are we tending to create within the local authority area the position in which persons could secure a vested interest in local authority houses and be able afterwards to exploit that and deny to the local authority the right to determine whether these houses should be used for the people for whom they were built?  Would the Minister care to comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 88, paragraph (c), states that without the consent of <Col N="337" /> the housing authority, the dwelling or any part thereof shall not be mortgaged, charged and so forth.  If we pass this Bill, a local authority could become the holder of a mortgage.  A house might be sold for £1,500 or £2,000 and the purchaser-occupier might not have the money.  The council, if in a position to do so, might provide the money for him and be paid back under some stipulated arrangement, which should not be confused with a purchase scheme arrangement.  If they have the money and are prepared to provide it, then they hold a mortgage and they make their arrangements the same as anybody else does in the ordinary commercial sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Deputy Jones's point but I do not know whether we can guard against it.  Except in the case of redemption of annuity on a county council cottage, in most cases this will apply, I believe, to urban dwellings.  If someone has not got the money and we prevent that person going to the bank to get the money to purchase the house, then Deputy Jones has a good point when he says that, if some third party produces the money, who would not be allowed to buy that house by the local authority, and the person who is entitled to buy borrows the money from him and gets possession of the house, there is nothing then to prevent the third party subsequently getting possession because the house is clearly bought out.  That is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the Minister is the manager of a local authority and I want to buy a house.  I go to the bank and the bank advances me £2,000.  It would not be reasonable to refuse me permission to mortgage the house in order to raise the money, but, if a person subsequently redeemed that mortgage by taking possession of the house, then it is only a matter of a switch and there is nothing the local <Col N="338" /> authority can do about it because they have, in fact, no say at that stage. There is a problem and it is not an easy one to solve.  I agree it is a question of the lesser of two evils.  Personally, I think we should be very slow to stop people from mortgaging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The other is the problem of the cottage referred to in Tipperary, in which case someone wanted to buy out and the Act was passed for the purpose of giving permission for that to be done.  Again, is there a danger that some third party could produce the necessary money, even at the inflated charge now suggested, to purchase that cottage?  Can that happen?  I think it can under this, but I do not see how we can get out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can get the inflated charge, whatever may be the reason, at least we have gone a long way from the situation in which people could purchase in various nefarious ways at give-away prices.  In that case you lose both the house and your money.  Here, at least, we get the money, and even if the house should ultimately go outside the scope of serving the people for whom it was intended, the local authority has got back substantially the wherewithal to put up another one.</P>

Ultimately these people get old and a third party, usually a young married man and his family, move in. I am citing now an actual instance.  The old person died.  No will was made. The young people continued in residence. Now there may be a thirty-first cousin who will come along later and say he or she is the nearest relative. The transfer has never been registered.

      <P>&ldquo;96.&mdash;Where, immediately before the commencement of this section, a cottage is let by a housing authority under section 24 of the Act of 1950, the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  the authority may declare that the person to whom the cottage was so let is a qualified <Col N="343" /> person, and thereupon such person shall become a qualified person;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to subsection (3) (a), of section 96, I should like the Minister to define &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo;. Will the Minister make regulations defining &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo;?  Is this to be left to the discretion of the local authority?  The subclause says that the authority may declare that the person to whom the cottage was so let is a qualified person, and thereupon such person shall become a qualified person.  What qualifications must an individual have in order to be a qualified person?  Will determination as to his qualification rest on regulations made by the Minister under the Bill or will it rest on regulations which will be made by the local authority under the Bill?

In so far as cottage type houses would be concerned and where, say, an agricultural labourer or a worker of that nature would be concerned, he would as of right be entitled to the facility and in regard to others who would be concerned with the dearer type houses the discretion would lie with the local authority as to what the conditions would be.</P>

Would the local authority be able to decide that they were not qualified persons and were not entitled to be housed by the local authority with the result that they would be thrown back on their own resources?  The Minister referred to better class houses.  The rent at which houses are let depends on the cost of erection.  Houses that <Col N="344" /> formerly would have been regarded as dear houses would not be so regarded now.  I should like to know whether or not people living in the country within the town areas and who would be classed as artisans would be regarded as being outside the scope of the section as being not qualified?</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Jones poses a question. There are certain people for whom the local authority have responsibility in the matter of housing.  If a certain class is picked out, is there a danger that others may be ruled out because of the mention of one class?  If the Minister is satisfied that that will not be the case, the problem is cleared. In the area in which I live there is only a small number of farm labourers in a housing scheme.  The other people in the scheme would be people who work in Dublin and other places.  Is there any danger that there might be a suggestion that the Bill says that these people do not qualify?</P>

      <P>The Bill proposes to do away with purchase schemes related to particular classes.  That is a very great liberalisation of the situation.  It means that a local authority, having a great deal of discretion vested in it, determines to whom it may sell and gives them wider power than they have enjoyed heretofore.  It does not tie them <Col N="345" /> to selling only to restricted classes, as was the case in the past.  The definition and determination of classes has been eroded over the years and we came to a point where none of us was too sure as to who was entitled to what.  We are doing away with the naming of classes and leaving the discretion with the local authority as to whom houses may be sold.</P>

      <P>I wonder.  There is just one thing about this and about the Act which was passed a few weeks ago.  It appears that certain legal advisers down the country who were insisting on certain things have got occasion to crow because they say if it were not necessary to introduce this, it would not have been introduced. Personally, I think the Minister was right to introduce an amendment in the previous Bill for the purpose of clarifying the position when we had these awkward customers who would not agree.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to any other power in that behalf, a housing authority may withhold their consent to the alienation of a cottage if they are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) the person to whom it is intended to alienate the cottage is a person who is not in need of housing, or</P>
      <P>(b) the alienation would, if effected, cause or be likely to cause the person intending to make the alienation or any of his dependants to be a person without adequate or suitable housing.  </P>
      <P>I was not quite happy about that, but having reread it, I agree with the Minister that the idea behind it is quite good.  We will have to see how it works out.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I move amendment No. 106:</P>
      <P>(i)  To delete all words from &ldquo;An&rdquo; in line 19 down to and including &ldquo;amount&rdquo; in line 22 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An annuity at any time outstanding, may, if the housing authority entitled to receive the <Col N="347" /> annuity think fit, be redeemed by the person liable to pay the annuity by payment to the authority of such amount as may be&rdquo;; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  In lines 26 and 27 to delete &ldquo;or the part (as the case may be)&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that the amount approved by the Minister for the redemption of an annuity need bear no relationship whatever to the amount of the annuity.  It may, in fact, be more closely related to the market value of the premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is likely to cause a considerable amount of trouble.  The Minister is perfectly correct when he says that if somebody wants to vest a house for the purpose of reselling it as soon as possible and picking up a good deal of money, he knows he cannot do that if the annuity is being paid.  Therefore, the only course open to him is to redeem it. The way to stop that kind of thing, of course, is to put a market price or value on it.  So far, I am all with the Minister.  When this was being discussed on the other Bill, the Minister said it was not intended that this would arise when people were selling to people of the class who would normally be entitled to local authority housing, say, a relative or some such person.  Since the discretion is left with the local authority, I have discussed the matter with a number of senior officials of various county councils and I am afraid they have got the idea that people who want to redeem their annuity should be asked by them to pay as near as possible to the market value even though the people will only be paying it for the purpose of saying that they, in fact, own their house.  This is something which, perhaps, the Minister might have another look at because, while the idea behind it originally was good, there is a danger it may cause trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second danger.  Supposing somebody wants to sell a plot to one of his neighbours for the purpose of building either a cottage or a house.  Some local authorities feel that if that is being done, the same regulation applies and that they should be able to collect <Col N="348" /> most of what is paid for the portion of land for the site.  This is something which will have to be very carefully examined before it is put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to require the market value is there.  There is a discretion to meet the possible peculiar cases which might arise where the market value should not be insisted upon.  I do not know what justification there might be for it but the power is there to get the market value, while a discretion is provided that they may not seek the market value in certain circumstances, if cases arise where the circumstances would warrant a departure from it.  The power is definitely there and it is really the discretion which should be the exception rather than the application of the market value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the market value there depend on what the local land prices may be at the time, or does it depend on what the building site may be worth at the time?  There are cases in proximity to towns at the present time where a portion of a cottage plot could be most valuable as a building site but its market value would be a very different thing altogether with regard to the prices ranging in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="349" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no sort of tie in that case and the market value would be permissible where it relates to the land or house, or the two together.  It must mean the price obtainable on the market.  In other words, auction value and where half, an acre next door was not worth half, this is not to be taken as a guide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the site is simply being sold, does the same thing apply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So it means that in the case of somebody who has a house, if some of his neighbours want to buy a site, this can apply if he wants to redeem.  The Minister will, of course, understand that this will very effectively stop these people from selling sites.  The only reason they are selling them now is that they are able to get something out of it.  There is no onus on them to give the money to the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I might mention a case where the owner of a cottage site has got up to £500, or over, for half an acre as a building site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a 20-year purchase and ten years had already passed in a case like this, where half the plot was being sold, the situation would very likely work out this way. Whatever was the total value of the site, you would probably halve it if you were selling half the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that it gives all the power that is required to charge enough and it also contains the discretion to charge less, and to try to determine each individual case here, in a general way, would be very dangerous. In fact, it could not be done. As I say, the general power to charge enough and the discretion to charge less on the merits of the case and in the circumstances is there.  I do not think you can better that.  Even though you might not be happy in that, there is the discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of those people who at present are prepared to sell sites or vested lots do so because of the fact that it means money in their pockets.  It is not because of love of their neighbour or anything else.  If the situation is created that they do not get the money, that the local authority gets it, does it not follow that they will not be anxious to sell?  Then the big pool of sites, which many of us were hoping would appear, may be dried up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy clarify this for me because it is not terribly clear what the Deputy wants us to do and what he has in mind regarding those sites readily available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it to the Minister in a few words.  If the local authority build a house, and it is vested in the tenant and the tenant wants to terminate his annuity for the purpose of selling it at a big profit, despite the fact that the house cost the local authority a considerable amount of money, there is quite a point in saying that he cannot do that, that if he wants to do that, he must pay the market value to the council first.  That is fair enough but now I come to the second part.  Along with the house, there is an acre of land which was bought at £30 or £40&mdash;at the present time it would be something more&mdash; and if the tenant wants to sell half of that to a neighbour or someone else for the purpose of erecting a cottage and he is offered a fairly good price for it, he will sell that under existing legislation.  Now, if the local authority can say that he must pay the market value to them first, does the Minister not agree that this will have the effect of quite a number of people refusing to sell sites which they had intended to sell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about working these halves, the half of a half and so on, and really this implies that that has been the approach up to now.  Now it is proposed that the market value will ultimately come to the council&mdash;not all of it.  On the other hand, a local authority, for a very good reason now find a very desirable site to build a <Col N="351" /> house for a member of a family, which could be part of an existing cottage plot.  Where they are not being &ldquo;done&rdquo;, and it is desirable from the council's point of view that they should get it in order to build a house, I do not think there is any difficulty at all for the council.  The owner of the plot and the proposed builder can get together, and a big sum of money does not necessarily pass in the transaction, but a good price is being paid for half the cottage plot and in such circumstances, it is only to be expected that the local authority should get some part of it, since the occupant is not yet the full owner.  I should think the amount the occupant would get and the council would get would be related to the number of years of the annuity payment period already expired, that there would be a relationship as between them in the price agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>Maybe not, but supposing somebody is selling a plot for £100 and the county manager says that they must get most of that amount does it not follow that the plot will not be sold?  This will reduce the number of sites available.  The person who wants to buy it can buy it only from the tenant but the local authority will say: &ldquo;You must pay so much to us&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Section 99 provides that where an annuity on a cottage is redeemed, the statutory conditions applying to the cottage shall cease to have effect. These statutory conditions are designed in the Act of 1936 and provide against alienation, sub-division, taking of sand, soil or gravel from the plot, and so on.  The restriction on charging or mortgaging is, however, not a statutory <Col N="354" /> condition.  Under these amendments, when the annuity on a cottage is redeemed, this restriction, as well as the statutory conditions, and all other provisions of the Act of 1936&mdash;relating to the recovery of the cottages, repairs, and so on, during the payment period &mdash;will cease to apply.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 109:</P>
      <P>In page 64, subsection (2), line 45, to insert, &ldquo;or otherwise than on account of the provisions of a scheme providing for graded or differential rents,&rdquo; after &ldquo;rate&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 100 provides that where the rent of labourers' cottages is revised, otherwise than on account of a change in the rate, the annuity payable for the purchase of the cottage will bear the same proportion to the revised rent as the annuity specified in the purchase scheme bore to the rent at the time the purchase scheme was made.  It is necessary to exclude from the scope of this provision changes in rent in accordance with a graded or differential rent scheme, since many purchase schemes specify an annuity based on the maximum rent in the scheme.  Thus, a scheme could provide for a maximum <Col N="355" /> rent of £2 a week and the purchase scheme for an annuity of £1 a week, that is, 50 per cent of the maximum rent.  If at the time the purchase scheme was made, the tenant was paying 10/- a week and his rent was consequently increased to 15/-, he could, theoretically, purchase for 7/6d. a week, that is, 50 per cent of the new rent, even though the purchase scheme specified an annuity of £1 a week. The purpose of the amendment is to wipe out this anomaly, which it actually is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Anomaly&rdquo; is right.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 100, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I think, is being introduced to deal with the type of house where somebody is paying a rent of about 1/6d. a week and the annuity is declared at 10d. or 11d.: we have many such old houses throughout the country.  Then the person who was the tenant of the house at that rent dies and a new tenant is appointed and the rent is fixed at 15/- or £1 a week, or whatever it is.  I assume from the Minister that what is meant is that those people would have to base the annuity they would have to pay on the same proportion of the rent as the previous annuity quoted in the Order was a proportion of the rent being paid at the time.  I can understand that.  I do not think it is a good idea because it simply means that, where there is a fixed Order in force, many of the local authorities might, when appointing a new tenant and knowing that that new tenant was going to vest the house, be tempted to make the rent much higher than it should be, knowing that it was going to affect the amount of annuity to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point arises where repairs are carried out before vesting and the repairs include such things as writing for electricity or the inclusion of a range where there is a smoking chimney, and so on.  Is it suggested <Col N="356" /> that, if the rent is raised in order to compensate for that over a period of years, it should be taken into account for the purpose of assessing the new annuity?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes, I am told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, does it mean that the local authority would get more money?  For instance, take the position where a room has had to be added to one of these houses to provide for a growing family.  Generally, the rent is raised on these occasions to provide for that.  Deputy Tully mentioned the question of having to provide a range even in replacement of one that has not been satisfactory or that was worn out and the rent is increased.  These are increases other than increases in relation to the rate. In other words, does the Minister mean that the purchase price will be related to the same fraction as the annuity would have borne to the other rent? Is that what is meant in the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the section would be to apply, in regard to a purchase annuity, the same up and down movements in any annuity as would apply under the differential rents scheme under which this particular property had been rented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  I would hope more often up than down &mdash;not because I want to see them up but because things are looking up when they are going up on a differential rent basis.  The other thing, of course, is that if they fall on harder times and things are difficult, they can come down.  That is really what we are providing for here.  It is variable in the same manner as the differential rent would be variable.</P>

We are getting a spoonful of sugar to tell us how good it is. A number of these people will be badly caught when it goes to those who are appointed tenants of old cottages in the country.  Lots of old people do not vest their houses and when they die the new tenant will be asked to vest at a very much higher rate.  The Minister might as well admit that that is partly the intention of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in regard to a vacant vested cottage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way can this help the vested owner or secure ordinary justice?  If a local authority knows that the cottage has not been occupied for 18 months and they decide&mdash;and they do not do these things lightly&mdash;they should repossess the cottage, having probably half a dozen people on the waiting list, what purpose will be served at the end of the 18 months if instead of proceeding in court in the ordinary way they must get the sanction of the Minister for Local Government?  The Minister has no way of knowing what the situation is in regard to the cottage.  It means that an official must be sent down to hear at first hand from the officials in the local authority what the situation is.  Alternatively the Minister will write and get a reply back; or, the third way, he will decide without making any investigation at all. How will that help the person from whom the cottage is to be taken by the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is cluttering up all the machinery which has been set in motion for the recovery of cottages on which the annuity has not been completed. If the Minister, instead of doing that, inserted a section to the effect that if the local authority proceeded against a person in court&mdash;and they must proceed in court&mdash;to recover the cottage, he would have the right to appeal to the Minister against such a decision, that might be of some use. However, this section is merely putting <Col N="360" /> the dead hand of the Department of Local Government on the proposal, and it will be 12 or 18 months before the matter is dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is this danger.  If the cottage is unoccupied for 18 months and the local authority then wants to take proceedings, if they do so immediately they may recover the cottage.  But if it has to go to the Department of Local Government and is held up for a considerable period longer, as soon as the row starts, there is nothing to stop that person, the owner of the cottage, getting into it himself or putting somebody else into it, putting up a bluff. The result will be that the cottage will not be recovered.  This section completely defeats the whole idea contained in the other parts of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 27 of the Labourers Act, 1936, provided for the consolidation of a council cottage and land subject to Land Purchase Acts. Doubts have been raised by the Land Registry as to whether section 27 gives the power to consolidate a council cottage in respect of which the annuity is fully paid.

      <P>Section 17 (2) (c) of the Labourers Act, 1936, provides that a vesting order shall be expressed and operate to vest a cottage on the gale day, that is, the vesting day, next following the date of such vesting order.  A number of cases have arisen where a date other than such a date has been specified in the Order.  Section 20 of the 1936 Act gives the power to correct by ministerial order such mistakes but in the present case this procedure would be extremely time-consuming.  The Land Registry agreed to register such cases and subsection (2) of section 101 is intended to cover such mistakes where a day not later than 30th October, 1961 was specified in the Order.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend this date to 31st December, 1964, to cover other cases which have come to notice since the Bill was drafted.</P>

A number of local authorities propose to fix the vesting <Col N="364" /> day as 25th December.

      <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he would bring the wording of part of this section to the notice of the Minister. It is a long and rather involved section. The whole purpose of the Bill is to make the provision of houses an easier matter.  We have decided in this Bill what the reserved functions of the housing authority should be.  We have decided that the elected representatives have certain responsibilities and that the manager shall have certain reserved functions.  It would seem that if the manager, acting on the authority of the elected representatives, feels that houses which are vacant in an area and are required for housing should be acquired, the onus is put on the local authority to apply to the Minister for permission to acquire these houses.  What would happen if the Minister decided not to give permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is clearly a case in which a local authority would be proceeding for the acquisition of a house and I think the Minister will have to justify this function which is reserved to him. What would the position be if a local authority decided that it was desirable <Col N="365" /> to acquire a house in an area and the Minister decided that he would not grant them acquisition powers?  This is a matter which the Parliamentary Secretary should look into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume it is proposed to have another look at this part of the section.  There is another matter, the person who has not been in occupation of a house for 18 months.  I think that period of 18 months is too long.  After all, if somebody has been out of a house for a period of 12 months, why should he be allowed, unless he can give very good reasons, to hold on to the cottage? The Minister might consider reducing the period of 18 months to 12 months, particularly in view of the fact that so many people are without houses.  Sometimes a local authority may vest a cottage over a period of years and the person who owns the cottage may die and will it to somebody who may not need it.  Should the local authority not be given the right of first refusal, shall we say&mdash;the right to purchase back the cottage?</P>

      <P>The 18 months provision here is new, and while it may seem to be a bit long, by putting this in, we are taking away a right that has existed.  Heretofore, there was no condition in regard to a person's normal place of residence.  If we seem to be a bit generous here in providing a period of 18 months, we must consider it in the context that this is new and is taking away a certain right that has existed.  Perhaps we may feel it is a right that should not have existed but in fact it did.  We must also have regard to the fact that we are applying this retrospectively.  For that reason also we should be a little more generous than if we were, so to speak, starting afresh.</P>

      <P>Local authorities will henceforth be up against the problem of the person who has a small portion of land and whose holding will be consolidated with the cottage. The Land Commission have been making a point during the past few years of consolidating holdings when vesting takes place.  Does the Minister envisage any difficulty in subdividing again which must be done in order to get possession of the cottage and does he think the powers he is taking here are adequate in that respect?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Land Act, 1946 provides that where additional land is allocated by the Land Commission for the enlargement of the original holding and such additional land has not been <Col N="369" /> consolidated, it shall not be lawful for the purchaser to assign, transfer, subdivide or sublet either the additional land or the original holding without the consent of the Land Commission and any such transfer, etc. shall be void.  Section 7 of the Act provides that where such additional land is allocated, the additional land shall, on the death of the purchaser, devolve on the person on whom the original holding devolves.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry have expressed doubts as to whether the reference to the original holding in sections 6 and 7 of the Land Act, 1946 would catch the case of a vested council cottage and plot.

      <P>In page 66, line 41 to 46, to substitute &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo; for &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, to my mind, contains <Col N="371" /> wording which will impose a grave hardship on tenants of local authority houses unless it is altered.  At present before a cottage can be vested, it must be in good structural repair and sanitary condition.  It is proposed here that it only needs to be in good structural repair.  In fact, subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>In determining for the purpose of this section whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure. </P>
    <P>Does the Minister mean by that if there are four walls and a roof, the house is in good structural repair and it does not matter whether it is in a sanitary condition?  This is a very serious matter because we all know of houses, even old ruins&mdash;I suppose one could say that Ballintubber Abbey is one&mdash;in good structural repair but which certainly are not places where a family would be expected to live. Possibly an error was made in the wording in having it put in that way, but as it stands &ldquo;good structural repair&rdquo; is all that is required.  We believe that unless &ldquo;and sanitary condition&rdquo; is added, the section will do a big disservice to tenants of local authority houses who want to vest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Tully, this section is not confined to cottages in rural Ireland.  I understand it would also apply in cases where housing authorities in urban areas are prepared to introduce tenant purchase schemes.  Under present legislation, if somebody applies for a repair or improvement grant by means of which he can claim assistance from the State and the local authority, one of the conditions is that the dwelling be fully fit, and certainly the State or the local authority would not think of providing money by way of repair and improvement grants on the basis that there were a roof and four walls but not adequate sanitary accommodation or if the floors, even the ground floors, were not in order.  They are very specific about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> Yet it appears from the section as it stands that a housing authority could think of selling to the tenant a house consisting of a reasonably sound roof and four reasonably sound walls.  The house, if examined by a health inspector of the same authority, if it were owned by somebody else, might well be unsuitable and unfit for habitation under the sanitary regulations because of lack of proper sanitary provision. Consequently, we feel that the section should include not only &ldquo;good structural repair&rdquo; but also &ldquo;and sanitary condition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a housing authority, with the sanction of the Minister, should enter into a scheme to sell to tenants dwellings which are not in good structural condition and do not comply with proper sanitary regulations.  It would be wrong to sell a house in which there was a bathroom and toilet but a defective running water system. That would not necessarily make a dwelling unsound structurally and, under this section, there would be nothing to prevent a housing authority endeavouring to sell a house in that condition.  Yet the same authority would declare that house unsuitable because it did not comply with sanitary requirements.  For that reason we suggest the section should include &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo; to meet that difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the last two speakers.  It is not sufficient simply to have four good walls.  The definition is too wide.  You want to make certain that the cottage is in good repair with good doors, wooden floors, that it be properly heated, with no draughts, and that there be proper sanitary facilities.  The definition is too wide as it stands.  It leaves too much room for local authorities to evade their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>The amendment should seem clear and reasonable to the Minister, in view of the vast number of complaints continually pouring into his Department concerning the poor standard of repairs to council cottages. One of the saving features for the <Col N="373" /> tenant has been his right of appeal to the Minister, if he is dissatisfied with the repairs carried out.  The tenants have been availing of that right.  The number of appeals upheld by the Minister is exceptionally high, reaching 70 per cent or 80 per cent for the whole country.  It is worrying to think that housing authorities are so indifferent in the matter of carrying out repairs to their property.</P>
      <P>There is much to be desired in the type of repair being carried out.  Strict supervision is required.  We need to get away from the terminology in this section that it is sufficient to put the cottage in &ldquo;good structural condition.&rdquo; We know the interpretation county managers will put on that.  It will mean, in effect, that tenants may not expect to have any of the ordinary repairs carried out.  Provided there is no desperate crack in the walls and the roof is not falling in, the engineer will deem it to be in good structural condition, ignoring the general state of disrepair of the cottage, such matters as windows falling out, doors rotting away, floors with serious defects, plaster falling off, and so on.  The people will be expected to be satisfied with what is deemed a good structural repair job.</P>
      <P>We are concerned to see that the tenant's right of appeal to the Minister is maintained so that he can be assured of having a decent, thorough repair job carried out on his house.  We would ask the Minister therefore to accept this amendment so that there will be good structural repair in every sense and that it will include sanitary facilities as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some attempt at a slick tactic by some officers of the Minister's Department to rid themselves of the great embarrassment caused by the colossal number of appeals against unsatisfactory repairs. The fact that so many of these appeals have been upheld by the Minister is obviously a serious indictment of housing authorities and a great reflection on managers, engineers and all those responsible for ensuring a reasonable repair job is carried out. Clearly, there is not proper supervision and in many cases no attempt <Col N="374" /> is made to ensure that the work is carried out by craftsmen and <i>bona fide</i> tradesmen.  We have had a spectacle in many counties of any kind of handyman being awarded contracts for the repair of cottages and being approved by the engineer.  Then the tenant appeals and the appeal is upheld by the Minister.  The Minister has to send his engineers down the country to look over these repairs and in 80 per cent of cases, they have recommended that additional repairs be done.</P>
    <P>We want to maintain and strengthen the tenant's right of appeal.  It is anomalous that the fundamental right of appeal against an unsatisfactory repair job is vested in the council tenant but no such right of appeal exists in the case of an urban tenant. The tenants of corporation and urban houses have no such right of appeal, and I have often wondered why.  Why do we concede this important right to county council tenants and deny it to the tenants of urban dwellings?</P>
    <P>It is very laudable that we should maintain the principle of vesting and it is desirable that tenants should be enticed to purchase their houses.  One of the best ways of inducing tenants to purchase is by making adequate repairs to the houses.  If it goes abroad from here that something which tenants enjoyed up to this will in future be filched from them, there will be, I believe, a serious diminution in the number anxious to have their houses vested. No one will want to own a house that is in bad repair.  It is very important that there should be no ambiguity whatsoever as to the kind of repairs that will be carried out.  Everything should be repaired from the broken lock on the door to the broken hasp on the window.</P>
    <P>We were very disturbed when we read this section and saw the implications. I fear, as I said earlier, that the number of successful appeals because of unsatisfactory repairs has been a source of embarrassment to the Minister and his Department.  It is very important that we should do everything to ensure that there will be no bad workmanship.  In 80 per cent of <Col N="375" /> appeals, additional repairs were recommended.  It is only right that local authorities should be obliged to ensure adequate repairs.  If local authorities have been remiss in relation to adequate repairs, and that has been borne out by the number of successful appeals, we should do nothing here which may result in their being even more remiss in the future.  It would be a bad thing, too, if tenants were dissuaded from owning their houses because of this fear of bad repair work on the part of local authorities.  That is why we recommend this amendment.  I am sure Deputies realise there is a serious defect in the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy makes much of the fact that a great number of appeals are upheld.  He does not take into account the fact that this proves nothing whatsoever, other than that, under the existing legislation, local authorities have been required to carry out all sorts of footling repairs. The idea of taking an appeal, and having it upheld, for fixing a gap in a sod fence, putting a latch on a door, or a catch on a window, seems stretching the law too far altogether. These are things the normal householder would do for himself.  Local authorities must bear the responsibility if maintenance is not carried out as it should be carried out.  The figures for maintenance range from £4 to £24 and in the majority of cases, the figure is nearer £4 than it is to £24.  If local authorities do not provide money for maintenance, there is little point in anyone coming in here saying this law is wrong or that law is wrong.  In many cases tenants make no effort to maintain their property.  If the property were their own, they would do these repairs themselves.  All that really is required is a little more consideration and care on the part of tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here some typical cases: annuity purchase money of £2 12s. a year: cost of repairs prior to vesting £363; annuity purchase money, £1 6s. a year: cost of repairs £301; annuity purchase money, £1 1s. 8d.: cost of repairs £412.  These costs might be justified if it were a case of putting <Col N="376" /> every last little thing into first-class condition, but a great deal of the work that is now insisted upon results from an accumulation of small items, small repairs that the tenant could just as quickly and as cheaply have done for himself.  This accumulation arises out of the neglect of the tenant and not just neglect of maintenance by the local authority.  We should not hold ourselves out as ready to do every little repair that may appear to be desirable. Some of these repairs could easily be effected by someone who is handy at that sort of thing.  That is not to say that repairs in respect of bad woodwork, dosed timber or timber suffering from dry rot, the relining of flues, the rebuilding of a chimney, the replacement of part of a roof, the improvement or repair of a roof, the replacement of slates will be discontinued in future.  These are repairs that will be insisted upon in future. Anything outside the scope of what the tenant could reasonably be expected to do and would be capable of doing will come within the &ldquo;structurally sound condition&rdquo; mentioned in the new provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been another change over recent years, that repair or reconstruction grants have been made available for vested cottages.  These have been availed of by quite a number of vested cottage holders and I would hope that they will be availed of in future to an even greater degree.  This is a good departure, that people who decide to purchase get the houses in many cases at a give-away price on those terms and in sound structural condition.  In other words, the walls are sound and will stand the test of time; the roof is sound and will stand the test of weather such as we are now experiencing; the floors are sound; the ceilings are sound and stairs, if any, are sound; the house they are getting is a sound structure.</P>
    <P>In many cases where the holders have been living in the houses for some time they have been doing jobs on their houses but there are many other cases where damage has been caused to houses by neglect.  A stitch in time saves nine.  A sod may be taken from a ditch.  If it is replaced, no damage is <Col N="377" /> done.  Where it is not replaced, the ditch disintegrates and the holder wants the ditch repaired and the gates repaired and painted.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell me the national percentage of appeals upheld by him?</P>

      <P>75 to 80 per cent.  We would probably find that 75 to 80 per cent of that 75 to 80 per cent were appeals upheld to conform with the law, which has been abused in that the matters were of a fiddling nature that should not be the concern of the local authority at the expense of the ratepayer. Many of the cases arose from neglect of the tenants who occupied the houses at give-away rents and who are now being given the houses at give-away purchase rates.  That should be borne in mind and also the fact that £300,000 odd was borrowed in a given 12 months for maintenance and repairs under this head and is still not sufficient. This was borrowed money, not current spending.  The more money taken for that purpose, the less money there is available for providing houses for those who have not got a house. A balance must be maintatined.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that we should do everything, that the tenant has rights which should be safeguarded. The matter must be kept in proper perspective.  It is little things that have caused the great number of appeals upheld&mdash;matters of no great importance in the great majority of cases.  We are not leaving the tenant without protection in so far as the structure of the house is concerned.  We will be ensuring that he gets a structurally sound house and we will be able to concentrate as to appeals on the question of the house being structurally sound in the matters that count rather than covering an immense amount of appeals in regard to fiddling things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind at all times that the houses we are talking about are good value.  If the tenants do not think they are good value, they need not opt to purchase.  The discretion is theirs.  If they decide that it is good value to purchase, let us facilitate them.  It is not fair to conclude from <Col N="378" /> what has been said here that we are abandoning the tenants to rack-renting landlords who have no regard for them and who will bruise them down and squeeze them out and leave them in condition that nobody would tolerate.  Remember, this is the housing authority, the authority whose responsibility it is to provide houses, the authority that created the houses we are now talking about and will continue to provide houses for more and more of our people.</P>
    <P>It should be realised that we cannot give everything to everybody down to putting paint on the door and paint on the gate, a latch on a door or a catch on a window.  There are more important things to be done that may be neglected at the moment.  It is far better to utilise money on more vital things and let the tenants have a care for themselves, which they will have when the houses are vested in them. Let them have a care as to these little things.  Give them a sound building and facilities at very favourable prices and let the rest of us get on with the provision of houses for people who have not houses.  Where there is any departure from the law we propose to enact, let us crack down and see that there is no abuse.</P>

      <P>We would appear to have reached the stage where the Bill is being directed against the cottage tenants.  The Bill started off as a Housing Bill but a couple of sections make us suspicious that this Bill is directed in a certain way.  It now seems quite obvious that the Department of Local Government have inserted a section which we thought was loosely worded and that they had forgotten to include the words &ldquo;good sanitary condition&rdquo;, in which they say &ldquo;if the house is in good structural repair&rdquo;. Subsection (4) which we are asking to have deleted, in amendment 119, could be discussed with amendment No. 118.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking to have that deleted because it says&mdash;and this goes a great deal further than what the Minister has been saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> In determining for the purpose of this section whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure. </P>
    <P>Surely that means that if the house can stand up, if there is no danger of its falling down because of the fact that heavy traffic passes it or because of gale force winds, as far as the Department of Local Government are concerned, the tenant has no right to appeal?</P>
    <P>During discussions in the House over the past few years, we have had on many occasions to bring to the notice of the Minister the extraordinary position where a local authority official examines a house and says that it is in good structural repair and good sanitary condition.  The house is vested in the tenant, the tenant subsequently appeals to the Minister and, following that appeal, an inspector is sent down to examine the house and stipulates that certain things be done. The local authority and the tenant are both notified and, when the repairs are done&mdash;or whether they are done at all or not&mdash;it is the official who originally said the house needed no repair who has the final say in the matter.  I was hoping, when the Minister was introducing the Bill&mdash;particularly as it was referring to this type of house&mdash;that he would attempt to have included a section or subsection which would state that the cottage or house would have to be examined by one of his officials because I think it most unfair that the person who originally said it required no repair should have the final say in whether or not the repairs were properly carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about the small cost of repairing some of the houses and the stupid footling appeals which have been sent in by certain people.  I am not aware that this is a common practice.  As a matter of fact, the appeals sent in are usually fairly serious ones.  Very often they are sent in by people who could not, by any <Col N="380" /> stretch of imagination, be expected to carry out the repairs themselves.  I should say, for the Minister's information, that his Department will not give grants for the repair of cottages which have recently been vested, on the ground that the local authority were supposed to put them into good repair before the vesting took place.  That being so, I cannot see how the Minister can say he has extended to vested cottages the right to have reconstruction grants applied.</P>
    <P>I myself had experience of an inspector of his Department visiting a cottage which was in a pretty bad state of repair.  One of the items down for inspection, or repair, was outoffices. That inspector looked at the outoffices and, in his report, he put a proviso that the door should be repaired.  But there was no roof at all on the outoffices.  It had been blown away in a storm some time previously. When the Minister speaks of all the futile repairs, I think that is the type of repair which should be done.  We all know of the leaking roofs, damaged doors and floors in bedrooms which have gone down years ago because the tenant who occupied the premises was too poor to have the repairs carried out.  This is deliberately intended to prevent this type of repair being done in the future.</P>
    <P>I know it is costing a lot of money. I know that over the years various devices have had to be used in order to raise that money but I still do not think it absolves the Minister or his Department from the responsibility. I think it is wrong to try to phrase a section of a Bill in such a way that, if it were not noticed, it could be said afterwards: &ldquo;Oh, you all passed it and saw it when it went through the House and nobody complained.&rdquo;  It is wrong to use that type of argument and it should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>One other thing I think the Minister has against this type of person&mdash;and it is entirely a build-up against this type of person&mdash;is the fee.  A person submitting an appeal must pay a fee. Can the Minister envisage an old woman living in a house which is vested and who is not satisfied with its <Col N="381" /> condition and who appeals to his Department?  What chance will she have to appeal if there is a fee laid down, even if it is as low as £2?  Surely the whole thing is aimed at trying to prevent a tenant from getting the rights which, up to now, he or she had to appeal to the Department against the condition of the house when it is vested.  For that reason I feel that, unless the Minister is prepared to reconsider this, we will have no option at all but to force this to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked by the Minister's observations when he referred to these as footling little jobs and the expense they impose on the ratepayers.  He has stated that the tenants should be reasonably expected to carry out many of these repairs and do the work themselves.  I am sure the Minister realises that in rural Ireland we still have poor people, many people with large families, who are not in a position to carry out what may appear to the Minister or a Deputy small and footling little repairs.  There are many of these people living in rural Ireland on £6 or £7 a week, trying to rear a family of seven, eight or nine children. Remember these people's hands are full already.  While putting a latch on a door, painting and so on may seem to the Minister to be footling little jobs, to these people, they certainly are not footling little things. Many of these people are not, and would not, be in a position to carry out this type of repair to their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that 75 per cent of the appeals have been upheld by him and by his engineers. Earlier on he said that that proves nothing.  I think it does; it proves that unsatisfactory repairs have been carried out to these houses, when the county manager, the county engineers or gangers have not being doing their duty.  It proves we have not got strict supervision in the carrying out of this work.  Some of those people should be asked to account for the reason why those houses have not been properly repaired, because it is wrong for an engineer in a county to say a particular house which has been sold is in a <Col N="382" /> proper state of repair.  Then, when the tenant goes into it and appeals to the Minister, the Minister's engineer goes down and admits, in 75 to 80 per cent of the cases, that the house has not been properly repaired.  Either the county manager or county engineer has not done his duty and he should do his duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the large sums of money spent on repairing cottages. We all know and admit that it places a big burden on the ratepayers in every county but, yet, it is the duty of the ratepayers to provide cottages for these people who are unable to provide houses for themselves, to keep them in a decent state of repair and, if they are being vested, put them in a proper state of repair before they are vested.  The Minister has spoken about a stitch in time saving nine.  We all agree on that and it applies very much to what we are discussing at the present time.  Remember those cottages cost, perhaps, £1,500 or £1,600 to build.  If the county council do not put them in a proper state of repair before vesting, what will happen to them in a few years' time?  They may fall into a terrible state of dilapidation and the ratepayers may have to take the people out of them and build new cottages for them.  That can happen. While the Minister may say those things are footling, to the poor and those who have to do the work, they certainly are not footling repairs.</P>
    <P>It should be our ideal to induce the owner of a cottage to buy out his cottage because we admit that the vast majority of Irish people will take a greater pride in their own cottage when it is bought out; but, if this section comes to the notice of the people, there will certainly be a serious diminution in the number of people coming forward to buy out their own houses. I am still of the opinion that any defect in the cottage should be attended to and the cottage should be put into a proper state of repair before the tenant is asked to sign for it or to buy it out.  If this section is left in, we all know and admit that the county managers and county engineers will look for a way out of spending money, and <Col N="383" /> the way is there.  If this amendment is put to a vote, we will have to vote in support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly interested to note that the Minister, in dealing with the comments made by Deputies, made no reference to the position with regard to houses other than county council cottages.  The bulk of the Minister's remarks were directed to the cottage of the type that was normally vested.  As I understand it, and in the absence of correction from the Minister, this particular section was applied in a case where a local authority proposed to sell a house under the Housing Acts.  If so, the situation is not quite as simple, and is not quite as the Minister says.  First of all, we know very well, any of us who are associated with local authorities, that over the past 20 or 30 years, the standard of maintenance has been declining steadily and it has reached the point at which maintenance is confined to such repairs as the county manager, or the city manager, as the case may be, cannot avoid doing.</P>
      <P>A possible explanation for that is that over the years the cost of maintenance of local authority dwellings has been a revenue expenditure and has been going up very considerably. There is scarcely a Deputy who is not aware that it is a too common experience that complaints regarding the condition of dwellings are submitted time after time and in many cases completely ignored, unless or until the tenant concerned, who has a grievance, contacts his local representative, or possibly a Deputy.  Then attention is very often given fairly quickly to such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to coats of paint.  In my earlier remarks, I dealt with something which I think is much more basic than coats of paint, although coats of paint serve a very necessary purpose from the point of view of general maintenance.  They help to preserve woodwork particularly.  I referred to the case where the water system may be defective, where the house has a bath which may be defective. The bath is not part of the structure <Col N="384" /> of the house but there was no indication given in the Minister's reply that the defective bath would be replaced, that that was the meaning of the particular phrase.  The toilet may be inside or outside, and it could be defective, but, as far as I can see, the interpretation of &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo; need not necessarily apply to a family toilet.</P>
    <P>A chimney may be giving continuous trouble and, in the life of a tenancy, the local authority, even if they fail to carry out their responsibility in many cases, have some responsibility for endeavouring to cure it.  A faulty chimney can arise from a number of things; yet some of them may not necessarily affect the stability of the dwelling as such.  The doors and the door frames of a house may be warped, as they frequently are, from time to time, because of the use of substandard timber.  Even houses built in recent years have been the subject of complaints under this heading; yet that may not necessarily affect the actual solidity of the structure because the four walls can still stand even though there is no door or the door is battered and twisted and in a very bad condition.</P>
    <P>The plaster work of the dwelling may be defective because of the incursion of damp and plaster may be falling off the walls; yet it may be held by an authority that the wall is still standing, even though half the plaster is off.  We could go on and on with these cases.  They are cases which would clearly indicate that the house was not in good sanitary condition.  Let me remind the House that, from time to time over recent years, within a few months of houses being constructed, there are complaints from tenants.  We are aware that under normal construction of all dwellings, there is a maintenance period of maybe six months, or perhaps 12 months in extreme cases. A tremendous number of complaints which would normally affect, in our opinion, the good sanitary condition of houses may not appear within that particular period; yet the test, if we come to a particular point of complaints by the tenants of the houses, <Col N="385" /> comes back again to whether the roof has the full number of slates on it or is reasonably sound, whether the four walls are such as will stand up for a number of years.</P>
    <P>That is why we are so concerned with this section and with this amendment. That sets out very clearly indeed what the meaning of good structure is for the purpose of this Bill. It says:</P>
    <P>In determining for the purpose of this section whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure. </P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that a number of matters I have mentioned, which are inherently taken into account, and should be taken into account in any sale of dwellings by tenants, would certainly be excluded under subsection (4).</P>
    <P>About 18 months ago an examination was made of cottages which were one time rural cottages.  An architect decided at the inspection&mdash;I happened to accompany some of my colleagues on the inspection at that time&mdash;that the cottages were in such bad condition that they would not warrant the spending of any money in repair work on them.  Yet, a few months ago, the members of the local authority had a recommendation put before them to provide a water and sewerage scheme for those same cottages.  They were requested to approve the expenditure on the scheme and the collection of money from the tenants of those cottages which, 18 months previously, an architect had stated were in such bad condition that he would not recommend spending any money on them.  Those cottages, if we leave the section as it stands, could well be described as being in good structural repair and sold to tenants on that basis.  Houses at present being built were the subject of comment in yesterday's newspapers and investigation is being sought into their condition.</P>
    <P>New houses could well be the subject of structural repair Dwellings were constructed in Milltown years <Col N="386" /> ago, under a proposed tenant-purchase scheme and I understand that, to this date, the bulk of the proposed tenant-purchasers have not been willing to accept purchase on that basis because of the condition of the houses.  Just consider the position of houses constructed 20 or 30 years ago with floors becoming affected with dry rot, and so on, but with sound walls.  As far as this section goes, and as far as the Minister has told us here today, such houses could be included on the basis that the local authorities could say: &ldquo;There is the house.  We propose to sell the house to you.  As far as we are concerned, we are satisfied it is in good structural repair.&rdquo;  Remember&mdash;and this is the aspect that has to be taken into account&mdash;that the decision as to whether in the local authority's point of view, it is in good structural repair, is not taken by the local representatives. It is taken by an official who reads &ldquo;goods structural repair&rdquo; and who may read this Bill, when enacted. I will give them all due credit: they are pretty expert with Acts affecting their duties.  In this Bill they read:</P>
    <P>In determining for the purpose of this section whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure. </P>
    <P>You know what could be done by any official who gets a section like that to deal with and who has to say whether the dwelling which they propose to sell is in good structural repair.  Measure the walls; make sure the foundations are secure.  He could then certify it was in good structural repair because that is what the section provides.  It does not say anything about the condition of the doors, whether they fit or whether it is possible for people to get in and out with ease.  Then there are the windows. A window could be absent.  The frame could be twisted.  However, the walls are still solid.  So it is covered there.</P>
    <P>There are aspects that do require consideration and do require, in our view, the Minister to feel an obligation to accept what has been said. <Col N="387" /> Nowadays, there is a general feeling that tenants of local authorities should be afforded, if they so desire, the opportunity of purchasing their dwellings. It would certainly be no benefit to tenants of local authorities to be asked to purchase a dwelling which consisted of a solid roof and four walls.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the question of minor matters that could be attended to.  Do we not all know that, by and large, as regards urban dwellings&mdash;anyway I have not much experience of the rural areas&mdash;the tenants have spent considerable sums of money over the years in decorating and improving their dwellings, those of them who are in any position to afford to meet that expenditure.  But that does not ensure that if a boiler or a chimney is defective it will be repaired by the local authority.  It is frequently urged, from time to time, that the tenant should be responsible for taking out that boiler, replacing it, doing the work inside, maybe having somebody to examine the chimney and making corrections in the chimneys. Yet that boiler or that fireplace could have been defective.  It could have been the cause of repeated complaints.</P>
    <P>If we consider the question of affording an opportunity to tenants to purchase their dwellings then section 102 provides quite a serious problem for them and, in connection with this matter, there appears to be no ground whatsoever for the retention of subsection (4) of section 102.  We would press very strongly indeed that the Minister accept the point of view put forward from these benches.  It is a reasonable point of view.  Certainly, we would ask the Minister to accept, in particular, the amendment calling for the absolute deletion of subsection (4) of section 102.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister talk about this again and to know whether in fact this section does apply to urban dwellings, as I understand it does.  Furthermore, it would be interesting to see whether he would indicate, on this particular section that the matters I have mentioned and others of like character <Col N="388" /> are dealt with under the term &ldquo;structural repair&rdquo;.  To my mind, the term &ldquo;structural repair&rdquo;, taken in conjunction with subsection (4), could mean that they are excluded and, again, a tenant could be asked to purchase something which would be nothing more than a shed.  If that is his intention, it is extraordinary to me and certainly there is at least one section of this Housing Bill which might as well be taken out of it altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing, I think, I should deal with is the last point Deputy Larkin mentioned, and he reiterated it several times, that tenants should not be asked to purchase. Tenants are not asked to purchase.  He would be a foolish tenant indeed who had a bad boiler or who had experience of some defect over a considerable time, while a tenant, who would opt to apply for purchase.  Remember that, all the time, nobody is asking them or telling them to purchase.  We are not compelling them to purchase.  The option is theirs.  Let us keep that clear in our minds, first.</P>
      <P>Take the case where defects have arisen, maybe a leaking bath, a broken range and so on, which were there either when the tenant took up occupation or developed since.  Why should the tenant put up with this situation? If the complaints Deputy Larkin outlines are not covered by the structural condition clause in this section, they would and should have been covered by the care and maintenance of the local authority in question.  The obvious course, and indeed the one that I know well is practised, is to seek to get these defects remedied at the earliest possible moment.  This may take time and very often does, but the remedy is there.  If people want assistance to get these things done, they go to their councillors, and it is up to the members of the local authority collectively to provide the money to do these things.  I have yet to know of a council engineer or other official who will refuse to do a reasonable job of repair or replacement on a house belonging to the council if the members are prepared to put up the money to do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> I am aware of many jobs that are crying out to be done for tenants and are not being done because the amount of money being provided for the entire work of this nature in any given local authority is far too small. I do not wish to bore the House with figures but there are some interesting figures I can give.  What county councils spend each year on vesting repairs, about £300,000, equals approximately all the money they receive from the purchase of cottages, and they have vested over 80 per cent of their cottages. It is not to be wondered at that the councils do not find themselves disposed to give any more than has been provided.</P>
    <P>Maintenance has been neglected. Houses have deteriorated over the years to a degree that should not have been allowed and for which we are now paying in a very solid manner.  We cannot allow this to continue.  Day-to-day maintenance, painting and the other odd jobs should be carried out so that a big job will not be necessary later on.  This is not merely the responsibility of the tenant but also of the county councils and the local housing authorities.  If they do not play their part, there is no point in asking the tenants to play their part.  Likewise, if the county councils play their part and the tenants do not play their part, then it is the tenants' loss.</P>
    <P>The distance I am inclined to go is reasonable in this connection.  As regards the basis on which appeals will be determined arising under this section, I am prepared to agree that repairs requiring to be done in pursuance of a vesting procedure will be such that in the normal way would not be within the competence of or be expected from the tenant.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asks: what about the aged widow living alone who is poor and who has no means?  The question I would ask there is: how do we know the aged widow at this stage of her life wants to purchase the cottage?  She has lived there for a long time and one would ask why should there be any inclination on her part to purchase now.  If she does want to purchase now, <Col N="390" /> there must be some advantage. Although she herself may be poor and unable to do any of these repairs herself or afford to pay for them, it may well be that in the background there is the expectant heir.  He may have a very keen interest in the vesting taking place and these little repairs will be no bother to that type of person.  The situation is not always as bleak as it might appear.  Nobody is forcing anybody to purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If she has a couple of bob extra and if it costs a couple of bob to buy the paint, she is no worse off when she has the cottage.  Seriously, let me say in regard to the housing estates under Deputy Larkin's jurisdiction&mdash;and they are vast&mdash;we are putting something in here that has never existed before.  There were no conditions laid down in regard to the sale of a house as to structural condition, sanitation or anything else.  I am now giving you a present of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a bit of elastic on it.  We have heard too much about the condemned houses in the past three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This condition in regard to the sale of houses is being imposed for the first time, that structural condition must be adverted to in making a sale.  That is not so at the moment.  A house can be sold by the Dublin housing authority without regard to structural condition.  They can sell is to any tenant foolish <Col N="391" /> enough to purchase it, but again tenants are not so foolish that they wish to purchase under those conditions. However, this is something we must keep in mind, and it is a matter for the tenant if he wishes to purchase.</P>
      <P>If a house has been neglected, if the paint is gone, the doors hanging off and the bath leaking, these are things that did not just happen yesterday. All I am saying is that between the tenant and the local authority, there has been neglect, and the elected members of the local authority must accept some of the blame for the neglect because they cannot find it in their hearts to provide sufficient money to maintain the houses in proper repair.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are tying to ensure that the Minister for Local Government will exercise some control as to proper maintenance in the future.  If we get proper maintenance, then only small things will arise at the time of vesting.  In other words, if the house has been properly maintained by the local authority and the tenant, then when a vesting application is made, the house, while it may require minor repairs, will not be in the bad condition in which many houses now seem to be.  These you might regard as the structural conditions of a cottage. Then you have the question of the sanitary condition.  If the rain is coming through a wall or through the roof, that would come within our jurisdiction with regard to the sanitary condition. It might come under the structural condition but it certainly would be a sanitary defect.  If a house, after the passage of years, finds itself in the middle of a swamp that would be a fundamental defect and such a premises could not be regarded as in good structural condition.</P>

      <P>I have already said that this section deals only with the <Col N="392" /> stability of a structure and that we are going to change it by saying that as far as we are concerned we will deal with all matters which cannot reasonably be expected to be done by the tenant.  We will do this by bringing these matters within the definition of &ldquo;structural condition&rdquo;.  That means that we have to change subsection (4) to bring into being what I have said I am prepared to do.  I want a reasonable position to arise, that we will do the jobs that are really necessary, that are really desirable, and that side by side with that, our cottages will be kept up to date.  No matter how I am to bring that about, I intend to do it. It has not been done up to the present.</P>

      <P>But look at the rich county you have.  We must do this job in the interests of all of us.  We will do what we can to give us the best return and when that is done, all the little things that have been an irritation to purchasers should not then arise to any great degree.  If these repairs are properly carried out by county councils and if the tenants look after the houses, these irritations to which I have referred should not arise again.  They should not arise if the houses are occupied and kept in good repair.  The thing to do is to make sure that the houses have sound walls, sound roofs and sound floors, to have the houses in such good condition that you can give them to the tenant in the full knowledge that they will last for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to remove some of the fears expressed by the House, we will change subsection (4) to read that <Col N="393" /> repairs required to be done to fit in with the structural condition, where such repairs could not reasonably be expected to be carried out by the tenant, will be done by the local authority.  This will meet the many complaints of the people who have talked against the section and will ensure that more care is taken by the tenant, on the one hand, and by the local authority, on the other.  The result will be that the money spent on the repair of houses will be well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy of the State and of the county councils to induce cottage tenants to purchase their own homes.  As Deputy Tully has said, many county managers have threatened to increase the rents of the cottages if tenants do not purchase their homes.  If they do purchase, it is better for the tenants.  They will take a greater interest in their own homes and look after them so that in the end it will also be better for the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  For that reason we should go further in our efforts to induce these people to purchase their own homes but, in my opinion, this section of the Bill will deter people from doing so.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he did not know of a reasonable engineer not doing a good job but he also said that the appeals of cottage tenants who were not satisfied with repairs carried out to their cottages comprise 75 to 80 per cent of the total number of appeals.  While some local authorities are anxious to spend money on repairing their cottages, there are others who are not so anxious.  In my constituency we have spent over £300,000 in the past ten years on cottage repairs and we have a lot yet to do.</P>
      <P>I feel that if this section remains in the Bill the number of houses purchased will tend to reduce because when a tenant asks for certain work to be done, the county council officials will point out that the Minister has stated in the Dáil that such work is only of a trivial nature and does not need to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also said that funds were available for the repair of cottages when people vest their houses. <Col N="394" /> We know from experience that some of those people, when they were told that they would get so much of a grant from the State and so much from the local authority, were not able to put up the balance of the money.  Many of them are not able to repair their cottages.  At present there is a departmental rule that tenants who wish to repair their cottages are not entitled to a grant until a certain period has elapsed.  I wonder if the Minister understands what is happening in rural Ireland, whether he knows the deplorable conditions of some of our cottages and the length of time it takes to have them repaired.  If this provision goes through, I am afraid it will add further to these difficulties.  Local councillors as well as Deputies have hundreds of representations made to them and this imposes a lot of work on all of us.</P>
    <P>On 25th August last I made representations on behalf of a man with a wife and two children, both under the age of three years, who had become a tenant only a year before.  He pointed out that the cottage was in a deplorable condition.  The floors, windows and doors were in a terrible state.  The plaster was falling off the ceilings and the walls.  Generally, the cottage was in a wretched state.  I told the man I would attend to it immediately and I did. Since then, not a single thing has been done, though I was told at the time that an engineer would inspect the house.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from that man on 19th of this month pointing out that he had not heard anything from the council. I went into the council offices and they completely ignored me, an elected representative.  If they treat me in that fashion, how do they treat the cottiers when they go in?  In his letter, the man says that the water covers the floors and the only middling room in the house is occupied by the two children, both of whom are down with influenza. The letter states that the bedrooms are wet, the paper is falling off the walls. He says he will be grateful if I can do anything at all to get the council to take action, and ends like this:</P>
    <P>I will have to give it up before any more of the bad weather comes.  It <Col N="395" /> would take anybody's life to live in it. </P>
    <P>This man was appointed a tenant less than a year ago and despite the fact that I made representations on his behalf, he is still living in that cottage. Would the Minister consider that that cottage is in sound structural condition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, if passed without the amendment, will effect a serious curtailment of the rights enjoyed by tenants of rural cottages in respect of vesting repairs.  Having heard the Minister's speeches in the past during debates on his Estimates, I regarded him as a defender of the rights of tenants.  I have heard him speak many times in a castigating manner concerning housing authorities who had, in his opinion, abandoned their responsibilities in respect of care and maintenance of their property.  He had some very hard things to say about local authorities, particularly in relation to their failure to maintain cottages or do proper jobs of repair.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it was all the more alarming to hear the Minister's audacity today defending a section in this Bill which merely prescribes that in future nothing other than structural repairs need be carried out to council cottages and that, for the purpose of determining the type of structural repairs, only two matters are likely to affect the stability and structure of a house.  We have already pointed out the kind of interpretation county managers and housing officers have been putting on that aspect of cottage repairs.  Under this provision, structural repairs only will be carried out.  It seems to me the Minister is seeking to rid himself and his Department of the embarrassing and humiliating aspects of things because he has been inundated with appeals against rotten repair jobs by the housing authority.  I can well imagine the voluminous correspondence burdening the Minister's Department on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also seeking to relieve the housing authorities of their obligation to carry out decent repairs. He has said that tenants do not have <Col N="396" /> to apply for purchase, that they were not asked to purchase cottages.  There is no obligation on people to purchase their houses, he says.  I submit that in the present situation that is not so. There is an element of compulsion involved in the vesting of cottages.  It has come about as a direct result of housing authorities giving priority in the matter of house repairs to those who have vested their cottages.  There is compulsion also in the threats of county managers to increase rents unless people opt to purchase.  We have a situation of which the Minister must be aware where, from the point of view of repairs, non-vested cottages are being treated as of no consequence whatsoever.  One must wait interminably for repairs to a non-vested cottage and having waited for years, must opt for purchase, in the clear knowledge that one will then get preferential treatment in the matter of repairs. Consequently, thousands of cottiers have become unwilling owners of cottages. They have been compelled to opt for purchase merely to get a decent repair job done.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister to have second thoughts on this aspect and realise, as some of us do who are members of local authorities, that the first decent repair job done on most of our council houses are vesting repairs. Many of these houses, built 30, 40, 60 years ago, were structurally defective from the very start &mdash; substandard houses.  Many of them were built at a figure of between £50 and £80.  That is a well-known fact.  Despite all this, a good many of them did not get repairs of any kind for a long number of years.  It was difficult then as now to get non-vesting repairs.  The only decent repair jobs done were vesting repairs and there was a safeguard contained there that if the tenants were dissatisfied, they had the right of appeal to the Minister.  Many of them did and the Department carried out investigations, and in 80 per cent of the cases upheld the appeals and recommended additional repairs.</P>
    <P>In the light of that appalling fact, why does the Minister seek in this section to give a virtual licence to housing authorities who are clearly <Col N="397" /> indicted, in the voluminous correspondence in the Minister's office, of dereliction of duty in regard to repairs? Why give local authorities additional licence in this Bill by placing an obligation on them to carry out only structural repairs?  In the past, tenants had had botched jobs done and now, if the Minister insists on structural repairs only, it means they can forget about repairs altogether.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the lot of what the Minister said on our amendment.  I am concerned about this section for many reasons.  Firstly, I am concerned about the rights of tenants to have decent repair jobs carried out.  Any diminution or compromise in that respect would clearly have a worsening effect out of all proportion on the scandalous treatment meted out to tenants in regard to repairs.  We have a scandalous history in that respect and I would not thank the Minister for introducing a new provision here, strengthening his hand and strengthening the hands of local authorities in ensuring that decent repairs are carried out.  He has been extremely hard on tenants and has cast reflections on them for not carrying out certain minor repairs. Basically, Irish cottiers are house-proud and will do all they can afford to improve their homes.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about footling repairs they expect done, maintenance of fences and gates and so on.  If a sod is knocked off a fence, the tenant expects the Minister or the local authority to replace it and expects them to paint the front gate and piers.  As a member of one housing authority, I am satisfied that repairs and maintenance of fences and gateways is a responsibility of the tenant from the time of appointment.  The local authority will not do certain things in respect of repair and maintenance.  There are two that I know of.  The Minister seems unaware of this&mdash;replacement of glass in windows and maintenance of the boundary fence.  These are the responsibility of the tenant and my local authority at any rate does not interest itself in these matters.  The Minister's imputation against tenants in that regard is quite unjustified.</P>
    <P>The elected members have come <Col N="398" /> under the Minister's fire also but I think local authority members have been in the forefront of those conscious of responsibility to maintain council property and they have sought on every occasion to secure adequate funds at estimates time to keep their cottages in decent repair.  It is extremely difficult at estimates time to get this done, when everybody is anxious to reduce the rates.  I have a vivid recollection of our county manager bringing in an estimate of some £32,000 for the repair of cottages in a particular financial year and that sum was reduced to something like £17,000, which was clearly inadequate. It is well known that one of the first things to be axed at estimates meetings in most county councils is the provision for cottage repairs.  Roads and cottage repairs will be attacked by people trying to make a worthwhile saving in the rates.  That is regettable and I have always been in the forefront of those seeking to retain essential money for cottage repairs, but on so many occasions these are cut to keep down the rates.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about this section because it would have a most discouraging effect on potential cottage owners in future.  We believe in diffusion of private property, that it is laudable, and one of our geat social aims is that every man or woman should own some portion of the country and it should be the ambition of all at least to own his own house. Surely it must be the desire of the Department to make this possible and entice people to become owners of their own homes?</P>
    <P>One of the first essentials is to satisfy the tenant that he will have a decent repair job carried out.  If it becomes known that merely structural repairs will be carried out, I can imagine a great falling off in interest among potential home owners.  It may well be, to judge from the aspersions the Minister has cast on cottiers, that the Department's policy is that they do not want people to purchase cottages any more.  If so, we should be told the facts, but we are now bringing in many thousands more urban dwellers for vesting purposes under this section.  I <Col N="399" /> am pleased to hear that.  The Minister will recall that I adverted to this matter on the occasions when I spoke on his Estimate and mentioned the anomaly that existed in the fact that county council tenants have the right to vest while no such right existed for tenants of corporation houses or urban dwellings.  For the first time, urban dwellers have the right to appeal to the Minister if aggrieved concerning repairs carried out.  That is only right but it is no reason why we should curtail or compromise the rights of tenants to have a decent repair job done.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the bad history of repairs, as evidenced by the high percentage of appeals upheld by the Minister, we should have a strong provision here rather than provisions which will further diminish tenants' rights.  I understand in regard to this right of appeal that for the first time a fee is being imposed upon the person vesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back to that.  In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied with the Minister's indication to us that he would be prepared merely to guarantee that repairs will be carried out under this section which could not reasonably be carried out by the tenants.  That is not good enough. I am concerned about the curtailment of rights tenants enjoyed in the past to get decent repairs done and concerned about the interpretation of this by county and city managers and those who are anxious to economise on the rates.  In my opinion, it will mean that so long as there are four sound walls and a reasonably good roof, nothing <Col N="400" /> else will be done.  I deplore the fact that the Minister has seen fit to put that into this Bill which was to be a new charter in respect of housing and rehousing.</P>
      <P>I suggest maintenance of our property is a first essential and the Minister should be in the forefront of the campaign to ensure that local authorities honour their obligations in respect of maintenance.  In this section that fundamental principle is being grossly violated, in my opinion, when you say it is no longer necessary to do decent repair jobs on council houses; it is sufficient to remedy structural defects. I know the interpretation placed on &ldquo;structural defects&rdquo; in the past.  It was completley unsatisfactory to the potential purchasers.  When they learned, to use the Minister's phrase, the kind of &ldquo;footling things&rdquo; the housing authority proposed to do as a final vesting repair, they rejected the purchase outright and did not proceed with the vesting.</P>

Further groups of houses will be handed over for occupation according as site organisation permits.  The construction of flats is scheduled to commence in January, 1966, reaching eighty flats a month in June.  As the construction programme is spread over a number of blocks, all flats erected cannot be occupied immediately on completion.  The timing of the first occupancy of flats is under examination with the contractors in the light of the general programme of site operations and I expect that this programme will allow for the occupation of as many flats as possible in the first half of 1966.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether his attention has been drawn <Col N="420" /> to the flooding and damage occasioned thereby to the houses and residences of the areas of Sandymount, Merrion Road, Anglesea Road and Clonskea, Dublin; whether, having regard to the fact that similar flooding occurred about two years ago in consequence of which the cause of such flooding ought to have been ascertained he will see that the residents are adequately compensated for the failure of whatever authority is responsible to take adequate steps to prevent the recurrence of the flooding; and whether it is true that the local authority is held up in taking steps to remedy the position by his failure to give his sanction to the remedial measures proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already requested the three local authorities concerned to submit as soon as possible, detailed reports on all the recent floodings in South Dublin and I have asked what it is proposed to do to minimise the effects of any similar occurrence in the future.  A preliminary report has been received from Dublin Corporation, in which it is stated that a fall of 6&rdquo; of rain was recorded in the Castlekelly and Bohernabreena areas resulting in the overflowing of the River Dodder at certain points, causing damage to property in the Clonskea, Anglesea Road, Ballsbridge and Sandymount areas.  The flooding in 1963 was of an entirely different origin, namely, the heavy overloading of the surface water drainage system in the area by an abnormally heavy rainfall concentrated in that area over a very short period.  It will therefore be evident that any remedial measures which might have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the 1963 flooding would not have been effective in preventing the river flooding of last week.</P>
      <P>Detailed design proposals for the Pembroke Main Drainage Scheme, which as well as providing improved sewerage facilities will also give greater protection from flooding in the Ballsbridge, Merrion and Sandymount areas, were received by my Department on the 22nd instant and examination of these proposals by my technical advisers is being undertaken.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary is <Col N="423" /> aware that, particularly in the Bray and Baltinglass areas of County Wicklow, a number of people have not only been badly affected in relation to the actual building&mdash;which would be covered possibly under reconstruction grants&mdash;but have suffered very grievous loss of furniture, household effects and other contents of that kind.</P>
      <P>I understood earlier today, from replies given by the Taoiseach, that the Parliamentary Secretary would deal with that situation when replying to this question.  I am concerned to find out if there is any fund whatever which the Government will make available, or create, for the purpose of compensating these people, to some extent at any rate, for the losses they have sustained. I do not want to make a speech but the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that it is only by reason of the tremendous efforts of the local authorities and charitable organisations in the Bray area that much great hardship has been avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to but I do not agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the Minister's reply.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question of 10th June last, the failure of the British authorities to pay increases of retirement pensions to persons living in this country has already been raised in connection with proposed reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain involving pensions following the introduction of the old age (contributory) pensions scheme here in 1961.  During discussions on these arrangements, my attitude to the restrictions on the payment of British pensions has repeatedly been made clear and every effort has been made to have the restrictions lifted.</P>

      <P>I hope they will come to a conclusion shortly.

    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> As I indicated on 10 November, 1965 (Vol. 218 No. 9, Col. 1537) the position about adaptation councils generally is reasonably satisfactory but their effectiveness has varied somewhat.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the establishment of adaptation councils and trade union advisory bodies stems from the recommendations contained in the Third Interim Report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  These envisaged that the adaptation councils would be organised and operated in a manner best suited to the circumstances of the particular industry.  The role of the trade union advisory bodies was seen as a consultative one.  I am aware that in some cases trade union advisory bodies have urged the need for greater consultation with their particular adaptation councils and I think that this is being achieved and will, I hope, be achieved in greater degree through the joint participation of councils and advisory bodies in the reviews of progress under the Second Programme at present taking place.</P>

      <P>All offences, and not just the first one, remain recorded permanently.  If, on the other hand, the Deputy is using the word &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;endorsed on the licence&rdquo;, the position is that the first offence is not endorsed at all but all subsequent offences are endorsed.  Endorsements, however, have a limited life and, moreover, are wiped out where there is a <i>bona fide</i> sale of the premises so that, contrary to what is sometimes suggested, they do not reduce the value of the premises.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals for the amendment of the licensing laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if a publican is convicted of a technical offence, and is fined 1/-, and that same publican retains the licence, say, for 20 years, the position is that, on a second conviction, there must be an endorsement, even after 20 years?  Would the Minister limit the period of the first conviction so that it will not be taken into account in recording a second conviction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say there was.  If a person is convicted of a technical offence for the first time and is fined 1/- and then runs, say, for 20 years, on a second offence, there must be an endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the need for that because the first endorsement has no practical effect at all.  No forfeiture follows on it.  The first endorsement itself lapses after two years.  I do not see the point of the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the mere fact of an endorsement reduces the value of a business premises.  I quite agree that it is wiped out on a <i>bona fide</i> sale. Furthermore, when that first endorsement is wiped out after two years and there is a second endorsement, it lasts for a period of four years and it takes four years to wipe out what, in actual fact is a first endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not follow the Deputy's reasoning. There is no endorsement on the first conviction.  On the second conviction, there is an endorsement which lapses after two years.  Then, if there is a third conviction, there is an endorsement for four years.  But the first endorsement following the second conviction has lapsed at this stage and is not taken into account.</P>

      <P>The certificate examination results in respect of school candidates are communicated to the managers of the schools concerned.  Results have not been issued for art in respect of ten Leaving Certificate candidates from one school or for history in respect of one Leaving Certificate candidate from another school.</P>
      <P>The reason in all cases is that the candidates' worked answer books were lost either in transit or subsequently. In accordance with the Rules for Secondary Schools, a second examination in these subjects is being provided for the candidates concerned. My Department will hold these examinations as soon as the school managers concerned are in a position to arrange suitable dates.</P>
      <P>Results will be furnished to the school manager within a very short time of the date of the examination in each case.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the inconvenience being caused to these pupils who took this examination? Some of the pupils concerned have left the country.  They are in jobs and are promising their employers <Col N="442" /> that their Leaving Certificate will be available any day.  Now they have to come back to this country to take this examination.  In view of the fact that this was something outside the control of the pupils concerned, is it not right and proper that these certificates should be given to the pupils concerned and that they be given the benefit of the doubt in this matter because they will be seriously penalised because of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of only one of the students concerned being abroad and that student has arranged to return for this special examination.  I doubt if the Deputy, on due consideration, would adhere to his suggestion that the certificate be awarded to the students without any knowledge of how they have done in the examination. While freely admitting that the matter was not their fault, nevertheless, it is not by any means certain that the fault was in the Department of Education.  In order to illustrate this, I would point out that there were 113,000 answer books submitted by Leaving Certificate candidates and 197,000 answer books submitted by Intermediate Certificate candidates, involving a large number of people. While every effort is made to ensure that nothing goes wrong, the human factor must be taken into account, and the small number of cases where this has happened in relation to the total number involved indicates that the measures taken are as effective as one could hope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, it is my policy, in the educational interests of the children concerned, that smaller schools should, wherever feasible, be discontinued, and provision made for the pupils in larger schools to which they would be brought by transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am having investigations made as to whether this policy can be suitably implemented in the parish of Inver, County Donegal.  The question of having a major scheme of improvements carried out at Keelogs national <Col N="449" /> school depends on the outcome of those investigations.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to have the matter brought to decision as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall he has made this answer to questions relative to schools in a very large number of areas in the country.  With reference to Keelogs school, I agree with the Minister's policy, but how long does he consider the inquiry involved in the parish of Inver will postpone urgent and necessary repairs to the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say in this case if it will have that effect, but I can say that in many cases the result of what we are doing is that children will be accommodated in new, or reasonably new, buildings very much faster than they would otherwise, if we were not carrying out this policy.  This arises because children may be carried by transport to a school which was built within the past few years within a few miles of their homes, whereas if we did not implement this policy, they would have to wait until a school was built in their own parish, which would take considerably longer.  This, of course, is not the case in all instances, but the investigation concerned normally would not take more than three or four months, that is, from the time it starts to the time the decision is made. Naturally the whole country could not be dealt with in three or four months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a school reaches a condition which constitutes a hazard to the children's health, the Minister can have them transported to a suitable school while this matter to which he has referred is under consideration, or, alternatively, he can decide to repair the school and put it into a condition in which it will not be a hazard to the children's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Where this is feasible, this is what we do.  There is another possibility, that is, where children are conveyed to an existing school to which an addition would have to be made.  In such a case we are making <Col N="450" /> every effort to have the construction completed as soon as possible but we will do temporary repairs in the meantime.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 66, line 41 to 46, to substitute &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo; for &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy James Tully). </P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand the Labour Party amendment to delete subsection (4).  We have learned this morning that up to the present time there has been no such provision in any housing legislation.  If the amendment is accepted, it will mean not progress but a reversion to something <Col N="473" /> that existed before the introduction of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We know that proper maintenance of housing is of great concern, particularly to members of local authorities who know of many examples of bad construction and subsequent bad maintenance.  In Dublin we have had houses built under tenant purchase schemes during the past 30 years. Some of them have fallen.  We feel that some effort must be made to ensure against this in the future.  The Minister has stated he is determined that proper maintenance of public housing will be pursued in a much stronger way after this Bill has been passed.  When one considers the great amount of money spent by Dublin Corporation on housing maintenance each year it makes the idea of purchase by tenant occupiers all the more insistent.</P>
      <P>If we had more tenant occupier purchase, there would be less trouble about maintenance because these new owners would then have a stake in the country and would take greater care of their houses than has been the case. The section states that regard must be had only to matters which affect the stability of the structure.  That is very wise because a defective door, if not repaired to keep out the elements, will affect the structure.  Under this section, the tenant occupier could seek to have even the smallest thing done for him. I do not mean the trivial things which any man worth his salt will do for himself. In recent times local authority members, myself included, perhaps, have looked to the local authority to have the smallest repairs carried out. We must try to make people realise that even if the property is only rented they, as members of the community, should ensure that the houses are preserved in a proper state of repair, thereby saving themselves and the community great expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree the Minister should look again at this section.  I am impressed by his statement that he will ensure in the future that there will be much better maintenance of public housing. The necessity for maintenance may arise from faulty building in the first instance.  Therefore, there is an onus on every local authority to ensure that <Col N="474" /> houses being built now will be erected in a proper way.  There is a belief that a house will last 80 years but at the present time, when there is such a tremendous demand for houses, we must attempt to preserve our existing stocks as well as building new houses.</P>
    <P>No member succeeded in justifying this amendment and I, for one, cannot support it.  The Minister said this morning that no tenant would buy a house which was not in a proper state of repair.  I agree; he would be very foolish to do so.  I feel, therefore, that when local authorities are introducing purchase schemes it will be in their interests to ensure that houses are in a proper state of repair.  Dublin Corporation spend almost £750,000 annually on house maintenance.  A lot of it could be saved if, in the first place, houses were properly built and, secondly, properly cared for afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we do not provide enough money for proper maintenance and I agree with him.  Each year, when the officials present their estimates for house maintenance, they do so in the background of proposed increases in rents.  Naturally, the members resist the rent increases and accordingly the expenditure figure is cut.  That is a very faulty way of facing this question because if we do not provide the money we cannot have proper maintenance. We have in Dublin now 45,000 local authority dwellings and in the not too distant future Dublin Corporation will be housing half the population of the city.  That is not a desirable feature of the economy and this Bill marks a great step forward.  I hope that as a result the housing situation will improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Moore, I see a great deal of merit in the amendment.  One does not wish to encourage, and I am sure the Labour Party do not, vexatious demands in respect of needling little repairs that people could do, even without skill, instead of idling but there are some substantial repairs which could arise in a house and yet not affect the stability of the structure.  That is what repairs in future will be confined to. I cannot see any surer way of excluding <Col N="475" /> substantial repairs than confining it to the stability of the structure.  I can see it being well argued that the replacement of worm-eaten floors is not something required by considerations of structural stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or window frames.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Window frames are an essential part of the skin of the house in this climate if stability of the structure is to be maintained.  I had to persist, by way of Parliamentary Question, on the question of a bedroom window frame for two years.  A number of members of Dublin County Council unsuccessfully pleaded and argued with Dublin Corporation on the question of replacing a window frame which had gone out of a county council bedroom three years after the house had been built.  Why did it come out? Because a county council worker had attended there and repainted the window and left the window lath off and a strong wind came along and took the whole window frame out of the wall.  We could not get the county council to accept responsibility. Their argument was that this was a window and the tenant's responsibility.  When we raised the matter in the House the Minister assisted the county council in sidestepping the issue.  The matter was then taken up in the public Press by way of criticism of a member of the House for raising such a tiny matter here. When the Press realised how this matter had been unsuccessfully argued for several years with both the county council and the Department they appreciated the necessity for raising the matter here, as it were, introducing the ombudsman into it.</P>
      <P>After all that had been done and all the various avenues of representation used, the unfortunate tenant, a widow with four children, who was unable to use that bedroom in the winter, had notice to quit served on her and then a notice warning her that she would be required to give up possession unless she repaired the window.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation would not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="476" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know; they might do worse.  This is the kind of thing that can happen and Dublin Corporation can be equally inhuman whenever the bureaucratic mind is applied.  The interpretation here would be compulsive on the bureaucrat that he could not consider a window frame in future because it did not affect the stability of the structure.  Whatever about the law beforehand which might have allowed Dublin Corporation or some other local authority to interpret the law in a humane way, it will not be open to any local authority to do it in future.</P>
      <P>To complete the story of the unfortunate lady, I am glad to say that before the argument finished the painters came around again in their usual five or six year cycle and found the window still out and it was put back into position.  But that poor lady and her children had to endure overcrowding in one bedroom every winter for five years because they had not the use of the other room because the window frame was not regarded as the responsibility of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with floorboards that require repairs and Deputy Dillon drew attention to window frames.  Other things could arise such as sanitary fittings, sinks or toilets if provided, and these could require replacement. Again, under the section as introduced the local authority could not apply itself or its revenue towards installing proper sinks or toilets or other sanitary amenities in a house before handing it over.  Likewise, the water supply might be grossly inadequate and there is nothing that the local authority would be empowered to do about it before handing over a house. Also, the house if wired for electricity, might require re-wiring but the local authority could do nothing about it because the Minister would say these things did not affect the stability of the structure.  That is why I think there is great deal of merit in the amendment which requires that these considerations should be taken into account in what is necessary for good structural repair and good sanitary condition of a property.  If the Minister wants to protect local authorities <Col N="477" /> from needling demands for minor repairs some better way can be found than confining these activities to the stability of the structure.  It is possible to frame a section which will allow more substantial repairs to be done without going down to the unnecessary form of decoration which I think the Minister and others would wish to have excluded.</P>
    <P>It is very important that houses are handed over in the best possible condition. It is reasonable to require people to maintain the house in the condition they receive it.  I know it is the practice, and I hope Dublin Corporation will be enabled by the continuance of the subsidy to introduce its own scheme, where you have tenant purchase schemes to impose conditions that the property must be kept in proper repair.  The standard of repair which has been understood for years to be reasonable is the standard in which the property is at the time of letting.  It is very important that the house should be handed over in good condition and the tenant in his own, as well as in the public interest, should be required to maintain it in that condition. It is undesirable that houses that are substandard in many respects so far as sanitation is concerned, so far as windows, door furniture, pointing and wiring are concerned, should be handed over in such condition.  If all these defects exist when the house is handed over it is very hard to require a tenant to spend large sums improving them.</P>
    <P>The Minister might perhaps clear up this point.  If a tenant is handed over a purchase house which is deficient in several respects and requires repairs which affect the house other than the structure, will he be able to obtain grants from the local authority and from the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I accept the Minister's word but he will be subject to pressure from the Department of Finance and other Departments and the local authorities not to do this.  I accept the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> but he will not always be Minister.  I am glad that he says this is the case but I do not think it entirely answers the question because even with the facility of grants and loans that may be made available the tenant will be required to pay a certain sum towards the cost of doing this work and that is where the rub comes so far as poor people are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no intention of travelling over the section on this amendment but I am concerned to see that people appealing against a decision of a local authority will be required to pay a fee at the time of making a complaint to the Minister that the local authority is not carrying out some necessary repair before vesting.  In other words, the people least able to pay for the repairs to the house are being coerced into paying a fee and because they are least able to pay the costs they will be least able to pay the fee.  We are certainly penalising the least fortunate members of the community.  I plead with the Minister either to accept the amendments or the spirit of them and <Col N="479" /> bring in a better amendment and a better section before the next stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated in regard to subsection (4) of section 102 that I intend to do something in response to the various views expressed here to change the subsection so that in future repairs other than those which can be reasonably expected to be carried out by the tenant would come within the framework of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's assurance that he will examine the subsection with a view to meeting the points raised in this House.  It is imperative that changes be made. While not doubting the Minister's sincerity, Ministers change from time to time.  One of the problems in this matter, and also in connection with amendment No. 118, is that the initial decision is one for the local authority. But it cannot be made by the elected members; it is made by the city and county managers.  The decision in regard to the repairs necessary to bring a building into good condition, therefore, can vary from area to area, and even within a particular local authority area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was a bit optimistic when he said the effect of section 102 would be so to improve the repairs of existing local authority houses that in a short time it would only be a question of keeping up an adequate standard of maintenance.  Dublin Corporation has 40,000 houses.  For many years they have been maintained at an absolutely minimum level.  The repairs have mainly consisted of a regular schedule of what is called maintenance painting, <Col N="480" /> which includes the necessary repairs to exterior woodwork in preparation for painting and the renewal of defective boilers and so on purchased during periods when the materials were somewhat substandard.  But there has been no inspection of those 40,000 dwellings to see whether they are in proper order inside.  Inspection only takes place when there is a complaint.  In many cases the complaint has to be made again and again and is only finally dealt with when somebody like Deputy Moore, Deputy Ryan or myself brings the matter up possibly at the highest level of the local authority.  I would estimate, having regard to rising costs, that at the present level of expenditure and, even if that were greatly increased, it would be a long time before these dwellings could be put into the condition where they would only require regular maintenance.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of problem the Labour Party amendments are designed to deal with.  I was astonished to hear Deputy Moore say there was no merit in them.  I am sure he has been active on behalf of his constituents drawing the attention of the local authority to the inadequate maintenance of their dwellings and the faults that have been appearing over the years.  He referred to buildings constructed within the last ten years which were showing serious defects.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that nobody was asking tenants to purchase their houses. That may be so at present.  But, having regard to the contents of other sections of this Bill and to what is happening as a result of proposals of city and county managers, it is clear there is an insidious form of inducement to tenants to purchase their houses.  In other sections of the Bill there is a clear indication that if the local authorities &mdash;and by that is meant the city and county managers&mdash;do not increase the rents on local authority dwellings, serious consideration will be given to reducing the amount of subsidy given to such local authorities.  If the managers get away with carrying out what the Bill says in this regard, it will mean they will attempt to increase substantially new rents, and they are not <Col N="481" /> unknown to try to deal with the existing rents as well.</P>
    <P>There is repeated stress on the desirability of people owning their own houses.  Therefore, it is hardly right to say that tenants are not being asked to purchase their dwellings.  The local authority of which I am a member has gone on record in favour of tenant purchase schemes.  Up to the present the view of the manager has been that the time is not opportune because of the need for help.  In the early 1950's a tenant purchase scheme was designed.  The houses were erected between 1952 and 1954, approximately 600 in all.  Preference was given as to 90 per cent to existing corporation tenants.  The tenants were selected. There was a deposit of £50.  The scheme was financially attractive but for more than three years there were continuous complaints with regard to the faulty construction of the dwellings. Because of administrative delay no tenant purchase agreements were available and consequently the tenants were in the happy position of being in residence over such a period that the maintenance period had run out and they were able to hold the local authority responsible.  Had they signed agreements they would have been liable themselves to make good the defects, many of them structural defects, which appeared in these houses a couple of years after they were built.</P>
    <P>That is the type of problem we have raised by way of amendment No. 118. When one talks of a house one does not have in mind four bare walls and a roof.  What about defective piping? Sinks and sanitary facilities are an important part of any house construction. The Minister referred to provisions relating to repairs normally carried out by the local authority.  His views would be quite all right if they were translated into making an alteration in subsection (4) to meet the particular problem because, if subsection (4) is not altered materially, we shall have no option but to insist on contesting it. The person who would interpret subsection (4) in its present form would be an official of the local authority.  I have the highest regard for most <Col N="482" /> officials with whom I come in contact but, at the same time, officials are there to carry out the instructions not of the local authority but of the manager. They may be given a specific direction as to how to interpret that section and I doubt very much that you will find any official who will refuse to act in accordance with such a direction.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared not only to re-examine this matter but to make some alterations in the subsection to meet the points put forward by the Labour Party then we could, I think, go along with him.  I would urge on him, however, to insert the words &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo;.  Structural condition alone refers to the basic structure and not to essential facilities.  Deputy Ryan referred to an exterior window.  What about an interior door which has warped?  Is the tenant to employ a carpenter to take out the door frame? That door could well need expert attention.  If maintenance were left solely to the local authority in Dublin we would be in a very bad way indeed. Tenants who can afford it do quite an amount of maintenance on their own homes, apart altogether from decoration.  Many of them make improvements and sometimes, when they make improvements, they are censured. But that should not be taken into account to the disadvantage of tenants generally as and when a tenant purchase scheme is proposed.  Surely it is a good thing to encourage tenants to purchase and, if it is good, surely it is only right and fair to deal properly with the matter and provide conditions which will ensure that the local authority will sell the prospective tenant a fit dwelling.</P>
    <P>The Minister says local authorities are getting new powers here.  I will not thank the Minister for that.  This is a housing Bill designed to correct errors in previous housing legislation.  Naturally, the first provision should be that houses which local authorities are selling to tenant purchasers should be put in proper structural and sanitary condition.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary will get up here and say that he does not think the <Col N="483" /> local authority should even contemplate selling to tenants dwellings which are not in proper sanitary condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am querying whether a responsible Parliamentary Secretary will get up here and say publicly that it is his view that no local authority should consider for one minute selling to tenants dwellings that are not structurally sound and in proper sanitary condition.  A Minister of any Government who would state in the House that that is to some extent what is implied in the section as it stands is certainly doing no service.  It is no offence to suggest that a local authority who introduce a tenant purchase scheme will sell them on the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i>&mdash;let the buyer beware.  Is it the suggestion that local authorities, charged with the responsibility of providing dwellings for the people should operate, when it comes to the point of selling houses on a tenant purchase basis, on the principle of letting the buyer beware? That is too often the approach of other people who build houses or sell houses. There are many thousands of people today who know that they take a chance in buying a house and if they find that it is defective, that is just too bad for them.  Surely local authorities or, rather, managers, should not subscribe to the view that they should operate on that basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals, not with the views of Deputy Moore, Deputy Dowling, Deputy Ryan or Deputy Larkin.  Under this section the responsibility will fall on city managers and whether we like individual city managers and respect them for their ability and conscientiousness or not, to put in a section saying that if they introduce a tenant purchase scheme it will be sufficient that the dwelling be in <Col N="484" /> good structural condition is to leave it open to them to interpret that on the basis that the dwelling can in fact physically stand up.  That is what it means.  No interpretation given afterwards can correct that.  As Deputy Tully says, there are round towers in existence which are structurally very sound.  Keogh Square is structurally sound also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would arise out of what Deputy Larkin said.  Not alone in Dublin, but in Cork, there are long delays in connection with the maintenance of houses and, if I may say so at this stage, the section generally will delay for a great length of time the vesting or selling or leasing of houses. If we are to wait for bodies like Dublin Corporation or Cork Corporation to put a large number of houses into a condition which could be described as structurally sound, the people will wait for years, because Cork Corporation at the moment cannot put the unfit houses that they have into a fit condition. They have not the staff.  I cannot see any local authority gearing itself to put a large number of houses into structurally sound condition in a short time.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in connection with the selling or leasing of houses the consideration might be reduced if the tenant undertook to put the house into proper structural condition.  Otherwise, the tenant will be waiting for years before he can purchase or lease the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin takes exception to the selling of a house on the basis of <i>caveat emptor.</i>  This principle is borne in mind by persons purchasing houses and before tenants accept a vesting order in respect of a cottage they certainly see to it that the house is in reasonable repair.  Otherwise, they do not have to accept it.</P>
      <P>As I see the section, the words &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo; mean just that.  By implication, it would mean good sanitary, hygienic condition. The addition of superfluous words does not help.  I go along with Deputy Larkin to the extent that we do not want to sell shacks, as it were, to tenants.  We must bear in mind the amount being paid for these houses and the financial interest of the tenants in the houses and that they can dispose of them and realise a considerable amount of money.  At this time the tenants do not have great regard as to where the money to build them came from.  They will tell you that they have been paying rent for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> In my view the amendment would be superfluous.  The words &ldquo;in good structural condition&rdquo; can be deemed to cover all that is necessary.  Otherwise, one might as well itemise every part of a house and add a specification.</P>
    <P>There were many types of cottages built.  Some with bathrooms, some without bathrooms, some having drainage and plumbing, some without drainage or plumbing, some with the old type privy at the back of the house. To write into this Bill that the house must be in good sanitary condition would impose an obligation on the local authority that should not be imposed and that was never intended.</P>
    <P>Regard must be had to the age of the house and the rent charged.  The rent charged for houses varies considerably. I cannot see why the Labour Party need the amendment when there is an all-embracing clause in the Bill in the words &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;. In my view the amendment is not necessary.</P>
    <P>That clause is reinforced in subsection (4) which states that the condition must be such as will not affect the stability of the structure.  That should satisfy the Labour Party. Regard must be had to the taxpayer and the ratepayer and to the bargain involved.  I have seen some very good bargains down in my own county of houses that were vested and are now being sold for £1,000.  I often wonder where is the justice in that.  A person who was only a tenant of a cottage paying something like 3/6d a week has had it vested in him and sells it for something like £1,000.  Who is calling the tune?  If we further spell out everything that ought to be done to that cottage, including a complete reconditioning job, the position will be that those people would get a lot more than £1,000.  These are the general conditions and I can appreciate fully what Deputy Larkin has said, which probably is a particular problem here in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>But we are legislating for the whole country.  We are also legislating for the people who have to pay the bill and we must have regard to them also.  I know we will pass the bill on to the public <Col N="487" /> later.  Dublin Corporation must have a tremendous bill and problem in the maintenance of their existing houses. I think it amounts to something like £500,000 a year, which is voted from rates in the city of Dublin.  If we are to spend £3 million, £4 million or £5 million on modernising these houses&mdash; and this is what this would imply&mdash; some of the houses might even have bathrooms.  It might even be said that a bathroom is necessary or, indeed, where there is no drainage at the moment, this might also imply that drainage would have to be put in where it never existed, was never charged or was part of the rates.</P>
    <P>At some stage in a vested cottage there should be an obligation on the tenant to keep it in good order and repair and, indeed, in all sections of this Housing Bill, there is ample opportunity for a tenant to improve and recondition his house if the landlord will not do it.  The duty of the housing authority to put cottages in good structural condition is adequately covered in section 102.  If we were to go beyond that we might as well say it should be papered, distempered and a whole lot of other things.  I think that the words &ldquo;structural condition&rdquo; cover the intention and meaning here where the drainage is in a sanitary condition and is safe and sound.  If we go beyond that, tenants in cottages two years after vesting, could come back and say: &ldquo;The range is not working&rdquo; or &ldquo;the chimney is giving trouble&rdquo; or &ldquo;the front door fell out&rdquo;.  I have come across all these problems and it strikes me as very remarkable that those people took over the houses at the time without complaint.  I know that any cases of appeal to the Minister have been upheld and the local authorities have gone back and put right any of those defects at the time of vesting.  I think the words &ldquo;structural condition&rdquo; will cover the whole lot without extending it to every facet and one might as well write a specification as put in &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>The trouble about any Bill in this House is that, if one is to understand it, one has to remain <Col N="488" /> with it from start to finish.  I notice the tendency has been for certain Deputies to pick out a section, not hear the arguments, and to hold forth and elaborate on what they consider is covered by that section or what that section is meant to do.  This can often give a very confusing impression to people who are not aware of what is intended by the whole Bill.  The Minister for Local Government, earlier on, went to great pains to explain that, not alone was he altering certain aspects of the vesting of local authority houses, but he would ensure if anybody had a local authority house and wanted to sell it for commercial purposes, that the local authority could take the necessary steps to recover whatever was considered to be the market value of that house.  That, having been explained to us, it is quite obvious that the arguments made by one or two of the speakers here this afternoon were completely wide of the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>You can sell to a qualified tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When that qualified tenant is a person who would be eligible for a local authority house in any case and would be entitled to have one in good repair.  Do not let us get confused about this.  There is a grave danger, if we do not follow the debate right from the start, we could see something in the section which might appear to be the answer to everything and could be quite the opposite. Deputy Gallagher has been most impressed by subsection (4) of section 102, which is the one we suggest should be deleted.  I shall read it just in case anybody has the wrong idea.  It says:</P>
      <P>In determining for the purpose of this section whether or not a cottage or dwelling is in good structural condition regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure. </P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Larkin when he was speaking, that could apply to a round tower.  Nobody could say it was not structurally sound but, apart from that, is it not absolutely useless as a dwelling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> Furthermore, I believe, when the Minister has given us a guarantee, he intends to alter very considerably the contents of subsection (4) in order to meet most of the arguments we have put up.  But that is of very little use unless he also takes into account our amendment No. 118 which says:</P>
    <P>In page 66, line 41 to 46, to substitute &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition&rdquo; for &ldquo;good structural condition&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>because, there again, the same thing applies.  We might as well face up to it. If we are not prepared to do that we may accept those particular sections of this Bill which refer to the vesting and repair of county council cottages, particularly, as being put in deliberately by the Minister and his Government for the purpose of preventing necessary repairs being carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister held forth for quite some time about the necessity for local authorities to ensure that their property is kept in good repair and that they should spend a certain amount of money on that property to ensure that it did not deteriorate.  I am all with the Minister there.  One of the biggest faults of local authorities is that they allow houses to fall into bad repair and, when they have to effect the necessary repairs, the cost is far more than it should be.  When we go down the country, we find houses which were built in 1884.  Will somebody tell me how much money has been spent on repairing houses which were built then, and is it not true that practically no repairs were carried out to county council cottages until about 1936?  From then on, the bill started to grow and grow and the county council in my own area, I am sure, have spent about £250,000 in repairing county council cottages since 1936&mdash; and we have 5,000 such cottages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Then your bill must be higher than that if you were as conscientious as we were.  We have been carrying out the repairs as far as we can over the years but we were not catching up on them and the trouble now is that the houses we are repairing <Col N="490" /> are only pre-vesting ones or after vesting appeals.  This has resulted in the situation that houses which could possibly be repaired for a relatively small sum of money cannot now be repaired for a number of years.  When they are repaired, they will cost a lot more.  Last month a county engineer or somebody else gave me an average figure of £140 per house for repairs, that is, taking the good with the bad&mdash;a fair average over all the country.  I grant that those houses are houses which will be sold over a ten year period for £10.  It is quite possible that the return on those houses to the council would be even less than that when the high cost of collecting is taken into account.</P>
      <P>I consider that an effort is being made under this Bill to defeat completely the object of the 1936 Act. Apparently, it is now accepted that our predecessors, when the 1936 Act was introduced, did something which was not right, that they gave too much to the tenants and that we must make an effort in 1965 to take some of that from them, or at least from their successors. That attitude of mind does no credit to any Party in this House and I am very glad to say that, so far, we seem to have been discussing this Bill on a non-Party basis.  That is the way it has been discussed so far but it appears that certain sections are trying to put it across, again and again, that those fellows are getting something for nothing and that it is our job to see they do not get it.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party are not prepared to go along that line.  Deputy Gallagher says the Labour Party want to give everything away to everybody and pass no remarks about where it comes from.  If that is his assessment, and he is perfectly entitled to make that assessment, I want to say, on behalf of the Labour Party, that we are simply trying to safeguard the rights given to tenants of county council cottages and local authority houses in 1936 and that we will do everything we possibly can to prevent those rights being taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer again to the Minister's suggestion about the amount of money to be spent on repairs and how it could be done.  I want to say that it <Col N="491" /> should not be forgotten that the position is not improving and that, as I said, not alone are we not catching up but we applied to borrow money to carry out repairs.  We did not get it from the banks, we got it from an insurance company, the Public Bodies Mutual.  We got £20,000 but we actually required £30,000.  We could be told that we need not worry about this at all and that it is only the cranks who worry about it.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this is subsection (4), which we suggest should be deleted. The Minister says he will meet us to a certain extent.  I shall be interested to see how far.  I want to say that, unless our amendment No. 118 is also taken into account, that is, the amendment to subsection (2), we are still in trouble over repairs to vested cottages.  There are many problems which arise.  The Minister said, with regard to an old person living in a house, when repairs were being carried out, that the local authority would see to it that the necessary repairs were carried out.  He proposed that in substitution for subsection (4).  I do not consider that meets the point because it creates a certain situation.  As Deputy Larkin says, when we talk about local authorities and housing managers, we talk of county managers and, if the county manager says: &ldquo;The law says if there are four walls and a roof, the house is OK&rdquo;, then no repairs will be carried out.  That may be a slick way of getting out of responsibility and of deciding, as far as council tenants are concerned, that they do not count any longer.  If they do not keep their houses in repair or if the house they have been appointed to is not in good repair when they get it&mdash;this is very often what happens&mdash;it is their fault and not that of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The onus should be on the local authority to put a house in good repair and in good sanitary condition. There is no use in saying that if the tenants over the years had carried out the necessary repairs, the house would have been all right and this would not have arisen.  We would be anxious to know the Minister's views on our <Col N="492" /> amendment No. 118.  While we are prepared, reluctantly, to agree not to move amendment No. 119, on the Minister giving a guarantee that he will rephrase subsection (4), we feel, that, unless he also rephrases subsection (2), he will not be doing any good or, at least, will not be doing much good.</P>
    <P>Let me finish on this.  It does not matter what the Minister does if he includes the reference in subsection (4) that &ldquo;regard shall be had only to matters which directly affect or are likely to so affect the stability of its structure&rdquo;.  If he insists on including that phraseology, then we will, of necessity, have to oppose the section when it comes up for consideration again.  We have gone a long way with the Minister on this Bill and we have gone to great trouble and I think the Minister will agree that we did so in order to ensure that sections of this Bill were clarified so that we knew exactly what was in the Minister's mind and in the Government's mind, but when we find that even in this House this evening half a dozen different persons interpreted the subsection in half a dozen different ways, it is obvious the matter needs further attention.</P>

      <P>The only object I have in speaking on this section is to make sure that what Deputy Tully said in his closing remarks will not happen, that there will be no misinterpretation of what is meant in the section and that any tenant who takes over a house, or any tenant in a vested cottage, will be assured that that house is in proper repair, whether it be termed &ldquo;good structural repair&rdquo;, or &ldquo;good structural repair and sanitary condition.&rdquo;  I have experience of seeing a county council cottage taken over in Mayo.  The house looked sound and to be in good structural condition.  The people who went into it looked at it from the outside and decided that it was a fit house. They were shown it and asked to go in. They went in, and when they were there a couple of days, they found that all the pipes were corroded, that the toilet did not work, that the entire hot water system did not work, that the windows were corroded and letting in <Col N="493" /> the rain and wind, and that some of the doors were so swollen that they would not open and others so shrunk that the wind was howling through them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in order to protect people against that type of situation that I would go along with the Labour Party amendment.  This Bill is supposed to be the be-all and end-all of housing legislation, a Bill which will not require amendment for many long years to come.  In view of the long time it has taken the Dáil to consider all the <Col N="494" /> sections up to this, I feel the Minister should leave no danger of misinterpretation of any section.  We know that in the past, because of the impact of the rates, local authorities did not carry out sufficient repairs to the houses they had.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 30th November, 1965.</P>

      <P>Following is the revised table taking account of (a) the £400,000 provided in the Budget in respect of the quality bonus of a penny a gallon for creamery milk and (b) the adjustments in the capital items announced in the White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure.</P>
      <P>There will be a substantial Supplementary Estimate in the current financial year for dairy produce and bacon subsidies.  It is not possible as yet to give a figure for the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P> (a)  &ldquo;Sick pay&rdquo; as used in the above statement means generally the amount required to bring Social Welfare Benefit up to the employees' normal weekly rate of wages.</P>
    <P>(b) The schemes generally apply to pensionable servants.</P>
    <P>(c) Sick pay is not allowed for the first three days' illness, unless, generally, the period of illness is longer than a fortnight.</P>
    <P>(d)  The sick pay period is allowed in a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>(e)  Roscommon County Council has decided to adopt a sick pay scheme on the 1st January, 1966, which will allow: 4 weeks at sick pay; 6 weeks at half sick pay.  The following authorities are considering adopting the same scheme: Offaly County Council, Laoighis-Offaly and Sligo-Leitrim Mental Health Boards.  Waterford Health Authority and Donegal and Laoighis County Councils are considering the introduction of this scheme in place of their existing schemes. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount collected by each health authority for a recent year, and the total for the State, in respect of (a) charges collected under section 15 of the Health Act, <Col N="470" /> 1953, and (b) similar charges collected under the Mental Treatment Acts in the form of a reply of 19th July 1962.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley) Donogh O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply, which is based on information supplied by the local authorities, is as follows:</P>
      <P>AMOUNTS collected in the year ended 31st March, 1965, in respect of charges for institutional services under section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, as amended and corresponding charges under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended.</P>
      <P>NOTE: In interpreting the figures, it is important to bear in mind that the percentages shown are the percentages of the total amount collected which was represented by payments at the maximum permitted rate of 10/- a day.  They have no relationship to the number of patients in the middle income group who were not required to meet any charge (persons in the lower income group are automatically relieved from paying any charge) or who were charged at rates less than 10/- a day.  Thus if, in a particular area, 100 people in the middle income group were concerned and of these, no charge were made in respect of 20, a charge of 5/- a day were made in respect of 60 and the maximum charge were made in respect of the remaining 20, although 80% of the people concerned, all middle income group, were afforded treatment at a rate less than 10/ a day, the percentage receipt from the patients paying the maximum rate would be 40%.</P>

I understand that alternative arrangements could be made but that it would require some disregard of regulations to provide it. Perhaps the Taoiseach could do something about it?</P>
